But for years prior, I was already deeply involved with the company. I co-created NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) in 2006, a screen reader for blind and vision impaired people like me. We wanted to make Firefox and NVDA work as well as they could together to provide everyone the best possible access to the web.\u00a0\nWith NVDA, I helped change the world for a lot of people through a free and open-source screen reader. Now at Mozilla, I get to do the work from the browser side of things \u2013 making sure Firefox continues to work efficiently alongside assistive technology as the internet evolves constantly and rapidly.\u00a0\nThis International Day of Persons with Disabilities, I want to take a moment to share how we\u2019re working to make Firefox not just accessible. We want to make sure the browser is also delightful, efficient and easy to use for everyone, including the more than 1 billion people around the world who live with disabilities.\u00a0\nText recognition in macOS\nWith the rise of social media, internet users are estimated to share about 3.2 billion images daily. The new Firefox release lets macOS users copy text from images they see on the browser. That could be a data graphic, an event flier or even a meme. Just right-click on the image and select \u201cCopy Text from Image.\u201d\u00a0\nTo use text recognition on Firefox, right-click on any image with text and select \u201cCopy Text From Image.\u201d\nThis feature has clear uses for everyone. But it\u2019s especially helpful for people across all kinds of disability spectrums. Text recognition on Firefox is compatible with VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader for macOS. A person with low vision who can\u2019t read small text in an image can also use the feature to extract the copy and enlarge it on a text document so that it\u2019s easier to read.\u00a0\nOne of the joys of inclusive design is creating products that a lot of people can use but can be especially beneficial for some. Text recognition is part of our effort to make accessibility and inclusion an even bigger part of our process across Mozilla. The Firefox desktop platform and front-end teams got us involved early on so that when the feature shipped, it\u2019s immediately accessible and delightfully so, rather than just ticking the required boxes.\nCurrently, our teams are working on making text recognition available to even more users.\u00a0\nMaking the web faster for screen readers\u00a0\nUsing a screen reader is like looking at\u00a0 the screen through a straw. You\u2019re constantly moving the straw around to see different bits of the screen, one little thing at a time.\u00a0\nFirefox has been great with screen readers, but it\u2019s not as fast as it could be. That\u2019s why in 2021, the accessibility team embarked on a major redesign of Firefox\u2019s accessibility engine, which provides screen readers and other assistive technologies the data they need to announce web content.\u00a0\nWith this project, which we call Cache the World, we\u2019re increasing the speed at which documents and pages load and update, making it dramatically faster on some pages. Even tiny speed improvements can make a big difference to people when you multiply that time over the course of a day. That\u2019s what we mean when we talk about something being delightful to use. It\u2019s not enough for us to have features that are just accessible. It also shouldn\u2019t take a lot of time and effort to use them.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re hoping to make this improvement available to everyone soon. You can follow the latest updates on the Mozilla Accessibility blog.\u00a0\nI\u2019ve been totally blind since birth, so working on accessibility is very personal for me. But it\u2019s also a space where I can have a direct impact on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0\nWe make changes and we fix things in the browser, and we have users saying, \u201cWow, that seriously improved my daily life.\u201d That\u2019s what drives me and why I feel so passionate about our work.\u00a0 Everyone has something to contribute to society. When we empower people with the right tools to achieve their maximum potential, they can improve not only their own lives, but the entire world.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Post\n\n          Pulse joins the Mozilla family to help develop a new approach to machine learning        \n\n\n\n\nNext Post\n\n          Over a decade of anti-tracking work at Mozilla        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI\n\nMisinformation in the age of AI: It\u2019s in the details (like extra fingers)\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nInternet Policy\n\nMozilla\u2019s response to proposed remedies in U.S. v.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.  While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, NVIDIA's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Price Based on Past Earnings December 23rd 2022   Keen to find out how analysts think NVIDIA's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start. Does Growth Match The High P/E? In order to justify its P/E ratio, NVIDIA would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market. Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 28%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 144% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.  Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 17% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive. With this information, we can see why NVIDIA is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock. What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's P/E? Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. We've established that NVIDIA maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances. You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for NVIDIA  you should be aware of.   Story Continues You might be able to find a better investment than NVIDIA.

For context, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite returned 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, last month. The latter index is the better benchmark for Nvidia because it has a heavier concentration of technology stocks.\nNvidia stock's strong performance last month is largely attributable to market dynamics. Investors bid up stocks in general and growth stocks in particular, following U.S. inflation data for October coming in better than widely expected.\n\nSo what\nOn Nov. 10, Nvidia stock jumped 14.3% following the Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing October Consumer Price Index (CPI) data that showed inflation is cooling off.\u00a0The October CPI, which measures consumer prices for a broad basket of goods and services, rose 0.4% from the prior month and 7.7% from the same month a year ago.\nThese numbers show inflation remains high, but they were better than the increases of 0.6% and 7.9%, respectively, that economists had expected. Moreover, they show a slight moderation of inflation from September, when the CPI rose 8.2% from the year-ago period.\nInvestors took the October CPI data as a sign that the Federal Reserve could soon begin to ease up on its large interest rate increases aimed at lowering inflation. High interest rates tend to suppress stock prices, and many investors are concerned that the Fed's monetary tightening policy is too aggressive and could throw the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia shares continued to move upward through the remainder of the month, posting a 22.8% gain from Nov. 10.\u00a0Last month, Nvidia released its third-quarter report for fiscal 2023, but this event had little effect on its stock price. Shares edged down 1.5% on Nov. 17 following the release on the prior afternoon.\nIn Q3, Nvidia's revenue declined 17% year over year to $5.93 billion, which beat the Wall Street consensus estimate of $5.77 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings per share (EPS) dropped 50% to $0.58. That result fell short of the $0.69 analysts had been expecting.\nAs I wrote in my earnings article, \"Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, most investors were probably satisfied with the report.\"\nNow what\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (i.e., November 2022 to January 2023), management guided for revenue to decline 21% year over year to $6 billion. It also guided (albeit indirectly by providing a bunch of inputs) for adjusted EPS to drop 41% to $0.78.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock is one of the best tech stocks for long-term investors, in my view. The company is a leader in many fast-growing spaces, including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, computer gaming, and autonomous vehicles.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).  Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 10.7% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA   Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA   Check price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.  In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.   Story Continues Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in NVDA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 8.6% over the past month to $3.27.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia.

While other sectors that consistently outperformed in previous years are deepest in the sea of red as we head into 2023.The SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund (ETF), SPY, is facing its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008, which saw a drop of nearly 37%. Contextually, SPY\u2019s 17.4% drop this year sounds far less drastic. A deeper dive shows where the losses are concentrated within the index, specifically with four sectors down more than 20% each.Below is a look at the worst performing sectors of the year and their outlook for the next 12 months.4 Worst Stock Market Sectors of 2022*1. Technology (XLK)Technology (XLK) Top 5 HoldingsCompanySymbol% of ETF2022 ReturnApple IncAAPL21.5%-27.7%Microsoft CorpMSFT20.4%-29.5%NVIDIA CorpNVDA5.0%-48.9%VISA IncV4.0%-7.7%PaypalPYPL3.4%-65.5%After being a dominant force for multiple years, the technology sector now faces a 25% loss as 2022 ends. XLK, the SPDR Technology Sector ETF, contains the two largest components of the overall index, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) comprising over 41% of the ETF. XLK itself represents over 25% of the S&P 500, thanks the holdings in AAPL and MSFT. The losses in these two stocks represent a sizeable amount of the negative performance for the overall index.Any rebound in the technology sector for 2023 will largely be driven by the performance of AAPL and MSFT. It seems like ancient history when AAPL hit its all-time high of $182.94, but that occurred on the second trading day of this year, January 4th.Though analysts remain optimistic AAPL will find that price level again, current averages for bullish analyst sentiment point to the stock rebounding above $180 in the future. Pricing for Call options for AAPL indicate around a 16% chance of AAPL being above $180 by the end of 2023, using the January 2024 options and % In-the-money (ITM) metric on the tastytrade mobile app.MSFT reached its all-time high of $349.67 in November of 2021. With the stock currently trading near $235, analysts are less optimistic MSFT will find the $350 any time soon, though Wall Street analysts do see a rebound possible for the tech-giant with a current bullish price target average above $300. The options indicate a roughly 20% chance of MSFT being above $300 by the end of 2023.While the overall technology sector will largely move with the movements in AAPL and MSFT, there remains another 60% of XLK\u2019s portfolio allocated across 74 other equities. XLK opened the year at $174.10, not far off its $177.04 all-time high, and while the ETF saw some strong rallies throughout the year, the were both preceded and followed by sharp selloffs. The probability of XLK seeing a 20% rally by the end of 2023 is approximately 25% according to the options markets. However, the chance of XLK reaching new highs in the coming year is below 9%.2. Real Estate (XLRE)Real Estate (XLRE) Top 5 HoldingsCompanySymbol% of ETF2022 ReturnAmerican Tower CorpAMT13.1%-27.7%Prologis IncPLD9.4%-32.5%Crown Castle International CorpCCI8.9%-35.7%Equinix IncEQIX7.7%-22.9%Public StoragePSA4.9%-23.7%The SPDR Real Estate Sector ETF (XLRE) is a portfolio of the real estate investment trusts (REITs) that are a part of the S&P 500 index. XLRE is the 3rd worse performing sector ETF, having lost over 26% by December 21st. XLRE\u2019s price ended up fairly flat for the year of 2020 after rebounding off of the lows of the initial pandemic drop. However, last year XLRE posted a 46% return, second only to the energy sector in 2021.Representing over 13% of the portfolio, American Tower Corp (AMT) is the largest holding in XLRE. AMT operates wireless cell towers and other infrastructure. Over 10 years the REIT returned nearly 300% to investors at its peak last year. Trading at $207, AMT is now far below that $303 high. Average bullish ratings indicate analysts expect AMT back above $250 in the future.The likelihood of the real estate sector and XLRE making a full recovery in the coming year are pretty low. The long-dated options indicate only a 5% chance of XLRE being above its prior high by the end of 2023.3. Consumer Discretionary (XLY)Consumer Discretionary (XLY) Top 5 HoldingsCompanySymbol% of ETF2022 ReturnAmazon.com IncAMZN23.5%-52%Tesla IncTSLA11.5%-69%Home Depot IncHD10.2%-24%NIKE IncNKE4.7%-30%McDonalds CorporationMCD4.7%-2%With constant discussions of recession, and the continued battle with inflation, it\u2019s no surprise that the consumer discretionary sector is struggling this year. The SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY) is now down nearly 35% for the year, with its two largest holdings paving the way lower. Amazon (AMZN) has lost over 50% of its value since January, with shares of Tesla (TSLA) down almost 70% for the year.Compared to many other large names, AMZN found its all-time high early in 2021, hitting $188.65 in July of last year. AMZN\u2019s selloff, that continued into this year started earlier than the overall indices, beginning to fall in November 2021. Shares are now more than $100 below that level at a sub-$83 price. Wall Street remains bullish on AMZN, with buy-side analysts being the outspoken majority. An average of bullish price-targets looks for shares to rebound above the $150 level. The derivatives markets look less optimistic, with June options indicating a $150 price at less than 3% probability and a roughly 6% probability by the end of 2023.TSLA continues to dominate financial headlines as its falling price hurts index, sector, and stockholders alike. After strong rallies in 2020 and 2021, TSLA has now retraced to levels last seen in September 2020. At $124 per share, the $414.50 highs of 2021 seem like a fantasy. Analysts seem to agree, and while there is sentiment out there that TSLA is now oversold, average analyst buy ratings have an aggregate target of around $250, still 40% below the high. However, TSLA\u2019s volatile options market indicates a slim chance of $250 at the end of 2023, with the Jan 2024 options giving the outcome less than a 10% probability. And two years from now, by the end of 2024, the market is pricing less than a 5% chance of the stock retesting its 2021 highs.Any recovery in AMZN and TSLA is likely to take a long time. This is reflected in the call options for XLY, which indicate the probability of XLY recovering to its previous highs as less than 3% by January 2024.4. Communication Services (XLC)Communication Services (XLC) Top 5 HoldingsCompanySymbol% of ETF2022 ReturnMeta Platforms IncMETA15.7%-65.6%Alphabet Inc (Class A)GOOGL12.1%-39.9%Alphabet Inc (Class C)GOOG10.8%-39.5%Walt Disney CompanyDIS9.2%-45.3%T-MobileTMUS4.9%21.6%The worst performing sector for 2022 is communication services. Looking at the holdings of XLC, the SPDR Communication Services ETF, this quickly becomes no surprise. The top three holdings are Meta Platforms (META), formerly Facebook, and the two share classes of Alphabet (GOOG & GOOGL), the parent company of Google. While most investors may think of these firms as tech-giants, their classification and inclusion in the communication services sector. Like the overall market, XLC saw strong returns over the past three years before 2022.META\u2019s collapse this year was largely publicized as both public and investor sentiment towards Facebook and META\u2019s other businesses turned sharply negative. It\u2019s fair to say that in the market euphoria perhaps META\u2019s shares were never \u201cworth\u201d $384.33, but that\u2019s the price at which the stock topped in August of last year. The options market indicates the chance of META ending 2023 above $385 is less than 1%. Industry analysts do see opportunity for META here, with a plethora of bullish ratings averaging $157 as a price target.While GOOG and GOOGL are the second and third holdings of XLY, their combined weighting means Alphabet represents nearly 23% of the ETF and nearly 3.4% of the overall S&P 500. Alphabet, like many tech and tech adjacent stocks has a long way to recover If investors are going to see new highs. This looks unlikely for GOOGL in the next two years with projections for the option market putting the $150 price level at a 12% probability. Analysts remain optimistic however, with average buy ratings at $130.The any recovery of XLC will be dominated by any upward momentum from META, GOOGL, and GOOG. Though in the damage seems to have been done for the foreseeable future. XLC\u2019s high of $86.36 will likely not be seen any time soon, with the 2-year LEAP call options predicting only a 5% chance the ETF ends 2024 above 80.*All data is current as of Dec 22nd, 2022.Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorDec 20, 2022, 11:34am ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.The AMD Radon RX 7900 XTX graphics cardAntony Leather\nAMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) Radeon RX 7900 series graphics cards are now available and we'll be taing a look to see how they perform against Nvidia's latest cards below, starting with the RX 7900 XTX.\n\n\nThis is AMD's new flagship graphics card, retailing for $999 and has more CUs, a higher clock speed, more memory, a wider 384-bit interface and higher total board power than the RX 7900 XT, with the latter retailing for $100 less as a result.\n\nThe quetion is, which one should you get and is the RX 7900 XTX a better option than Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080? We'll be looking to answer that question here as well as looking at how much power the crad draws, its thermals and the impact of AMD's FSR on boosting frame rates compared to Nvidia's DLSS.\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nTest system\nI used an Intel Core i9-12900K CPU, 32GB Kingston DDR5 memory, an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Apex motherboard, Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 1350W PSU and Solidigm P41 Plus 2TB M.2 SSD along with the latest version of Windows 11. Frame rates were recorded with Nvidia Frameview using either manual play throughs or the game's own built-in benchmark.\n\n\nBenchmarks\nBelow we can see Forza Horizon 5 at 1440p and here, the RX 6900 cards still offered exceptional value as they did at launch in Forza, with only the RTX 4090 offering higher performance. The RX 7900 XTX posted a higher minimum 99th percentile frame rate than the RTX 4080, but the latter offered a higher average frame rate.\n\n \nAt 4K, the same was true - the 7900 XTX was slightly ahead of the RTX 4080 on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate while the Nvidia card was ahead on the average frame rate. As an additional test, FSR was enabled, which provided a noticeable boost to frame rates, but still not enough to overhaul the RTX 4080 completely.\nBelow in Rainbow Six Extraction, the 7900 XTX finally had the measure of the RTX 4080 and was also signficiantly faster than the 7900 XT as well, easily justifying the extra $100 outlay over its sibling and offering a big upgrade from RTX 3000 or RX 6900 series cards.\nAt 4K the RTX 4080 stepped ahead on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate, but the 7900 XTX was ahead on the average frame rate, generally giving the cheaper 7900 XTX the advantage. It again justified the extra outlay over the 7900 XT too.\nBelow in Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition at 1440p with ray tracing enabled, The 7900 XTX was much faster on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate than the RTX 4080, but the latter was 11fps faster on the average frame rate. Again, that's largely a win for the 7900 XTX, which was again much faster than the 7900 XT here too.\nThe RTX 4080 leapfrogged the 7900 XTX at 4K and the average frame rate was signficantly faster, while the 7900 XT was again noticeably slower offering questionable value compared to AMD's new flagship.\nAt 4K again but with DLSS enabled (sadly AMD FSR isn't available here) and we can see the impact of Nvidia's frame rate-boosting technology, with even the RTX 3080 able to better both of AMD's new cards. A lot depends on whether you want to use this or FSR, though, but it's important to highlight a few examples of each for those that do.\nMoving on to Watch Dogs and here at 1440p with DXR reflections enabled, AMD finally seems to have banished the gremlins that plagued it in DXR titles with the RX 6000 series as the 7900 XTX wasn't far behind the RTX 4080 and comfortably beat everything else except the RTX 4090. You'd probably want to spend the extra $100 over the 7900 XT here too.\nAt 4K, there was very little between the RTX 4080 and 7900 XTX, but again, the latter was by far the better option over the 7900 XT and was also much faster than any previous generation card.\nThrowing in DLSS again and once more the RTX 3080 is able to reign in the 7900 XTX while the RTX 4080 was able to offer nearly double the frame rates of either AMD card.\nSwitching to an FSR-enabled game now and Far Cry 6 is already a title that leans heavily towards AMD and unsuprisingly both 7900 series cards beat everything else at 1440p.\nThe RTX 4090 managed to split them at 4K and better the 7900 XTX's average frame rate, but FSR comes to the rescue, offering huge benefits for both cards, although strangely the less powerful 7900 XT did better with FSR enabled than the 7900 XTX.\nIf FSR isn't for you and you want maximum image quality perhaps with some DXR reflections thrown in, then the 7900 XTX is still a force to be reckoned with, easily outpacing the RTX 4080 and nearly matching the far more expensive RTX 4090 too.\nBelow in Halo Infinite's Campaign mode at 1440p, AMD has some work to do here to get its cards to be competitive. Everything above the RTX 3090 was able to better the 7900 XTX and the RTX 4080 was definitely worth the extra cash and it's worth noting that both DLSS and FSR will be coming to this game.\nAt 4K things weren't much better for AMD with the RTX 4080 again enjoying a decent lead over the 7900 XTX, although the latter was generally quicker than the RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti overall.\nFlight Simulator remains a stubborn title when it comes to boost frame rates, but the RTX 4080 offered a slightly higher average than the 7900 XTX while the 7900 XT was a little slower still at 1440p.\n4K saw the RTX 4080 and 7900 XTX perform similarly with the 7900 XT close behind, but it's pretty evident there are bottlenecks elsewhere in the system despite the test using using cutting-edge hardware.\nThe beta version of the game was supplied used in my original RTX 4000-series reviews and includes support for both DLSS 3.0 and FSR 2.2. Both are tested below, but in this latest version of the game and a slightly different benchmark, AMD actually pipped the RTX 4090 to the post with no frame rate trickering going on. FSR certainly helped both the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX too, but if you want maximum frame rates, you'll need an RTX 4000-series card and DLSS 3.0.\nPower and thermals\nThe 7900 XTX sat at around 65\u00b0C during benchmarking, but the cooler remained quiet and would certainly not be loud enough for even those with sensitive ears to be annoyed by except in a case with poor cooling. You also have the benefit of no flow-through fan compared to Nvidia cards.\nPower consumption isn't really something either AMD or Nvidia can shout about right now and below you can see the total system draw. Typically the rest of the system uses 100-150W, with the rest being drawn by the GPU. It's not good news for either AMD card compared to the RTX 4080 although the 7900 XTX was at least faster in a number of titles. The 7900 XT doesn't offer great performance per watt by comparison.\nConclusions\nIt's not a clean sweep for AMD as the RTX 4080 is both faster in a number of games, in and out of ray tracing and in several examples, justifies the extra outlay too, especially if you're prepared to use the latest version of DLSS.\nThe Radeon RX 7900 XTX does get the better of the Nvidia card, though, both in outright performance in a number of games, but more often in terms of value given it costs $100 less but either performed the same or close to the RTX 4080.AMD's RTX 7900 XTX and Nvdia's RTX 4080Antony Leather\nA lot will depend on the game, resolution and settings you use, with some favoring the 7900 XTX and othersthe RTX 4080. Ray tracing is generally one for Nvidia, but outside of this the 7900 XTX usually offers similar or better performance as well as better value. In addition, it's also far smaller so will have fewer case and cooling compatibility issues. It's also doubtful the RTX 4070 Ti wil cause too many issues for it, unlike the 7900 XT.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Constellation Brands, a leading wine and spirits producer and beer importer, will be the first customer given keys\u00a0 at a launch event today.\nThe debut caps a two-year development sprint since Monarch, founded in 2018, hatched plans to deliver its smart tractor, complete with the energy-efficient NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform. The tractor combines electrification, automation, and data analysis to help farmers reduce their carbon footprint, improve field safety, streamline farming operations, and increase their bottom lines.\nThe MK-V tractor cuts energy costs and diesel emissions, while also helping reduce harmful herbicides, which are expensive and deplete the soil.\n\u201cWith precision ag, autonomy and AI, data will decrease the volume of chemicals used, which is good for the soil, good for the farmer from a profitability standpoint, and good for the consumer,\u201d said Praveen Penmetsa, CEO of Monarch Tractor.\nThe delivery of MK-V tractors to Constellation Brands will be followed with additional tractor shipments to family farms and large corporate customers, according to the company.\nMonarch is a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, which provides startups with technology support and AI platforms guidance.\nLeading Farming AI Wave of Clean Tractors\nMonarch Tractor founders include veterans of Silicon Valley\u2019s EV scene who worked together at startup Zoox, now Amazon owned. Carlo Mondavi, from the Napa Valley Mondavi winery family, is a sustainability-focused vintner and chief farming officer.\u00a0 Mark Schwager, former Tesla Gigafactory chief, is president; Zachary Omohundro, a robotics Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon, is CTO; Penmetsa is an autonomy and mobility engineer. \u201cThe marriage of NVIDIA accelerated computing with Jetson edge AI on our Monarch MK-V has helped our customers reduce the use of unneeded herbicides with our cutting-edge, zero-emission tractor \u2013 this revolutionary technology is helping our planet\u2019s soil, waterways and biodiversity,\u201d said Carlo Mondavi.\n\nPenmetsa likens the revolutionary new tractor to paradigm shifts in PCs and smartphones, enablers of world-changing applications. Monarch\u2019s role, he said, is as the hub to enable smart implements \u2014 precision sprayers, harvesters and more \u2014 for computer vision applications to help automate farming.\nIn 2021, Monarch launched pilot test models for commercial use at Wente Vineyards, also based in Livermore. The trial at Wente compared its energy usage to that of a diesel tractor, noting Monarch saved more than $2,600 in annual expenses.\nMonarch has raised more than $110 million in funding. Strategic investors include Japanese auto parts maker Musashi Seimitsu Industry Co; CNH Industrial, an agricultural equipment maker; and VST Tillers Tractors, an India-based equipment maker and dealer of tractors and implements.\nIt recently signed a contract manufacturing agreement with Hon Hai Technology Group Foxconn to build the MK-V and its battery packs at the Mahoning Valley, Ohio, plant.\nAs a wave of AI sweeps farming, developers are working to support more sustainable farming practices.\nThe NVIDIA Jetson platform provides energy-efficient computing to the MK-V, which offers advances in battery performance.\nWhat a Jetson-Supported Monarch Founder Series MK-V Can Do\nTapping into six NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX SOMs (system on modules), Monarch\u2019s Founder Series MK-V tractors are essentially roving robots packing supercomputing.\nMonarch has harnessed Jetson to deliver tractors that can safely traverse rows within agriculture fields using only cameras. \u201cThis is important in certain agriculture environments because there may be no GPS signal,\u201d said Penmetsa. \u201cIt\u2019s also crucial for safety as the Monarch is intended for totally driverless operation.\u201d\nThe Founder Series MK-V runs two 3D cameras and six standard cameras. With the six Jetson edge AI modules on board, it can run models for multiple farming tasks when paired with different implements.\nSupporting more sustainable farming practices, computer vision applications are available to fine-tune with transfer learning for the Monarch platform to develop precision spraying and other options.\nDelivering Farm-Apps-as-a-Service\u00a0\nMonarch offers a core of main applications to assist farms with AI, available in a software-as-a-service model on its platform.\nThe Founder Series MK-V has some basic functions on its platform as well, such as sending alerts when on a low charge or there\u2019s an unidentified object obstructing a path. It will also shut down from spraying if its camera-based vision platform identifies a human.\nThe tractor collects and analyzes crop data daily and can process data from current and next-generation implements equipped with sensors and imaging.

Just in case you needed further confirmation, Twitter leaker @momomo_us managed to track down a leaked listing on Nvidia\u2019s own French website, complete with full specifications.\nThe details have since been removed, yet the brief appearance has put to bed any speculation regarding the GPU\u2019s composition; it is, as expected, the much-maligned GeForce RTX 3080 12GB going by a new name.\nDesigned around a purpose-built AD104 die, RTX 4070 Ti is a full implementation of 60 Ada Lovelace SMs, resulting in 7,680 cores with Nvidia maintaining the same 2,610MHz boost clock originally purported for RTX 4080 12GB. A reduced pool of memory is aligned to a narrow 192-bit bus, and card power shrinks to a mere 285W.\nGeForceRTX 4090RTX 4080RTX 4070 TILaunch dateOct 2022Nov 2022Jan 2023CodenameAD102AD103AD104Process (nm)444Transistors (bn)76.345.935.8Die size (mm2)608.5378.6294.5SMs128 of 14476 of 8060 of 60CUDA cores16,3849,7287,680Boost clock (MHz)2,5202,5052,610Memory size (GB)241612Memory typeGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XMemory bus (bits)384256192Power (watts)450320285Launch MSRP ($)1,5991,199799 (TBC)\nSpecifications come as no surprise \u2013 these numbers have been available ever since RTX 4080 12GB was announced back in September \u2013 but word on the grapevine is that a new lower price could be in the offing. Whereas the cancelled RTX 4080 12GB was expected to fetch $899, RTX 3070 Ti is now rumoured to be starting at $799.\nAn 11 per cent price cut would be significant, and could be interpreted multiple ways. Is Nvidia attempting to make amends after the RTX 4080 12GB backlash, or has the $899 Radeon RX 7900 XT delivered more punch than Team Green had anticipated? It\u2019s too soon to say, yet early third-party leaks suggest RTX 4070 Ti will benchmark close to a previous-generation RTX 3090 Ti when it comes to pure rasterisation.\n$799 would surely put the Radeon in a tight spot just weeks after launch, but remember, there will be no RTX 4070 Ti Founders Edition. That means actual pricing will be in the hands of AIB partners and retailers, so only time will tell whether or not any cards manage to hit that fabled figure.\n\n\nParm MannClub386 founder and editor-in-chief, his journey with hardware pre-dates Google.

Not only has it mastered Full HD and QHD gaming, but it also lets you bask in the glory of Nvidia\u2019s ray-traced future while keeping things affordable, making it the best graphics card for most gamers out there not called the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.With every new generation, the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards always get a massive power bump over their predecessors. This time, it\u2019s the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, doing what the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 did before it with some major improvements that blow the best AMD graphics cards it's competing with out of the water.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: nearly RTX 4090 performance for a whole lot less\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 at Amazon for $569And, although the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 does come at a slight price bump over its predecessor, if you\u2019re looking for a way to get in on Nvidia's ray tracing capable GPUs, the RTX 2060 is an appealing option.This new mid-range graphics card rules over 1080p gaming, fully delivers on 1440p experiences and can even play games at 4K (if you don\u2019t mind the more pedestrian frame rate of 30 fps).\u00a0Plus, this graphics card can give users a taste of ray-traced gaming, though, not to the uncompromising level of the company\u2019s higher-end cards.Users on a tighter budget may be better served by the myriad versions of the Radeon RX 590, if they\u2019re okay with just gaming at a Full HD resolution. Otherwise, the Nvidia RTX 2060 currently stands unchallenged as one of the best midrange graphics cards you can buy.Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060: price and availabilityHow much is it? MSRP listed at $339 (about \u00a3270, AU$490)When is it out? January 2019Where can you get it? You can buy it from retailers in the US, UK, and AustraliaAs we expected, the new Nvidia RTX 2060 comes at a higher $339 (about \u00a3270, AU$490) price than the card we looked at in our Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 review, which is the one the RTX 2060 is replacing and which has an MSRP starting at $179 (about \u00a3140, AU$180). That\u2019s a $200 price bump, although some might argue that this isn\u2019t nearly as severe a price bump as we\u2019ve seen on the company\u2019s higher-end GPUs.Despite the higher price, the Nvidia RTX 2060 certainly punches well above its weight and feels more like a replacement for the Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti, which cost $449 (\u00a3419, AU$759) around the time of this review. It still falters behind its bigger brother, the $499 (about \u00a3380, AU$690) Nvidia RTX 2070, but puts AMD\u2019s $399 (\u00a3379, AU$679) Radeon RX Vega 56 and $279 (\u00a3249, AU$425) XFX Radeon RX 590 Fatboy in their place.It\u2019s worth mentioning, however, that AMD does offer a compelling alternative with the AMD Radeon RX 5700, expected to offer comparable performance at 1440p on Max or Ultra settings, though bizarrely at $30 more and without any ray tracing capability. Additionally, as we saw in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super review, Nvidia has more than enough firepower to take on the AMD Navi lineup.Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060: DesignImage 1 of 5How the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 stacks up against various graphics cards\u00a0 Ray tracing cores6GB of 14 Gbps GDDR6 memoryNo NVLink connector or SLI SupportNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 key specsGPU: Nvidia TU106\nStream multiprocessors: 30 (64 CUDA per SM)\nCUDA Cores: 1,920\nTensor cores: 240\nRay tracing cores: 30\nPower Draw (TGP): 160W\nBoost clock: 1,680MHz\nVRAM: 6GB GDDR6\nMemory Speed: 14Gbps\nInterface: PCIe 3.0 x16\nPower connector: 1 x 8-pinThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 is quite a step up from its predecessor. Equipped with 6GB of the latest 14Gbps GDDR6 video memory and 50% more CUDA cores, you\u2019re looking at a much more capable graphics card.\u00a0As we saw in our Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 review, the RTX 2060's predecessor was designed for 1080p gaming and could scrape by playing some games at 1440p, but the RTX 2060 has mastered high-frame rate Full HD gaming, delivering excellent 1440p results, and offers somewhat playable 4K gaming hovering around 30 frames per second (fps).This is thanks in large part to the RTX 2060 being based on a modified version of the Turing TU106 GPU used in the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070. While this technically means you\u2019re getting a cutdown version of a higher-end graphics card, most of its power still carries over. This is the very reason why this new \u2018mid-range\u2019 card is so capable.The only thing we\u2019re not wild about is the fact that Nvidia has decided not to include an NVLink connector or any form of SLI support on the RTX 2060. This means users will have to buy a much more expensive RTX 2070 or RTX 2080 \u2013 rather than plugging in another RTX 2060 \u2013 if they want to inject some more graphical oomph into their gaming PC later on.Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060: performanceImage 1 of 8Outstanding 1080p performanceDLSS is a huge boost to gaming frames per secondNot great for 4K gaming on highest settingsIn our synthetic benchmark tests, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 tops not only its predecessor, but even higher-tier GPUs of the Nvidia Pascal generation, like the Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti. The only graphics cards to top the Nvidia RTX 2060 of the Turing-era cards are the considerably more expensive Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070, AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080.Test system specsCPU: 3.7Ghz Intel Core i7-8700K (hexa-core, 12MB cache, up to 4.7GHz) \nRAM: 32GB Vengeance LED DDR4 (3,200MHz) \nMotherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z390-E Gaming \nPower Supply: Corsiar RM850x \nStorage: 512GB Samsung 960 Pro M.2 SSD (NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4) \nCooling: Thermaltake Floe Riing 360 TT Premium Edition \nCase: Corsair Crystal Series 570X RGB \nOperating system: Windows 10That is, until AMD releases the new AMD Radeon RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT graphics, and Nvidia unleashes its Super RTX series, you won\u2019t find another mid-range graphics card more powerful than this.All this performance also translates to seamless gaming experiences. The Nvidia RTX 2060 is more than powerful enough to keep frame rates well north of 60fps in Full HD gaming, which is music to the ears of high-refresh-rate monitor owners. Meanwhile, it even delivers decent 4K gaming that hovers close to 30 fps in our benchmarks.Image 1 of 4Despite having the smallest complement of RT and Tensor Cores in the Nvidia RTX lineup thus far, the Nvidia RTX 2060 can still pull off all of the Turing architecture\u2019s new tricks including DLSS and ray tracing. In fact, this GPU can play Battlefield V at a consistent 70-75 fps with the game running at 1080p with Ultra quality settings and ray tracing.Unfortunately, tuning up the fidelity to 2,560 x 1,440 drops the frame rate to 45fps \u2013 40fps if left on Ultra quality settings and ray tracing. However, 4K with all the same settings is still surprisingly somewhat playable with the frame rate hovering around 25fps.Based on our testing, we also find new dual fan cooler works well at keeping the Nvidia RTX 2060 running much more efficiently than the previous Pascal-series cards.Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060?Buy it if...You want ray-traced graphics at a reasonable price\nGetting ray tracing in your games is a huge jump from previous-gen GTX cards, and the RTX 2060 will let you do that at a reasonable price.\u00a0You want to take advantage of DLSS technology\nDLSS is one of the most exciting technologies to hit the graphics card scene in years, and it substantially boosts framerates with the RTX 2060.You can find or are priced out of Nvidia Ampere\nWhile the RTX 2060 is last-gen tech with the release of Nvidia Ampere, the latest RTX 3000-series cards are still difficult to find.Don't buy it if...You're looking for a true budget graphics card\nWhile the RTX 2060 is more affordable, it's not cheap either.You want 1440p and 4K gaming\nWhile the RTX 2060 does an admirable job with at 1440p, it's not a true 1440p gaming card, and you can forget about getting 60 fps at 4K on the latest AAA games.\nAlso ConsiderNvidia GeForce RTX 3050\nIf you're willing to make the jump to the next-gen Ampere graphics cards, the RTX 3050 is the most affordable in that series, and is a strong competitor to the RTX 2060.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 3060\nIf you're willing to shell out a bit more cash, the RTX 3060 is a major improvement over the RTX 2060 without a huge price increase.

Technically, it gets underway a couple of days before CES officially starts, but that's how things typically go\u2014announcements both big and little start pouring in ahead of time and continue throughout the week.\n\n\nOfficially, CES runs from Thursday, January 5 through Sunday, January 8. However, the GeForce Beyond event is scheduled for Tuesday, January 3 starting at 8:00am PST (11:00am EST). Presumably this will entail a keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.\n\n\nThis will be a livestreamed event that you can watch on NVIDIA's YouTube and/or Twitch channels. According to NVIDIA's GeForce Beyond at CES 2023 portal, the livestream will deliver news about the \"latest breakthroughs in gaming, creating, and graphics technology, as part of the broader NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2023.\" So what exactly can we expect? Let's dive in...\nWhat To Expect At NVIDIA's GeForce Beyond Event At CES 2023\nWhen it comes to betting, nothing is ever guaranteed. However, if Las Vegas was offering odds on NVIDIA unveiling a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at the GeForce Beyond event, the paltry payout would reflect that it's as close to guaranteed as it can get in the betting world. Not only are there a wealth of GeForce RTX 4070 Ti leaks and rumors, but even NVIDIA isn't bothering to hide what's coming. Check this out...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a screenshot of the system requirements for NVIDIA's Omniverse View platform, which is current at the time of this writing. If you look at the GPU section in the Recommended category, it plainly lists the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, a graphics card that has not yet been announced.\n\n\nWho knows if NVIDIA was planning all along to unveil a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at CES, but the moment it became inevitable is when the GPU designer \"unlaunched\" the 12GB version of its GeForce RTX 4080. NVIDIA made the decision in response to blow back from enthusiasts over the 12GB variant being a cut down version of the 16GB GeForce RTX 4080, with not just less memory but also fewer CUDA cores and a narrower bus width.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it happened so late in the game (post-announcement), it made sense that we would eventually see the cancelled GPU reborn/rebadged with a different SKU, so that NVIDIA's hardware partners wouldn't be stuck holding the bag. Multiple leaks and rumors have the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti sporting the same specifications as the unlaunched 12GB GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, and more recently it's even shown up in a retail listing for the same price.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the upcoming card does actually debut with an $899 MSRP, or if NVIDIA or goes with a lower price point to better compete with AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX. We'll find out soon enough.\n\n\nIn addition to the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, NVIDIA is almost as likely to announce its initial lineup of GeForce RTX 40 series mobile GPUs based on Ada Lovelace. Earlier this month, an upgraded HP Omen 17 gaming laptop broke cover with several mobile GeForce RTX 40 series options (4090, 4080, 4070, and 4060). And last month, a Samsung Galaxy Book Pro was spotted wielding a mobile GeForce RTX 4050 GPU.\n\n\nSo if we had to guess, the major announcements will be the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti for the desktop, and a spattering of laptop GPUs based on Ada Lovelace. Beyond those hardware bits, it wouldn't surprise us if NVIDIA announced more games supporting DLSS 3. We might also be in for a surprise of some sort. For example, at least year's CES event, NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti.\n\n\nBe sure to check HotHardware often as we'll be covering all the juicy announcements coming out of CES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), geforce rtx 4070 ti, ces2023, geforce beyond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing...\nBeep-Beep!

Download today to use it in your #WinterArtChallenge scenes.\nTune in to NVIDIA\u2019s special address at CES on Tuesday, Jan. 3, at 8 a.m. PT, when we\u2019ll share the latest innovations made possible by accelerated computing and AI.\nDare to Dragon\nXu is a veteran digital artist who has worked at top game studio Tencent, made key contributions to the third season of Netflix\u2019s Love, Death & Robots, and won ZBrush 2018 Sculpt of the Year award. He carries massive influence in the 3D community in China, and the country\u2019s traditional culture is an inexhaustible treasure of inspiration for the artist.\n\u201cAncient Chinese artisans have created countless unique, aesthetic systems over time that are completely different from Western art,\u201d said Xu. \u201cMy dream is to use modern means to reinterpret Chinese culture and aesthetics as I understand them.\u201d\nBlood Moon is a tribute to the lost Shu civilization, which existed from 2,800 B.C. to 1,100 B.C. The work demonstrates the creative power of ancient China. During a trip to the Sanxingdui Museum in the Sichuan province, where many relics from this era are housed, Xu became inspired by the mysterious, ancient Shu civilization.\nThe artist spent around 10 minutes sketching in the Procreate app, looking to capture the general direction and soul of the piece. This conceptual stage is important so that the heart of the artwork doesn\u2019t get lost once 3D is applied, Xu said.\nSketching in Procreate.\nHe then began sculpting in Maxon\u2019s ZBrush, which is his preferred tool as he says it contains the most convenient sculpting features.\nAdvanced sculpting in ZBrush.\nNext, Xu used Adobe Substance 3D Painter to apply colors and textures directly to 3D models. NVIDIA RTX-accelerated light- and ambient-occlusion features baked and optimized scene assets in mere seconds, giving Xu the option to experiment with visual aesthetics quickly and easily.\nLayers baked in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.\nNVIDIA Iray technology in the viewport enabled Xu to edit interactively and use ray-traced baking for faster rendering speeds \u2014 all accelerated by his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\n\u201cThe RTX 4090 GPU always gives me reliable performance and smooth interaction; plus, the Iray renderer delivers unbiased rendering,\u201d Xu said.\nTextures and materials applied in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.\nXu used the Universal Scene Description file framework to export the scene from Blender into the Omniverse Create app, where he used the advanced RTX Renderer, with path tracing, global illumination, reflections and refractions, to create incredibly realistic visuals.\nXu used the Blender USD branch to export the scene into Omniverse Create.\nNVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a platform for creating and operating metaverse applications \u2014 was incredibly useful for scene modifications, Xu said, as it enabled him to test lighting scenarios with his scene rendering in real time. This provided Xu with the most accurate iteration of final renders, allowing for more meaningful edits in the moment, he said.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nvidia-studio-itns-wk37-clip1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nFurther edits included adding fog and volume effects, easily applied in Omniverse Create.\nFog and volume effects applied in Omniverse Create.\nOmniverse gives 3D artists their choice of renderer within the viewport, with support for Pixar HD Storm, Chaos V-Ray, Maxon\u2019s Redshift, OTOY Octane, Blender Cycles and more. Xu deployed the unbiased NVIDIA Iray renderer to complete the project.\nXu selected the RTX Iray renderer for final renders.\n\u201cOmniverse is already an indispensable part of my work,\u201d Xu added.\nThe artist demonstrated this in another history-inspired piece, Kirin, built in Omniverse Create.\n\u2018Kirin\u2019 by Zhelong Xu.\n\u201cKirin, or Qilin, is always a symbol of hope and good fortune in China, but there are few realistic works in the traditional culture,\u201d said Xu.\nHe wanted to create a Kirin, a legendary hooved creature in Chinese mythology, with a body structure in line with Western fine art and anatomy, as well as with a sense of peace and the wisdom of silence based on Chinese culture.\n\u201cIt is not scary,\u201d said Xu. \u201cInstead, it is a creature of great power and majesty.\u201d\nKirin is decorated with jade-like cloud patterns, symbolizing the intersection of tradition and modernity, something the artist wanted to express and explore. Clouds and fogs are difficult to depict in solid sculpture, though they are often carved in classical Chinese sculpture. These were easily brought to life in Xu\u2019s 3D artwork.\n\u2018Kirin\u2019 resembles a cross between a dragon and a horse, with the body of a deer and the tail of an ox.\nCheck out Zhelong Xu\u2019s website for more inspirational artwork.\n3D artist Zhelong Xu.\nFor the latest creative app updates, download the monthly NVIDIA Studio Driver.\nAccess tutorials on the Studio YouTube channel and get updates directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Studio newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Art | Creators | GeForce | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Omniverse | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But AMD and Intel are upping the GPU competition. \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is playing some serious games.\nWhen Jensen Huang and his two partners established Nvidia in 1993, the graphics chip market had many more competitors than the CPU market, which had just two. Nvidia\u2019s competitors in the gaming market included ATI Technologies, Matrox, S3, Chips & Technology, and 3DFX.\nA decade later, Nvidia had laid waste to every one of them except for ATI, which was purchased by AMD in 2006. For most of this century, Nvidia has shifted its focus to bring the same technology it uses to render videogames in 4k pixel resolution to power supercomputers, high-performance computing (HPC) in the enterprise, and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of that shift are laid clear in Nvidia\u2019s financial reports and in the industry. For its most recent quarter, data center revenue hit $3.81 billion, up 61% from a year earlier, and it accounted for 56% of Nvidia\u2019s total revenue. In the latest Top500 list of supercomputers, 153 are running Nvidia accelerators while AMD only has nine. According to IDC, Nvidia held 91.4% of the enterprise GPU market to AMD\u2019s 8.5% in 2021.\n\n\n\nHow did it get here? Earlier in the century, Nvidia realized that the nature of the GPU, a floating-point math co-processor with thousands of cores running in parallel, lends itself very well to HPC and AI computing. Like 3D graphics, HPC and AI are heavily dependent on floating-point math.\nThe first steps toward an enterprise shift came in 2007, when former Stanford University computer science professor Ian Buck developed CUDA, a C++-like language for programming GPUs. Videogame developers didn\u2019t code to the GPU; they programmed to Microsoft\u2019s DirectX graphics library, which in turn spoke to the GPU. CUDA presented an opportunity to code directly to the GPU just like a programmer working in C/C++ would to a CPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFifteen years later, CUDA is taught in several hundred universities around the world and Buck is the head of Nvidia\u2019s AI efforts. CUDA allowed developers to make GPU-specific applications \u2013 something not doable before \u2013but it also locked them into the Nvidia platform, because CUDA is not easily portable.\nFew companies play in both the consumer and enterprise spaces. Hewlett-Packard split itself in two to better serve those markets. Manuvir Das, vice president of enterprise computing at Nvidia, says the company \u201cis definitely focused on enterprise companies today. Of course, we\u2019re also a gaming company entity. That\u2019s not going to change.\u201d\nThe gaming and enterprise sides of the house both use the same GPU architecture, but the company thinks of these two businesses as separate entities. \u201cSo in that sense, we\u2019re almost sort of two companies within one. It\u2019s one architecture but two very different routes to market, sets of customers, use cases, all of that,\u201d he says.\nDas adds that Nvidia has a range of GPUs, and they all have different functionality depending on the target market. The enterprise GPUs have a transformer engine that performs natural language processing, for example, and other functions which are not found in the gaming GPUs.\nAddison Snell, principal researcher and CEO of Intersect360 Research, says Nvidia is straddling the two markets well for now. However, \u201cthe growth in GPU computing is really taking them full force into enterprise computing and AI. And I think they\u2019re predominantly now serving the hyperscale market there, which is the home of the majority of AI spending,\u201d Snell says.\nAnshel Sag, principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, echoes this. \u201cI feel like a lot of the company\u2019s efforts are very much focused on the enterprise today, but I still think that there\u2019s a lot of gaming that\u2019s still very much within its overall branding,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSag believes Nvidia\u2019s biggest room for improvement is in mobile technologies, where it plays second fiddle to Qualcomm. \u201cI think they\u2019re very weak in the mobile space, and that mobile space is not just limited to smartphones, but handheld gaming, and AR/VR applications. I think it exposes them on the edge, and I think that they will have competition down the road,\u201d Sag says.\nAccording to Snell, Nvidia is continuing to downplay HPC in favor of AI and focusing on hyperscale companies, counting on cloud computing as the delivery mechanism for all types of enterprise computing.\n\u201cThis points to Nvidia aiming to be a complete solution provider for hyperscale and cloud, while diminishing its efforts as a component provider through traditional server OEMs to end users,\u201d Snell says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompeting against its partners\nNvidia operates differently than other chip giants in that it competes with its OEM partners. That has caused at least one public blowup.\nIn September, peripheral maker EVGA announced it would no longer make Nvidia cards. EVGA was one of the top vendors in the market, and graphics cards accounted for 80% of its income. So they had to be pretty angry with Nvidia to walk away from 80% of its revenue.\nEVGA CEO Andy Han cited several grievances with Nvidia, not the least of which was that it competes with Nvidia. Nvidia makes graphics cards and sells them to consumers under the brand name Founder\u2019s Edition, something AMD and Intel do very little or not at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, Nvidia\u2019s line of graphics cards was being sold for less than what licensees were selling their cards. So not only was Nvidia competing with its licensees, but it was also undercutting them.\nNvidia does the same on the enterprise side, selling DGX server units (rack-mounted servers packed with eight A100 GPUs) in competition with OEM partners like HPE and Supermicro. Das defends this practice.\n\u201cDGX for us has always been sort of the AI innovation vehicle where we do a lot of item testing,\u201d he says, adding that building the DGX servers gives Nvidia the chance to shake out the bugs in the system, knowledge it passes on to OEMs. \u201cOur work with DGX gives the OEMs a big head-start in getting their systems ready and out there. So it\u2019s actually an enabler for them.\u201d\nBut both Snell and Sag think Nvidia should not be competing against its partners. \u201cI\u2019m highly skeptical of that strategy,\u201d Snell says. \u201cIt defies the tenet of not competing with your own customers. If I were one of the major server OEMs, I wouldn\u2019t like the idea that Nvidia is now acting as a system provider and taking me out of the loop.\u201d\n\u201cI think those [DGX] systems do, to a certain degree, compete with what their partners are offering. But that said, I also think that Nvidia doesn\u2019t necessarily want to provide support and services for those systems, like their partners will. And I think that\u2019s a big component of the enterprise solutions that isn\u2019t really present on the consumer side,\u201d Sag says.\nAMD, Intel bolster their GPU technologies\nSo who might knock Nvidia from its perch? Throughout the history of the Silicon Valley, most companies that experienced a great fall were not knocked off by a competitor but fell apart from within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM and Apple in the 1990s, Sun Microsystems, SGI, Novell, and now Facebook were all undone or nearly undone because of bad management and bad decisions, not because somebody else came along and knocked them off.\nNvidia has had product misfires along the way, but it has always quickly course-corrected with the next generation of silicon. And it has had pretty much the same executive management team since the beginning, and they haven\u2019t made that many mistakes.\nOne thing that helped Nvidia achieve such dominance is that it had the market to itself. AMD was struggling to survive for years, and Intel repeatedly tried and failed to develop a GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case anymore. AMD is thoroughly revitalized, and it has bragging rights now that its GPU technology, Instinct, is powering the fastest supercomputer in the world, Frontier. And Intel finally seems to be on the right track with its Xe GPU architecture, found in the forthcoming Ponte Vecchio enterprise GPU.\nIf there\u2019s a company that has Das looking over his shoulder, he isn\u2019t admitting it, however. \u201cI think the real competition we see is basically how do we [support] the workloads that already exist, that are running non-accelerated?\u201d he asks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nTop network and data center events 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Denise Dubie \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Computing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Security\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nEnterprises reevaluate virtualization strategies amid Broadcom uncertainty\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetwork Management Software\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n5 alternatives to VMware vSphere virtualization platform\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Neal Weinberg \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking Devices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServer Virtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtualization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nIonQ, Alice & Bob tout quantum breakthroughs\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Maria Korolov \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n5 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCPUs and Processors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Andy Patrizio                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on X\n\n\nFollow Andy Patrizio on LinkedIn\n \n\n\n\nAndy Patrizio is a freelance journalist based in southern California who has covered the computer industry for 20 years and has built every x86 PC he\u2019s ever owned, laptops not included.\nThe opinions expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of ITworld, Network World, its parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies.\n\n\n\n\nMore from this author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewsIntel taps semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan as new CEO Mar 12, 2025 4 minsnewsAltera targets low-latency AI edge applications with new FPGA products Mar 11, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo introduces compact, liquid-cooled AI edge server Mar 07, 2025 3 minsfeatureSeven important trends in the server sphere Mar 06, 2025 4 minsfeatureData center vacancies hit historic lows despite record construction Mar 06, 2025 4 minsnewsAI driving a 165% rise in data center power demand by 2030 Mar 05, 2025 3 minsnewsTariffs for now won\u2019t impact IT organizations Mar 04, 2025 3 minsnewsLenovo renews ThinkSystem lineup for AI workloads and more Feb 26, 2025 2 mins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me morePopularArticlesPodcastsVideos\n\n\nopinion  Jio teams with AMD, Cisco and Nokia to build AI-enabled telecom platform  By Zeus Kerravala\nMar 18, 20254 mins\nNetworkingTelecommunications\n\n\n\n\nnews  2025 network outage report and internet health check By Ann Bednarz\nMar 18, 202528 mins\nInternet Service ProvidersNetwork Management SoftwareNetworking\n\n\n\n\nnews  Cloudflare unveils network-powered posture management By Sean Michael Kerner\nMar 18, 20255 mins\nCloud ComputingNetwork Security\n\n\n\n\npodcast  Has the hype around \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 paid off?

In pretty much all of our performance tests, it slots in right where you'd expect it to, comfortably ahead of the RTX 3080 Ti but trailing the $1,600 RTX 4090 by enough to justify the $300 price gap. It's usually capable of hitting or exceeding 60 fps at 4K, and games with DLSS support (or some other kind of upscaling tech) can buy you a solid frame rate increase. And its power requirements aren't as stratospheric as the 4090's, either, so most people with an existing xx70 or xx80-class gaming PC shouldn't need to switch out their power supply.\nThe major downsides, as of this writing? As a group, the cards are often just as huge and cumbersome as the RTX 4090 (the Founders Edition is identical, and partner cards largely follow suit). The $1,200 starting price is historically high\u2014the 3080 Ti launched with a GPU-shortage-inflated MSRP of $1,119 GPU, but the 2080 and 3080 were both a mere $699 at launch. And even if you are willing to pay that price\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014it's basically impossible to find in any form anywhere close to MSRP.\nWhich means, hooray: another GPU review that exists mostly as a theoretical exercise! If you could buy this GPU for the amount of money it's supposed to cost, and if its competitors were also available for what they were supposed to cost, then here's how it would stack up. That world doesn't exist right now, but if you're reading this in a few months, circumstances may have changed. In the meantime, imagine with us, won't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the size\u2014and that power connector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                From left to right and largest to smallest: GeForce RTX 4080 (which is the same physical size as the RTX 4090), Radeon RX 7900 XTX, and Radeon RX 7900 XT.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      From left to right and largest to smallest: GeForce RTX 4080 (which is the same physical size as the RTX 4090), Radeon RX 7900 XTX, and Radeon RX 7900 XT.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe 4080's physical dimensions are 12.3\u00d75.35\u00d72.13 inches, same as the 4090, and our 4090 review has several images comparing it to various objects so you can get an idea of just how large that is. It's a GPU that's roughly the same size as an entire Xbox Series S.\nThat does have ramifications for upgraders, particularly those using more space-efficient cases. Plenty of gaming-focused mini ITX cases won't fit a 4090 or 4080 at all, and although the case I use for my testbed fits full-size ATX motherboards (a Lian Li O11 Air Mini), I can't put the side panel back on with the card installed because the included power adapter sticks out too much. Once you factor in the front-mounted radiator and tubing for the CPU cooler, it's a tight fit, and it's something to keep in mind when upgrading an existing PC rather than building a new PC specifically designed to accommodate the card.\nOn the subject of that power adapter, the 4080 still uses a 12VHPWR power connector, the same as the RTX 4090\u2014the adapter just wants three 8-pin power adapters plugged into it instead of four. This connector has been the subject of some controversy because of overheating and melting issues that some users have experienced. The bad news is that the 4080's adapter is likely susceptible to the same issue, but the good news is that, in most cases, Nvidia and third-party testers have found that this overheating is created when the cables aren't quite plugged in all the way, something most people should be able to avoid with a little care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia's 12VHPWR power cable adapter on an RTX 4080.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's 12VHPWR power cable adapter on an RTX 4080.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe best way to check the firmness of your connection is to give the adapter a couple of firm tugs to make sure it doesn't come unseated\u2014it may pull back a millimeter or two while you're doing this but not enough to cause the heat problems that some people have been seeing. Push the connector back down after you've done this and try to be careful not to pull the cables around too much or bend them at an extreme angle.\nIn terms of power draw, the Founders Edition of the RTX 4080 is rated at around 320 W, the same as the last-generation RTX 3080 and lower than the 4090 (450 W) and the 3080 Ti (350 W). In practice, we found it to be even better behaved, drawing an average of just under 300 W during a\u00a0Hitman 3\u00a0benchmark run and averaging a relatively cool 59.8 degrees Celsius. The hulking heatsink and fans are overkill, but they do their job. Nvidia recommends a 750 W power supply, the same as the RTX 3080 and 3080 Ti, and you might be able to get away with less if you've paired it with a modest 6- or 8-core CPU.\n\nGame performance\n\n\n\n\nGaming testbed\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D (provided by AMD)\n\n\nMotherboard\nAsus ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero (provided by ASUS)\n\n\nRAM\n64GB DDR4-3200 (provided by Crucial)\n\n\nSSD\nWestern Digital Black SN850 1TB (provided by Western Digital)\n\n\nPower supply\nEVGA Supernova 850 P6 (provided by EVGA)\n\n\nCPU cooler\n280mm Corsair iCure H115i Elite Capellix AIO\n\n\nCase\nLian Li O11 Air Mini\n\n\n\nThe RTX 4090 is so much faster than last-generation cards that it leaves a lot of space underneath it for a still-faster-but-not-quite-as-fast card to fit, and that's exactly what the RTX 4080 is. It's short of the RTX 4090 but well ahead of the RTX 3090 and (especially) the 3080 Ti, and 3DMark gives a good high-level summary, though if anything, it undersells how well the 4080 stacks up to the 4090 in actual games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Results with an asterisk were done in another test PC with a somewhat slower CPU; results should still be broadly comparable.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Results with an asterisk were done in another test PC with a somewhat slower CPU; results should still be broadly comparable.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nFor anyone other than an RTX 4090 owner, this will be the most capable 4K graphics card you've ever owned, and it averages well over 60 fps in all of our non-raytracing test games at 4K with the settings maxed, even without the help of frame rate-boosting DLSS upscaling (you will usually want DLSS enabled to break 100 fps at 4K, though).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe card also handles ray-tracing-enabled games pretty well, hitting almost exactly 60 fps in Quake II RTX and more than that in slightly older games like\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Ray-tracing is still demanding enough that more recent games may need that DLSS boost to get to 60 fps and beyond, though, as is the case with Hitman 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond raw performance, the 4080 brings the same upgrades to the table that the RTX 4090 does, including hardware encoding support for the royalty-free AV1 video codec. Most importantly, though, it brings DLSS 3.0, which boosts frame rates by lightening the load on your CPU and\u00a0GPU without unduly increasing latency to do all those fancy predictions. For the few games that support it\u2014we tested the RTX 4090 with\u00a0Microsoft Flight Simulator and\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077, but others will follow\u2014it can feel like a \"magic wand,\" boosting frame rates even more than the previous version of DLSS. The benefits will be the same for the RTX 4080, albeit at a somewhat lower performance level.\n\nThe Radeon RX 7900 looms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 is an impressive graphics card next to anything other than the RTX 4090. If we lived in a world where the 4080 cost $1,200 and the 4090 cost $1,600, it would be a solid deal, delivering between 82 and 88 percent of the performance in most games for 75 percent of the money. Even without breaking out a calculator, the results speak for themselves: This is a good-to-great 4K gaming experience that saves you enough money to buy a better CPU, a roomier SSD, a nicer case, a better CPU cooler, or some combination of all four.\nThat being said, it's difficult at best to do this kind of price comparison in a world where neither the 4080 or 4090 is easy to find at those suggested prices, making them hard to justify no matter how good they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when you start talking about value for money, you have to include AMD's imminent Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT in the conversation. So far, AMD has published little in the way of head-to-head comparisons between the RTX 4080 and the upcoming Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT cards. But at $899 and $999, if either or both of those cards can approach the RTX 4080's performance, they'll be undercutting it even more on price (despite still being expensive, historically speaking).\nThere's more than raw game performance in the AMD-Nvidia rivalry, as ever. Nvidia has typically maintained an edge in power efficiency and ray-tracing performance, not to mention fringe benefits like DLSS 3.0. But if AMD can come close in general game performance while offering a physically smaller card with traditional PCIe power connectors, the combination of pricing and compatibility might make them better buys than the RTX 4080. You can't buy a 4080 for anywhere close to $1,200 right now\u2014but even if you could, your best bet is still to wait just a bit longer.\nThe good\n\nExcellent 4K gaming performance, second only to the RTX 4090.\nRuns cool and quiet and shouldn't require a new power supply for anyone already using an upper-midrange or lower-high-end GPU in their current PC.\nGreat ray-tracing performance, especially with DLSS upscaling enabled.\nAV1 video encoding support, which will be handy as the codec enters wider use among streamers and streaming sites.\nIt's hard to call something that costs $1,200 a \"bargain,\" but its performance-per-dollar is usually better than the RTX 4090's at that price.\n\nThe bad\n\n12VHPWR power connector controversy.

Wilson \u2022\nDec 24, 2022 at 01:08am EST\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA AIB partners have finally started offering the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card with the GA107 GPU, resulting in 15W less power consumption.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Gets Ampere GA107 GPU, Same Performance At 15W Lower Power\nA year ago, NVIDIA introduced the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card which featured the GA106 GPU for $249 US. The graphics card was meant to offer entry-level RTX performance in a 130W package but it looks like it was originally intended to use the GA107 GPU which at the time was shipping to notebooks and NVIDIA had to reuse GA106 silicon for the time being.\nNow a year later, NVIDIA's AIBs are introducing the GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card with the GA107 GPU. NVIDIA's GA107 GPU has a smaller core than the GA106, which offers 3840 CUDA cores. There will be no reason to replace the PCB as both versions are identical pin layouts, allowing for both to be compatible.\nImage source: Chiphell via IT Home.\nMSI has released its new GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X XS 8G OC, which is expected to offer 2560 CUDA cores. The graphics card will be capable of overclocking, with the boost clock anticipated to be 1807 MHz. Memory speeds are expected to be 14 Gbps and utilize the 8GB GDDR6 memory onboard and a 128-bit memory bus. The total power consumption level will be 115W, 15W less than the GA106 variant.\n\nDisplay outputs on the new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 VENTUS 2X XS 8G OC graphics card will have a single DisplayPort 1.4a port, one HDMI port that is expected to support 4K resolutions at 120 Hz with the 2.1 specifications, and a single DL-DVI-D connector, which is interesting that they are adding an older display connector onto the GPU. DL-DVI-D cables are seen with LCD connections and only provide a digital output.\nNVIDIA won't be launching an RTX 4050 any time soon since they are still focused on the RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 series for the majority of early 2023. The successor to the RTX 3050 might appear by mid of 2023 but we will have to see so for users who want to wait, the RTX 3050 is a decent entry-level option for now and can be found at decent prices too.\nNews Source: IT Home\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n94\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

I put in a large budget because I wanted it to be able to handle anything I threw at it \u2013 from 1080p to 8K, from ProRes to H.264. I also wanted to be able to spit out exports quickly as I\u2019m working remotely now all the time. I do not like waiting for renders or exports.\nBut that was the time of the Great GPU Shortage \u2013 the RTX 3000 series had launched, but I couldn\u2019t get my hands on one, at least not without paying exorbitant scalper prices. So I \u201cmade do\u201d with a RTX 2060 Super and decided to wait until the RTX 4000 release with my eye on the 4080. During that time I had been mightily impressed with the affordable 2060 Super and I wondered whether it was even worth upgrading. Maybe you\u2019re in a similar position.\nBut upgrade I did and I ran some tests using the three main NLEs as well as some other programs like Topaz Video AI to see what real life differences I gained from upgrading from a mid-range 20 series card to the higher end 40 series. Although these numbers are specific to me and not meant to be scientific in any way, I think there are a number of conclusions we can draw from them.\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition\nI\u2019ve previously covered that the gaming community was less than pleased with the pricing of the 4080 and that continues to be the case. Most commentators are still pretty annoyed at the high pricing of the 4080 (Nvidia have even lowed prices slightly in Europe).\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThere is the odd person out there with a more nuanced view, like this wonderful video essay from YouTube channel The TryHards. Personally I try to stay neutral with these things, plus I\u2019m not a gamer, but I must admit I started to feel bad for even wanting to buy the 4080. However I certainly didn\u2019t buy the argument that \u201cyou might as well buy the 4090\u201d as it was outside my budget and the available headroom I had on my power supply and I didn\u2019t want to buy a new one of those as well. That said I think for colourists and 3D ops the 4090 is very tempting. In the end I decided I\u2019d only get a 4080 if I was lucky enough to find the Founders Edition in stock \u2013 for its lower price and smaller size (we\u2019re talking relatively here!) \u2013 and so I checked every day on the Nvidia site and one day there it was.\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnto the tests \u2013 Decoding\nI ran a number of identical tests, first with the RTX 2060 Super and then the RTX 4080. My system has the following specs: Windows 10 Pro, AMD Threadripper 3960X (24 core), 128GB RAM (CL-16 3200MHz), Multiple NVMe SSDs. I used the latest versions of all the programs: Avid Media Composer v2022.10, Adobe Premiere Pro v23.0.0, Davinci Resolve v18.1.1, Neat Video v5.5.6, Topaz Video AI v3.0.5. Test clips were UHD (3840\u00d72160) 25fps.\nI tested first decoding H.264(AVC) and H.264(HVEC) (using hardware supported 8bit 4:2:0 for both). This test replicates transcoding or making proxies \u2013 converting to a mezzanine codec (commonly ProRes, but I used DNxHR as all the NLEs here support it).\u00a0 I calculated the results as FPS \u2013 frames per second \u2013 so higher is always better on the charts.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a few things to talk through here:\n\nWhy the low Premiere score? It seems the ability to make use of Nvidia\u2019s hardware decoder (NVDEC) is broken on the latest Windows Nvidia drivers (and they are the only drivers that support the 4080 so there\u2019s no rolling back). I have included the score as my real world results, but I will update it when it hopefully gets fixed. (Though if you have an Intel CPU with Quick Sync you will be fine as Premiere will decode with that.)\n\n**UPDATE: Although updated Nvidia drivers fixed NVDEC for playback, it isn\u2019t working for export and so these low score remain for now.\n\nAvid also didn\u2019t show any use of the hardware decoder which is to be expected, though I was pleasantly surprised by its score. I\u2019ll also note here, that for a fair test, I \u201clinked\u201d the source media in Avid which is not a common workflow. Normally H.264/H.265 media would be transcoded, but this test is effectively doing the same thing. Also that Avid prefers the use of Quadro cards.\nThe disappointingly small increase of the 4080 over the 2060 Super. In many ways this shows the power of even the base models going back to the RTX 20 series.\nDavinci Resolve is way ahead of the pack in making the most of hardware, but I think this is old news by now, which is why it\u2019s often used to do the transcoding or proxy-making even when the edit is done on Avid or Premiere.\n\nOnly Davinci Resolve showed use of the Nvidia hardware decoder for H.264 and H.265\nAvid rocking the 48 threads of my Threadripper (sadly on decode only).\n\u00a0\nEncoding\nThis was the opposite test: DNxHR to H.264/H.265 \u2013 an example scenario: you are delivering for social media or sending producers/clients an update (I love the built in frame.io Premiere panel for this). Encoding was done using the default settings in each NLE.\n\nWhat I\u2019m seeing here:\n\nAvid really struggles here with its CPU-only approach. Probably better to export as DNx (or whatever your media has been transcoded to) and run it through Shutter Encoder or Resolve.\nPremiere\u2019s use of the hardware encoder (NVENC) thankfully is working, but still Davinci Resolve takes the win.\nThe 4080 brings a bit more to the table here, with a 20% improvement in Premiere and 36% in Resolve for H.265, but you\u2019re paying a lot for that over a lower end card.\n\nDecoding and Encoding at the same time\nThis test represents the situation where you have H.264/H.265 media on your timeline and export to the same for review or social.\n\nWhat I\u2019m seeing:\n\nAvid struggles for the same reasons mentioned above.\nResolve has a greater lead here (may or may not change with updated drivers \u2013 I have seen in the past Premiere not able to use NVDEC and NVENC at the same time).\nVery little gain here in Premiere for the higher end card.\n\nThus far, it has to be said the far greater cost of the 4080 has not proved worthwhile.\nWhere the RTX 4080 shines \u2013 more VRAM, better AI, raw power & AV1\n\n8K. If I want to be ready to deal with 8K media, I need more than the 8GB of VRAM that the 2060 Super has. 10GB would be the bare minimum and that would assume closing all other programs that might use some of it up. All three NLEs completely failed to deal with an 8K RED test clip with the 2060 Super \u2013 they all crashed. All three managed it with the 16GB VRAM of the 4080, albeit slowly. Of course there are cheaper options here to get a bit more VRAM \u2013 not least the 3060 12GB version. It will be interesting to see how much VRAM each RTX 4000 card has. AMD are bit more generous in that department \u2013 another reason why this could be their year to shine, though for such a long time NLEs have run better on the CUDA based Nvidia cards, it\u2019s more likely that will continue.\n\n\n\nNeat Video. Until Premiere comes with built in noise reduction (hint hint), Neat Video is my go to. I was finding even 4K timelines with Neat were sometimes crashing Premiere or even Windows itself and the 4080 has made a massive difference to the stability of using Neat. It has a decent speed increase too, though not as much as I\u2019d hoped.\n\n\n\nTopaz Video AI. I gave it a nasty test here \u2013 2x upscale plus stabilisation plus 4x slow-mo, all at the same time \u2013 thus the tiny FPS scores. The 4x increase in speed is impressive here and would mean massive time savings on lengthy upscaled clips.\n\n\n\nDavinci Resolve noise reduction and Magic Mask. Noise reduction in Resolve is a common task and a 3x increase in speed here is extremely welcome. The 5x increase in the AI based magic mask tool, while not common, is at least something that shows some of the advanced tech under the hood being used to great effect.\n\n\n\nAV1. AV1 is the next in line to H.264 and H.265 \u2013 even smaller files for the same quality. The RTX 40 series brings AV1 hardware if you need it, which you most likely don\u2019t \u2013 yet.\n\n\u00a0\nExport AV1 with Davinci Resolve and an RTX 40 series card (as well as the latest from AMD and Intel).\nConclusion\nSo who would benefit from the RTX 4080? Realistically not that many people. Certainly not the Avid-only editor, you should stick with a recommended Quadro card (though Avid works fine with the 40 series). Nor the Premiere editor who never deals with more graphically intensive tasks \u2013 you\u2019d be paying a lot for a small increase in performance. And not even the editor who needs more than 8GB VRAM \u2013 you\u2019d be better of with say a 3060 12GB or waiting for next year\u2019s 4000 series cards. And what about the heavy Davinci Resolve user \u2013 perhaps after all you might push your budget to buy the 4090 or ideally two!\nBut if you are a power user and happen to not have the budget (or space) for a 4090 then the 4080 may be for you. It is an expensive card for what it brings, but the time it saves you & the stability it brings to intensive plugins may well be worth it. I also think its full potential is still to come (update \u2013 see my post here for much faster export times in Davinci Resolve).\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport ProVideo Coalition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShop with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmtools\nFilmmakers go-to destination for pre-production, production & post production equipment!\nShop Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgpu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia RTX 4080\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treview\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReviews\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat Do You Think?

accelerate the use of AI to improve financial services\nCompanies developing a range of applications, including intelligent avatars, speech AI, and fraud detection\nDeutsche Bank and NVIDIA to develop applications to improve risk management, boost efficiency and enhance customer service using NVIDIA AI Enterprise software\nPartnership will expand the bank\u2019s internal AI center of excellence to develop, foster and promote Explainable and Responsible AI in the financial services industry\n\nDeutsche Bank today announced a multi-year innovation partnership with NVIDIA to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the financial services sector.\nCombining Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial industry expertise with NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI and accelerated computing will hasten the development of a broad range of regulatory-compliant AI-powered services. The partnership will support Deutsche Bank\u2019s cloud transformation journey, for example by using AI and ML to simplify and accelerate cloud migration decisions.\n\u201cAI, ML and data will be a game changer in banking, and our partnership with NVIDIA is further evidence that we are committed to redefining what is possible for our clients,\u201d said Christian Sewing, CEO, Deutsche Bank.\n\u201cThis partnership is a significant step forward in our AI and ML ambitions. It will help us take a leading position in the usage of these technologies in financial services,\u201d added Bernd Leukert, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Management Board Member responsible for Technology, Data and Innovation.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and AI are at a tipping point, and we\u2019re bringing them to the world\u2019s enterprises through the cloud,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \u201cEvery aspect of future business will be supercharged with insight and intelligence running at the speed of light. Together with Deutsche Bank, we are modernizing and reimagining the way financial services are operated and delivered.\u201d\nThe collaboration follows months of exploratory work in which the companies tested a number of potential use cases, with a focus on three in particular: risk model development, high-performance computing, and the creation of a branded virtual avatar.\nNext-generation risk management through accelerated compute\nAccelerated computing enables traders to manage risk and run more scenarios faster and at scale while also improving energy efficiency. Supported by NVIDIA\u2019s AI, ML and accelerated compute knowledge, the partnership will enrich Deutsche Bank\u2019s leadership in risk management, improve efficiency and enhance customer service.\nTo enable this work, Deutsche Bank plans to leverage NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end software suite for streamlining AI development and deployment that can run in the cloud or in the data center. With this flexibility, Deutsche Bank\u2019s AI developers, data scientists and IT professionals will be able to run NVIDIA AI workflows on-premises as well as on Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank\u2019s public cloud provider.\u00a0\nRedefining customer service with interactive avatars\nDeutsche Bank is working to develop next-generation user experiences with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, an open computing platform for building and operating metaverse applications, and AI models and services that makes it easier to build and customize lifelike virtual assistants and digital humans.\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse, the bank\u2019s teams have developed an early concept of a 3D virtual avatar aimed at helping employees navigate internal systems and respond to HR-related questions. Future use cases will explore immersive experiences with banking clients.\nDeriving insights out of unstructured data\nExtracting key information from unstructured data has long been a challenge for organizations, especially those in financial services. Existing large language models do not perform well on financial texts. Deutsche Bank and NVIDIA are testing a collection of large language models called Financial Transformers. These will run AI and ML models and achieve outcomes such as early warning signs on the counterparty of a financial transaction, faster data retrieval and identifying data-quality issues.\nThe innovation partnership is an integral part of Deutsche Bank\u2019s ongoing technology transformation. Deutsche Bank will expand an internal AI center of excellence, accelerated through the partnership, to support the experimentation and development of AI and ML services and professional skills development.

They used the musical notes from that sample and applied them to the digital voice of TJ to make the avatar sing the same notes and with the same rhythm as the original singer.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Generative AI \u2013 Audio2Face, Audio2Gesture Enable Realistic Facial Expressions, Body Movements\nThen the team used NVIDIA Omniverse ACE along with Omniverse Audio2Face and Audio2Gesture technologies to generate realistic facial expressions and body movements for the animated performance based on TJ\u2019s audio alone.\nWhile the team behind Omniverse ACE technologies spent years developing and fine-tuning the technology showcased in the performance, turning the music track they created into a polished video took just hours.\nToy Jensen Delights Fans With \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 Performance\nThat gave them plenty of time to ensure an amazing performance.\nThey even collaborated with Jochem van der Saag, a composer and producer who has worked with Michael Bubl\u00e9 and David Foster, to create the perfect backing track for TJ to sing along to.\n\u201cWe have van der Saag composing the song, and he\u2019s gonna also orchestrate it for us,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cSo that\u2019s a really great addition to the team. And we\u2019re really excited to have him on board.\u201d\nACE Could Revolutionize Virtual Experiences\nThe result is the perfect showcase for NVIDIA Omniverse ACE and the applications it could have in various industries \u2014 for virtual events, online education and customer service, as well as in creating personalized avatars for video games, social media and virtual reality experiences. NVIDIA Omniverse ACE will be available soon to early-access partners.\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Besides, didn\u2019t many of us turn to gardening during the pandemic as a hobby? There\u2019s also research that having plants around can help cool the environment, and we might even save some money by eating what we grow. NParks also distributed seed packets to households for us to start growing our own edibles!  In any case, we\u2019ve written at length on greenery, whether it\u2019s within or around our homes: Plant Nursery in Singapore: 6 Benefits Of Keeping Indoor Plants Growing Indoor Plants and Vegetables: 8 Ways to Make Your Home and Neighbourhood Greener Instead of Flowers, Give Your Beau These Useful Houseplants Everything You Need To Know About Urban Farming in Singapore  Now let\u2019s turn our focus to the area outside our home \u2013 literally the green gateway, or corridor garden \u2013 and how some folks with green fingers in Singapore (maybe your neighbours as well!) have been cultivating this common space with care. 1. Flower Power in Toa Payoh    Francine, a long-time resident of Toa Payoh, started her HDB corridor garden in early 2022. Since then, under the care of her amazing green fingers, the space has literally bloomed, with colourful flowers and a variety of plants that include Queen of Night, Inchplant, Begonia Rose,\u00a0 Desert Rose, Kampong Rose, Jasmine, Pandan plant, Hibiscus and Air plant.    She says, \u201cI decided to have a corridor garden because it\u2019s a healthy hobby and it\u2019s great for seniors. Doing gardening is also a form of exercise as you need to attend to the plants daily.\u201d    For those keen to begin, Francine advises that they start small and increase their collection gradually, as she did. Her first plants were a few pots of hibiscus and orchids, after which she slowly expanded with other leafy and flowering plants. 2. Gorgeous Urban Jungle  We were enthralled by this perfectly framed shot, which featured the popular Monstera deliciosa, Anthurium vittariifolium, Philodendron billietiae, Rhaphidophora tetrasperma and even a Vanda orchid. This plant parent also has a cat, so she needs to ensure that her kitty knows not to chew on her plants, and to be mindful of not growing \u2013 or keeping out of reach \u2013 plants that are potentially poisonous to her pet. 3. Captivating Corridor  We are also mighty impressed by this HDB corridor jungle, which looks so lush, like it belongs in Gardens by the Bay. It\u2019s no simple feat, as commentators have said, \u201cI tried growing my corridor\u2026 Wah, disaster. Lack of sun, and windy like 24/7. Nothing grows.\u201d   Story continues To this, the plant parent replied, concurring, \u201cYes, it is a real struggle for me too. I get some direct evening sun for only a few months and I have failed with some plants that need that extra light or humidity.\u201d4. For Nourishment and Love for NatureHDB corridor gardener Shirley grows a mixture of edibles and non-edibles, such as kailan, pandan, tomato, Philodendron red congo, orchids, round eggplants, tangerine, Thai basil, Aglaonema, and more.In addition to posting photos of the blooms and edibles she harvests for her meals, Shirley also shares care tips for certain plants and even why she chooses to grow a certain edible.\u201cOne good thing about growing kai lan is that no birdies want to eat their young leaves! Unlike my Bayam seedlings and capsicum seedlings,\u201d she remarks in another post.5. Inspo Outside Your Door  For Angela, her HDB corridor garden began during the pandemic. She recalls, \u201cAfter being stuck at home during the Circuit Breaker, I decided to get some indoor house plants to beautify my home and corridor. It made me happy to open my door and see my plants thriving and growing.\u201dIndeed, it is a joy, not just for herself, but for fellow neighbours who drop by and admire her small but neat and well-maintained corridor garden.6. Gardens by the CorridorWith a hashtag as cute (and as apt) as #gardensbythecorridor, we have to give props to this plant parent who arranges his babies on a plant rack and even has a name for the space where he places those he has propagated successfully (Propagation University).As for his remark on \u201caccidentally\u201d purchased plants, we\u2019re sure many fellow plant parents can relate to that!7. So Attractive, Even Bees Came!For this Pasir Ris resident, his #gardensbythebalcony was growing so lush that it attracted bees to build a huge beehive that caused the wooden structure on his balcony to give way. In fact, that\u2019s not the only rare occurrence this gardener has experienced \u2013 with his green fingers, he\u2019s also managed to coax a Stapelia gigantea (also known as carrion flower) to bloom.8. Mini Garden of LoveFor this HDB-dwelling couple, they maintain a mini garden outside their love nest, along the corridor. It\u2019s modest (and what many of us have), but what stands out is their choice of plants which makes this green space look aesthetically pleasing. There\u2019s even a small tree!Speaking of which, this Instagram account documents the time when a mama bird decided to build her nest in their tree \u2013 eggs were laid and they even hatched! This goes to show the wonders of nature that can happen right in one\u2019s HDB corridor garden.Tips on Growing Plants in SingaporeIf you\u2019re thinking of embarking on your plant-growing journey, there\u2019s no better time than to start now. We\u2019ve seen HDB corridor gardeners grow, harvest and eat their own edibles \u2013 this not only means we can save some money on food but growing food locally is part of Singapore\u2019s 30 by 30 Green Plan.In addition, for those with little ones in the household, showing them how much care and time goes into growing their favourite vegetable from seed helps them appreciate how precious food is. This, in turn, could translate to our future generation being mindful of food waste, for a more sustainable Singapore.For those of us in the midst of searching for our dream home, becoming fully-fledged plant parents also means you might want to look for a property that\u2019s plant-friendly. Once we have the infrastructure, we can go the extra mile and be more sustainable at home by making our own compost for gardening from leftover food scraps, growing our own herbs and more.For new plant parents, Angela and Francine also have some useful tips they\u2019ve gleaned during their own journey.\u201cI water my plants once every few days. A plus point is that my corridor is bright but not exposed to direct sunlight, so my plants are pretty easy to maintain,\u201d Angela shares.\u201cI water my garden twice a day but have to be mindful of certain plants that do not like too much water, such as the Begonia Rose and Queen of Night. Like humans, plants also need nutrients so you need to fertilise them weekly. Check plants for pests like mealy bugs, white flies, spider mites, snails, etc. If any of these pests are present, you need to treat the plant immediately as they can spread to neighbouring plants. Remove weeds if any,\u201d Francine adds.Rules on Growing Plants in HDB CorridorGrowing plants in your HDB corridor should not just be a show of how big and bountiful your garden can be \u2013 we should also be mindful of our neighbours, as well as rules for using this shared space.For instance, the same rules that apply to HDB common areas apply. Don\u2019t put your big pots of plants at the HDB staircase landing as that should remain unobstructed at all times (yes, even if the sunlight there is fantastic). Remember that you also shouldn\u2019t block access to the staircase, even if it seems no one is using it anyway.Along the common corridor, ensure that there\u2019s at least a 1.2m wide clearance for people, rescue equipment and fellow neighbours who may use wheelchairs to pass. For those who live in flats where the common corridor is less than 1.2m wide, we\u2019re sorry, but you can\u2019t put anything there at all. Time to move your plant babies inside, or perhaps find a more spacious plant-friendly flat on PropertyGuru?Do also ensure that the items you store in your common corridor aren\u2019t things that can easily catch fire, such as carton boxes and other papers.NParks has also come up with a handbook on good corridor gardening practices. These include making sure your planters and racks are securely fastened, not putting your plant pots on the parapet walls (you might be fined for high-rise littering or even killer litter should the pots fall), and ensuring they do not breed mosquitoes (you can be penalised by NEA when they come round to inspect).Basically, just remember to keep your HDB corridor garden neat and orderly, don\u2019t obstruct the way and don\u2019t introduce any potential hazards (even plants with sharp thorns or climbing plants that may loosen your windows or gates can be potential issues).\u201cAs the corridor is for common use, you need to ensure that there is a 1.2m space (a requirement by Town Council) especially if you have elderly neighbours who use the wheelchair. It\u2019s not advisable to drill holes in the ceiling of your corridor to hang plants as this could be hazardous as well,\u201d Francine advises.\u201cI check that the plant dish does not collect water to prevent mozzies from breeding. I also clean the area frequently to ensure no dried leaves are left behind,\u201d Angela mentions.Now you\u2019re all ready to give your green fingers a whirl!For more property news, content and resources,\u00a0check out\u00a0PropertyGuru\u2019s guides section.\u00a0Looking\u00a0for a new home?\u00a0Head to\u00a0PropertyGuru to browse the top properties for sale in Singapore.\u00a0Need help financing your latest property purchase?\u00a0Let the mortgage experts at PropertyGuru Finance\u00a0help you find the best deals.\u00a0\u00a0  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s rumored RTX 4070 Ti has been the subject of yet more leakage, again from a graphics card maker. This time we\u2019ve been treated to spilled images of PNY\u2019s cards, and the full specs of the 4070 Ti \u2013 which will come as a relief to those who were concerned about recent chatter regarding a big slash in the CUDA Core count.This latest rumor aired by VideoCardz \u2013 and let\u2019s remember, it is just a rumor, albeit one backed up with a whole bunch of images of PNY\u2019s RTX 4070 Ti models \u2013 shows its Verto boards, which have identical specs to the previous leak from Colorful: 2,310MHz base clock, 12GB GDDR6X VRAM (192-bit bus).What we\u2019re told additionally by the PNY leakage is that the boost clock is 2,610MHz, and we get that crucial CUDA Core loadout, which is 7,680.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI can't tell if it's just a coincidence, but Nvidia's RTX 5070 is now reportedly set for March alongside AMD's RDNA 4 series launch\n\n\n\n\nThe end of the Nvidia RTX 4000 series is nigh \u2013 with the RTX 4070 expected to sell out in weeks\n\n\n\nAll of this is exactly the same spec as the canceled RTX 4080 12GB, down to the last detail, including the exact same clock frequencies, so to put it another way \u2013 this again underlines that Nvidia has slapped the RTX 4070 Ti badge on the ditched lower-tier RTX 4080 graphics card.Analysis: Hopeful signs \u2013 let\u2019s just keep our fingers crossed for pricingIt\u2019s not like this wasn\u2019t expected, but what we also anticipated was that Nvidia might change things up a bit somewhere, just to show that it has done at least something to tune and make this a slightly different GPU to the one that unceremoniously got the boot. You know, tweak the clock speeds just a touch maybe.Or as some suggested, cut the CUDA Cores a bit, or even a lot, because as we mentioned at the outset, there was a recent rumor that the 4070 Ti would slash the core count to 5,888 cores, a big drop from the full 7,680. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that can\u2019t happen \u2013 maybe the earlier rumor is right. But this new one is weightier, coming from a retailer, complete with a bunch of images to give it more substance; though still, we must remain cautious around either possibility.What could be the case is that the leaker who floated the 5,888 cores idea has heard info that actually pertains to the RTX 4070, the vanilla version \u2013 but we\u2019re into the territory of pure guesswork here.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If you\u2019re thinking: why would Nvidia need to tweak the RTX 4070 Ti to make it different to the banished 4080 12GB? Well, it\u2019s to do with the price mainly. The previous thinking was that if Nvidia pitches the 4070 Ti a chunk lower than the $899 price tag of the 4080 12GB, then it\u2019ll have people asking \u2013 why on earth was the latter unveiled with that asking price, then, if the 4070 Ti is pretty much the exact same card?What it appears that Nvidia might be doing instead is cutting the price of the existing RTX 4080 16GB, something that\u2019s needed for a number of reasons, stoking flagging sales being one of them, and competing better with the freshly unleashed AMD RX 7900 XTX, which (mostly) edges out the RTX 4080 at a lower price point (for gamers, anyway, ray tracing aside). Once the 4080 16GB costs less, then a cheaper price tag for the 4070 Ti compared to the canceled 4080 12GB obviously makes sense, even if it\u2019s the same spec.Clearly, Nvidia needs to do something to counterattack against the strong initial impression made by the 7900 XTX and making the RTX 4080 more competitive, then bringing in some upper-mid-range ammo in the form of a more affordable 4070 Ti, seems a likely plan. Then again, in the GPU world, sometimes sense goes out the window, so we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. The rumored release date for the RTX 4070 Ti is January 5, so the graphics card is theoretically just a few weeks away now.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

(Picture: HDB) SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - The November 2022 Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise closed on Dec 2 with 24,562 applications received, according to data released by HDB. HDB is offering 9,655 flats for sale under the exercise, making it the largest offering to date for a single launch.  Read also:\u00a0HDB offers 9,655 BTOs in largest sales exercise to combat soaring resale prices and rents The number of applications received works out to an overall application rate of 2.5. This is lower than the 7.8 application rate registered for the August 2022 BTO sales exercise, when 39,136 applications were received for 4,993 launched flats. Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, notes that the number of applications in November fell by 37.2% compared to the August exercise. \u201cThis is the lowest overall BTO application rate since September 2019 with an application ratio of 2.1,\u201d she highlights. Sun attributes the lower number of applicants to a few reasons, including buyer demand being diverted to the Sale of Balance Flats (SBF). Citing data released by HDB, she points out that 25,350 applications were received for the 1,071 SBF units available in the November sales exercise, translating to an application rate of 23.7. According to Sun, the stronger demand for SBF units points to a preference by buyers for flats with a shorter completion period. \u201cMost SBF flats may be completed faster than newly launched BTO flats in the same town since they are launched in earlier phases,\u201d she remarks.\u00a0(Find HDB flats for rent or sale with our Singapore HDB directory)     Other reasons for the lower BTO applications may include the cooling measures that came into effect on Sept 30. According to Sun, some buyers may be anticipating prices in the resale market to fall, and are thus holding back on purchasing a BTO flat in order to buy a completed home in the secondary market. The highest application rates in the November BTO exercise were recorded for the three- and four-room flats under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) Model project in the mature Kallang/Whampoa estate. 4,561 applications were received for the 405 four-room flats available, which works out to an application rate of 11.3. For the three-room flats, 550 applications were received for the 72 units launched, translating to a 7.6 application rate.

Story continues Nonetheless, OrangeTee & Tie\u2019s Sun highlights that PLH flats in Kallang/ Whampoa were more popular than those in Queenstown, possibly due to their closer proximity to the downtown core. \u201cThis indicates that there could be some buyer resistance if the boundaries of PLH model flats are pushed too far inland, and not everyone is willing to trade a further location for a long minimum occupation period,\u201d she observes.Among the non-mature estates in the launch, which comprises Bukit Batok, Tengah and Yishun, five-room flats in Tengah saw the highest\u00a0interest, with 2,849 applications received for the 670 units available, or an application rate of 4.3. Huttons\u2019 Lee attributes this to buyers seeking bigger units, which provide more flexibility to accommodate hybrid work and home-based learning activities. \u201cTengah has consistently attracted many applicants for its sustainability theme and proximity to major employment centres in Jurong East Regional Centre and Jurong Innovation District,\u201d he adds.  From a full-year perspective, OrangeTee & Tie\u2019s Sun highlights that the total number of applicants for all BTO and SBF sales exercises this year\u00a0clocked in at 167,119, 16.3% higher than the 143,706 applicants logged in 2021. In terms of BTO launches, the number of applicants increased by 22.6% y-o-y in 2022 to 117,251, while the number of SBF applicants increased by 3.7% y-o-y to 49,868.From a supply standpoint, the number of BTO units launched this year jumped by 35.5% y-o-y to 23,184 units, while SBF units launched fell 29.6% y-o-y to 3,023 units. Altogether, units launched in 2022 totalled 26,207 flats, up 22.5% y-o-y.Check out the latest listings near Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown, Bukit Batok, Tengah, YishunSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) November BTO launch: Our in-depth analysis HDB offers 9,655 BTOs in largest sales exercise to combat soaring resale prices and rents Owners of Ang Mo Kio Sers flats to get 7.5% higher compensation than earlier estimates  En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

At least, that's what we all thought when it came out. Now, the GeForce RTX 4090 has hit the market and made the last-gen \"BFGPU\" look positively puny. High-end graphics cards are getting bigger, and have been for some time. Gigabyte's Aorus Twitter account decided to poke some fun at the trend with a wacky tweet, pictured below.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nEmbedded in the tweet was the image at the top of the page, which you can click to see in higher resolution. Jokes aside, it appears to be some kind of industrial cooler or ventilator, but the three large axial fans arranged in a line with their rectangular casing definitely gives the impression of a gigantic graphics card. Comically, it appears that it's being installed at or near a power station of some kind.\n\nGPUs are getting bigger because their power requirements are going up. More power means more heat, and that means you need more mass to dissipate the energy. As for why graphics processors are pulling more power, it has to do with diminishing returns from foundry advancements. To keep the pace of performance increases steady as progress slows and die shrinks offer less and less benefit, it becomes necessary to make ever-larger GPUs that draw more and more power.\n\n\nNVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, says manufacturing costs have risen faster than performance gains.\n\r\nThat's exactly the reasoning that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang used when he declared Moore's Law to be dead. Moore's Law is the colloquial name for an observation by Intel founder Gordon Moore that peak transistor count roughly doubles every two years. Ironically, the GeForce RTX 4090 packs well more than double\u2014nearly triple\u2014the transistors of the GeForce RTX 3090 that precedes it by about two years. Still, Huang credits much of Ada Lovelace's performance uplift to AI and other advancements, rather than process tech alone.\n\r\nAorus credits the meme idea to /u/AngryPotato8 on Reddit, although the image has been a popular (if low-effort) meme post on the PC Master Race subreddit for a while now. If you're feeling fatigued over thousand-dollar 350-watt-plus graphics cards, know that AMD and NVIDIA, having launched their halo products, will be focused on mid-range and high-end products for the foreseeable future. Hopefully we see some impressively-efficient GPUs in the first half of next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, Gigabyte, graphics cards, Humor, Aorus, (nasdaq:nvda), meme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing...\nBeep-Beep!

ShopBack has raised US$200 million ($270.08 million) in an oversubscribed Series F round. The final close comes after US$30 million in equity capital via a strategic investment from Australian bank Westpac Banking Corporation. This follows an earlier announcement of ShopBack\u2019s US$160 million Series F tranche from Asia Partners and 65 Equity Partners, among others.  The raise will support the Group\u2019s growth efforts across the Asia Pacific as it gears up for the public markets, says ShopBack on Dec 8. \u201cAs part of the equity investment, the rewards platform has also entered into a partnership with the Australian bank that will enable Westpac\u2019s customers to gain access to exclusive offers and deals when they shop via ShopBack,\u201d adds the company. Steve Rubenstein, Westpac\u2019s managing director of consumer finance, says: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be investing in one of Asia Pacific\u2019s leading shopping and rewards platforms, which will help our Australian customers get bonus cashback and rewards at participating merchants when spending online. With more customers choosing to shop online, we\u2019ll also be exploring new ways to expand on this offering within Westpac\u2019s digital channels.\u201d The funds will also be invested into launching new shopping products for users, developing growth and payments solutions for merchant partners, extending its services to more markets and building capabilities for public market readiness, adds the company.  Henry Chan, co-founder and CEO of ShopBack Group, says: \u201c\u201cThe outcome of the Group\u2019s Series F raise has far exceeded our own expectations, given the volatility in the capital markets and challenging macroeconomic environment.\u201d Chan adds: \u201cWestpac\u2019s investment underscores the herculean efforts put in by the ShopBack Australia team in establishing our brand as the leading shopping and rewards app in Australia. This partnership with Westpac will accelerate our efforts to bring the rewarding ShopBack experience to more Australian consumers. We are excited and look forward to a fruitful and fulfilling partnership.\u201d Founded in 2014, the platform has expanded to 10 markets across Southeast Asia, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan. In 2020, the company raised US$75 million from Temasek, Rakuten and East Ventures. In 2021, ShopBack bought buy now, pay later platform Hoolah. With the latest close, ShopBack has raised around US$355 million. In January, the company launched ShopBack Pay with over 5,000 merchant outlets between Singapore and Australia. In August, it launched its cashback service in Hong Kong.   Story continues ShopBack also hired chief technology officer San Oo from communications giant Slack Technologies, its commercial managing director Alessio Romeni, formerly chief revenue officer of fashion e-commerce platform Zalora, and global accounts managing director Alexander Yardley, who previously headed up commercial leadership roles at Agoda and eBay.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Experian appointed to perform creditworthiness checks on buy now, pay later users $2,000 debt limit for buy now, pay later users and credit information sharing under new code of conduct ShopBack leverages Forter to grow securely Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

The bear markets there have lasted for almost two years and no one knows if the worst is over. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) touched its 1997 handover levels of around 15,000, but has rebounded recently to close at around the 20,000 level.  Sad to say, It has come almost a full circle after a quarter of a century. If you are a contrarian investor and enjoy looking for bargains,, you may consider buying one or more of the ETFs listed below. A note of caution, though. You should consider the risks carefully and prepare to hold them for years if need be. 1. The Tracker Fund of Hong Kong (HKSE: 2800) When the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) and stock market were under immense attack from speculators during the Asian Financial Crisis, the Hong Kong government made an unprecedented move to buy up many stocks. The portfolio of stocks they bought in 1998 was the predecessor of The Tracker Fund of Hong Kong. Today, the Tracker Fund tracks the Hang Seng Index (HSI). Since its inception in 1969, HSI has had 33 or fewer constituents, with HSBC (HKSE: 0005, LON: HSBA) as one of its largest components. For many years, the storied bank was popular with many Hong Kongers as its loyal and long term investors. In 2021, the manager of HSI announced its biggest revamp yet \u2013 the plan was to increase the constituents quarterly, to eventually bring the total number to 100.  Currently, there are over 70 constituents. Over the past decade, the proportion of Chinese companies has increased at the expense of Hong Kong companies in the HSI. Right now, three of the top five companies are Chinese companies: Tencent (HKSE: 0700), Alibaba (HKSE: 9988) and Meituan (HKSE: 3690). 2. ChinaAMC CSI 300 Index ETF (HKSE: 3188) This ETF follows the CSI 300 Index which is a market capitalization-weighted index. It covers the top 300 companies listed in both the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. This China stock market index is equivalent to the S&P 500 Index in the US and is widely followed by both institutional and retail investors. The top holdings of this ETF include Kweichow Moutai (SHA: 600519), Ping An Insurance (SHA: 601318), BYD (SHE: 002594) and China Merchants Bank (SHA: 600036). 3. Hang Seng China Enterprises Index ETF (HKSE: 2828) The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) reflects the overall performance of China companies listed in Hong Kong. Just like the HSI, there is a maximum cap of 8% for any company to avoid single stock concentration. The top holdings for this ETF include Meituan, Tencent, Alibaba, China Construction Bank (SHA: 601939) and China Mobile (SHA: 600941).   Story continues 4. CSOP Hang Seng Tech Index ETF (HKSE: 3033)Hang Seng Tech Index is the newest index among the five listed in this article.It was launched just two years ago in 2020.It consists of 30 largest technology companies listed in Hong Kong.Some of its holdings include Xiaomi (SEHK: 1810), Sunny Optical (HKSE: 2382) and JD Health International (HKSE: 6618).It has been on a roller-coaster ride since its inception: rising to 11,000 in February 2021 and crashing to below 3000 in October 2022.5. CSOP SZSE ChiNext ETF (HKSE: 3147)In October 2009, ChiNext Index was launched on the ShenZhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) with 28 companies.This index is considered by some to be the Nasdaq of China, comprising many fast-growing technology companies.Just like Hang Seng Tech Index, ChiNext Index is volatile and not for the faint-hearted.Ironically, if you prefer an ETF with exposure to only Hong Kong companies, you\u2019ll have to look at iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (NYSEARCA: EWH) listed in the US.Some familiar Hong Kong companies in this ETF include AIA Group (HKSE: 1299), Hong Kong Exchange (HKSE: 0388), CK Hutchison (HKSE: 0001), Link REIT (HKSE: 0823) and MTR Corp (HKSE: 0066).Over the past year, some of my Singaproean friends ventured into the Hong Kong stock market for the first time.All of them bought Alibaba\u2019s (HKSE: 9988) stock.Instead of a single stock, they could have bought the Hang Seng Tech Index ETF with Alibaba as one of its top holdings.While we can\u2019t be sure if the return of this ETF is better than Alibaba in the future, the risk is undoubtedly a lot lower.While Alibaba is a big and profitable company, it will never be safer than a basket of 30 companies.If you\u2019re looking to invest in 2023, our latest FREE report can guide you.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

You can skip our detailed analysis of scientific progress, the consequent technological benefits and 21st century scientific trends, and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Science.\u00a0 Science is the greatest tool required to solve some of the biggest problems humanity faces. Recently, the US Department of Energy announced a breakthrough in fusion energy. It was a net-gain in the energy output compared to the input energy that was used to heat the fuel source.\u00a0 The breakthrough is likely to result in increasing investment in fusion energy, accelerating further understanding and if the engineering and economic challenges are not great enough, it might lead to an effective fusion power plant by 2030.\u00a0 Economics of Science Progress in pure sciences results in the increase in technological output. For instance, the rocket equation, Kepler\u2019s three laws of planetary motion and Newton\u2019s laws of motion and gravitation together make space travel possible. Engineers use these laws for calculations relating to rocket design, its orbital mechanics and trajectory corrections.  Technological growth, on the other hand, leads to greater economic output. In this sense, pure science is indirectly correlated to economic growth.\u00a0 In fact, it has been shown that correlation coefficient for Total-Factor-Productivity (TFP) and long-term economic growth in advanced economies is a strong 0.60, with technological output being one of the three main factors in TFP.\u00a0 Scientific Infrastructure\u00a0 Scientific research used to be limited to academia. However, as societies have become more complex, the infrastructure for scientific R&D has also evolved, incorporating non-academic government institutes and private/public corporations as well.\u00a0 This is especially true in research surrounding AI. While research in the field is dominated by academia, corporate research comprises a meaningful 19.2% of the total AI papers published globally. In China and the EU, the second major share in AI-research comes from non-academic governmental institutes, at 15.6% and 17.2%, respectively.\u00a0 Scientific Trends, and Corporations/Institutes Dominating Them\u00a0 Going by the papers published by academic institutes and corporations, AI and biotechnology are the fastest growing scientific fields in the world. On Academic front, Harvard University, Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dominate research in the US, with fractional-counts of 70.67, 39.85 and 37.69, respectively, in papers published in the Nature journal in 2018.   Story Continues On the corporate front, tech corporations like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominate R&D in AI.\u00a0Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), through its subsidiary DeepMind, has designed deep learning algorithms like AlphaFold and AlphaTensor. The former has solved 98.5% of human proteins\u2019 structures, which was a major problem for half a century.\u00a0AlphaTensor, on the other hand, is designed to find novel methods for matrix multiplications, and is expected to speed up computers through discovery of new algorithms.\u00a0On the other hand, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Novo Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are some of the prominent corporate names in biotechnology.\u00a0Some of the biggest advances in science are happening in countries like the United States and Germany.\u00a0  Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of most advanced countries in science, we\u2019ve ranked them based on the h-index score for their papers in 2021. The h-index measures the aggregate impact of scholarly output. An h-index of 20 implies that for all publications by a researcher, 20 of them have been cited by other researchers at-least 20 times.According to Dr. Jorge E. Hirsch, an American physics professor and the pioneer of h-index, an h-index of 20 is usually considered good, 40 is considered outstanding, while an h-index of 60 can be thought of as exceptional.For the number of papers in 2021 and their h index, we\u2019ve sourced the data from SCImago Country Rankings.We\u2019ve also mentioned the respective countries\u2019 top academic institutes. The results come from SCImago Institutions Ranking. Further, we\u2019ve discussed the R&D share of countries\u2019 GDPs and sourced the data from the World Bank.12. SpainNumber of Papers in 2021: 122,688\u00a0Total h-Index Score: 1,073Spain is located in Southern Europe.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics.\u00a0 Robotics refers to the design, manufacturing and utilization of robots for tasks (in hardware and software) that have traditionally been performed by humans.\u00a0 A Robot Takeover Automation has been one of the most noteworthy trends in the world, with 31% businesses having fully automated at-least one business function as of 2020, according to McKinsey.\u00a0 Additionally, businesses that had no plans to automate operations were reduced to 16% in 2020, from 20% in 2018. Further, according to the World Economic Forum, more than half of the jobs in the workflow will be performed by robots and algorithms by 2025.\u00a0  Conventional wisdom suggests that robot-takeover of jobs won\u2019t bode well for human workers. However, it has been argued that the reverse is true, with robots reducing humanity\u2019s physical and mental labor while creating new jobs in the process.\u00a0 The World Economic Forum forecasts suggest that automation will create 97 million new jobs for humans by 2025. Driving Factors Robotics offers various advantages in the workflow including consistent product/service quality in manufacturing, reduction in operating costs and lead times, and higher production output and efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0 Another key driving factor is long-term adaptation to the aging human population. In 2020, the number of people who were 60 years or older, outnumbered children that were less than 5 years of age.\u00a0 Those aged 65 or above, comprised 1 in 11 people in the world in 2019. Their population is projected to reach 1.5 billion in 2050, per the UN figures, with every 1 in 6 people being 65 years or older.\u00a0  Automation and robotics will play an important role to compensate for the availability of fewer people of working age in the coming decades.\u00a0 In fact, the future is being played out in Japan, where people who are aged 65 years or older, make up 29% of the country\u2019s population as of 2021. This has led Japan to early-adopt robotics and automation to remain competitive, with 631 robots for every 10,000 humans in the workforce in the country. The necessity of automation has also made Japan pretty much a superpower in robotics. The country is the largest manufacturer and exporter of industrial robots in 2022.\u00a0 Robotics Industry Outlook The global robotics market is projected to reach $215 billion in value by 2030, growing at a solid CAGR of 23% according to Market Research Future. The industrial automation market, on the other hand, is much bigger but largely overlaps with the robotics market.   Story Continues According to Precedence Research, the automation industry was valued at $197 billion in 2021 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 8.59%, to a market value of $413 billion by 2030.\u00a0Major players in the two sibling industries include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX), Boston Dynamics, Fanuc Corporation (TOKYO:6954.T), Seiko Epson Corporation (TOKYO:6724.T) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM).\u00a0Some of the leading countries in robotics are Japan, Singapore and the US. Below, we list the 12 most advanced countries in robotics.\u00a0   Most Advanced Countries in Robotics  Our MethodologyFor our list of the most advanced countries in robotics, we\u2019ve ranked them based on their technology scene in robotics as well as their level of automation. We\u2019ve used data from the International Federation of Robotics, especially for the robot density in the manufacturing workforce.\u00a0Here are the 12 most advanced nations in robotics.12. ChinaChina, like other East Asian countries, is one of the most advanced countries in robotics. According to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the Chinese market added over 240,000 new robot units in 2021, an increase of 44% as compared to the year 2020.\u00a0The country had 187 robots working in the manufacturing sector for every 10,000 humans in the same year.\u00a0This suggests that a significant number of factories in China have implemented automation technologies, including industrial robots, in their operations.Automation in the country is covering for the labor shortage due to an aging population while also creating new jobs. For instance, 18 professions were announced by the Chinese Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security. One of these included the \u2018Robotics Engineering Technician\u2019, a job for R&D in control algorithms and operating systems for robots.\u00a0Siasun Robot&Automation Co.,Ltd. (SHENZHEN:300024.SZ) is one of the leading robotics companies in China.11. The NetherlandsThe Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe. It is known for high levels of automation as well as numerous robotics companies. As of 2021, the country\u2019s robot density in the manufacturing workflow is 224 robots for every 10,000 human workers, according to the International Federation of Robotics.The Netherlands is one of the pioneers in the most advanced robotics systems to date and is producing leading research from institutes like Radboud University. The country is also implementing AI and robotics technology to modernize industries like Agriculture, with its Wageningen UR\u00a0being the top institute innovating in robotics for agriculture. 10. DenmarkDenmark is a European country in the Scandinavian region. It is one of the most developed countries in terms of science, technology, GDP per Capita and other indicators. As of 2021, Denmark has 234 robots in the manufacturing-sector workforce for every 10,000 humans.\u00a0One of the key players in the Danish robotics industry is the Danish Technological Institute, which conducts research and development in a wide range of areas related to robotics and automation, including collaborative robots, service robots, and manufacturing automation.\u00a0The institute also works closely with industry partners and has a number of commercial projects in development.Another important player in the Danish robotics industry is Universal Robots, a leading manufacturer of collaborative robots (also known as cobots). Based in Odense, Denmark, the company has developed a range of cobots that are used in a variety of applications, including assembly, welding, packaging, and material handling.9. SwitzerlandSwitzerland is ninth on the list of most advanced countries in robotics. There are 240 robots for every 10,000 human workers in the manufacturing industry in the country as of 2021. It is also home to some of the most noteworthy robotics companies in the world, like ANYbotics.\u00a0Some of the key players in the robotics industry in Switzerland include ABB, which is a global leader in industrial robotics and automation, and Swisslog, which specializes in logistics automation solutions.Switzerland is also home to a number of research institutions and universities that are actively involved in robotics research and development. These include the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, which has a well-recognized robotics program. 8. SwedenSweden is another one of the most advanced countries when it comes to robotics. As of 2021, there are 321 robots per 10,000 humans in the manufacturing labor-force in the country.Sweden has a number of research institutions and universities that are involved in automation R&D. These include the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, which has a renowned automation program, and the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, which has a strong focus on automation and control systems.Sweden made headlines for Eve, a lab robot that is extensively used in automating research processes in the country.\u00a0Apart from its own robotics companies, Sweden also benefits from the presence of American companies like Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Cognex Corporation (NYSE:CGNX) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).7. United StatesThe United States is one of the most advanced western nations in robotics. Its robots to human workers ratio is lower than Germany\u2019s, at 274 robots per 10,000 humans, but the country makes up for it with advanced robotics technology.Some of the top tech corporations in the US like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) are highly focused on robotics.Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) primarily develops high-end GPUs, which have been found to have many applications for robotics and machine learning. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX), on the other hand, are two of the premier automation companies in the US with a global presence.\u00a0There has been a record adoption of industrial robots in the US in the past decade. In 2019, however, the trend started slowing down and the decline continued well into 2020, with 8% fewer installations than the previous year. The slow down can largely be attributed to the pandemic and factory closures due to lockdowns. 6. Hong Kong, SARHong Kong has an advanced manufacturing and research infrastructure, which the country has used to advance in robotics among many other fields. There are 304 robots in Hong Kong for every 10,000 human workers as of 2021.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday   State Bank of India shelves $1.7 billion fund raising as yields elevated, sources say MUMBAI (Reuters) -State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, is shelving plans to raise funds this fiscal year, discouraged by elevated bond yields despite a policy rate cut and liquidity boost from the central bank, three sources aware of the matter said on Monday.  The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

There will be names that go bankrupt, but some will roar to new highs. That has us looking for stocks that can rally 1,000%. Buying a stock before it goes up 1,000% is no easy feat. It takes patience, good timing and a bit of luck.  The years 2020 and 2021 were somewhat unusual. Normally, global central bankers do not immediately respond to stock downturns with large amounts of liquidity, helping to fuel markets to new all-time highs. Of course, we are paying the price for that now, but it was not uncommon to see massive gains in a short period of time for many growth stocks between the 2020 lows and early 2021. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Several stocks, however, delivered 1,000% gains between 2010 and 2020. Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) are just a few that come to mind. Let\u2019s look at a few stocks that can gain 1,000% in the next decade.

Some investors may not be interested in DOCN after reading that. They got used to seeing stocks soar 1,000% in less than one year during the pandemic. But such returns were highly abnormal! It normally takes years to generate a gain of that magnitude. But DigitalOcean might be able to soar 1,000%. From its 52-week low, a rally of \u201cjust 400%\u201d would get the shares back to their all-time high near $132.50.  However, we\u2019re talking about a company that is profitable and generates free-cash flow, along with immense revenue growth. If DigitalOcean can keep up that type of momentum, it will eventually be rewarded. Of course, if it drops \u2014 say, to $15 or $20 \u2014 then it will be easier for the shares to soar 1,000%. Stocks With 1,000% Upside Potential: Twilio (TWLO)   The Twilio (TWLO) logo is displayed over a white background on a smartphone screen.   Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) is a controversial stock and for good reason. Many growth investors held its shares for quite some time, and it was one of the first growth stocks to come roaring to life after the Covid-19 selloff. For example, it took less than two months for Twilio stock to nearly triple from its Covid-19 low. Twilio\u2019s stock peaked in February 2021, well ahead of the many high-quality growth stocks that reached their highest points in the fourth quarter of 2021. In hindsight, that was a red flag for TWLO.   Story Continues Twilio\u2019s stock has been falling sharply. It suffered a one-day decline of more than 34% in early November following its earnings and is now down 90% from its highs. I don\u2019t know if or when Twilio\u2019s stock will recover its highs, but the company still provides value to its customers.If it does bounce back to its highs, it will have soared 1,000%.Stocks With 1,000% Upside Potential: Olaplex (OLPX)  Massage chairs  Source: ShutterstockI highlighted Olaplex (NASDAQ:OLPX) earlier this quarter and it has since rallied more than 50%. Now that the shares have dropped again, investors may want to take a second look at them.The shares tumbled 56% in one day after the company cut its guidance and its COO resigned. But I believe that the recent decline of the stock was unjustified.I\u2019ll admit that the news was not favorable for the company. However, the shares were already down 67% from their highs before that news. And after the decline, Olaplex was 87.5% from its all-time high reached in December 2021.Based on the stock\u2019s decline, you would think this company is on the brink of bankruptcy, and that all of its top executives walked out in October. That\u2019s hardly the case, though.In fact,\u00a0 OLPX is profitable, and analysts, on average, expect its revenue to increase 18% this year to $706 million. Analysts\u2019 mean estimate calls for the company\u2019s\u00a0 revenue to grow again next year, while the stock trades at about 12 times this year\u2019s average earnings estimate.If the stock falls to its low again, it may be worth buying as a speculative investment.Ondas (ONDS)  a visualization of Internet communications superimposed on a photo of a city skyline  Source: ShutterstockSpeaking of speculative, Ondas (NASDAQ:ONDS) is without question the most speculative name on this list.\u00a0 Some of these other companies may struggle to generate profits, but all of their top lines are high relative their market capitalizations, and they have good businesses.Ondas could have a good business in the future, but it has not yet blossomed.According to the company, \u201cThe Ondas platform enables wide area intelligent networks for smart grids, smart pipes, smart fields and any other mission critical network that needs internet protocol connectivity.\u201dONDS has a ton of untapped potential revenue, and the rewards for the firms in its industry can be enormous. Ondas has received orders and government approvals, but so far, it\u2019s still an early stage, speculative company.It has a great deal of potential, but\u00a0 it also carries a lot of risk. That combination is reflected in analysts\u2019\u00a0 average estimates\u00a0for ONDS. Their mean estimates calls for $3.2 million of sales this year for ONDs, but almost $25 million next year.But if companies and governments reduce their spending, Ondas\u2019 revenue could end up being significantly below those levels.Snap (SNAP)  Snapchat (SNAP) application on android cell smartphone. Snapchat is a mobile messaging application used to share photos, videos, text, and drawings.  Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we have Snap (NYSE:SNAP). This stock has been hammered and understandably so. When the times are good, the company generates large amounts of ad revenue, and its stock price tends to roar higher. However, when marketing budgets tighten, Snap\u2019s growth sharply decelerates, and the stock tumbles.We can all agree that Meta (NASDAQ:META) has had a pretty bad year, right? It has suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 77%. However, Snap\u2019s shares have done even worse, suffering a total decline of 91%.As a result of that tumble, if Snap ever revisits its highs, it will have logged a 1,000% gain. The fact that the stock rallied over 950% from its Covid-19 low makes me more optimistic about its ability to soar 1,000% going forward. Once companies start spending more on ads again \u2014 and if SNAP stock falls to new, 52-week lows beforehand\u00a0 \u2014 I do think this name could soar in the future.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As expected, the RTX 4070 Ti will feature the same specs as the RTX 4080 12 GB which was 'Un launched' by the green team. We managed to see some performance figures for the 4080 12 GB which showed performance very close to the RTX 3090 Ti and exceeding in RT heavy titles.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingNVIDIA officially leaks and confirms the specs of the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card. (Image Credits: Momomo_US)\nHowever, the benchmarks NVIDIA has shown so far have relied heavily on DLSS3 and the latest ones go one step ahead and use the RT-Overdrive mode when comparing the RTX 4070 Ti to the RTX 3080. With RT-Overdrive enabled, the RTX 4070 Ti ends up to 3.5x faster than the RTX 3080 12 GB graphics card. Even without RT-Overdrive, the card shows nearly 2x gains but these are once again with DLSS 3 (Frame-Generation) enabled.\nNVIDIA claims a 3.5x increase in performance for the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti vs the RTX 3080 12 GB when utilizing RT-overdrive. (Image Credits: Momomo_US)\nNow while these are official performance figures, we want to advise our readers to wait for final reviews that land in the coming week before making their final decisions on whether the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is worth the price and performance or it's better getting something else.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB 'Official' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti will utilize the \"Ada Lovelace\" AD104-400 GPU configuration with 7,680 cores or 60\u00a0 SMs enabled which is the full-fat SKU. The GPU will be packing 48 MB of L2 cache and features a 192-bit bus interface so that's why we are getting up to 12 GB of GDDR6X capacities. The memory is said to be running at 21 Gbps speeds for a memory bandwidth of 504 GB/s. The card is said to be clocked at a 2610 MHz boost clock however the peak frequency will be higher.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB \"Official\" TBP - 285W\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 8 GB \"Official\" TBP - 290W\n\nFor power, the TBP is now set to be rated at 285W which is a 35W decrease versus the RTX 3080 10 GB model and a 5W decrease from the RTX 3070 Ti. The new graphics card is expected to offer better performance than the RTX 3080 but given the specs cut over the 4080 16 GB, there will be a big gap between both models of around 30-40%.\n\nFor power, the TBP is now set to be rated at 285W which is a 35W decrease versus the RTX 3080 10 GB model and a 5W decrease from the RTX 3070 Ti.

If you want to read about some more stocks that members of Congress own, go directly to 5 Stocks That Members of Congress Own. It is no secret that stock trading has generally been considered a side-benefit to winning a seat in the United States Congress. Although these trades by lawmakers were not available to the public for scrutiny before, they have been since 2012, as the STOCK Act of 2012 mandates that lawmakers disclose these trades publicly. An analysis of these trades by the New York Times has found that at least 97 current members of Congress bought or sold stock, bonds or other financial assets that intersected with their congressional work.\u00a0  It is important to clarify that US lawmakers are not banned from investing in any company, including those companies that could be affected by their decisions. However, such calls have grown in the past few years as the trading activities of lawmakers become controversial.\u00a0 Public outrage over congressional stock trading intensified in recent years after revelations that four senators had sold stocks in 2020 after private briefings on the risks of a coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in September 2022 that she would support a floor vote on legislation that would ban members of Congress and their family members from dealing in individual stocks while those lawmakers are in office. Pelosi had earlier gone against such a vote.\u00a0 Some of the top stocks that US Congress members presently own include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), among others. The US Congress has postponed a vote regarding the ban on stock trading for lawmakers until after the midterm elections.\u00a0    Photo by MIKE STOLL on Unsplash Our Methodology The companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US politicians who trade stocks are obliged to file. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Congress members and their families have made in the past few months. The purchases may not have been made by the members themselves but only disclosed on behalf of their families. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at a scatter plot of all of Distillate\u2019s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with the valuation on the vertical axis and free cash \u03f2ow stability on the horizontal axis.\u201d 10. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that enables hosts to offer stays and experiences to guests worldwide. According to the data available publicly, Rep. Jim Langevin bought Airbnb, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cAirbnb, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of our largest detractors from performance in the second quarter. Airbnb is the clear market leader in private rental bookings globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The business is currently firing on all cylinders, with revenue and earnings growth well above our expectations and long-term estimates. It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company. But, Airbnb also grew quickly in 2021 when people were still hesitant to travel and preferred staying close to home. The company\u2019s growth in 2022 is not an easy comparison like it is for online travel agencies (which are more hotel-oriented), airlines, and hotels. Airbnb\u2019s business has outpaced the hotel industry growth by more than 1,250 basis points per year since 2019, showing far more resilience than hotels and online travel agencies. 9.

Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While the integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block\u2019s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.\u201d 7.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas.  The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.  In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population. The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Many investors have been excited about the move, and are looking to follow Buffett's lead.\nBut maybe that's not such a great idea. Apple (AAPL -0.64%) makes up over more thanof Buffett's stock portfolio, and is a top customer of Taiwan Semi. Perhaps Buffett is simply hedging his Apple bet, especially since Taiwan Semi just passed big chipmaking price increases on to customers like Apple.\u00a0\nNevertheless, a huge surge in chip manufacturing is shaping up around the globe, including here in the U.S. Rather than investing in Taiwan Semi stock, give Air Products & Chemicals (APD -2.04%) a serious look first.\u00a0\nA hidden gem amid mountains of silicon?\nAir Products is not a chip manufacturer, nor is it a supplier of any key ingredients in chips like silicon. Rather, the company specializes in industrial gasses, liquified natural gas, and related equipment needed for manufacturing infrastructure. Chip fabrication is a mind-bogglingly complex process. Many chip fabs are customers of Air Products as they tap the company for gasses and energy to power massive fab facilities and manage a complex global supply chain.\u00a0\nAs pointed out in Air Products' earnings presentations this year, Taiwan Semi (which commands over half of the world's chip fab market share) is likely an Air Products customer. Taiwan Semi is trying to localize the production of some of its neon gas (an ingredient in chipmaking). Global supply of neon has come to a grinding halt since Russia's invasion of what was once the world's top producer of the rare gas, Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, while Air Products isn't a pure play on chip manufacturing, it could be a great way to get some chip and technology supply chain exposure in your portfolio.\nThe U.S. and other countries around the world are prioritizing domestic technology (for example with the U.S. CHIPS Act, legislation that will kick in some $52 billion in chip manufacturing and research in the U.S.), and Air Products could have a lot to gain. New facilities being built means more gasses, energy, and equipment will need to be sold.\nAnd a lot of facilities will be built. Various estimates anticipate global chip sales to surpass $1 trillion a year by 2030, up from just over $600 billion in 2022.\u00a0\nA stellar track record of steady and profitable returns\nWhy would an investor choose to invest in a stock like Air Products rather than a chipmaker like Taiwan Semi, especially given the huge growth expectation for the chip industry? Well, semiconductors can be a cyclical investment theme at times, and especially on the chip fab side. As with all manufacturing, chipmaking goes through booms when demand outpaces supply, followed by periods of sales slumps. It can also create some wild fluctuations in stock price that aren't tasteful to many investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a heavy industrial company, Air Products can also go through up-and-down cycles. However, the company has been around a long time, and has carved out a highly profitable and diversified business for itself in the global manufacturing and energy supply chain. It also pays a dividend, which it has consistently increased for decades (the stock is a Dividend Aristocrat). Air Products' total return, which factors in share price increase and dividends paid, has been a steady winner for shareholders.\u00a0\n\nData by YCharts.\nWill Air Products be a winning investment going forward? I believe it will. Besides manufacturing, the company is also a top provider of renewable energy systems and equipment, like hydrogen. Saving money on energy is a top priority for many organizations these days, especially with inflation running hot in the wake of the pandemic. And here too Air Products could be a top supplier for tech and chipmaking.\nIn a recent interview, Nvidia's (NVDA -2.84%) vice president of enterprise computing cited a study that points toward computing technology eventually gobbling up a mid-teens percentage of total global energy consumption, up from a low-single-digit percentage today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Products could thus call chip companies a customer by way of this boom in energy consumption too, not just as a supplier of manufacturing gasses. Add that to a long list of other non-tech customers that rely on Air Products to get continuously more efficient.\nIs Air Products stock a buy right now?\nAir Products stock has outpaced a recent rally in the overall market, rising by nearly 40% from lows in early October to early December. Shares currently trade for just under 32 times trailing 12-month earnings. It's a premium price, one that assumes Air Products will continue putting up market-beating earnings growth for many years.\n\nAt this juncture, I'd be inclined to start slowly dollar-cost averaging into Air Products, rather than investing a large sum all at once. Management anticipates growing earnings by 9% to 12% in 2023, which is not bad considering the world is fretting over a possible recession. And if the company can continue growing earnings at a low-teens percentage over the next decade like it has over the previous one, the current valuation certainly isn't all that \"expensive.\"\u00a0\nHowever, using a discounted cash flow valuation method, at the moment the stock is just a bit over fairly valued assuming a 12% earnings growth rate for the next two years and then 7% earnings growth after that when using a discount rate of 11%.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Products & Chemicals doesn't rank as a top priority stock purchase for me right now. However, if you think chip manufacturing hype is real like I do, keep this company on your radar (or start nibbling in small amounts now) to ride the demand for gas and energy supply chain solutions that will be needed in the years ahead.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Nvidia.

It has advanced new features that all play directly to Nvidia's strengths in terms of hardware-accelerated machine learning, ray tracing, and more.\u00a0It even has, as Nvidia quipped earlier this week, better (or at least more frequently updated) drivers that consistently improve performance and fix hiccups that can hold a graphics card as powerful as an Nvidia Lovelace GPU back from reaching its full potential.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5080 has dethroned AMD's RX 7900 XTX at the same price \u2013 but good luck finding one\n\n\n\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT review: delivering exactly what the market needs with stunning performance at an unbeatable price\n\n\n\nBut somewhere along the way, whether it was a marketing decision that outran engineering or there is some yet-to-be-uncovered, behind-the-scenes supply-chain drama about supply chains that could explain what's happened, the Nvidia RTX 4080 got shanked, and that's truly a shame.\u00a0In the end, though, Nvidia has only itself to blame, and I really hope it learns its lesson before it moves on to the Lovelace cards that most of us will be looking to buy in the new year, even if it can't bring itself to redeem the RTX 4080.The RTX 4080 didn't stumble on its own, it was pushed(Image credit: Future)The Nvidia RTX 4080 is an incredibly powerful graphics card that can play the best PC games at incredibly high frame rates using advanced technologies that only Nvidia seems able to master. Better still, it is also an incredibly powerful creative accelerator for all kinds of content creation, from video editing to 3D modeling and game development.The fact that the AMD RX 7900 XTX edges it out in rasterization performance, which is what 97% of all PC games rely on, isn't even a fatal blow to the card (as much as it is a credit to the team at AMD).\u00a0In my RX 7900 XTX review, I note that AMD's FSR 2.0 delivers a fantastic 4K gaming experience on the highest setting with ray tracing enabled, something that the last generation of AMD graphics cards (including its previous flagship, the RX 6950 XT) really wasn't able to match.I also made a point to say that Nvidia DLSS 3 absolutely smokes FSR 2.0. Where AMD FSR 2.0 might net you 25 extra frames per second on quality settings or 50 more frames per second (or greater) on ultra-performance mode, DLSS 3 with whole-frame generation, rather than the slower per-pixel upscaling of earlier tech, can get you twice or even three times that performance increase in the games that feature it right now.\u00a0It's impressive stuff. Nvidia wasn't lying when it said DLSS would net you more than 100fps in Cyberpunk 2077 with every setting \u2013 including ray tracing \u2013 turned up to 11. Granted, that was on the RTX 4090 (at least in our tests), but on the 4080, you are still seeing the high 80s in terms of fps, which is twice what you'd get with just native-resolution rendering.The problem is that this isn't really the RTX 4080, it's what the RTX 4080 Ti should have been, while the \"unlaunched\" RTX 4080 12GB variant should have been the proper RTX 4080. Nvidia can't undo that terrible marketing decision, but it can make a much-needed change in one area that is still firmly within its control: pricing.\u00a0Read the room, Nvidia(Image credit: AMD)The problem for Nvidia is that it guessed that gamers would still jump at the chance to have an RTX 4080 the second it launched, whatever its ultimate price. In fairness, Nvidia has spent the past two years watching every single one of its graphics cards sell out the second stock was put online, so you can hardly blame it for thinking that the same might be true for the RTX 4080, a card that should have garnered far more interest than Nvidia's flagship RTX 4090.Instead, the RTX 4090 sold out almost immediately, as did the RX 7900 XTX, and you can still find stock of the RTX 4080 in the UK, while scalpers in the US can't sell their ill-gotten RTX 4080 cards even at MSRP. Some retailers are reportedly not letting them return those cards, either, notes Moore's Law is Dead, meaning that they suspect they won't be able to resell them.All of this, honestly, comes down to the price of the RTX 4080. It is 20% more expensive than the RX 7900 XTX and only 25% cheaper than the RTX 4090, and, as I noted in my review, if you are going to drop $1,200 on a graphics card, it makes no sense to settle for the third best graphics card overall, especially when the RX 7900 XTX stacks up pretty well against the RTX 4090.There may have been a time when the $200 price difference between the RX 7900 XTX and the RTX 4080 wouldn't have bothered too many people, but as we head into 2023 with an abundance of inflation and recessionary signals, even big spenders are going to be more conscious of the price of these GPUs. Nvidia seems to have missed that signal, and it has cost them a lot in terms of sales.Of course, Nvidia isn't the biggest manufacturer of RTX 4080 graphics cards, it's third-party partners, and whether Nvidia likes it or not, they are going to start selling their graphics cards for less in order to boost sales. The longer Nvidia keeps the RTX 4080 at its current MSRP, the longer it is really delaying the inevitable. \u00a0Can Nvidia recover?The real question now is whether Nvidia can recover the RTX 4080 in the wake of the RX 7900 XTX's success. I believe it can, but it needs to slash the price of the RTX 4080, and it needs to do so as soon as possible. The longer the RTX 4080 stays at its current price point, the more AMD is going to have the chance to get its cards into the hands of customers.\u00a0This is a zero-sum game since any customer who buys an RX 7900 XTX is not going to then turn around and buy an RTX 4080 a few months later. Once those customers are lost, they are likely lost for another couple of generations.\u00a0Retailers have already sold out their launch inventory of the AMD RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XTs. Nvidia is almost certainly going to be able to restock retailer's inventories first, and after scalpers got burned by the 4080 the first time around, they aren't likely to make a run on these cards for a second time.Cut the price of the RTX 4080 to match the RX 7900 XTX and the RTX 4080 will fly off the shelves as fast as the RX 7900 XTX and RTX 4090 did. But doing so will require Nvidia to actually humble itself, which might be the biggest challenge for the dominant player in the GPU market yet.\u00a0If nothing else, we hope Nvidia has taken the lesson to heart when it releases the next round of graphics cards next year and prices its mainstream GPUs at a price point that the rest of us can actually afford. If it doesn't, Nvidia could see its market position erode as fast as Intel's did when it similarly took its dominance over AMD for granted.\u00a0\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

Specifically, consumers are slamming the brakes on the purchase of new PCs and smartphones, which has hit Nvidia's (NVDA -2.84%) empire built on the GPU (graphics processing unit) especially hard. During the last quarter, sales from video gaming and other graphics applications were halved compared to a year prior. \u00a0\nEnterprise computing is a different story entirely, though. At the moment, the sale of actual GPUs is still fueling plenty of growth at Nvidia, and a budding software business is beginning to emerge as well. Will 2023 be the year Nvidia makes the jump from semiconductor business to software?\u00a0\n\nWill Nvidia software revenue take off in 2023?\nTo be clear, Nvidia does not separate out revenue it earns from software services from revenue from selling actual semiconductor hardware. We can assume, though, that the bulk of sales still comes from the sale of GPUs and GPU-powered computing systems for data centers. After all, Nvidia has a long history of bundling free-to-use software with a chip purchase to make it easier for video game enthusiasts and developers to get their new GPUs running as quickly as possible.\u00a0\nHowever, Nvidia is already making more money off software sales than many investors realize. For example, many Nvidia chips are being used for incredibly complicated computing tasks that require advanced software programs to operate. Many of the companies putting Nvidia hardware to use are not themselves software technologists, so employing some of Nvidia's software engineering is already taking place. Some of this software access might be a one-off purchase, though, rather than a recurring Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution investors have come to love.\nAs proof of this, during the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, CFO Collette Kress explained that Nvidia will begin segmenting out its large \"data center\" unit. Not incidentally, \"data centers\" is by far the company's largest unit. It hauled in over $3.8 billion in sales (more than half of the $5.8 billion revenue total) during the quarter. Kress said: \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the number and scale of public cloud computing and internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows, our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations, and analytics. \n\nIn other words, \"data centers\" have become far too generic a term for Nvidia's largest revenue segment. Included in that big $3.8 billion quarterly line item were sales of actual GPUs to data center operators, GPU \"rentals\" via a cloud service (known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service, or IaaS), engineering services, and software used to operate those GPUs. Starting with the next earnings report, expect a lot more detail from Nvidia on what its customers are actually doing with its silicon designs.\nBuilding from small beginnings, but just how small?\nSales from Nvidia's data center unit are currently a bit opaque, but what about the other three primary end-markets of \"gaming,\" \"professional visualization,\" and \"automotive\"? There are no specifics on software sales here either, but Nvidia could already be making quite a lot of money from recurring software revenue.\nLet's start with Nvidia's first subscription business, GeForce Now (think of it like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), but for video games). This past summer, Kress said that GeForce Now's registered users exceeded 20 million globally. How much revenue is that generating? Here's a little guesswork: GeForce Now has a free tier (I'll assume half of the 20 million users subscribe to this), a \"Priority\" pass at $9.99 a month (let's say nine million subs on average, or $90 million in revenue), and an advanced pass at $19.99 a month (one million subs, or $20 million in revenue). \nIf this is even a remotely accurate assumption, that means Nvidia could be generating over $300 million in revenue on a quarterly basis. In Q3 fiscal 2023, total video game revenue was $1.57 billion, so video game streaming could still be a small -- but certainly not insignificant -- source of sales complementing the sale of video game GPUs. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething similar is likely taking place with the \"professional visualization\" segment, which caters to video game and movie content creators, engineers, architects, and the like. Revenue was just $200 million in the last quarter, a big decline due to lower sales of PCs. However, Nvidia's Omniverse Cloud subscription (used for building 3D virtual worlds, for games and movies or to simulate real-world locations) is lumped into this unit.\nOmniverse is free to use for individuals, but a basic enterprise package starts at $9,000 a year. Hundreds of companies are now using Omniverse, so it wouldn't take many teams subscribing to the service to make this a big chunk of the \"professional visualization\" segment. \nThe \"automotive\" segment is even trickier. Sales were $251 million last quarter, and we can assume that most of this revenue is from the sale of Nvidia's computing system used in modern cars (the Nvidia DRIVE Orin and Thor chips). However, Nvidia has a whole suite of software for companies developing self-driving vehicle technology, from actual computing chips to software used to accelerate development. However, many of these sales could be housed under the \"data center\" segment. Look for some more detail on that starting in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. \nAt any rate, Nvidia has many irons in the fire when it comes to software, and 2023 could be a big year. But even now, it appears the company has been quietly building up its recurring software sales to complement its leading GPU designs. As more companies adopt Nvidia chips as they develop their own artificial intelligence systems and 3D applications, there is massive potential for Nvidia software to continue growing. This is a truly unique company operating within the massive semiconductor industry.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Nvidia.

Video Transcript [AUDIO LOGO] [MUSIC PLAYING] JARED BLIKRE: Time for a triple play-- three stocks were watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. Today, we have Nvidia, Tesla, and Amazon. My pick is Nvidia, which reached a peak market cap not this year, but last year of $834 billion. It is ending the year at $359 billion. That is a drop of over $475 billion, or 57%. And not a lot of fun-- well, we do have a lot of fundamental news, but I want to get to our heat maps here and just show some technical analysis on a sector basis.   So here we have the year-to-date view. Lots of dark red. Pretty ugly there. Nvidia, by the way, in the lower left. That's down over 50%. And let me sort by performance. You can see the bottom row there. Intel down a very similar amount, almost 50%. It looks like Western Digital, AMD, Marvell, all of those significant losses here. Now, if you look at the quarter, we do see some green. But the month of December was pretty negative for chip stocks. They are very cyclical, very levered to the business economy here. And any bad news with respect to the Fed still hiking, anything with regard to persistent inflation, well, that weighs on this sector. You can see only AVGO, that's Broadcom in the upper left, that's up about 9/10 of a perfect for us. - Yeah, Jared. We had a guest on this week on chips and stuff and talking about how the boom-bust nature of the business, it's such a commodity. They overproduced, then they have too much supply. Nvidia is a different story because it's really kind of these high-value graphics chips that people really want. So maybe if these people-- or, sorry, businesses go through that supply, and then replenish later in the year, maybe they might be in a better spot. I mean, it's still a very expensive business to be in. - Yeah, it certainly is very expensive. And we've heard a number of the projections that have come out, not only from analysts but a number of industry watchers. Gartner out with a recent forecast saying that the global semiconductor revenue is projected to decline 3.6% next year. So I know a number of analysts are bullish on the sector, but a lot of that has to do with picking the right winners in this space, given the fact that there's so much uncertainty headed into the new year. - Yeah.

The calculator is intuitive, but here are step-by-step instructions:\nStep 1: Enter the ticker symbol directly.\u00a0\nIf you know the ticker symbol of the stock you\u2019re looking for, just enter that into the \u201cChoose a Stock to Populate Sell Price\u201d field. MarketBeat will populate the tool from its search engine to give you the current market cap for that stock.\u00a0\nStep 2: Enter the share price.\u00a0\nThis is simply the current price at which the stock trades. You don\u2019t need to think about it beyond that. However, note that this price will change frequently during the trading day.\nStep 3: Enter the number of outstanding shares.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re on the MarketBeat site, you can find this in the right-hand column on the stock profile page.\u00a0\nMarket Capitalization Formula\nTo determine a company\u2019s market capitalization (or market cap), you will multiply the price of a single share by the number of total shares outstanding (the number of shares available to be publicly traded). The market cap calculation looks like this:\nMarket cap \uff1d Current share price x Outstanding shares\nIn many cases, you can easily find a company\u2019s market cap without having to do the calculation.\u00a0In fact, MarketBeat provides the market cap for all the publicly traded stocks in their database. However, for illustrative purposes, let\u2019s look at two examples using the formula:\nCompany A has 10,000,000 outstanding shares and currently sells stock at $50 per share. The formula looks like this:\nMarket cap \uff1d 50 x 10,000,000\nMarket cap = $500 million\nCompany B has 5,000,000 outstanding shares and currently trades at $20 per share. The formula looks like this:\nMarket cap \uff1d 20 x 5,000,000\u00a0\nMarket cap = $100 million\nMore Calculators from MarketBeat\n\nStock Calculators\n\nEarnings Per Share Calculator\nMarket Cap Calculator\nOptions Profit Calculator\nP/E Ratio Calculator\nStock Average Calculator\nStock Split Calculator\nStock Profit Calculator\nProfit Margin Calculator\n\n\n\nInvestment Calculators\n\nCD Calculator\nCompound Interest Calculator\nInflation Calculator\nInvestment Calculator\nAPY Calculator\nRetirement Calculator\nRoth IRA Calculator\n\n\n\nDividend Calculators\n\nDividend Calculator\nDividend Payout Ratio Calculator\nDividend Tax Calculator\nDividend Yield Calculator\n\n\n\nFinancial Calculators\n\nSalary to Hourly Income Calculator\nAnnual Income Calculator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet 30 Days of MarketBeat All Access for Free\nSign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools.\nStart Your 30-Day Trial\n\n\nMarketBeat All Access Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest-in-Class Portfolio Monitoring\n\nGet personalized stock ideas.\nCompare portfolio to indices.\nCheck stock news, ratings, SEC filings, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Ideas and Recommendations\n\nSee daily stock ideas from top analysts.\nReceive short-term trading ideas from MarketBeat.\nIdentify trending stocks on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Stock Screeners and Research Tools\n\nUse our seven stock screeners to find suitable stocks.\nStay informed with MarketBeat's real-time news.\nExport data to Excel for personal analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign in to your free account to enjoy these benefits\n\nIn-depth profiles and analysis for 20,000 public companies.\nReal-time analyst ratings, insider transactions, earnings data, and more.\nOur daily ratings and market update email newsletter.\n\n\n\nSign in to your free account to enjoy all that MarketBeat has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address:\n\n\n\nYour Password:\n\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nSign in with Facebook\n\nSign in with Google\n\nForgot your password?\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address:\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a Password:\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate My Account (Free)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nSign in with Facebook\n\nSign in with Google\n\nBy creating a free account, you agree to our terms of service.

GraniteShares\u2019 new suite of leveraged single-stock ETFs enables sophisticated investors to take high-conviction positions on some of the most popular stocks: Meta, Alibaba & Nvidia. The three new leveraged single-stock ETFs are as follows: Fund NamesFund TickerUnderlying StockGraniteShares 1.5X Long META Daily ETFFBLMetaGraniteShares 1.5X Long NVDA Daily ETFNVDLNvidiaGraniteShares 1.75X Long BABA Daily ETFBABXAlibaba  The GraniteShares 1.5X Long META Daily ETF (FBL) provides 1.5 times (150%) long exposure to shares of Meta, while the GraniteShares 1.5X Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) offers 1.5 times (150%) long exposure to shares of NVIDIA. GraniteShares 1.75X Long BABA Daily ETF (BABX) offers 1.75 times (175%) long exposure to shares of Alibaba. This new category reflects the evolution of the ETF market from broad index solutions to the ability today to take targeted positions on individual stocks. GraniteShares\u2019 new suite of leveraged single-stock ETFs expands on the current offering that provides exposure to Tesla (TSLA), Coinbase (COIN) & Apple (AAPL). Historically, access to leverage on single companies has been the domain of specialists such as Hedge Funds. GraniteShares has removed a key access barrier by making such exposures available on exchange as ETFs, allowing sophisticated investors to express high-conviction views in a transparent, accessible way. GraniteShares first launched leveraged ETFs on single stocks in the UK in 2019. GraniteShares launched +3X & -3X leveraged single stock ETPs on popular stocks such as Tesla, NIO, Rolls Royce and BP and has since expanded the range of products on offer to 106 listed across all major European markets \u2014 UK, France, Italy & Germany. GraniteShares\u2019 range of products has proven very popular with investors in Europe and the company brings valuable operating experience to the U.S. market. GraniteShares\u2019 initial leveraged single-stock ETF launches are listed below: Fund NamesFund TickerUnderlying StockGraniteShares 1.25X Long TSLA Daily ETFTSLTeslaGraniteShares 1X Short TSLA Daily ETFTSLITeslaGraniteShares 1.5X Long COIN Daily ETFCONLCoinbaseGraniteShares 1.75X Long AAPL Daily ETFAAPBApple  Will Rhind, Founder and CEO at GraniteShares, commented: \u201cWe are pleased to be able to expand our leveraged single-stock ETF platform to include Meta, Alibaba and Nvidia, all first to market offerings\u201d.  \u201cToday\u2019s launch is an expansion of our existing ETF offering that provides exposure to Tesla (TSL, TSLI), Coinbase (CONL) and Apple (AAPB).

For more information, please visit: www.graniteshares.com *As of 1st December 2022 Important Risk Disclosure Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or click here. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program. The investment program of the Fund is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock\u2019s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock\u2019s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex. Underlying Stock Risk: The Underlying Stock is subject to many risks that can negatively impact its revenue and viability including, but are not limited to price volatility risk, management risk, inflation risk, global economic risk, growth risk, supply and demand risk, operations risk, regulatory risk, environmental risk, terrorism risk and the risk of natural disasters. The Underlying Stock objectives may be affected by its ability to develop and launch new products, the growth of its sales and delivery capabilities, part supplier constraints or delays, consumer demand for electric vehicles and competition from existing and competitors. The Fund\u2019s daily returns may be affected by many factors but will depend on the performance and volatility of the Underlying Stock. Derivatives Risk: The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These risks include (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. Such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets, including, but not limited to: changing supply and demand relationships; government programs and policies; national and international political and economic events, changes in interest rates, inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships. Trading derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities. For Long Funds: Leverage Risk: The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Stock will be magnified. This means that an investment in the Fund will be reduced by an amount equal to 1.25% for every 1% daily decline in the Underlying Stock, not including the costs of financing leverage and other operating expenses, which would further reduce its value. The Fund could theoretically lose an amount greater than its net assets in the event the Underlying Stock declines more than 80%. Leverage will also have the effect of magnifying any differences in the Fund performance\u2019s correlation with the Underlying Stock For Short Funds: Short Sale Risk: The Fund will seek inverse or \u201cshort\u201d exposure through financial instruments, which would cause the Fund to be exposed to certain risks associated with selling short. These risks include, under certain market conditions, an increase in the volatility and decrease in the liquidity of the instruments underlying the short position, which may lower the Fund\u2019s return, result in a loss, have the effect of limiting the Fund\u2019s ability to obtain inverse exposure through financial instruments, or require the Fund to seek inverse exposure through alternative investment strategies that may be less desirable or more costly to implement. To the extent that, at any particular point in time, the instruments underlying the short position may be thinly traded or have a limited market, including due to regulatory action, the Fund may be unable to meet its investment objective due to a lack of available securities or counterparties. During such periods, the Fund\u2019s ability to issue additional Creation Units may be adversely affected. Obtaining inverse exposure through these instruments may be considered an aggressive investment technique. Any income, dividends or payments by any assets underlying the Fund\u2019s short positions, if any, would negatively impact the Fund. The Fund could theoretically lose an amount greater than its net assets in the event the Underlying Stock increases more than 100%. For Long Funds: Compounding Risk: The Fund aims to replicate the leveraged daily returns of the Underlying Stock and the Fund\u2019s performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day\u2019s returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Underlying Stock\u2019s performance, before fees and expenses. Compounding affects all investments but has a more significant impact on funds that aims to replicate leverage daily returns. For a Fund aiming to replicate 1.25 times the daily performance of an Underlying Stock, if adverse daily performance of the Underlying Stock reduces the amount of a shareholder\u2019s investment, any further adverse daily performance will lead to a smaller dollar loss because the shareholder\u2019s investment had already been reduced by the prior adverse performance. Equally, however, if favorable daily performance of the Underlying Stock increases the amount of a shareholder\u2019s investment, the dollar amount lost due to future adverse performance will increase because the shareholder\u2019s investment has increased. For Short Funds: Compounding Risk: The Fund aims to replicate the daily inverse returns of the Underlying Stock and the Fund\u2019s performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day\u2019s returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from Underlying Stock\u2019s performance, before fees and expenses. Compounding affects all investments but has a more significant impact on funds that aims to replicate inverse daily returns. For a Fund aiming to replicate the inverse performance of an Underlying Stock, if adverse daily performance of the Underlying Stock reduces the amount of a shareholder\u2019s investment, any further adverse daily performance will lead to a smaller dollar loss because the shareholder\u2019s investment had already been reduced by the prior adverse performance. Equally, however, if favorable daily performance of the Underlying Stock increases the amount of a shareholder\u2019s investment, the dollar amount lost due to future adverse performance will increase because the shareholder\u2019s investment has increased. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Because the Funds may effect redemptions principally for cash, rather than in-kind distributions, an investment in Funds\u2019 shares may be less tax efficient than investments in shares of conventional ETFs, and there may be a substantial difference in the after-tax rate of return between the Funds and conventional ETFs. The Funds may engage in frequent trading of derivatives. Active and frequent trading may lead to the realization and distribution to shareholders of higher short-term capital gains, which would increase their tax liability. Frequent trading also increases transaction costs, such as commissions, which could detract from the Funds\u2019performance.

Part of this is because, despite its undeniable power, its launch price of $1,199 (\u00a31,269, around AU$1,740) is extremely high for a gaming GPU. In fact, it\u2019s a whopping 71% more expensive than the RTX 3080 GPU it\u2019s supposed to be replacing.This price actually puts it on par with the RTX 3080 Ti \u2013 a high-end GPU that we\u2019ve previously looked at from both a gaming and creative angle.Perhaps the biggest issue facing the RTX 4080 is its bigger sibling: the RTX 4090. At $1,599 in the US (about \u00a31,359/AU$2,300), the RTX 4090 is more expensive, but not by a huge amount. In fact, there are some third-party RTX 4080 models that sell for more than the Founders Edition RTX 4090.This closeness in price introduces a dilemma; while prices are close, performance isn\u2019t. So, if you\u2019re looking to spend a lot of money on a GPU, saving up a bit longer for the RTX 4090 may end up being worthwhile.Are you a pro?

An early price cut so soon after launch would normally not be even remotely likely, but the rumor suggests that RTX 4080 sales haven\u2019t been stellar \u2013 and a price cut could change that.There\u2019s also the fact that the RTX 4070 Ti is rumored to arrive soon \u2013 and it could just be a rebadged RTX 4080 12GB (a weaker version of the 4080 that Nvidia ended up \u2018unlaunching\u2019 after a vocal outcry. Rumors suggest the RTX 4070 Ti will launch at a cheaper price than it was advertised when it was the RTX 4080 12GB, and to justify that, Nvidia may lower the price of the regular RTX 4080.This seems a bit like wishful thinking, but if you can hold on until CES 2023 to see what Nvidia has planned, you may be able to get the RTX 4080 at a lower price \u2013 making it even better value for digital creatives \u2013 especially when compared to the high prices of professional-grade GPUs.(Image credit: Nvidia)SpecificationsAs you\u2019d probably expect, the RTX 4080 comes with some of Nvidia\u2019s most cutting-edge tech, including stuff found on the more expensive 4090 as well. It comes with 9,728 CUDA Cores for rasterized graphics, plus 304 fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI and DLSS.The memory has been boosted to 16GB of GDDR6X which makes the RTX 4080 a powerful performer when it comes to heavy-duty creative tasks, such as rendering complex 3D scenes or editing ultra-high-resolution video.According to Nvidia, the RTX 4080 offers twice the performance of the RTX 3080 Ti for the same launch price and using 10% less power. That power consumption saving is going to add up for people planning on using their PCs for sustained high-intensity workloads.Yeah, but how does it actually perform?In our own benchmarks, we were pleasantly surprised to see the RTX 4080 broadly live up to Nvidia\u2019s claims when using creative tools.Blender is an incredibly popular 3D render engine and modeling tool, and it also comes with a host of benchmarks. In the Blender 3.3.0 Monster benchmark, the RTX 4080 scored 4,812, almost twice the score of the RTX 3080 Ti\u2019s 2,747. Impressively, it also handily beats both the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti \u2013 both flagship models that went on sale for a lot more. In the same test, for example, the RTX 3090 Ti scored 3,077.It was a similar story with the Blender Junkshop results, and while the RTX 4080 didn\u2019t quite score twice the amount of the RTX 3080 Ti, at 2,238 vs 1,559, it still provided a hefty performance boost.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)In fact, in all of our Blender benchmarks, the RTX 4080 came out well on top \u2013 only being beaten by the RTX 4090.This means for 3D artists and creatives, if money is no object, the RTX 4080 is currently the second-best GPU you can buy right now.However, if money is a consideration, the RTX 4080 is going to be a better investment than the 4090 \u2013 especially if a price cut is coming.We also ran the PugetBench benchmark for Adobe Premiere Pro. Premiere Pro is a popular tool for video editors and content creators, and the benchmark checks to see how well hardware can run various tasks.In the tests, the RTX 4080 unsurprisingly scored quite a bit higher than the RTX 3090 Ti, 3090, and 3080 Ti. What was a surprise, however, was that the gap drastically narrowed in our tests with the RTX 4090. The more expensive GPU still came out on top, but with a score of 967 compared to the RTX 4080\u2019s 946, it\u2019s incredibly close \u2013 to the point where you\u2019d not notice the difference.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)(Image credit: Future / InfoGram)Even more interestingly, the RTX 4080 actually scored slightly higher than the RTX 4090 in the PugetBench benchmark for Adobe Photoshop \u2013 arguably the best photo editing software photographers can use.The Ada edge?Ada-series GPUs don\u2019t just build upon the features found in previous consumer GPU architecture, such as Ampere and Turing, but also take elements of Nvidia\u2019s enterprise-class Hopper GPUs, particularly with the 4th generation Tensor Cores, which feature Hopper\u2019s FP8 Transformer Engine.So, what\u2019s behind the big leap in creative performance for the RTX 4080 compared to the RTX 3080 Ti? The RTX 4080, like the 4090, is built on Nvidia\u2019s new Ada Lovelace architecture which adds new features that help boost creative tasks.There\u2019s an improved eight-generation encoder, including AV1 and AI live streaming for content creators. We had a play around, and while results will vary depending on your own and your viewers' internet connections, live streaming quality was impressive. The extra gaming chops of the RTX 4080 certainly help in this regard, ensuring gameplay is smooth and responsive.(Image credit: GPUDatabase)Jargon aside, the exciting implication is that you\u2019re getting the kind of features you\u2019d expect in an enterprise GPU in a far cheaper consumer GPU.The RTX 4080 also comes with two video encoders that support the AV1 video codec, and Nvidia claims it\u2019s 40% more efficient than the H.264 encoder that the previous Ampere generation used.With dual video encoders, video rendering can be up to twice as fast as previous generation GPUs. For professionals this could have big, positive, repercussions \u2013 the faster your work renders, the more projects and commissions you can take on.As with previous GPUs, Nvidia has also released Studio drivers that have been specially designed for creative applications (rather than its \u2018Game Ready\u2019 drivers, which focus on gaming performance). New features such as RTX Remix allow modders to add ray tracing effects to older games. It\u2019s tools like this that really impress us.\u00a0Modding games takes a huge amount of effort and creativity, but it\u2019s often dismissed as \u2018just\u2019 a hobby for hardcore fans \u2013 so it\u2019s good to see Nvidia giving modders the respect they\u2019re due.(Image credit: Valve, Nvidia)VerdictAs we noted in our main review of the RTX 4080, the GPU struggles to justify its price tag for gamers due to its high price tag which puts it out of the reach of mainstream users, even those who would have splashed out on the RTX 3080, while also coming enticingly close to the price of the RTX 4090 \u2013 which means enthusiasts may skip the 4080 and go for the much more powerful GPU.When it comes to creatives, however, the RTX 4080 is a much more competitive proposition. It offers a big leap in performance over more expensive previous-generation GPUs in creative workloads, and includes features found in enterprise-grade GPUs \u2013 and while the 4080 is certainly expensive for a gaming GPU, when you compare it to professional GPUs, it offers far better value for money.As our own tests showed, the gap between the 4080 and 4090 isn\u2019t as pronounced with creative workloads as it is with gaming. Don\u2019t get us wrong, the 4090 is a beast when powering through creative tasks, but the 24GB VRAM \u2013 arguably the biggest difference between the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 (which has 16GB) \u2013 could be overkill for all but the most intense creative workloads (such as rendering extremely high-resolution 3D graphics).If that\u2019s the case, then the RTX 4080 will be much better value. As a gaming GPU, the RTX 4080 struggles to make a case for itself when it comes to value for money. As a creative GPU, it\u2019s a much more compelling buy, with the advanced and improved features of the Ada Lovelace architecture making a noticeable difference when using creative apps.\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

However, it seems that the company may have been preparing another card in stealth mode and could possibly announce that at CES as well: the GeForce RTX 4070. A filling of Inno3D spotted by Harukaze (via Videocardz) confirms that both cards will be launched in Q1 2023.\nNVIDIA RTX 4070 launching soon as well\nBoth the NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti and non-Ti are going to be based on the AD104 GPU with the Ti variant getting the full fat die and the non-Ti getting binned dies with 5888 CUDA cores. The memory specification has not been confirmed yet but could remain the same at 12 GB of GDDR6 memory as NVIDIA is unlikely to ship a GPU in 2023 with just 6 GB of vRAM (hopefully).\n\n\nAt an expected clock rate of around 2.6 GHz, this would mean the RTX 4070 non-Ti GPU has a performance spec of 30.6 FP32 TFLOPs at a TGP rating of 250W. Since EEC fillings are one of the last steps in the launch process after which the design cannot be changed, this means we will almost certainly see the card launch in Q1 2023 and probably announced along with its bigger brother. Not much else is known about the RTX 4070 although MLiD has previously done a video on the same.\nImage courtesy of Moores Law is Dead (MLiD).\nWe have been hearing that NVIDIA was planning to launch the RTX 4070 Ti at an MSRP of $899. If that turns out to be the case (NVIDIA seems to deliberately be withholding MSRP confirmation from its partners to avoid leaks) then the RTX 4070 should be priced around $699 or so, making it the \"mainstream\" entry from NVIDIA's Ada Lovelace line up. With AMD's price over performance value proposition a bit shaky with the last launch, the NVIDIA RTX 4070 might be the entry NVIDIA needs to start converting the mainstream segment from RTX 30 to RTX 40.\n\n\n\nWhichi NVIDIA GPU do you think offers the most value?\n\n\n RTX 4090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 4080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 4070 Ti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 4070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Potato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Reportedly Getting A New SKU With GDDR6 Memory Amid GDDR6X Shortages\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reportedly Axes GeForce RTX 4090 Ti, Rumored To Launch New RTX 4070 & RTX 4060 GPUs\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInno3D Unveils GeForce RTX 4070 & 4060 Ti GPUs With Hidden Power Connectors\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti & RTX 4060 Custom Models Roundup: From ITX To Triple-Fans!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

That\u2019s better than the $10.28 per share that Wall Street was expecting during the quarter. It\u2019s also a strong jump from the $7.81 per share reported in the same period of the year prior.\nAdding to that is the semiconductor company\u2019s revenue of $8.93 billion. Yet again, that\u2019s above the $8.9 billion analysts were expecting for the period. It\u2019s also a 21% increase from the $7.4 billion reported in fiscal Q4 2021.\nTo go along with these positive results, Broadcom provides revenue guidance of $8.9 billion for its fiscal first quarter of 2023. That would see it beating out Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $8.8 billion for the quarter.\nInvestors were previously worried about semiconductor stocks as several companies, Broadcom included, warned of waning interest in PCs. However, today\u2019s news is boosting shares higher.

NVIDIA Leaks GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Specs And Performance Chart Ahead Of Launch\n\r\n            by\r\n\r\n            Paul Lilly\r\n            \u2014\r\n            Friday, December 30, 2022, 11:37 AM EDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, NVIDIA might as well officially announce the next Ada Lovelace card that we all know is coming. We're of course talking about the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, which continues to make appearances ahead of next week's anticipated reveal. And not just in obscure leaks, either. The latest pre-release discovery comes from one of NVIDIA's own portals...again.\n\n\nLet's backtrack just a moment. Earlier this week, we posted an article on what to expect from NVIDIA's GeForce Beyond at CES 2023 event next week, and in it we noted that the company lists a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti as one of the recommended graphics cards for its Omniverse View platform. NVIDIA has removed the reference to its unannounced graphics card in the days that have passed, but not before we could grab a screenshot (which we posted in that article).\n\n\nSo the Omniverse team essentially confirmed the card's existence, to which NVIDIA France responded, 'Hold my ray-traced beer' with an even more substantial leak. Once gain, NVIDIA was quick to plug its own leak but, as we've often said, there are no mulligans on the internet. In this instance, notorious leaker and Twitter user @momomo_us grabbed a couple of revealing screenshots.\n\n\n\nSource: NVIDIA France (via @momomo_us)\n\n\n\nOne of them outlines the baseline specifications for the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, with the upcoming SKU plopped next to the GeForce RTX 4080 and GeForce RTX 4090. According to NVIDIA's own chart, it will feature 7,680 CUDA cores, 12GB of GDDR6X memory, and a 2.61GHz boost clock. It also shows support for a max display resolution of 4K at 240Hz, or 8K at 60Hz with DSC.\n\n\nThe specifications are identical to the 'unlaunched' GeForce RTX 4080 12GB, because the general assumption (backed by numerous leaks and rumors) is that NVIDIA essentially rebadged the card into the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. That makes sense, given the decision came after NVIDIA had already announced the 12GB model of the 4080, with its hardware partners presumably already in possession of the silicon.\n\n\n\nSource: NVIDIA France (via @momomo_us)\n\n\n\nNVIDIA France also posted a performance chart comparing the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti to the previous generation GeForce RTX 3080 (12GB) in three games: Microsoft Flight Simulator, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and Cyberpunk 2077. The fine print in the screenshot captured by @momomo_us reveals that testing was performed at 2560x1440 at the highest game settings, and DLSS set to the Quality mode. Other specs include a Core i9-12900K processor, 32GB of RAM, and Windows 11.\n\n\nAccording to NVIDIA's own benchmarks, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is around 1.75X to 3.5X faster than the previous generation part, at least in these specific games.\n\n\nWe'll obviously wait for the official reveal and our own testing before drawing any conclusions. To that end, it's rumored the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti will debut with a $799 MSRP instead of the original $899 price of the cancelled GeForce RTX 4080 12GB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), ada lovelace, geforce rtx 4070 ti, ces2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Not only that but Blackwell architecture could very well bring the largest performance leap in the company's history. NVIDIA recently confirmed that the Blackwell GPU architecture will be releasing in 2024. Since these are very preliminary rumblings, this post is very much a rumor so keep that grain of salt handy.\nNVIDIA RTX 50 GPUs feature new SM design and a raytracing denoising accelerator\nNow before I begin, I would like to point out that Blackwell architecture was planned to be the successor to Hopper architecture and the leak using Blackwell and RTX 50 interchangeably could mean several things. Hopper's parallel release in the consumer segment (RTX 40) had the codename of Ada Lovelace, so it is possible that Blackwell will also get its consumer counterpart. Alternatively, it is possible that Blackwell is actually the consumer codename (although admittedly, this is less probable) and the datacenter side of things will get a new name. Previous reports have indicated that Blackwell GPUs will be fabricated on TSMC's 3nm process.\n\n\nThe rumor comes from RedGamingTech and they have received some new information regarding the architecture. Firstly, Blackwell will feature an entirely new SM structure. Considering the underlying micro architecture is shifting to an MCM design with Blackwell - this is not surprising. Also, Blackwell will leverage a hyperspeed bus that will interlink the various SM and chiplets. A denoising accelerator will also be part of the ray tracing pipeline (modern path tracing setups don't actually trace the full sequence, they do it partially and a denoiser handles the rest) which should result in significantly improved RT performance.\n\nThere still seems to be no word on specifications although the source notes that there are various Blackwell GPUs being considered and a lot of the binning will depend on how AMD's current RDNA 3 and future RDNA4 offerings perform. Finally, RGT leaves us with the following teaser: \"biggest perf leap in NVIDIA's history\".\nNVIDIA Hopper was the world's fastest 4nm GPU at launch and the world's first with HBM3 memory. It featured higher specifications than even the NVIDIA RTX 4090 (which contains 16,384 CUDA cores) at a net total of 18,432 CUDA cores. Blackwell will provide significant generational improvement over Hopper (as has always been the case). Four NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs have already been confirmed in a prior leak.\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell architecture was based after David Blackwell who was an American statistician and mathematician that made significant contributions to game theory, probability theory, information theory and statistics. He was also the first African American to be inducted into the National Academy of Sciences. Blackwell continues NVIDIA's trend of naming major architectures after prominent computer scientists and mathematicians and not much else is known about the Blackwell architecture at this point. It is very likely that we will eventually be introduced to the parallel nomenclature (as Ada Lovelace is to Hopper) that will complete NVIDIA's first MCM duo.\n\n\n\nHow much would you be willing to spend for the Blackwell / RTX 50 flagship GPU?\n\n\n $1999+\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n $1599-1999\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n $1199-$1599\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n $999-$1199\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n $899-900\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n <$899\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Only AMD for me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n I will wait and see what to buy from Intel/NVIDIA/AMD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Says It Shipped Twice The RTX 50 Cards In The First Five Weeks Than RTX 40 Series; Promises Stability In Pricing Soon\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 5070 Takes The Number One Spot On Amazon, More NVIDIA GPUs Replace AMD In Best Selling GPUs List\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 & RTX 5060 Ti Specs Leaked: 5060 Ti Gets 4608 Cores & Up To 16 GB G7, 5050 Gets 2560 Cores & 8 GB G6, Both at 128-bit\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n105\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n100\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n28\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And while it's not the only available option, Steam Link can be a worthy replacement to the now-defunct GameStream service. \nIn this article, we explain everything you need to know about Steam Link and how to use it to stream games to an NVIDIA Shield TV. \n                        What Is Steam Link?\n               \nFirst, let's clear up what we're talking about when we refer to Steam Link. We're not referring to the hardware variant of Steam Link\u2014which was discontinued in 2018 and replaced with the Steam Link app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinus Tech Tips/YouTube\n\n\n\nWhen we refer to Steam Link in this guide, we're referring to the app, not the hardware. With that clarification out of the way, how does it all work?\nSteam Link streams games from your gaming PC to the device you wish to stream to (in our case, your Shield TV) by bridging a connection between the two. Setup is straightforward, though you may encounter caveats once you try to stream. But more on that later.\nIt's a decent option when you want to stream PC games to your Shield TV, especially with NVIDIA discontinuing GameStream. Even though you'll be limited to Steam's ecosystem, you can still play games from other digital marketplaces by adding non-Steam games to your Steam library. \n                        How to Install and Set Up Steam Link on NVIDIA Shield TV\n               \nOpen the Play Store app on your Shield TV, search for \"Steam Link.\" and then select Install > Open > Allow.\nNow, Steam Link will search the PCs currently running Steam. In most cases, your PC will be found automatically. If not, you'll have to manually add the PC (more on that in a moment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's bridge the connection between your gaming PC and the Shield TV. Here's how: \n\n                                        Select the gaming PC you want to connect to.\n                        \n\n                                        Choose Start Playing.\n                        \n\n                                        Take note of the four-digit PIN that appears.\n                        \n\n                                        Go to the gaming PC you want to connect to and enter the code in the blank field.\n                        \n\n                                        Select Confirm.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more than one gaming PC running Steam on your home network and want to bridge another connection to your Shield TV, select Settings and then Computer to see every PC found by Steam Link. Select a computer you want to steam from, then select Start Playing to bridge another connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! But what can you do if Steam Link fails to find your gaming PC on your home network? That's an easy fix, so read below. \n                        What to Do if Steam Link Can't Find Your PC\n               \nIf Steam Link can't find the PC you want to stream games from to your Shield TV, go to Settings > Computer > Rescan to see if it can be found a second time around. But if the Steam Link app still cannot find your gaming PC, you'll have to add it manually.\nFortunately, Steam Link also makes this process simple. So, follow these simple instructions: \n\n                                        Go to Settings > Computer.\n                        \n\n                                        Now, select Other Computer at the bottom.\n                        \n\n                                        Take note of the four-digit PIN.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Steam client on the gaming PC you want to stream from. Now, click on Steam > Settings, and head to Remote Play on the left pane.\nEnter the four-digital PIN and select Confirm as we did in the previous example. If successful, the Steam Link app will bridge a connection between the PC and your Shield TV. \n                        Connecting a Controller to the Shield TV\n               \nAndroid and iOS users may already know that they don't necessarily need to connect a controller if they want to stream their PC titles to their mobile devices. But since the goal is to stream PC games to the Shield TV, we don't have that option. So, we'll need to pair a Bluetooth controller to your Shield TV.\nYou can skip this step if you've done this in the past. For everyone else, you have two options: \n\n                                        Pairing a Steam Controller with the Shield TV.\n                        \n\n                                        Pairing other controllers, like DualSense and Xbox Series X/S controllers.\n                        \n\nFor the few that still own a Steam Controller and wish to pair it to the Shield TV, first, update the Steam Controller's firmware. To do this: \n\n                                        Open Steam on your PC where the Steam Controller is paired.\n                        \n\n                                        Click on View and choose Big Picture Mode from the dropdown menu.\n                        \n\n                                        Now, follow the on-screen instructions for updating the firmware if an update is available.\n                        \n\n                                        Turn off the Steam Controller by holding the Steam button.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinus Tech Tips/YouTube\n\n\n\nTo pair any Bluetooth controller to your Shield TV, including the Steam Controller, follow the instructions below: \n\n                                        Select Settings and choose Remotes & accessories.\n                        \n\n                                        Hold the pairing button on your controller.\n                        \n\n                                        Select Add Bluetooth accessories.\n                        \n\n                                        Using your Shield TV remote, choose the controller you are pairing.\n                        \n\n                                        Select Pair.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unpair a controller from the Shield TV, go to Settings > Remotes & accessories and go to the bottom of the list to find your connected controller under the Paired devices section. Select the controller, then choose Unpair. \n                        Troubleshooting Steam Link's Latency Issues\n               \nAlthough not everyone will experience latency issues with Steam Link, it's a common problem. Unfortunately, latency woes can occur for any number of reasons. If you're getting undesirable bandwidth speeds via Steam Link, conduct a bandwidth test on the PC you want to stream to your Shield TV. You can do this within Steam Link itself.\nSelect Settings > Streaming > Network Test. Enter the four-digit PIN on the gaming PC you want to stream to the Shield TV, and then select Confirm to conduct a speed test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your connection crawls at a turtle's pace, consider plugging your gaming PC into an Ethernet port on your home network. Alternatively, switch your PC from 2.4GHz to 5GHz.\nAdditionally, you can enable hardware encoding to minimize latency woes by opening the Steam client on your PC and going to Steam > Settings > Remote Play > Advanced Host Options > Enable hardware encoding > OK.\nWhile you're on the Steam client, it's a good time to adjust the stream quality of your gaming PC. Return to Settings, then select Remote Play. Look for the section Client options streaming to this computer at the bottom of the page. You will find three choices: Fast, Balanced, and Beautiful.\nBy default, Steam sets this to Balanced, but if your connection is slow, make sure you choose Fast. \n                        Steam Link Is the Next Best Thing to GameStream\n               \nSteam Link isn't perfect, and it may make you feel nostalgic for the days when you could stream from your gaming PC to your Shield TV via NVIDIA's GameStream service.\nStill, it's arguably the easiest solution for streaming your PC games to the Shield TV.

In part 1 of the blog we discussed the workflow for developing AI models using MATLAB for seismic interpretation. Today, in part 2, we will discuss the various compute resources leveraged from AWS and NVIDIA for developing the models.\nThese posts were contributed by Akhilesh Mishra, Medical Devices Industry Manager at MathWorks.\nAccelerating the workflow using NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\nThe entire workflow involving the computation of five channel wavelet-based features and training the deep learning model had two challenges for computations \u2013 limited physical memory and time taken to train the deep learning models. The process of coming up with an algorithm which has a reasonable accuracy required multiple iterations of trying different signal preprocessing techniques combined with training various deep learning architectures. As an example, understanding which discrete wavelet (e.g. Daubechies, Fej\u00e9r-Korovkin, Coiflets, Symlets etc.) decomposition was better with different architectures of deep learning layers (using LSTMs, GRUs or BiLSTMs), required us to setup multiple experiments running simultaneously. An additional layer of complexity is added by the process of hyperparameter tuning required to optimize a given deep learning network architecture. With the entire training dataset being quite large (782\u00d7590 decomposed seismic traces of size 1006x3x3x5 samples each) and multiple experiments running in parallel, it was imperative for us to utilize a powerful resource for our computation needs.\nMathWorks offers various cloud services to speed up these development processes by providing on-demand access to enhanced compute resources, software tools, and reliable data storage. As of today, we can easily scale our long-running computations and simulations to CPUs, GPUs, or compute clusters in the cloud. In the section below we will describe the three different cloud offerings which were leveraged for this work, namely:\n\nMATLAB Cloud Center\nMATLAB AWS Reference Architecture\nMATLAB container on NVIDIA NGC Catalog\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Various cloud-based scaling options with MATLAB\n\nMATLAB Cloud Center\nMATLAB Cloud Center enables you to create, access, and manage public cloud resources. It allows users to easily launch a Windows or Linux machine with MATLAB installed that can be accessed remotely.\nTo get started, you need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a MathWorks account. The Cloud Center has a guided process\u00a0to authorize and add credentials for multiple AWS accounts and allow Cloud Center to manage cloud resources on user\u2019s behalf. You can use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to establish a trusted relationship between the user\u2019s AWS account and the account belonging to MathWorks Cloud Center. After completing authorization, you can now create an Amazon EC2 instance with MATLAB installed. It is worth mentioning that in this blog we are describing how to run MATLAB directly on Amazon EC2 instances, which is the workflow utilized for training the seismic facies classification models. There is a separate workflow for connecting the desktop/laptop version of MATLAB to Amazon EC2 clusters using MATLAB Parallel Server, which is covered in details in this blog article.\n\n\nFigure 2: Login to Cloud Center and create cloud resource\n\nFigure 2 shows the first step for creating the Amazon EC2 instance after the MATLAB Cloud Center has been associated with the AWS account. The creation and configuration of EC2 happens directly on MATLAB Cloud Center as opposed to the AWS console.\nFor the second step we need to configure the instance. This step gives us various options including the EC2 instance type. AWS offers various instances such as memory optimized, storage optimized, accelerated computing etc. The full details of all the AWS instances supported with MathWorks Cloud Center can be found here \u2013 https://www.mathworks.com/help/cloudcenter/ug/choose-supported-ec2-instance-machine-types.html. For our problem we selected the p3d.2xlarge instance which has one NVIDIA V100 GPU with 5,120 CUDA cores, 640 Tensor cores and 8 vCPUs, which was optimal for massive scaling of our deep learning training. Figure 3 below shows the second step for setting up the configuration. Note that there are two options for accessing the instance \u2013 opening MATLAB directly from browser using NICE DCV or launching MATLAB using the remote desktop connection. NICE DCV is a high-performance remote display protocol provided by AWS to render remote desktops sessions streaming from any cloud over various network conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3: Configure the cloud resource\n\nThe next step is where the instance is configured, which takes 5-15 minutes. Once ready we can directly launch the instance by clicking on the access option under the Actions tab as show in Figure 4.\n\n\nFigure 4: Launch the instance via DCV\n\nOnce launched, you can log in to the DCV via \u201cAccess Your Cloud Resource\u201d console in the Cloud Center using our credentials setup in Step 2. Once you click \u201cCopy and Connect\u201d, it will redirect to the DCV login console and allow the user to access MATLAB in the browser itself. The MATLAB R2022a release selected in the second step of the setup is already linked to our MathWorks account, and it automatically checks out all the toolboxes which our license is subscribed to. Figure 5 shows MATLAB launched through DCV with the GPU information of the instance which is the Tesla V-100 for p3d.2xlarge instance selected.\n\n\nFigure 5: Launching MATLAB directly on the browser via DCV connection\n\nMATLAB Cloud Center allows us to configure the instance to automatically shut down when not in use, and we can also enable it to automatically resize based on our needs.\nOnce inside MATLAB, we were able to run multiple training sessions using Experiment Manager app to configure the hyperparameters of the various deep learning network architectures while iterating through the various wavelet-based training data features. We used a Bayesian optimization technique to tune the hyperparameters of various deep learning networks. MATLAB has built-in support for the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) libraries for accelerated training and predictions. This enabled us to seamlessly leverage NVIDIA GPUs for deep learning training on the cloud. Figure 6 shows the experiment manager app running the multiple deep learning experiments setup using the cloud GPU resources.\n\n\nFigure 6 Experiment manager app running Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning\n\nMATLAB AWS Reference Architecture\nA MATLAB AWS reference architecture is a collection of pre-built virtual machines with MathWorks software pre-installed in them. The reference architecture also contains the necessary AWS CloudFormation templates that define how the infrastructure will be deployed e.g. with load balancers, storage systems, etc. With the CloudFormation template the user has full control over the resources being created.\nThis is an alternate cloud resource which we leveraged for training deep learning networks on the seismic data. The reference architecture is available on the MathWorks GitHub page.\nThe MATLAB container image on reference architecture could be accessed remotely using a web browser or via VNC connection. The advantage of using a reference architecture is that these architectures can be adapted, extended, and customized to incorporate specific IT needs. Figure 7 shows the snippet of the MathWorks AWS reference architecture page with different versions of MATLAB available for its customers.\n\n\nFigure 7 MATLAB AWS reference architecture Github page\n\nWe used the Amazon EC2 p4d.24xlarge instance with reference architecture, which is more powerful than the p3 instance leveraged from the Cloud Center workflow. With eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs available on a single instance and a higher total instance memory (1152 GB instance memory, 320 GB GPU memory), it was possible to launch multiple experiments in parallel to iterate over different combinations wavelet features with diverse deep learning architectures and get outputs very quickly. As there were 8 GPUs available, we were able to launch 8 different instances of MATLAB and run simultaneous experiments for deep learning training all at once. As an example, using the MATLAB AWS reference architecture the overall speed up achieved on the EC2 P4d instance compared to running an experiment on a laptop with an NVIDIA Titan V GPU was 48X; 6X speed up for each experiment and 8 experiments running on eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs simultaneously.\nMATLAB Container on NVIDIA NGC Catalog\nAn alternative approach to using MATLAB to accelerate end-to-end AI workloads using NVIDIA GPUs on the AWS cloud is to leverage the NVIDIA NGC Catalog, which is a catalog of GPU-optimized AI and HPC software containers that can be accessed on the AWS Marketplace. The MATLAB Deep Learning Container\u00a0in the NGC Catalog provides algorithms, pretrained models, and apps to create, train, visualize, and optimize deep neural networks. Figure 8 shows the NGC catalog page for accessing MATLAB.\n\n\nFigure 8 NGC catalog for MATLAB container\n\nWe can use this MATLAB deep learning container to automatically generate C and CUDA code using the GPU Coder toolbox for optimizing deployment on NVIDIA GPUs. The functions for wavelet feature extraction and deep learning inference are both supported for CUDA code generation, and the speed up achieved for the final algorithm running on a single GPU instance was 7X times than running it on just CPU.\nMost oil and gas companies need to process 100s of these datasets which makes CPU usage impractical. Access to GPU-acceleration at scale on AWS simplifies and accelerates the development and deployment of AI-enabled applications like seismic facies classification we demonstrated in this blog series. By fine-tuning pretrained models with custom data through a UI-based, guided workflow, enterprises can produce highly accurate models in hours rather than months, improving total cost of ownership and eliminating the need for deep AI expertise. The combination of data, computational power, and the flexibility to scale on-demand are critical to advanced seismic imaging techniques and unlocking the full value of digitalization in the oil and gas industry.\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we covered how you can easily develop and deploy AI-based seismic facies classification by leveraging the computational power and scale of NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2. MathWorks offers various options for scaling the algorithms on the cloud-based high-performance computing resources for faster prototyping and development of AI algorithms with large 3-D seismic datasets. In part I of the blog we discussed the detailed workflow for developing AI models with MATLAB.\nThe entire MATLAB code for training and inference of the above work can be downloaded from the following git repository:\nhttps://github.com/mathworks/Seismic-Facies-Classification-with-Wavelets-and-Deep-Learning\nFor more information, see the following resources:\n\nMATLAB\nMATLAB Tech Talks: Understanding Wavelets\nGet Started\u00a0with Wavelet Toolbox\nMATLAB for Deep Learning\nClassify Time-Series using Wavelet Analysis and Deep Learning\nMATLAB Parallel Cloud Computing on AWS\n\nThe content and opinions in this blog are those of the third-party author and AWS is not responsible for the content or accuracy of this blog.\n\n\n\n\n         TAGS: \n        Geo Sciences, HPC, MATLAB, Research Computing, Scientific Computing\n\n\n\n\n\n AWS Editorial Team \nAmazon Web Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resources\n\n\nHPC on AWS Overview\nHPC Tech Shorts Video Series\nHPC Community Site\nAWS Quantum Technologies Blog\nAWS ParallelCluster\nAWS Batch\nNICE DCV\nElastic Fabric Adapter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow\n\n\n\u00a0Twitter\n\u00a0Facebook\n\u00a0LinkedIn\n\u00a0Twitch\n\u00a0Email Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Sign In to the Console \n\n Learn About AWS\n\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Accessibility\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nWhat is Generative AI?\nWhat is Machine Learning (ML)?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n Resources for AWS\n\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Library\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partners\n\n\n\n Developers on AWS\n\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavaScript on AWS\n\n\n\n Help\n\nContact Us\nGet Expert Help\nFile a Support Ticket\nAWS re:Post\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\nAWS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Create an AWS Account \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Amazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: \n          Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\nBahasa Indonesia\nDeutsch\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\nFran\u00e7ais\nItaliano\nPortugu\u00eas\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\u03a1\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53)\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7e41\u9ad4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Terms\n|\n Cookie Preferences \n|\n\u00a9 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

I'm not much of a command line kinda guy, so having a simple mouseable interface is much more up my street. And it's a fun plaything for a man without a visual artistic bone in his body. I've pictured the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, a Monet painting of Boris Johnson sitting on the toilet in the middle of a pond, and Donald Trump reading my beloved PC Format.But nothing has affected me so much as hammering the Nvidia RTX 4090 for eight and a half hours straight, training it to paint like my great uncle Hermann.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI'll say it: The best thing I saw from Nvidia at CES wasn't its sweet new GPUs, but some tasty AI every RTX gamer can enjoy\n\n\n\n\nIt's time for me to admit that AI-accelerated frame generation might actually be the way of the future and that's a good thing\n\n\n\nYou won't know the name Hermann Kahn. I would also be incredibly surprised if you recognised him by the name he was actually more widely known by, Aharon Kahana. Honestly, I didn't know him either; sadly he died well before I was born.\u00a0But I have heard so many stories, so much talk about Uncle Hermann from both my mother and late grandmother as I grew up, that I feel like I do kind of know him. At least part of him anyway.Kahana's art style is distinctive, and a distinct feature of my childhood.The familial bond is strong, ever more so since travelling to Tel Aviv just before the birth of my three-year-old son. It was the place my gran, Inge, and great grandmother, Rosa Kahn fled to from a pre-Kristallnacht Germany in the mid '30s. And the place Hermann Khan settled after meeting his wife while studying art in Berlin.\u00a0I walked the streets they walked, passed the apartment my gran grew up in, travelled the road to Haifa Rosa took each morning for work, and visited Hermann's home in Ramat Gan.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Dave James)(Image credit: Dave James)(Image credit: Dave James)That home he shared with his wife, Mideh, has become a museum to his art and while it was closed when I visited, and clearly had been for some time, it has seemingly since re-opened and is hosting exhibitions again.Kahana's art style is distinctive, and a distinct feature of my childhood. I was surrounded by his ceramics and both early and late style paintings in my parents' and grandparents' homes. Even as a child I was drawn to them. There's a particular vase that I could never not see as the starship Enterprise, thanks to its Trek-like saucer section.An entirely abstract geometric image of what I always assumed was a loving couple adorned our chimney breast, an image of Parisian rooftops and a stormy looking beach scene in thick oil paint ran up our stairs.But inevitably this early 20th century German-Israeli painter and ceramicist has not been included as one of Stable Diffusion's listed artists. And although I experimented with detailed prompts, messed around with X/Y plots to try and find levers to pull to get a close approximation of the abstract paintings he produced, I never really got there.The Stable Diffusion checkpoint file simply doesn't have the necessary reference points. But there are ways to encourage the AI to understand different, related images, and build from those specifically. They're called embeddings and people have used them to train the tool to recognise their own faces. That way you can include yourself in all the wild furry AI-painted fantasies you could ever desire.But I wanted to train it to recognise and understand\u2014as best a relatively simple AI could\u2014the art of Aharon Kahana. It's a surprisingly powerful tool, especially given the caveats in the embeddings explanation that \"the feature is very raw, use at own risk\". Thanks to the latest release of the web UI app on Github, however, it can all be done through a browser.Image 1 of 3Stable Diffusion running on an RTX 4090 generating images(Image credit: Future)'photorealistic caricature of Donald Trump reading PC Format magazine, HD, 4K, cinematic, ominous, portrait'(Image credit: Future)'abstract portrait of donald trump, charcoal line drawing by aharon_kahana'(Image credit: Future)You'll need Stable Diffusion, and therefore Python, already up and running on your machine, but you can then pull together a folder of images under a particular name, and it will thrash your GPU to 100% load, and 50% of your CPU, for hours to create reference points that Stable Diffusion can use when prompted with the exact name of the embedding.I wanted to train it to recognise and understand\u2014as best a relatively simple AI could\u2014the art of Aharon Kahana.Sounds relatively simple, but it certainly took some trial and error on my part. Not least after the realisation that once I'd downloaded 70-odd images of my great uncle's work, from various auction sites around the world, that I actually had to label them with something vaguely detailed in order for the training to have any impact.\u00a0That queued up a lot of time figuring out the medium and subjects of each of the pieces I'd downloaded, and then renaming each file by hand. And when you're working with sometimes seriously abstract imagery that's not always so easy.I then pointed the RTX 4090 and my Core i9 10900K at the relevant folder, created the embedding wrapper, and left it beavering away for over eight and a half hours to come to terms with what I'd fed it. All 16,432 cores and a healthy chunk of the 24GB of memory in the new Nvidia card, as well as half my 10th Gen Core i9, were employed on this task.\u00a0I'm not going to pretend to be smart enough to truly understand what I'd tasked the most powerful consumer GPU in the world with, but when I checked in with it over the evening I could see it had been taking the input images and making its own approximations.Image 1 of 2Original images on the left, AI training doodles on the right(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)It was like some teaching from beyond the grave, like my PC had spent the night learning from Hermann, doodling away in some homage to his style to try and figure out how to do it without the artist's help.By the morning the embedding was finished and I could boot up the web UI again\u2014now listed with one textual inversion embedding\u2014and affix the 'by aharon_kahana' text to the end of any prompt and see what the AI had learned overnight.And it was remarkable. My computer was creating homage after homage to my great uncle, more fascinating still when it was making images of things Kahana would never hit. I'm an absolute novice when it comes to the mystic art of the prompt, but even my basic requests delivered images that evoked the memory of the artist.\u00a0Where it lacked the pure soul and understanding of what it was actually doing, it made up for in strange digital creativity and GPU-backed effort. Certainly, it was all recognisably and inextricably linked to his art style.Image 1 of 5'abstract paiting of a dancer, on a metallic background, oil on canvas by aharon_kahana'(Image credit: Future)'landscape image of the bath city skyline, 4K, cinematic, oil on canvas by aharon_kahana'(Image credit: Future)'abstract painting of a woman walking a dog on a beach at sunset oil on canvas by aharon_kahana'(Image credit: Future)'abstract paiting of a dancer, on a metallic background, oil on canvas by aharon_kahana'(Image credit: Future)'image of an nvidia graphics card, oil on canvas by aharon_kahana'(Image credit: Future)I know a lot of modern artists are railing against the AI art development, frustrated at the glut of pictures of fantasy women created by people with no artistic talent\u2014along with said furry fantasies\u2014and I don't pretend to know exactly how Aharon Kahana would have felt, but I can't help but feel he would have embraced this new tool.And that's what it is, a tool. As much as I've been impressed by how close Stable Diffusion has come to recreating his art style, that's all it can really do: recreate. It's not really going to evolve the style on its own; it's still going to take a human artist to take the art any further. And it still needs detailed human input to give it enough of a subject to build from.Rather than something that's going to replace artists, it's just another tool\u2014like high resolution SLRs and Photoshop has become for landscape painters\u2014that will slot into the arsenal of artists interested in taking the technology to new, interesting places.AI art then, at its current level, feels like a starting point rather than something capable of truly creating the finished product. But that's probably not going to stop me from filling my PC with a million colourful, endlessly abstract images. All inspired by part of my family I've never really known yet still hope to embrace.\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

I wanted to find out how to make the most of the hardware, especially the dual encoders \u2013 Nvidia having included two encoder chips this time around.\nRTX 4000 series has a new 8th generation NVENC encoder. It handles AV1 as well as H.265 and H.264.\nAnd it has two of them \u2013 but how do you access them?\nSome background on presets\nIt is often said, \u201cGood, Fast, Cheap \u2013 Pick Two\u201d and it fits post production pretty well. Encoding has a similar relationship between quality, speed and file size.\nEncoding \u2013 pick two\nFor example if you fix the file size by fixing the bitrate, as is common, you can have higher quality by taking longer to make the encode. If you fix the quality (using say the constant quality slider in Handbrake), you can get the file size a bit smaller by taking longer with the encode. The way you go about this is by choosing a different preset \u2013 seen here for the x264 encoder in Handbrake for example.\nEncoder preset in Handbrake\nA preset is defined as follows:\nA preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio. A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize). This means that, for example, if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate, you will achieve better quality with a slower preset. Similarly, for constant quality encoding, you will simply save bitrate by choosing a slower preset (source).\nThe real question though is whether taking that extra time is worth it to you. Some people will just choose the slowest preset knowing they want the highest quality and are prepared to wait for it. Personally I would always like to know if it\u2019s worth doing something slower \u2013 what if you\u2019re waiting an extra 10 minutes every day for a 0.01% improvement that no-one will ever see? Well it turns out it\u2019s exactly like that \u2013 not only for software encoders like x264, but also for the new RTX 4000 series, which I\u2019ll get to later.\nA while back I came across some great research from Jan Ozer called \u201cChoosing an x264 preset\u201d which clearly shows that you gain almost nothing by using anything slower than the \u201cfaster\u201d preset in terms of quality, yet cost yourself a good bit of time if you do.\nSource: \u201cChoosing an x264 preset\u201d by Jan Ozer\n\nPresets for Nvidia\u2019s NVENC in Davinci Resolve\nThe Nvidia hardware encoder (NVENC) also has presets \u2013 officially called P1 (fastest) through P7 (slowest) which according to Nvidia \u201cdetermine for example GOP structure, B frames, look-ahead encoding, and so on\u201d \u2013 stuff most of us don\u2019t have time to understand, but it\u2019s the same deal \u2013 spending a bit more time to get a bit more quality or a smaller file.\nNVENC presets available in Davinci Resolve\nAnd it turns out the export time is massively different across these presets. I ran some tests on the RTX 4080 exporting a 5 minute DNxHR UHD 25fps clip to all three output options (H.264, H.265 and AV1) across all 7 presets. For H.265 and AV1, the fastest preset was around 6 times faster than the slowest one, going from around 50 FPS to around 300 FPS. To put that into some context, if you have a 30 minute timeline, the \u201cVery Slow\u201d preset will take over 15 minutes and the \u201cVery Fast\u201d preset will take 2.5 minutes. That kind of time adds up if you\u2019re doing this every day. To get this export speed, the input codec does have to be ProRes or DNxHR (or equivalent mezzanine codec) with effects already cached/rendered \u2013 otherwise the encoder is not fed fast enough.\n\nThe dual encoders\nThere\u2019s also a reason why the encoding speed jumps up sharply for the two fastest presets \u2013 it is here that the dual encoders come into play. Apparently under certain conditions, the new cards can split a video into two halves and pass each half to each encoder and then recombine them. In order to use the dual encoders on the new RTX 4000 series you need the following to be true:\n\nResolution is UHD or above\nPreset is \u201cFaster (P2)\u201d or \u201cVery Fast (P1)\u201d\nTuning is set as \u201cHigh Quality\u201d (this is the default anyway)\nExport codec is AV1 or H.265\n\nI was also only able to achieve this in Davinci Resolve (not Premiere Pro or Shutter Encoder for example). It\u2019s interesting that the H.265 encode is now overall faster than H.264 \u2013 I think it is time to start using it if you\u2019re not already.\nIf you see the Video Encode over 50% then you know you are using the dual encoders\n\u00a0\n\nBut what about quality?\nOf course the big question is what is the tradeoff in quality for these speeds? While you can and should use your eyes to see if an export is at the quality you require, for more subtle differences it\u2019s best to use something like PSNR or VMAF to assess the visual quality.\nVMAF is an \u201cEmmy-winning perceptual video quality assessment algorithm developed by Netflix\u201d. And you can use it for free within FFmpeg \u2013 I followed this guide (again by Jan Ozer). The really good thing about VMAF is that it\u2019s a score out of 100 which makes it quite easy to understand and according to Netflix a score of over 85 is good.\nRunning VMAF calculations with FFmpeg\nWhile there is a small drop-off in quality across the presets, it really is very small \u2013 less than half a VMAF point & not visible to the naked eye. Really with any score over 90 I find it hard to see any artifacting at all. A much bigger difference is seen by using H.265 instead of H.264 (and AV1 is even better). Of course the actual numbers will depend on the source material, but I did a few other tests and got similar results.\n\nWhile speed of encode doesn\u2019t affect the quality that much, the bitrate/filesize does. You can see here a 1080p test file encoded to H.265 at bitrates from 10Mbps down to 1Mbps \u2013 the quality varies little across the presets, but a lot across the bitrates. To my eye I was very happy with the encodes above 6Mbps.\n\nGiven most people are not short of drive space or internet speed, upping the bitrate is definitely the way to push the quality up, whilst keeping the benefit of getting the encode done quickly with the fastest presets.\nPremiere Pro\nIn Premiere Pro there are more limited options, but you still can speed up your exports by some judicious tweaking of settings. Presets are not available in H.264 and AV1 is not available at all yet (aside from using 3rd party plugin Voukoder), but if you choose HVEC (H.265) as the format and you dial down in the Video settings, you see five options listed as \u201cQuality\u201d \u2013 why there are five and not seven I have no idea (my guess is trying to keep it simpler by leaving off the outer two). You also need to make sure you have chosen one pass hardware encoding which uses the Nvidia NVENC encoder.\nChoosing a preset in Premiere with H.265\nAgain there are substantial time savings to be made here, though sadly none of them seemed to access the dual encoders. But I saw about a 67% speed increase going from the default \u201cGood\u201d to the \u201cLower\u201d setting \u2013 and this time the drop off in quality was completely negligible (only 0.1 VMAF points across all the presets). And getting to 167 FPS is pretty impressive even if not quite the 300 FPS of Davinci Resolve.\n\nShutter Encoder\nShutter Encoder is a popular free encoding tool so I thought I\u2019d give it a look too. It\u2019s very useful and better than Handbrake in lots of ways (e.g. keeps timecode intact). It\u2019s a front end for FFmpeg and by default it\u2019s using the CPU encoders like x264. This is great if you have an older graphics card or you are after the best possible quality. You can force it to use NVENC if you want to for much faster speeds \u2013 in my tests getting a 10x speed increase by changing from the default settings to NVENC \u201cveryfast\u201d. It performed similarly to Premiere with 183 FPS and again didn\u2019t seem to be able to use the dual encoders.\n\nI did find the software encoders gave 1 or 2 more VMAF points for the same material in general, so again it depends if you are trying to squeeze out the last bit of quality and don\u2019t mind spending the time doing that.\nForcing the NVENC preset in the Advanced settings in Shutter Encoder.\nConclusions\nThe Nvidia hardware encoder (NVENC) has been of a very high quality for many generations \u2013 close enough to the quality of software encoders to make it worthwhile and much much faster. In this RTX 4000 series it is even better and the inclusion of dual encoders is quite exciting. Being able to access them in Davinci Resolve is fantastic, bringing encoding speeds up to an impressive 300 FPS by using the fastest presets. And those speeds involve very little drop off in quality, plus you could make up for that anyway by bumping up the bitrate a little, to no real disadvantage.\nI also think it\u2019s time to ditch H.264 for H.265.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nThe next-gen graphics card fight between Nvidia and AMD looks to be heating up ahead of the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX in a week's time as Nvidia is reportedly set to cut the price of its RTX 4080 in mid-December to compete with Team Red's latest flagship.The rumor of the price cut comes courtesy of Twitter leaker Harukaze5719, who says that the price of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 will \"be adjusted\" in mid-December and that Nvidia isn't doing so in response to the forthcoming AMD release, but rather in response to \"its own considerations\", particular its price-to-performance ratio and to help improve sales.According to boardchannels, RTX 4080 will be adjusted price in mid-Dec.However, the source emphasized price cut isn't afraid of RDNA3, but from its own considerations. Price is appropriately reduced to improve price-perf ratio and stimulate sales.https://t.co/M0bXfHqDZIDecember 5, 2022That latter point is definitely possible since it has been reported that scalpers have struggled to sell their ill-gotten graphics cards as they've been able to do in the past. But there is no getting around the fact that AMD's next-gen GPU is right around the corner and that it is priced significantly lower than Nvidia's RTX 4080, and the rumored timing of the RTX 4080 price drop is conspicuously timed to say the least. So what's going on here?\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nSorry, AMD, Nvidia's price tags for its RTX 5000 GPUs could win me over\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5080 has dethroned AMD's RX 7900 XTX at the same price \u2013 but good luck finding one\n\n\n\nNvidia got the pricing of the RTX 4080 terribly, terribly wrong, giving AMD a huge opening\u00a0(Image credit: AMD)Even with a price drop, Nvidia has really bungled the RTX 4080 launch. Not only did it create confusion by initially announcing two RTX 4080 cards, one with 16GB VRAM and one with 12GB, it then \"unlaunched\" the 12GB version, which was also the cheaper of the two cards, leaving both its next-gen cards north of $1,200 (once you factor in tax and/or shipping).Now the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX is also playing that manufacturer's game of claiming, \"Our flagship card is selling for less than $1,000!\" by charging exactly one penny less and declaring a $999.99 victory, but it also has the RX 7900 XT coming in at $900, which means at least one of its launch cards will sell for less than a thousand dollars, and if the performance of these two cards is anything close to what the RTX 4080 has on offer, that pricing advantage for AMD is going to make a massive difference in this kind of economic environment.It seems Nvidia either forgot or doesn't care that nobody has any money right now to drop on a super high-end graphics card, even if it is the best graphics card in the world. Just like the World Cup, AMD can make a major advance on Nvidia's market position by simply fighting Team Green to a tie right now, or even cutting down Nvidia's lead to a narrower margin while still ultimately falling short of Nvidia's best.\u00a0For a lot of PC gamers out here, it really is going to come down to whether something is good enough to upgrade, and since everyone missed out on Nvidia Ampere, there is almost no universe where AMD isn't going to make a super compelling case for Nvidia GTX 1650 owners to make the jump to Team Red this go around.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia RTX 4080 sales have been sluggish, which tells you everything you need to know(Image credit: Future)Even by Nvidia's reasoning, if this report is to be believed, it needs to lower the price of the RTX 4080 to \"stimulate sales.\" We've been keeping track of Nvidia RTX 4090 stock and RTX 4080 stock, and we saw the Nvidia RTX 4090 sell out very, very quickly.Meanwhile, on the RTX 4080's first day of sale, there was still stock available in the UK after 24 hours and it took several hours for the RTX 4080 to sell out in the US, and that might well have been driven those poor unfortunate scalpers who now can't sell their GPUs even at MSRP.It's something we identified immediately in our review of the RTX 4080: its MSRP killed any reason to buy the card. If you're dropping that much cash, you're just going to buy an RTX 4090. Why settle for a $1,200 second-place finish?The sluggish sales of the RTX 4080 seem to bear this out since it really does seem like everyone is waiting to see how well the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT stack up before making a decision. No matter what happens, AMD has at least done what no one else has seemed to be able to do, which is get Nvidia to price its graphics cards more reasonably.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nAMD\nNvidia\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

The latest release offers two main benefits for VMware vSphere:\n\nIncreasing multi-vGPU support up to eight GPUs per virtual machine with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation.\nProviding the ability for a single virtual machine to access multiple fractional GPUs for higher utilization.\n\nFuture-Proof Digital Workspaces With NVIDIA vGPU\nNVIDIA vGPU solutions meet the rising performance demands of any professional application. They also improve IT manageability to centralize apps and data, and deliver future-proofing virtual workspaces that offer improved user experience. NVIDIA vGPU software products include:\n\nNVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (RTX vWS): Enables IT to virtualize any application, including Autodesk AutoCAD, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes SOLIDWORKS, Esri ArcGIS Pro and Siemens NX, with an immersive user experience.\nNVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC): Extends the power of NVIDIA GPUs to cost-effectively deliver an immersive, virtualized hybrid workspace.\nNVIDIA Virtual Applications (vApps): Enable enhanced productivity with virtual GPUs and NVIDIA vApps software for accelerated application streaming, allowing users to access any Windows app at full performance on any device.\n\nThe latest vGPU release enables businesses to deliver scalable, cost-effective virtual desktop infrastructure performance. NVIDIA vGPU technologies bring GPU acceleration to end-user computing solutions, letting enterprises expand their accelerated workloads \u2014 whether on premises or in the cloud.\nWith GPU-powered virtual machines, remote teams can also securely collaborate in real time without risk, from anywhere, using any device. And they\u2019ll achieve the same user experience as a physical PC or workstation.\nWith fractional vGPU support, users can split a single GPU into smaller independent partitions. For example, if multiple graphics-intensive applications are running simultaneously, fractional vGPUs can be provisioned to each workload to ensure they have enough GPU resources for the best performance.\nWith vGPU 15.0, existing customers will need the NVIDIA Licensing System, which is a new system for serving licenses to NVIDIA enterprise software products.\nLearn more about NVIDIA vGPU for virtual desktops.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: Graphics | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Asus)\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a pretty good year for graphics cards, especially if you're Nvidia.AMD and Intel grabbed their share of headlines, but it was Nvidia's name that cropped up more often than not during the supply-and-demand shake-up that swept through the GPU market over the last two years.\u00a0Of course, more often than not we were talking about how expensive Nvidia's graphics cards could be, especially at the height of the global chip shortage.Thankfully graphics card prices finally started to slip down out of the stratosphere in 2022, much to the relief of many. This was the year I finally started to seriously consider building a new gaming PC, and I know I'm not alone. But as I look ahead to 2023 and plan out what GPU to buy when, I have to think about what came out this year and what the big card companies are likely to do in the wake of 2022.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI review gaming PCs for a living, and I'd never buy the RTX 5090 \u2014 here's why\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090: 3 reasons to buy and 2 reasons to skip\n\n\n\nIf you, like me, are wondering what happened this year in GPUs and whether you should buy one now or wait until 2023, read on\u2014here's a brief rundown of what happened to the GPU market in 2022, and what to look for in the year ahead.Nvidia's on top and begging to be challengedNvidia started 2022 riding high, in large part because of the global supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its GeForce 30-series cards started shipping in 2020, at the height of COVID-19 quarantines, and the entire line was a hot commodity from day one. Scalpers and crypto fiends were the scourge of anyone trying to buy a new RTX 3080 in 2020, and similar problems persisted all the way through 2021 and well into 2022.\u00a0In short, if you wanted to buy a new Nvidia GPU at the regular retail price it was almost impossible\u2014until a few months ago, when new 30-series cards started to show up on store shelves in quantities that made it possible for a normal person to buy one for a less-than-extravagant price.Nvidia chief Jensen Huang has led his company to new heights, but the remarkable $1,500+ price tag on the new RTX 4090 (pictured in hand) may prove too high in 2023. (Image credit: Nvidia)Around the same time (October 12th, to be specific) Nvidia launched its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the first of the 40-series cards. This is the current top-of-the-line GeForce GPU, and yet when you look up where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 you have no trouble finding it for MSRP at retailers like Best Buy.\u00a0That's great news for folks with a lot of cash to burn on a new GPU, but it seems like less than great news for Nvidia, who for the last year or two has seen its new GPUs sell out at speeds we haven't seen since Nintendo launched the Wii. But now it seems the global supply of GPUs has caught up to demand, at least for the moment, and that suggests Nvidia's GPU fortunes may fall a bit in 2023.\u00a0a new RTX 3080 GPU is more than powerful enough to play all the latest games at great frameratesIt all hangs on how customers will respond to the rest of the GeForce 40-series cards launching in the year ahead. Now that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 is out alongside the 4090 and they both cost over $1,000, the big question is: What will the other 40-series cards cost?The truth is it may not matter that much, because there's still plenty of 30-series cards in stock at retailers around the world. This remains true even after Nvidia's disappointing Q2 results back in August, when CEO Jensen Huang told investors that the company's earnings were being dragged down by \"excess inventory\" of 30-series cards and thus it would change pricing and reduce the number of those cards sold to vendors. Now, nearly four months later, you can still get a new RTX 3080 for less than its $700 MSRP if you spend a bit of time deal-hunting.While true performance maniacs won't be able to tear their eyes from all the bells and whistles of the new cards (including DLSS 3, which is only available on 40-series Nvidia GPUs), the fact is that a new RTX 3080 GPU is more than powerful enough to play all the latest games at great framerates. And since you can buy one right now for nearly half the price of a new 4090, it looks like Nvidia has set itself up for a backward slide in 2023.AMD could be poised to shine in 2023If PC enthusiasts are turned off by the high prices (and massive power demands) of Nvidia's new 40-series cards, rival AMD will be there to offer an enticing alternative.\u00a0That alternative is the new AMD Radeon RX 7000 series of cards, which will begin arriving on store shelves later this month in the form of the Radeon RX 7900 XT and 7900 XTX. They offer improvements over their predecessors that are similar to what Nvidia's latest cards offer, including performance improvements, better ray tracing support and improved upscaling (via AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution tech).\u00a0But what's perhaps most relevant is the pricing on AMD's new top-of-the-line cards: $999 for the 7900 XTX and $899 for the weaker 7900 XT. That's several hundred dollars less than Nvidia's top-tier cards, and that could make all the difference in 2023.AMD continues to price its cards lower than the competition in what seems like a bid to control the mid-range GPU market -- and in 2023 that could pay off in a big way. (Image credit: AMD)Of course, we'll have to wait and see how true enthusiasts take to AMD's new GPUs before we know how much competition they'll bring to Nvidia's offerings. The RX 7000 series is the first series of Radeon GPUs to feature a chiplet design, which to put it (very) simply, basically means they stack self-contained \"chiplets\" tightly together in linked configurations designed to be more powerful and efficient than a single piece of silicon.\u00a0AMD is the first GPU manufacturer to try this, and it has done so using lessons learned from taking a similar chiplet approach with its CPU designs, most recently the Ryzen 7000 chips. This could be a big differentiator that could help AMD tear some market share from Nvidia in 2023, but we'll have to wait and see how the cards perform before we say for sure.What about Intel?Don't forget about Intel, which re-entered the graphics card market this year after decades away with the launch of its first Intel Arc GPUs. While we saw Arc GPUs showing up in laptops as early as March, we had to wait until October to see the launch of the top-of-the-line Intel Arc A750 and Arc A770 desktop GPUs.\u00a0Intel provided internal benchmarks which make the Arc A770 appear to outperform Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3060 @ 1080p. (Image credit: Intel)These are the two most powerful Arc graphics cards currently on the market, and with starting prices of $289 and $329 (respectively) they're clearly trying to compete with Nvidia and AMD's mid-range cards. With support for hardware-based raytracing, DirectX 12 Ultimate and Intel's new proprietary XeSS upscaling tech, these cards are just as capable of playing modern games well as anything the competition can field.Outlook: A hot GPU summer is comingHowever, it's hard to know how much excitement the market has for these new mid-range cards now that global supply chain issues have eased and it's easier to find more powerful cards in stock for MSRP. We've seen multiple reviews with benchmarks which suggest the Arc 770 can compete with and even outperform the similarly-priced Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 in many games, so Intel seems to have successfully delivered some mid-range competition for AMD and Nvidia in 2022.But we've also seen multiple complaints of buggy drivers in those Intel Arc GPU reviews, suggesting Intel still has some work to do before its graphics cards are reliable recommendations.\u00a0By delaying the launch of desktop Arc GPUs from summer 2022 'til the end of the year, Intel was forced to debut them alongside the latest and greatest from AMD and Nvidia. Now, it seems hard to find anyone talking about the new Arc GPUs over all the noise made by the 40-series and 70-series GeForce and Radeon cards. Intel will have to give us more of a reason to take notice in 2023 if it hopes to build the successful launch of Arc into a well-respected GPU line.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Two weeks ago, Nvidia and tech watchdog GamersNexus agreed on one thing: if your Nvidia RTX 4090 graphic card\u2019s 12VHPWR power cable starts smoking and melting, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t plug it in all the way. But the PCI-SIG standards body is now suggesting that Nvidia and partners should have accounted for that.GPU manufacturers \u201cneed to take all appropriate and prudent measures to ensure end user safety, including testing for the reported problem cases,\u201d reads part of a statement from the PCI-SIG. The group also spends 49 words deflecting any blame away from itself:Members are reminded that PCI-SIG specifications provide necessary technical information for interoperability and do not attempt to address proper design, manufacturing methods, materials, safety testing, safety tolerances or workmanship. When implementing a PCI-SIG specification, Members are responsible for the design, manufacturing, and testing, including safety testing, of their products.The PCI-SIG created the 12VHPWR standard \u2014 as well as all of PCI Express, for that matter \u2014 and there are some good reasons it might want to send this note now.\u201cMembers are responsible for the design, manufacturing, and testing, including safety testing, of their products.\u201dFor one thing, it hopes the new connector will become the standard for PCIe 5.0 graphics cards. That may not happen now that Nvidia\u2019s melting power connectors have become a meme and safety concern. AMD gaming marketing director Sasa Marinkovic practically suggested the 16-pin connector was a fire hazard in a tweet: \u201cStay safe this holiday season,\u201d he wrote, alongside a picture of the two old 8-pin connectors that AMD includes on its latest graphics cards, the RX 7900 XTX and XT.Asus will even have a custom version of the RX 7900 with three 8-pin connectors instead of embracing 12VHPWR. Still, the new AMD cards use PCIe 4.0, not 5.0, so AMD could still switch with its next generation.RelatedNvidia thinks RTX 4090 cables melted because they weren\u2019t fully plugged inGPUs are headed in the wrong directionThe PCI-SIG also probably wants to avoid those who might see the organization\u2019s own upcoming changes to the 12VHPWR cable as evidence that the standards body is to blame. TweakTown reported earlier this month that a new version of the connector extends its shroud over its four data pins. Admittedly, if you compare that tiny change to GamersNexus\u2019 reporting about when and where fried cables are likely to happen, it doesn\u2019t seem like a slightly longer shroud would help. What would help is a design with a more audible click or other indications that the power cable is fully secure.As of November 18th, Nvidia said it had received around 50 reports of burning or melting power cables so far, and it promised replacements for anyone affected by the issue. There\u2019s currently no official recall. One buyer did file a lawsuit in California (PDF), accusing Nvidia of selling the card with \u201ca dangerous power cable plug and socket\u201d that \u201cposes a serious electrical and fire hazard for each and every purchaser.\u201dSee More: TechEntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

PC gamers responded accordingly. Within a year of its release, the 1060 became the most-used GPU in Steam's Hardware and Software Survey, a position it occupied from June 2017 until October 2022.\nThe 1060 owes its longevity to a unique combination of factors\u2014its original value, plus a years-long GPU shortage and inflated pricing for newer models like the RTX 3050 and 3060. But its long reign finally ended in November's data, where the midrange GeForce GTX 1650 finally unseated the 1060. (The same shortage and pricing issues that kept the 1060 on top for so long have also contributed to the 1650's continued availability and viability four years after its release.)\nThe nature of Steam's stat gathering makes its data inherently noisy; it can only capture data volunteered by users who happen to open and use Steam while the data is being collected. This makes it useful for identifying broad trends over time\u2014CPU and GPU market share, the number of CPU cores in most systems, the rough adoption rate of new Windows versions\u2014but not quite as good at measuring data points as specific as \"which individual GPU is the most popular?\" The GTX 1060 actually\u00a0gained share in the Steam data for September and October, which strikes us as not particularly likely given the age of the 1060 and steadily improving availability and pricing for newer models.\nEven so, it has been so many years since any GPU other than the 1060 topped the charts that we thought we'd run down some of the things that have changed in PC gaming over the last five years. If you bought a GTX 1060 when it first took over the Steam leaderboard and then hibernated until 2022, here's just a bit of what you'd notice (strictly PC gaming-wise):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll new GPUs support some kind of hardware-accelerated ray tracing, though performance still varies.\nThe amount of graphics RAM has gone up. The 1060 came in both 3GB and 6GB versions, and high-end GTX 1080 and Titan GPUs from that generation shipped with between 8GB and 12GB. Current GPUs ship with as much as 24GB, and 8GB or 12GB is closer to the floor.\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen CPUs have returned AMD to competitiveness in gaming PCs; AMD's CPU market share in the Steam data rose from 19.01 percent in June 2017 to 32.87 percent in November 2022. That success didn't rub off on AMD's GPU hardware, which saw its share drop from 20 to 15 percent over the same period.\nA majority of PCs use processors with six or more CPU cores. In mid-2017, nearly all PCs in Steam's data used either two or four CPU cores.\nFancy upscaling technologies like Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR 2.0 have made games look nicer when your GPU can't quite play them at your monitor's native resolution. DLSS doesn't support the GTX 1060, but FSR 2.0 does, and if you're still getting by with a 1060, it's one option to make newer games run well on it.\nMonitors have gotten more advanced, with technologies like adaptive sync, high refresh rates, and 4K becoming much more common in new displays. In Steam's data, 1080p is still overwhelmingly the most popular resolution for primary displays, though 1440p and 4K screens have gotten more popular since 2017.\nFast SSDs are becoming more important for game load times, partly thanks to a new console generation that comes standard with speedy PCIe SSDs. It's also cheaper than ever to pick up a decent 1TB or 2TB drive! This is good because game installs are bigger than ever.\nThere's a third competitor in the GPU market for the first time in a couple decades\u2014Intel's Arc GPUs are actually decent, despite bumpy development and launch periods.\n\nWill we ever see another individual GPU become as popular as the GTX 1060 was at its peak? Never say never. But re-creating the conditions of its success\u2014starting with Nvidia launching an RTX 4060 that outruns an RTX 3080 for just $250\u2014doesn't seem especially likely right this minute.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Nvidia GTX 1060 review: The new best budget graphics card\n          \n\n            GTX 1060 is faster than GTX 980, for just a wee bit more cash than AMD's RX 480.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Mark Walton\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\n\n\n\nYou've just taken your shiny new graphics card out of the box and you're ready to pull the old one out and replace it with the more powerful alternative. But before you upgrade the hardware, or even if you've already done that, it's never a bad idea to completely uninstall all the old Nvidia, AMD, and/or Intel drivers, getting rid of all the cruft and potentially freeing up a decent amount of storage in the process.Whether you're upgrading from one Nvidia card to another one or switching brands \u2014 \u00a0going from Nvidia to AMD, vice versa, or even to an Intel Arc GPU \u2014 wiping out any remnants of the older card's software is a good idea. The old drivers could harm performance or even lead to crashes. Also, if you're currently experiencing problems with a graphics card you've had for a while \u2014 crashes, freezes, blue screens \u2014 \u00a0nuking your drivers and starting over from scratch could solve your issues.\u00a0You might think that uninstalling old graphics drivers is a simple process and, on the surface, it is. All three major GPU manufacturers provide the option to uninstall their respective drivers via the Control Panel. Furthermore, you can elect to do a \u201cclean install\u201d when updating to the latest release. And a lot of the time, things will go swimmingly, with your PC and OS none the worse for wear.But sometimes you end up with corrupted drivers that won\u2019t uninstall properly, or perhaps they uninstall but leave behind undesirable remnants (cruft). We\u2019ve experienced situations where performance in a game inexplicably drops, and the only way to ensure your drivers are clean is to really make sure they\u2019re clean.A handy utility appropriately called DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) will do all the dirty work for you. It\u2019s been around quite a few years now and gets routinely updated. It also has support for removing audio drivers as well as graphics. The important thing is that it\u2019s programmed with all the knowledge of where AMD, Intel, and Nvidia store the various registry settings and files, so it knows exactly where to look at what to delete.How to Uninstall Nvidia, AMD or Intel Graphics Drivers Using DDUFollow these steps to get rid of every last piece of your old graphics drivers.1. Download and launch the DDU installer from the Wagnardsoft website. \u00a0This is free software, but the company doesn't make it easy to find the correct download link, because the pages are littered with ads that have \"download\" buttons in them that lead elsewhere.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The best bet is to find the \"download and support\" post for the latest version on Wagnardsoft's forums and click the ***Download DDU Here*** link. At publication time, the latest forum post was for version V18.0.5.9 and going to that link would get you the download link.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)2. Extract DDU to the folder of your choice. It will create a subfolder with a name that contains DDU and the version number. You'll get prompted when newer versions become available when you run the utility.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)3. Boot Windows into Safe Mode (optional). Wagnardsoft recommends that you boot into Safe Mode before running DDU, but this is not absolutely necessary. We have used it in regular mode many times without issue. However, if you're concerned that the program might miss something, you can go into Safe Mode.\u00a0We have an article on how to boot to safe mode in Windows. (That applies to both Windows 10 and 11). The quick answer is to go to Settings->Recovery->Advanced Startup, click Restart Now, wait for it to restart, select Troubleshoot->Advanced Options->Startup Settings->Restart and then enter 4 to Enable Safe Mode.\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)4. Launch Display Driver Uninstaller.exe from the folder the extraction created. Click Yes if prompted by Windows User Account Control. This will bring up the full program. If you are not in Safe Mode, the program will give a dialog box warning you that it recommends Safe Mode. You can click Ok and ignore it.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)5. Click Options if the program isn't already showing you the Options menu (which it does the first time you launch).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)6. Uncheck \"Show offers from our partners\" and check \"Prevent downloads of drivers from 'Windows Update'\" (under Advanced). We also recommend unchecking \"Create a system restore point,\" as that seems unnecessary and could be a waste of space. But if you're concerned, you can leave it checked. Click Close when done.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)7. Select GPU from the device type menu.\u00a0(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)It should automatically detect the brand of GPU that's currently installed and show it on screen. However, if it gets this wrong, you can choose the brand from another pulldown menu.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)If you have installed drivers from other vendors in the past, you can select these from the pulldown menu and then click \"Clean and do NOT restart\" for each of them.8. Click \"Clean and shutdown\" if you are planning to install a new graphics card right now. Click \"Clean and restart\" if you already have the GPU installed.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)DDU will take a minute or two to remove all the drivers and cruft from the brand of graphics card you selected. While it's going, you will see status updates in DDU's log box. It will typically close any open Windows Explorer widows as well, a slight annoyance at times if you're like us and have half a dozen locations open.(Image credit: Future)Remember, if you select Nvidia, it will only remove Nvidia \u00a0drivers so, if you have remnants of other branded drivers, you will need to perform the process on those as well.9. Install your new graphics card (if you haven't already).10. Boot your PC and download and install the appropriate drivers.

If one is experiencing issues with a current driver and needs to install an older, known good version? DDU. Moving to a different brand? DDU. There are several registry entries that are left behind on a standard uninstall, as well as folders and other fragments that can and do have stability and performance implications. Of course it is possible to remove/edit these things oneself, but DDU makes it simple and in many years I have not had an issue using it. I certainly have had issues NOT using it, or at least making the deletions/changing keys myself.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMath Geek\n\n\npeachpuff said:Are you still using windows 98?\n\nI just switched from amd to nvidia and windows 10 isn't as stupid as you think it is.\nso what you're saying is \"it worked for me so it clearly will work for everyone else in the world!!\" this forum has a ton of questions daily that start with \"i changed gpu and it's all kinds of messed up\" if it was so simple, we'd not see these questions. \n\nguess what we suggest each time someone has the issues?? yup that's right, exactly what this article says to do. and guess what?? yah it works just about every time to get it working right. \n\nstop being so nieve to think that just because you did something successfully once, it will always work every time for everyone in all ways.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelicaGT\n\n\nMath Geek said:so what you're saying is \"it worked for me so it clearly will work for everyone else in the world!!\" this forum has a ton of questions daily that start with \"i changed gpu and it's all kinds of messed up\" if it was so simple, we'd not see these questions.\n\nguess what we suggest each time someone has the issues?? yup that's right, exactly what this article says to do. and guess what?? yah it works just about every time to get it working right.\n\nstop being so nieve to think that just because you did something successfully once, it will always work every time for everyone in all ways.\nYou're assuming both that their system is functioning correctly, and that they would have any idea if it wasn't.

Not sure what I did but it took me days to get my PC up and running again. If I was switching from an Nvidia card to an AMD I would maybe use it again but if I'm using the same company I don't bother. Just upgraded from a 3070 to a 4080 and just did a clean driver install with GeForce Experience.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeachpuff\n\n\nMath Geek said:stop being so nieve to think that just because you did something successfully once, it will always work every time for everyone in all ways.Once?

Going from NV to AMD, or Intel? Yes there can be, and often are issues.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 24 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Windows 11 on Raspberry Pi 5 with Botspot Virtual Machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use an RFID reader with a Raspberry Pi Pico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to fix Salmon Skin Problems in 3D Prints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Create 3D Printing Timelapses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate your own Raspberry Pi powered home VOIP service with Mumble\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Convert Texts into 3D Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Run DeepSeek R1 on your Raspberry Pi 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to rip your audio CDs to MP3 from the Linux terminal with abcde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to install a motherboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to enable XMP to improve RAM speeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we're pressing the 'unlaunch' button,\" a news release from October read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany had speculated the card would reappear, reborn as the 4070. And this week, Nvidia confirmed those suspicions after the RTX 4070 TI appeared on the company's 40-series product page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glance over the specs reveals no real surprises here. The card boasts 7,680 CUDA cores, a 2.52GHz boost clock, and 12GB of GDDR6X memory. You may recall, those are the same specs promised by Nvidia's lower-spec RTX 4080.\n\nThe new GPU world order is beginning to take shape\nNvidia admits mistake, 'unlaunches' 12GB RTX 4080\nAMD's latest, greatest Radeon graphics card $600 cheaper than Nvidia's top RTX 4090\nNvidia unveils RTX 4090 \u2013 but it's the 4080 to watch out for\n\nThe \"new\" 40-series card's full spec sheet hasn't been published yet, but it's safe to say it'll use Nvidia's AD104 GPU die, have a 192-bit memory bus, and a 285W TDP. It appears the card's details may have been published early by mistake, but as of Friday morning Nvidia had not removed them for their site.\nWhat we don't know is what the card will retail for. At launch the 12GB 4080 had an MSRP of $899. However, in the months since GTC, the PC market has changed considerably. GPU demand has plummeted in the wake of the crypto-crash, Ethereum merge, and other inflationary pressures.\nWith the launch of AMD's RDNA-3 GPUs last month, Nvidia is facing stiff competition, particularly when it comes to pricing. Team Red's flagship card, the $999 RX 7900 XTX, undercuts Nvidia's RTX 4090 by nearly $600. The more pedestrian RX 7900 XT, meanwhile, retails for $899.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it stands, Nvidia's cheapest 40-series card \u2014 the 16GB RTX 4080 \u2014 has a suggested retail price of $1,199. And while it appears you can actually find cards at that price \u2014 at least in the US \u2014 we've also seen board-partner cards selling for more than $1,700.\nGiven how poorly Nvidia and the broader PC market have performed in recent quarters, it wouldn't be surprising to see the RTX 4070 TI introduced at a lower price this time around. This week, the industry watchers at Wccftech, citing multiple unnamed sources, claimed the card would instead launch at $799.\nIt's also not clear when the card to hit will be available. Nvidia's website claims, rather unhelpfully, that the card is \"coming Month XX.\" But, given the timing of the cards appearance on Nvidia's site, a CES launch early next month seems a likely bet.

The updated, tentative, MSRP of the NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti is $799 and can be read about over here.\nUpdate 9:27 PM GMT+5 12-8-2022: Added clarification on the comments about custom variants.\nSo it turns out that NVIDIA is considering launching the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at an MSRP of $899. This is the pricing that is currently being told to AICs and the one that is tentatively the final MSRP for the upcoming launch. At a Founder's Edition MSRP of $899, partners lucky enough to get custom variants at B2B prices can also expect custom variants ~$50 below this mark (more on this below), making the RTX 4070 Ti (at ~$849) the most affordable Ada Lovelace based NVIDIA GPU yet.\nNVIDIA is thinking of (re)launching the RTX 4070 Ti at the $899 MSRP price point\nNVIDIA had previously launched the NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti as the RTX 4080 12GB and with the (re)launch of the RTX 4070 Ti coming up, AICs have started taking orders from their industry partners for the relatively affordable graphics card. Keep in mind, however, that Jensen wields the black leather jacket and all of us must submit to its power. So he could very well snap his fingers and change the MSRP at the very last moment should he want to. This is also why I am still tagging this post as a rumor - because until the marketing and documentation gets made for the launch, details like this can still change.\nThat said, we *do* have confirmation from multiple sources that this is the price point being used for AICs to start generating orders for the RTX 4070 Ti.\n\n\n\nGPUFP32 TFLOPsMSRPTFLOPs/$Value (%)\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 409082.5915990.05165100.0%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 408048.7411990.0406578.7%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti40.098990.0445986.3%\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, this would make the RTX 4070 Ti have a far better price point than the RTX 4080. One of the reasons for the RTX 4080 not selling as well as the 4090 is because it offers far lower (fp32) performance per dollar. Obviously, other reasons also play a role (like the market segment that will buy the absolute best graphics card will buy the RTX 4090 while the $1199 price point is not low enough to start hitting the mainstream segments) but this is a major pain point and the RTX 4070 Ti should offer decently improved value as you can see from the table above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe lovely thing about this launch is that NVIDIA has alreadyt leaked all the performance numbers themselves. I am talking, of course, about the official performance benchmarks, which place the RTX 4070 Ti (formerly the RTX 4080 12GB) just behind an RTX 3090 Ti.\nThe official graph does not show the RTX 3080 Ti so I presume that it will be slightly ahead of that card and trade punches in some cases. At any rate the RTX 4070 Ti is the true mainstream offering as it is finally starting to hit the $799 sweet spot for mainstream flagships and with the Founder's Edition going for $899, we can expect some custom variants from AICs to be around $849 on official invoices. Of course, the vast majority of AIC sales are not direct to consumers. They will typically sell in bulk to brick and mortar retailers, etailers, partners and system builders (like HP) who will then resell the GPU either alone or as part of a system to the end user. Because the end-user pricing is dictated by market forces, there is very little to be gained by commenting on it.\nIt should also help bring down pricing in the second hand market where new-old-stock RTX 3090s are going for upwards of $1000. With an RTX 4000 series GPU that basically performs the same as an RTX 3090 Ti (but offers vastly improved tech like DLSS 3.0 and RT performance) being sold around $849-899, this would rapidly stabilize prices and finally allow gamers to actually buy second-hand RTX 30 series GPUs for the prices they should be selling at by now.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA RTX 40 GPUs would you consider buying (multiple choice)?\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX 4090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX 4080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: Actual Source\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Drops To $699 & RTX 4070 Drops To $519 US In New GPU Promos\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 & 4070 GPU Inventory Expected To Run Out of Stock As Early As December\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ends GeForce RTX 4080 & 4070 Ti GPU Production As \u201cSUPER\u201d Launch Imminent\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER Packaging Reveals It Might Be The Most Weirdest Name Ever For A GPU\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

GameStream has been a feature of Nvidia Shield devices ever since they were portable, allowing Shield owners to stream games to their TV from a PC at up to 60fps in 4K resolution.Shield owners will be disappointed to hear that Nvidia isn\u2019t just discontinuing its GameStream feature, but it\u2019s actually going to remove it from devices. An update due in mid-February will totally remove the GameStream feature, in a bizarre move after nearly 10 years.Nvidia recommends Steam Link insteadNvidia is recommending that Shield users switch to Steam Link, which is a similar way of streaming PC games to a Shield device. You\u2019ll need the Steam Link app on your Shield TV to get access to streaming games from your gaming PC. Nvidia also lists GeForce Now as an alternative, but you won\u2019t get 4K streaming and high frame rates without subscribing to the cloud gaming service.You can refuse the Nvidia Games app update and GameStream will continue working for some time, but Nvidia warns it \u201cwill no longer be supported and eventually will stop working.\u201d You\u2019ll also need the latest Nvidia Games app to access services like GeForce Now.An alternative could be using Moonlight, an open source implementation of Nvidia\u2019s GameStream protocol. Moonlight uses a third-party set of clients and Nvidia\u2019s protocol to play PC games on almost any device. It should be possible to continue using alternatives like Sunshine as a GameStream host for Moonlight.Nvidia hasn\u2019t explained why it\u2019s removing GameStream, but we\u2019ve reached out to the company for comment on the removal and we\u2019ll update you accordingly.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

However, experts like Digital Foundry's Alexander Battaglia pointed out that some of the water reflections seen in the trailer of The Witcher 3 Next-Gen seemed to indicate ray-tracing was in use.\nToday, amidst their RTX and DLSS update post for December, NVIDIA confirmed that, indeed, The Witcher 3 Next-Gen features ray-traced reflections.\nRelated Story Atomic Heart Ditches Ray Tracing on PC at the Very Last Minute\nRTX Global Illumination\u00a0(RTXGI) adds more immersive and realistic outdoor ray-traced lighting\nRay-traced ambient occlusion improves shading around objects occluding light\nRay-traced shadows improve the fidelity, clarity, and visibility of shadows\nRay-traced reflections increase the accuracy and quality of reflections on bodies of water and other suitably reflective surfaces\n\nOn top of that, Ultra+ settings increase draw distances, foliage density, background character detail, asset quality, and more. Texture resolutions are increased, and environments gain new geometric detail.\nIt's hard to imagine why they wouldn't say that outright in the reveal live stream. Perhaps it was a simple slip-up or a last-minute addition. Either way, we can't wait to check it out once The Witcher 3 Next-Gen hits on December 14th. As a reminder, The Witcher 3 Next-Gen also supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 (for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs), DLSS 2 (for GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series GPUs), and NVIDIA Reflex (for GeForce GTX 90 Series GPUs and upward).\nIn related ray tracing news, NVIDIA is expanding Minecraft with RTX next week.

This was revealed during the Credit Suisse 26th Annual Tech conference. We know that the market was recently flooded with an over-excess of used GPUs due to the crypto craze coming to an end and with prices falling down on last-gen GPUs, both in retail and used markets, there was little to no demand for any more GPUs. With that said, NVIDIA is now starting to refresh its older RTX 30 GPUs with new offerings and resuming shipments to stabilize its channel inventory and backlog.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingThe company expects that their channel inventory would be back to normal by the end of Q4 and they will resume shipments starting 1H 2023. The company also anticipates building up its channel for the Ada launch and all the additional Ada-based GPUs (Desktops/Workstations/Laptops) coming to the market.\n\nSo we have been under-shipping. We have been under-shipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.\nAnd as we discussed, we plan, hopefully, by the end of Q4, as we approach the end of Q4, that we will be in a solid position to that. That means as we move forward, we will start to get back up. We'll get to some point of an equilibrium between sell-through and sell-in. And then we will likely get to where we'll be selling in to build the channel for our Ada launch and all of the additional Ada products that we will see coming to market.\nColette Kress, NVIDIA Chief Financial Officer\nKress also reports that NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 are still in their early days. We know from our previous reports that NVIDIA had shipped around 160,000 RTX 40 series graphics cards since the mid of November. This number might be higher now but we also know that bulk of the shipments includes the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card which has been the highlight launch of the Ada family so far. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 on the other hand hasn't seen as much of a response as the RTX 4090 owing to its poor performance to dollar value. Even scalpers who got the cards and tried to sell them at absurd prices are resorting to selling them at the MSRP since no one is interested in them.\nAda is just in the early days right now of shipping. We have shipped, one of our very high-end cards are 4090 and our 4080 is just now starting to sell as well.\nColette Kress, NVIDIA Chief Financial Officer\n\nIt is also pointed out that NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090, despite being the flagship with a starting price of $1599 US, sold out within 2 weeks. We know that NVIDIA initially shipped 100,000 cards (GeForce RTX 4090) so that's very impressive if the chipmaker managed to sell the entirety of its stock in under 2 weeks.\nOur Ada launch, 4090 when it came out, yes, it was only the very first card and the high-end card, it's sold out in 2 weeks. So we're very pleased to see something that was a nod for us, that we knew that gaming, no matter what time of year, no matter what the situation is still a very important entertainment industry.\nColette Kress, NVIDIA Chief Financial Officer\nNVIDIA has also pointed out their popularity by including numbers from Steam's hardware survey. The company states that the top 15 cards on the SHS are from NVIDIA. The GTX 1650 recently took up the top spot with a 6.27% market share, followed by the GTX 1060 at 5.77% market share & the RTX 2060 taking up the 3rd spot as the only 'RTX' graphics card with a 4.64% market share. Neither the RTX 4090 nor RTX 4080 have so far shown up in the Steam Hardware Survey but they should be starting to take up some share by Q1 2023.\n\n\nWe did see some great new gamers joining that market and taking advantage of the leadership that we have in terms of gaming. Not only is Ada a leader in the industry, so as Ampere. So number 1 and number 2 top architectures are NVIDIA. We continue to watch what we see in terms of Steam. Steam has still a record level of gamers online, gaming. And the top 15 cards on Steam are NVIDIA, all 15 out of 15. So this is an area that gamers will be gamers for life. And we watch this industry both at the great times and also during some of the hard times. It is a sport that is economical because you can choose many different form factors at many different price points for the gaming that you want to do.\nColette Kress, NVIDIA Chief Financial Officer\nNVIDIA is expected to introduce more mainstream GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards in the first half of 2023. The company recently scored big-time in the latest discrete GPU market share report, claiming up to 88% market share according to the JPR report. We can expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters till NVIDIA and AMD enter the mid-range segment where the majority of the market share comes from.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n62\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The two companies, which have been working on the partnership for the past 18 months, plan to develop a wide range of regulatory compliant AI-powered services. In addition, Deutsche Bank said working closely with Nvidia will enable it to accelerate its digital transformation efforts by using AI to simplify and accelerate decisions around cloud migration, for example.\nThe two companies are planning to collaborate in many different areas, but the one with the most potential is risk model development. Important tasks in the banking sector, such as price discovery, risk valuation and model backtesting, involve doing lots of computationally intensive calculations. These are traditionally done using massive central processing unit-driven server grid farms.\nHowever, Deutsche Bank said it will instead tap Nvidia\u2019s expertise in accelerated computing, powered by graphics processing units and coupled with AI, to enable traders to manage risk better by running more scenarios faster. Deutsche Bank said many functions that were typically processed overnight, such as risk valuation, can now be performed in real time thanks to Nvidia\u2019s accelerated compute.\nAs part of the collaboration, Deutsche Bank said it will leverage the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform that\u2019s used to streamline the development of AI models on-premises or in the cloud. This will give it the flexibility it needs to run AI workloads wherever they\u2019re required, the bank explained.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and AI are at a tipping point, and we\u2019re bringing them to the world\u2019s enterprises through the cloud,\u201d said Nvidia founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang. \u201cEvery aspect of future business will be supercharged with insight and intelligence running at the speed of light. Together with Deutsche Bank, we are modernizing and reimagining the way financial services are operated and delivered.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank is also looking at ways in which AI can be used to deliver new, interactive experiences for employees, potential recruits and customers that involve using 3D virtual avatars, it said. During its exploratory work with Nvidia, Deutsche Bank used Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse Enterprise platform to create a 3D virtual avatar to help new employees navigate internal banking systems and respond to questions from its human resources department. Looking ahead, Deutsche Bank will work with Nvidia to create additional immersive metaverse experiences for its banking clients, with digital avatars and virtual assistants powered by AI.\nAnother major use case Deutsche Bank is looking into is the extraction of useful insights from the masses of unstructured data it collects. While AI has already proven its worth in data analytics in the past, the problem for banks is that existing models don\u2019t perform very well when it comes to unstructured, financial texts. Deutsche Bank is instead looking to use new neural networks known as \u201ctransformers\u201d to improve this. It explained that a single, pretrained transformer model is capable of performing amazing feats already, including text generation, translation and even software programming.\nAs such, Deutsche Bank has already begun working with Nvidia to test a collection of AI models called \u201cFinformers,\u201d or financial transformers, that can tap unstructured data to spot early warning signs of counterparty risk, fraud, issues with data quality and more.\nFinally, Deutsche Bank said it\u2019s planning to work with Nvidia to expand its existing internal AI center of excellence to support the experimentation and development of AI services and professional skills development. Ultimately, it wants to develop, foster and promote explainable and responsible AI models that can expand its understanding of AI predictions in financial services.\n\u201cThis partnership is a significant step forward in our AI and ML ambitions,\u201d said Bernd Leukert, a Deutsche Bank board member responsible for technology, data and innovation.\nPhoto: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Tests\nG-SYNC\n\nUpdated Dec 16, 2022 at 09:24 am \n\n\n         By Nicholas Di Giovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat it is:\n    An implementation of variable refresh rate that works with NVIDIA graphics cards.\n  \n\nWhen it matters:\n    If you have an NVIDIA graphics card.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor manufacturers have come up with new technology in recent years to improve your gaming experience. One of those is variable refresh rate (VRR) support which matches the refresh rate of your monitor with the frame rate of your source, even if the frame rate drops. This helps reduce screen tearing and helps to provide a smooth gaming experience.\nThere are different types of VRR produced by different companies, and one is NVIDIA's G-SYNC feature. For VRR to work, the monitor has to be compatible with your graphics card's VRR feature. Before 2019, only G-SYNC monitors worked with NVIDIA graphics cards, but since then, monitors that natively support AMD's FreeSync VRR feature can still work with NVIDIA graphics cards thanks to the G-SYNC Compatibility feature.\nWe test every monitor with an NVIDIA graphics card to see which type of G-SYNC it has, whether native or compatible. This test is part of a bigger test where we look at its refresh rate range and different types of VRR support.\nYou can learn more about the entire Refresh Rate and Variable Refresh Rate tests here.\n\n\n\nTest results\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen It Matters\nIf you have an NVIDIA graphics card, you'll want to know if the monitor you want to buy can implement its VRR feature with it. If you want a native G-SYNC monitor, you know that it works with an NVIDIA graphics card, but if you have a native FreeSync monitor, you'll want to look at this test to see if it works.\n\n\n\nOur Tests\n\nFor our tests, we use a test PC with an NVIDIA RTX 3000 Series graphics card connected to the monitor. It's a fairly straightforward test as we open the NVIDIA Control Panel to see which type of G-SYNC support it has (Native or Compatible), use the NVIDIA Pendulum Demo to see the refresh rate range at which it works, and then look for any screen tearing, bugs, or flicker. We also play a few games to see if there are any problems.\n\nG-SYNC\n\n\n\nWhat it is:\n    An implementation of variable refresh rate that works with NVIDIA graphics cards.\n  \n\nWhen it matters:\n    If you have an NVIDIA graphics card.\n  \n\n\nThere are four different possibilities of results for this test. Each result tells us something different about the monitor, and while native FreeSync monitors can still work with NVIDIA graphics cards, there are a few extra advantages you get with a native G-SYNC monitor too.\nNo:\u00a0Some displays simply aren't compatible with NVIDIA's G-SYNC technology as there's screen tearing. This is becoming increasingly rare, as most monitors at least work with G-SYNC.\n\nA certified G-SYNC Compatible display - MSI Optix MAG274QRF-QD\n\nCompatible (NVIDIA Certified):\u00a0NVIDIA officially certifies some monitors to work with their G-SYNC compatible program, and you can see the full list of certified monitors\u00a0here. On certified displays, G-SYNC is automatically enabled when connected to at least a 10-series NVIDIA card over DisplayPort. NVIDIA tests them for compatibility issues and only certifies displays that work perfectly out of the box, but they lack the G-SYNC hardware module found on native G-SYNC monitors.\nThe simplest way to validate that a display is officially G-SYNC compatible is to check the 'Set up G-SYNC' menu from the NVIDIA Control Panel. G-SYNC will automatically be enabled for a certified compatible display, and it'll say 'G-SYNC Compatible' under the monitor name. Most of the time, this works only over DisplayPort, but with newer GPUs, it's also possible to enable G-SYNC over HDMI with a few monitors and TVs, but these are relatively rare.\nWe use the Pendulum Demo and check games to see if there are any noteworthy issues or oddities.\n\nAn unofficial G-SYNC Compatible display -\u00a0Gigabyte AORUS FI32U\n\nCompatible (Tested):\u00a0Monitors that aren't officially certified but still have the same 'Enable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible' setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel get 'Compatible (Tested)' instead of 'NVIDIA Certified'. However, you'll see on the monitor name that there isn't a certification here. There isn't a difference in performance between the two sets of monitors, and there could be different reasons why it isn't certified by NVIDIA, including NVIDIA simply not testing it. As long as the VRR support works over its entire refresh rate range, the monitor works with an NVIDIA graphics card.\n\nA native G-SYNC Display - Dell Alienware AW2721D\n\nYes (Native):\u00a0Displays that natively support G-SYNC have a few extra features when paired with an NVIDIA graphics card. They can dynamically adjust their overdrive to match the content, ensuring a consistent gaming experience. Some high refresh rate monitors also support the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer to measure the latency of your entire setup.\nLike with certified G-SYNC compatible monitors, G-SYNC is automatically enabled on Native devices. Instead of listing them as G-SYNC Compatible in the 'Set up G-SYNC page', Native monitors are identified as simply 'G-SYNC Capable' below the monitor name. We don't specify if it has a standard G-SYNC certification or G-SYNC Ultimate, as both are considered the same for this testing.\nFor this test, we ensure G-SYNC is enabled from the NVIDIA Control Panel and use the NVIDIA Pendulum Demo to ensure G-SYNC is working correctly. If we have any doubts, we'll check with a few games to ensure it's working with real content.\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\nG-SYNC vs FREESYNC vs HDMI Forum VRR\nAs mentioned earlier, there are different types of VRR formats, and the most common ones now are FreeSync, G-SYNC, and HDMI Forum VRR. They all present the same advantages for a nearly tear-free gaming experience, and the differences between them are on supported devices. Most graphics cards and monitors support at least FreeSync or G-SYNC, if not both, but HDMI Forum VRR is relatively new and isn't available on as many devices. It's part of\u00a0HDMI 2.1 certification\u00a0and is the only VRR format that the PlayStation 5 supports. The Xbox Series X, on the other hand, supports both HDMI Forum VRR and FreeSync. There's a relationship between G-SYNC and HDMI Forum VRR because any native G-SYNC monitor also supports HDMI Forum VRR.\nLearn more about G-SYNC vs FreeSync\nOfficially Supported Monitors\nNVIDIA has a list of certified monitors that they update to show each monitor's certification. You can see the current list on NVIDIA's website. If your monitor is supposed to be supported but isn't working, make sure the monitor's firmware and your graphics card's drivers are up to date.\nNote that the list on NVIDIA's website isn't always perfectly up-to-date;\u00a0there may be other models supported that haven't been listed.\nHow To Get The Best Results\nTo enable the VRR support, you must first select \"G-SYNC Compatible\" from the\u00a0Setup G-SYNC\u00a0setting under NVIDIA Control Panel. From there, you can enable G-SYNC for either full-screen mode or both full-screen and windowed mode.\nIf you don't see this option, there are a few things you can check:\n\nMake sure you're using a supported graphics card.\nUse a DisplayPort connection. For many G-SYNC compatible (native FreeSync monitors), the G-SYNC support only works with a DisplayPort connection. Monitors with HDMI 2.1 bandwidth should work with G-SYNC over both HDMI and G-SYNC. We'll make a note in the text of the review which connections support G-SYNC.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nG-SYNC is one of the common variable refresh rate (VRR) formats to reduce screen tearing when the frame rate of your game drops. For VRR to work, both the monitor and graphics cards need to work with the same VRR format, and our G-SYNC test checks to see if a monitor supports G-SYNC VRR with an NVIDIA graphics card. Most modern monitors are at least G-SYNC compatible, which is a nice addition, as pre-2019, you needed a native G-SYNC monitor to work with NVIDIA graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: People walk past a TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) logo at the Taiwanese semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company building in Hsinchu.)\n\n\n\n\nBetween sanctions against China and the United States CHIPS act potentially slowing business in Taiwan, the semiconductor industry is ready for a big shakeup. Of course much of this has been orchestrated by the United States to bring more business into the country. Europe did much the same with its own act, and while Taiwan will likely continue to dominate the semiconductor industry for a while to come, we're starting to see some slight changes.\u00a0The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, or TSMC is one of the biggest chip producers around, especially when it comes to advanced manufacturing. According to NikkeiAsia, TSMC is about to bring some of that power to the United States by manufacturing its 4nm chips out of a new plant in Arizona. This is despite TSMC founder Morris Chang's previous statements, claiming US-based manufacturing would be too expensive.TSMC already has customers lined up for the United States based plant, and they're not small names either. Both Apple and Nvidia are set to be two of the first to have chips manufactured at the new fab, with other US developers like AMD said to also be in talks to have their turn at the home-based facilities.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nTSMC reportedly plots 2027 start date for its 3 nm US fab, but will that be in time to save next-gen GPUs from tariffs?\n\n\n\n\nAMD is now reportedly making all-American Ryzen 9000 CPU dies at TSMC's Arizona fab\n\n\n\nHaving TSMC set up on North American soil is a huge win for the CHIPS act, proving that it can already tempt high profile companies with the various government subsidies. This push to have advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities within the United States has been massive, and is seen as vital for the future of building tech. As such, it's no surprise that President Biden is set to attend a ceremony as the first equipment is installed at the facility.\u00a0Peak Storage(Image credit: Future)Best SSD for gaming: the best solid state drives around\nBest PCIe 4.0 SSD for gaming: the next gen has landed\nThe best NVMe SSD: this slivers of SSD goodness\nBest external hard drives: expand your horizons\nBest external SSDs: plug in upgrades for gaming laptops and consolesOriginally, the Arizona fab was only set to build 5nm and 4nm chips for things like the iPhone 14 series, at about the rate of 20,000 wafers per month. This new plan means the plant will be pumping out state of the art 3nm wafers at a higher capacity. Having these highly advanced chips made in the United States seems to be exactly the kind of thing the government was hoping for. Especially given they're only currently produced by TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.But it's also very likely this investment didn't come cheap. TSMC as a company has already poured $12 billion just into the original plan for the plant. There currently aren't any figures addressing what it took to push this 4nm fab to a 3nm one, but I'm guessing it's a figure difficult to comprehend. Here's hoping it's scalable with 2nm chips set to come out in 2026.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nHope CorriganSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterHope\u2019s been writing about games for about a decade, starting out way back when on the Australian Nintendo fan site Vooks.net.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorDec 27, 2022, 09:04am ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.Nvidia's soon to be released GeForce RTX 4070 Ti has beaten the RTX 3090 Ti in a recent benchmark leak. The previous flagship graphics card was beaten by a score of 688 to the RTX 4070 Ti's 725. That's a five percent boost over the RTX 3090 Ti, 11 percent over the RTX 3090 and 30 percent faster than the RTX 3080.\nNvidia's RTX 4070 Ti  has beaten the RTX 3090 Ti in a leaked benchmark resulthttps://render.otoy.com/\n\nThe result, reported by Videocardz and posted online in a post on Laptopvideo2go via OctaneBench, isn\u2019t conclusive proof of performance as there are no system details so a direct comparison is likely not what we\u2019re looking at here.\n\nHowever, the other results do fall in line with where we generally expect the other graphics cards to be in the graph. While not a gaming benchmark, it's still useful for guaging GPU performance.\n\nForbesNvidia RTX 4080 Vs RTX 4090 Vs RTX 3090 Ti: Which Should You Buy?By Antony Leather\nIn another benchmark comes off the back of another leaked set of benchmarks this time on Geekbench, with the RTX 4070 Ti sitting between the RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 3090, with Notebookcheck reporting on additional details last week.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nRTX 4070 Ti cards have already been spotted at retailersReddit/CouncilorIrissa\n\nEverything else we know about the RTX 4070 Ti\nThee RTX 4070 Ti is rumored to have 12GB of GDDR6X memory, 7680 CUDA cores and will likely use an AD104 GPU core. Pricing for the RTX 4070 Ti has not been released but it's expected to have a launch price of between $800-1,000 given the RTX 4080 hot shelves at an MSRP of $1,199 and RTX 4080 at $1,599.\n\n\nThe RTX 3080 is readily available for $700 so given the above benchmarks suggest the RTX 4070 Ti will be around 20-30 percent faster than this, perhaps even more if you factor in Ray Tracing and DLSS performance, a launch price of $800-1000 seems logical. Wccftech has also just released new pricing information for an MSI Gaming X Trio model, which in China is retailing for the equivalent of $1,034.\nA $1,000 price tag will see it compete directly with AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, which were released earlier this month. Pricing will be key for Nvidia here given the $999 RX 7900 XTX was already matching or bettering the RTX 4080 in many games, especially away from ray tracing.\nPricing has been a hot topic in 2022, with many PC gamers complaining about the high cost of graphics cards, especially new models, despite the crypto mining craze coming to an end. The RTX 4070 Ti doesn't seem to be bucking that trend and we'll likely have to wait for RTX 4060 or 4060 Ti models for anything under $700. However, a Serbian retailer was seen selling them for the equivalent of $1,400, which is clearly breaking the availability embargo and trying to cash in seeing as RTX 4080's are readily available for less.\nThe RTX 4070 Ti is expected to launch in the first week of January, making it one of the first major PC hardware launches of 2023. I'll be publishing a full review of the card at launch and comparing it against the likes of the RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 3080 and RTX 4080 so follow me here on Forbes using the blue botton or on YouTube for the full review.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The first commercially available electric tractors with autonomy also launched this year, packing AI to support more sustainable farming practices.\nMeanwhile, startups worldwide are developing energy-efficient autonomy with NVIDIA Jetson AI that supports the planet.\nTake a peek at some of the top robots of the year.\nMonarch Tractor Plows New Path\nDevelopers have been digging into agriculture technologies for the past several years, but Monarch Tractor in December released a revolutionary new electric tractor that checks a lot of boxes.\nMonarch, based in Livermore, Calif., unveiled the first commercially available tractor with autonomy, which is compatible with computer vision-guided smart implements like precision sprayers for herbicides.\nUsing six NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX system-on-modules, Monarch\u2019s Founder Series MK-V tractors are essentially roving robots.\nFarmers won\u2019t get range anxiety with these either. The highly capable sustainable farming tractor can run all day on a charge. The NVIDIA Jetson platform provides energy-efficient computing to the MK-V, which offers advances in battery performance.\nWith plans to scale up production in 2023, Monarch\u2019s debut marks a Tesla moment for tractors.\n\nCartken Puts Delivery Bots in Reach\nFood delivery has been a hot ticket with consumers, driving mobile apps that deliver from restaurants. An offshoot of this, robot food delivery startups are assisting some of these companies.\nCartken, based in Oakland, Calif., is serving Grubhub and Starbucks deliveries with its robot. It\u2019s among a growing pack of robots-as-a-service companies that harness NVIDIA Jetson for edge AI.\nThe startup relies on the Jetson AGX Orin module to run six cameras to support mapping and navigation as well as the complete sense, perceive and control stack.\nCartken joins the food party as startup Kiwibot is making a splash here, too. And Cartken has thousands of reservations for its on-demand robot service, according to the company.\nRobot deliveries are poised to boom. Robotic last-mile delivery is expected to grow more than 9x to $670 million in revenue in 2030, up from $70 million in 2022, according to ABI Research.\nFraunhofer IML Aims at Warehouse Efficiencies\nRobots, particularly autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), are playing a big role in creating supply chain efficiencies.\nLike many working on robotics innovations \u2014 including BMW, Amazon and Siemens \u2014 German research firm Fraunhofer IML relies on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and operating metaverse applications. It\u2019s harnessing the platform to make advances in applied research in logistics for fulfillment and manufacturing.\nFraunhofer IML taps into the NVIDIA Isaac Sim application to make leaps in robot design with simulation. Fraunhofer\u2019s O3dyn robot uses NVIDIA simulation and robotics technologies to create an indoor-outdoor AMR.\nIt aims to deliver fast-moving AMRs that aren\u2019t yet available on the market.\n\nTelexistence Deploying Hundreds of Restocking Bots\nLockdowns and labor shortages of the past few years put empty retail store shelves around the world in the spotlight.\nTelexistence, based in Tokyo, recently announced plans to deploy NVIDIA AI-driven robots for restocking shelves at hundreds of FamilyMart convenience stores in Japan. They are also using the power of simulation with Isaac Sim so the developers are not left waiting to develop and debug the product.\nThe startup is helping to create efficiencies and keep shelves fresh by applying robots to repetitive tasks like beverage restocking. This frees up retail employees to handle more complex challenges, like customer service.\nNext up, it plans to expand to U.S convenience stores.\nScythe Rolls Out Autonomous Lawn Mower\nScythe, based in Boulder, Colo., is taking reservations for its M.52 autonomous electric lawn mower.\nThe startup\u2019s M.52 mower gathers data from eight cameras and more than a dozen sensors, processed by NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge AI computing modules.\nScythe plans to rent its machines to customers in a robots-as-as-service model, or RaaS, based on acreage of cut grass, reducing upfront costs.\nIt has more than 7,500 reservations for its on-demand robot service so far, according to the company.\nThe lawn robot company is a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, as are Cartken and Monarch Tractor.\n\u00a0\n\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Isaac platform for robotics and apply to join NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Inception | Machine Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Image Credits: CNET)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowly but surely, details surrounding NVIDIA's upcoming Blackwell architecture are starting to coalesce and become concrete. We heard of the name a while ago, saw the GPU nomenclature leaked and then heard rumors that NVIDIA is in talks with TSMC to develop Blackwell on the TSMC's 3nm node but this is the first (pseudo) official confirmation that the architecture will, in fact, launch in 2024 as expected.\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPUs will succeed Hopper in 2024: GB100, GB102 and GB202 GPUs in the pipeline\nWhile answering a question at the Arete Tech Conference 2022, Ian Buck of NVIDIA reiterated that the company is fully committed to launching a major GPGPU architecture every 2 years and Hopper was released this year. This was in response to potential new developments in 2023 and confirms that the Blackwell GPU architecture will be launched in 2024 (since we know that is the architecture to succeed Hopper), which was the expected timeline based on NVIDIA's historical cadence anyways.\nDavid Blackwell is the inspiration for NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell architecture.\nQ: ....maybe touch on some of the sort of customer reactions to the new products and what you think is happening at the bleeding edge of AI and how you see this all evolving into 2023?\nA: .....We are making new GP architectures every two years. We have committed to a new CPU architecture also every two years and it was very exciting to launch Hopper this year.\"\n......\"So, I think, it\u2019s going to be exciting, it is exciting and this Hopper transition is just yet another turn of the crank the 2023 will bring even more and we will -- and again, 2024, happy to keep coming back to you guys and telling you what the next thing is as we.\"\n-Ian Buck, VP and GM, Datacenter Business, NVIDIA via Seeking Alpha\nNVIDIA Hopper was the world's fastest 4nm GPU at launch and the world's first with HBM3 memory. It features higher specifications than even the NVIDIA RTX 4090 (which contains 16,384 CUDA cores) at a net total of 18,432 CUDA cores. Blackwell will provide significant generational improvement over Hopper (as has always been the case). Four NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs have already been confirmed in a prior leak.\nThe text string that was initially found in the dump is also given below (courtesy of Videocardz):\nImage credits: Videocardz.com\nFollowing is a short bio taken from the Wikipedia page of Dr. David Blackwell.\nDavid Harold Blackwell (April 24, 1919 \u2013 July 8, 2010) was an American statistician and mathematician who made significant contributions to game theory, probability theory, information theory, and statistics. He is one of the eponyms of the Rao\u2013Blackwell theorem. He was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, the first black tenured faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley, and the seventh African American to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics.\nNot much else is known about the Blackwell GPU series at this point (obviously) since it is nothing more than a string of text at this point. All we know is that this series is likely going to be slotted in after the Hopper GPUs (which was released in parallel with the mainstream Ada Lovelace GPUs). It is now confirmed that this nomenclature does not refer to consumer GPUs but refers to the Hopper successor.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Explains The \u201cMarvelous\u201d Design Of The GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition; Revealing How They Shrank The Size By More Than 40%\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Flagship \u201cRTX Blackwell\u201d Workstation GPU Surfaces Online; Featuring 96GB GDDR7 Memory With 512-Bit Interface\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 5090 FE Gets Officially Unboxed, Reveals A New \u201cEco-Friendly\u201d Packaging & First In-Depth Looks\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell \u201cRTX 50\u201d GPU Architecture Detailed: Advanced Cores, DLSS 4, Next-Gen Gaming Technologies & More\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n88\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n41\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Wilson, Wccftech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK online retailer AWD-IT recently reduced the price of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card from \u00a31,429.99 to \u00a31,099.99 which is \u00a3100 below MSRP. Since the initial release of the Palit version of the RTX 4080, the price has dropped close to \u00a3330. Converting to USD, the card has dropped just over $405.\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080 Sees Huge Price Cut In UK, Drops \u00a3100 Below MSRP\nThe actual price reduction on the site was not as dramatic, as the price had changed from \u00a31,199.99 to \u00a31,099.99. The MSRP in the United Kingdom is closer to the United States MSRP on NVIDIA GPUs, but this current drop in price is below the current MSRP set by NVIDIA. The card is also factory-clocked.\nPrice comparisons in the UK show that the most affordable NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU from the company's partners is the Palit GameRock OmniBlack. This current pricing is very close in comparison to the OmniBlack. The difference between the two graphics cards from Palit is that the Midnight Kaleidoscope offers additional RGB lighting on the card that the other version does not provide.\nPalit NVIDIA RTX 4080 GameRock 16GB GPU. Image source: AWD-IT via VideoCardz.\nNVIDIA is in a position to lower the cost of the RTX 4080 graphics cards to compete with AMD and their release, which is just over a week away. The decision to lower the price would benefit the company as AMD's initial graphics card from their new line will go toe-to-toe with the RTX 4080 Ada Lovelace GPU series. The only hesitation from NVIDIA on adjusting the price would depend on AMD's stock upon launch. If AMD cannot keep up with demand, NVIDIA could keep the cost the same and reap the benefits of having a public need for consumer graphics cards.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB graphics card has a diminished AD103-300 GPU structure with 9,728 cores and 84 GPU units. The RTX 4080 offers a total of 64 MB of L2 cache and 224 ROPs. The graphics card presents a boost clock rate of 2505 MHz. Besides the 16GB of onboard memory, the new card series offers as high as 720 GB/s of bandwidth.\nNews Sources: AWD-IT, VideoCardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Built on the company\u2019s new RDNA 3 architecture, AMD\u2019s current-gen graphics cards deliver comparable performance to Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Not only that, but both GPUs cost hundreds of dollars less in comparison. They'd rest comfortably inside the best gaming PCs.Price alone might make AMD's GPUs more appealing to some folks. However, there are other important factors worth considering. Are you willing to sacrifice certain features to save money, or are you comfortable spending big for a GPU with a bunch of proverbial bells and whistles?Below, we\u2019ll compare the AMD Radeon RX 7900 and Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs and try to determine an overall winner.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 GPUs revealed \u2014 everything you need to know\n\n\n\n\nCan AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT dethrone Nvidia's RTX-50 series? Let's talk GPU specs\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 vs Nvidia RTX 40 series: PriceGenerally speaking, AMD\u2019s GPUs (and CPUs) are easier on the wallet than its competitors. The same holds true for its Radeon RX 7000 graphics cards.The top-of-the-line Radeon RX 7900 XTX costs $999 while the less powerful Radeon RX 7900 XT comes in at $899. This is a price hike from the previous generation, as the Radeon RX 6900 XT cost $679 while the more powerful 6950 XT sold for $849.The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT cost $999 and $899, respectively. (Image credit: AMD)While AMD has a reputation for releasing relatively affordable components, Nvidia is known for releasing premium-priced GPUs. This is the case with the company\u2019s RTX 40 series.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 has a $1,199 price tag, while the beefier RTX 4090 has a starting price of \u00a0$1,599. These cards also see a price hike from their predecessors \u2014 the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, which were priced at $699 and $1,499 (respectively) at launch.Price-wise, AMD\u2019s Radeon GPUs are the clear winner compared to Nvidia. Only the Intel Arc A750 ($289) and Intel Arc A770 ($329) cost less.AMD Radeon RX 7000 vs Nvidia RTX 40 series: SpecsSwipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTXNvidia RTX 4090Nvidia RTX 4080Price$899$999$1,599$1,199Compute units8496N/AN/ARay accelerators8496N/AN/AGame frequency2000 MHz2300 MHzN/AN/AInfinity Cache8096N/AN/AMax memory size20GB GDDR624GB GDDR624GB GDDR6X16GB GDDR6XThe Radeon RX 7900 XT and 7900 XTX are the first AMD GPUs built on the company's new RDNA 3 architecture. What's perhaps more intriguing is that these are the first AMD GPUs to feature a chiplet design, something competitors Intel and Nvidia have not (yet) attempted. AMD is more familiar with the technology, having already employed it in the design of its new Ryzen 7000 CPUs.Understanding how chiplet GPUs differ, performance-wise, from more traditional GPU designs is a complicated topic. Our sibling site Tom's Hardware has an excellent in-depth interview with AMD's Sam Naffziger about entering the GPU chiplet era and what it means for the industry. For simplicity\u2019s sake, chiplet designs let AMD stack individual self-contained \"chiplets\" tightly together in configurations that are potentially more powerful and power-efficient than a processor on a single piece of silicon.The RTX 4090 is Nvidia's most powerful GPU yet. (Image credit: Nvidia)According to Nvidia, the RTX 4090 with DLSS 3 is up to four times faster compared to last generation\u2019s RTX 3090 Ti with DLSS 2. It's also up to two times faster in modern games while maintaining the same 450W power consumption. This GPU features 76 billion transistors, 16,384 CUDA cores and 24GB of high-speed Micron GDDR6X memory. It\u2019s capable of consistently delivering over 100 frames per second at 4K resolution gaming, according to Nvidia.The RTX 4080 has 9,728 CUDA cores and 16GB of the aforementioned high-speed Micron GDDR6X memory. With DLSS 3, Nvidia claims the card is twice as fast in modern games as the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and more powerful than the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at lower power.Comparing the company\u2019s graphics cards isn\u2019t exactly straightforward. For example, the RX 7900 XTX has 24GB of VRAM (memory) compared to the RTX 4080\u2019s 16GB. With that said, the latter uses speedier GDDR6X memory. Because of that, the two GPUs are effectively on-par in terms of balanced bus width and speed for gaming. But for applications that use a lot of VRAM, the RX 7900 XTX might prove more beneficial.AMD Radeon RX 7000 vs Nvidia RTX 40 series: PerformanceSibling website Tom\u2019s Hardware reviewed AMD and Nvidia\u2019s latest cards. We\u2019ll use their benchmark results to compare the GPUs.For its 4K gaming benchmark (which tested nine titles), the site found that the RTX 4090 Founder\u2019s Edition averaged a 55% improvement over the last-gen RTX 3090 Ti. There\u2019s a 71% uplift compared to the RTX 3090 and a 77% improvement over the RTX 3080 Ti.Tom\u2019s Guide noted that the 55% average includes games like Microsoft Flight Simulator, which is still hitting CPU bottlenecks. The RTX 4090 maintained performance when going from 1080p Ultra to 1440p Ultra to 4K Ultra.In its RTX 4080 review, Tom\u2019s Hardware wrote that the GPU delivers 78% of the RTX 4090\u2019s performance for 75% of the price. It\u2019s also 21% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti and 51% faster than the RTX 3080. Compared to the RTX 3080 Ti it\u2019s meant to replace, the RTX 4080 is 38% faster.Games like Microsoft Flight Simulator (pictured above) run wonderfully on the RTX 4090. (Image credit: Microsoft)In Tom\u2019s Hardware's rasterization benchmark suite, which tests games with ray tracing disabled, the site found that the RX 7900 XTX won against the RTX 4080 in five out of nine games tested in 4K \u2014 with a general lead of 3.7%. You can see the results of individual game titles in the site\u2019s AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT review.The RX 7900 XTX offers a 39% improvement over the last-gen RX 6950 XT. Results ranged from 22% in Forza Horizon 5 to 52% in Flight Simulator and Total War: Warhammer 3. AMD\u2019s GPU is also 22% faster than the RTX 3090 Ti when playing games in 4K.AMD\u2019s RX 7900 cards look good in 4K games with ray tracing disabled. However, the GPUs struggle when ray tracing is turned on. The beefier XTX barely managed to average 30 frames per second on Tom\u2019s Hardware\u2019s test suite, for example.At 4K resolution, games like Forza Horizon 5 (pictured above) run at higher frame rates on the RTX 4090 than on the RX 7900 XTX. (Image credit: Playground Games)The 7900 XTX falls behind the RTX 4080 by 27%. The 7900 XT falls even further behind by 37%. The RTX 4090 is nearly twice as fast as the 7900 XTX in Tom\u2019s Hardware\u2019s 4K tests and 125% faster than the 7900 XT. This is without DLSS or any other form of upscaling.Compared to last gen, the RX 7900 XT is over 30% faster than the 6950 XT. The 7900 XTX has an impressive 50% lead over its predecessor. However, in the rasterization suite, the RX 7900 XTX couldn\u2019t surpass the RTX 3090 Ti. Tom\u2019s Hardware believes the GPU would likely tie the RTX 3090 in overall ray tracing performance.AMD Radeon RX 7000 vs Nvidia RTX 40 series: Which GPU wins?Choosing between AMD Radeon RX and Nvidia RTX 40 series GPUs ultimately comes down to personal preference. If you don\u2019t care about ray tracing or can\u2019t justify paying over $1,000 for a graphics card, the Radeon 7000 GPUs are your best bet. And though most games are optimized for Nvidia cards, the new AMD GPUs should be able to run the majority of modern titles just fine.Conversely, you should opt for an Nvidia RTX 40 series GPU if you want a powerful graphics card with features like ray tracing and DLSS.

Multiple sources have informed us that they have received a last minute update from big green with what appears to be a pre-launch price drop and the current tentative MSRP of the NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti: $799.\nNVIDIA quietly informs AICs of a price cut for the 4070 Ti's MSRP: tentatively launching at $799\nNVIDIA likes to keep the pricing of its GPUs close to itself before launch and some AICs had already started taking orders at an MSRP of $899 from some of their channel partners. However, they have been informed today that the tentative launch date is now $799 and the difference will be adjusted for existing orders. Since we are closer to the launch, this price point is likely going to stick (although that is just my educated guess).\nThat said, this extract form my original article still remains relevant (although price is unlikely to go up, and more likely to go down if Jensen changes his mind again):\nKeep in mind, however, that Jensen wields the black leather jacket and all of us must submit to its power. So he could very well snap his fingers and change the MSRP at the very last moment should he want to. This is also why I am still tagging this post as a rumor - because until the marketing and documentation gets made for the launch, details like this can still change.\nA big reason for why NVIDIA might have had a change of heart could be because of the fact that 25% GPU tariffs were set to resume on 1/1 and were pushed back by the US government by 9 months. This meant that if NVIDIA and AICs kept the pricing of their cards constant, it would have shrunk their margins. They might have figured to take the hurt anyways and pass on the savings from the lack of resumption to the consumer.\nhttps://twitter.com/usmanpirzada/status/1604080678756294662\nBut of course, the biggest reason is probably the completely lackluster traction of the NVIDIA RTX 4080 which has had serious difficulty in flying off the shelves unlike its much more expensive sibling: the NVIDIA RTX 4090. The updated value proposition of NVIDIA's RTX 40 series based on the value that the RTX 4090 offers is below:\n\n\n\nGPUFP32 TFLOPsMSRPTFLOPs/$Value (%)\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 409082.5915990.05165100.0%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 408048.7411990.0406578.7%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti40.097990.0501797%\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the RTX 4070 Ti with this\u00a0 new MSRP is far closer to the value that the TITAN offers from a TFLOPs/$ perspective and should enable the card to take the burn to AMD's recently launched Radeon RX 7000 series GPUs. With just a few weeks to launch, NVIDIA has decided to reduce the price of its relatively-mainstream entry and further price cuts could be in the pipeline should the wielder of the black-leather-jacket deem it so. If there any more price changes, I will report on them right away.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA RTX 40 GPUs would you consider buying (multiple choice)?\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX 4080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX 4090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB GPU Drops Below $700 US As AIBs Offer Stock Clearance Discounts\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Drops To $699 & RTX 4070 Drops To $519 US In New GPU Promos\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth Hands-on Preview \u2013 The Calm Before Kalm\n\nKai Tatsumoto\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapanese Manufacturer Sycom Unveils NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, Featuring Noctua Fans\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n19\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n16\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1528\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

They\u2019re accelerated by NVIDIA Inception, a program that offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for cutting-edge startups.\nFor those who prefer eye candy, artists also recreated a ramen restaurant using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for creating and operating metaverse applications.\nAI\u2019ll Take Your Order: Conversational AI at the Drive-Thru\nImage credit: Jonathan Borba via Unsplash.\nToronto startup HuEx is developing a conversational AI assistant to handle order requests at the drive-thru speaker box. The real-time voice service, which runs on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform, transcribes voice orders to text for staff members to fulfill.\nThe technology, integrated with the existing drive-thru headset system, allows for team members to hear the orders and jump in to assist if needed. It\u2019s in pilot tests to help support service at popular Canadian fast-service chains.\nHungry for AI: Automated Ordering Addresses Restaurant Labor Crunch\nSan Diego-based startup Vistry is tackling a growing labor shortage among quick-service restaurants with an AI-enabled, automated order-taking solution. The system, built with the NVIDIA Riva software development kit, uses natural language processing for menu understanding and speech \u2014 plus recommendation systems to enable faster, more accurate order-taking and more relevant, personalized offers.\nVistry is also using the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework to create computer vision applications that can help automate curbside check-ins, speed up drive-thrus and predict the time it takes to prepare a customer\u2019s order. Its tools are powered by NVIDIA Jetson and NVIDIA A2 Tensor Core GPUs.\nDinner Delivered: Cartken Deploys Sidewalk Robots\nOakland-based startup Cartken is deploying NVIDIA Jetson-enabled sidewalk robots for last-mile deliveries of coffee and meals.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, Nvidia has certainly experienced its fair share of problems and controversies, as you\u2019re unlikely to have missed. Good things happened in 2022, certainly, but there were a fair number of bad occurrences, and even some ugly ones (melting adapters on top-end GPUs springs to mind in that category). Without further ado, let\u2019s get cracking on summarizing Nvidia\u2019s progress \u2013 or lack of it in some cases \u2013 during 2022.(Image credit: Future)Lovelace GPUs arrived with a superfast flagship \u2013 and some serious problemsNvidia\u2019s Lovelace GPUs succeeded Ampere, with the first next-gen model coming out in mid-October, the flagship RTX 4090. That was followed by the RTX 4080 a month later, and while both desktop graphics cards were undeniably fast \u2013 particularly that flagship \u2013 they were both equally undeniably dogged with some thorny problems.Let\u2019s start with the RTX 4090 and the case of the melting adapters. Even before the RTX 4090 came out, we knew it would be a powerful but power-hungry beast, and so it came to pass, with the flagship sporting a TGP of 450W. So, any buyers had to take care that their power supply could handle that, and that their case design could cope with the heat produced by the RTX 4090 (and that the GPU would fit inside the case in the first place, of course).\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\n\nAMD in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\nHowever, not long after the RTX 4090 emerged, worrying reports of melting adapter cables reached our ears. These were few in number to start with, and Nvidia was quick to say it was investigating, but gradually these complaints multiplied.The problem was being encountered by those who used the adapter supplied with the RTX 4090 so it could be connected to an ATX 2.0 power supply. (Those PSUs are what most PC owners have, with not many folks having upgraded to the very new ATX 3.0 models. But the 4090 comes with a 16-pin power connector that works directly with ATX 3.0 PSUs, and doesn\u2019t fit ATX 2.0 models \u2013 so with the latter, the adapter has to be used).Unfortunately, that adapter was melting in some cases, and damaging the graphics card, too, in some of those instances. Which is obviously a terrible situation (not to mention the fire risk element, if you\u2019re not around when the smoking begins).(Image credit: Party_Quail_1048 (Reddit) / Nvidia)Now, we should note very clearly that according to the Nvidia investigation, as of mid-November, there were only 50 cases globally. That\u2019s 50 cards in purported sales of something like 125,000 boards, which if correct, would mean the chance of a melting adapter is very unlikely. As the big Reddit mega-thread on this issue points out, the chance of a melt being experienced is 0.04% \u2013 but still, it can happen.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.There was lots of theorizing about why the adapters were melting, and the most prominent theory \u2013 that the adapter wasn\u2019t seated properly in its socket in the GPU \u2013 was confirmed by Nvidia to be the most likely culprit. As Nvidia told us: \u201cOur findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card.\u201dPart of the problem here, though , is that to fit this gargantuan graphics card in your PC, you have to bend the power cable round quite tightly (maybe with it pressed up against the side panel of the case), and this could put strain on the adapter and perhaps begin to pull it out of the socket slightly.What\u2019ll be Nvidia\u2019s final conclusion on this affair? We still don\u2019t know that at the time of writing, but this has left a somewhat sour taste in the mouths of some buyers who paid a lot of money \u2013 a small fortune, in fact \u2013 for the Lovelace flagship.However, we should make it clear that the RTX 4090 itself is a jaw-droppingly speedy high-end GPU, and an incredible performance high point, make no mistake on that (for gamers and creatives alike). But a design flaw like this, no matter how very uncommon it might be, is really quite a serious drop of the ball from Nvidia (even if the company is offering expedited returns for affected graphics cards, as you might expect). No matter how great the RTX 4090 might be in raw performance terms, this episode has still tarnished Nvidia\u2019s reputation to an extent.(Image credit: Future)Let\u2019s move on to the RTX 4080, which may not have suffered from melting controversies, but actually caused more of a stir than the RTX 4090 in the end \u2013 thanks to pricing, and the fact that it turned up as two variants, one of which was quickly canceled.When Nvidia revealed the RTX 4080, two models were shown off \u2013 one with 16GB of VRAM, and the other with 12GB (and a lesser spec GPU chip). Immediately there was an outcry about the latter lower-tier model, and how relatively pants it was \u2013 for its price \u2013 and the undoubted confusion caused by having two such very different flavors of RTX 4080. Especially when one of those flavors looked suspiciously like an RTX 4070 in RTX 4080 clothing (with that theory very much underlined by RTX 4070 Ti rumors later in the year).Following all this controversy, Nvidia famously \u2018unlaunched\u2019 the graphics card and consigned it to the dustbin. (That said, its resurrection is rumored to be imminent as the aforementioned RTX 4070 Ti, but that story will be for next year).Price-wise, like the scrapped lower-tier model, the RTX 4080 16GB that went on sale was still a price/performance nightmare. Particularly when custom third-party boards pushed up the already exorbitant MSRP ($1,199 in the US) to dizzying heights that made them almost as costly as the RTX 4090 \u2013 which is very much a faster GPU.So why on earth would you buy the RTX 4080, and not the flagship? That was the thinking of quite a few folks, and the value proposition of the RTX 4080 prompted us to call it the GPU that Nvidia should have canceled (referencing the aforementioned canned 4080 12GB, of course).And going by sales estimates floating around via the rumor mill \u2013 with some pretty consistent approximations \u2013 it seems GPU buyers agreed, and RTX 4080 sales flagged, trailing the RTX 4090 by a long, long way.All in all, the Lovelace graphics card launches for 2022 were seriously problematic in some respects, then. But this shouldn\u2019t draw away from the fact that the RTX 4090 offered an astonishing level of frame rate shifting power \u2013 plus don\u2019t forget DLSS 3 was added into the mix with all Lovelace cards, too (we\u2019ll talk more about that later) \u2013 and even the RTX 4080 is a powerful GPU, make no mistake.It\u2019s just that the price of the RTX 4080 is way more off base than the Lovelace flagship, value-wise \u2013 which is really saying something \u2013 although Nvidia may well be about to correct that pricing according to the rumor mill. (Particularly in light of how that value proposition looks even worse compared to the freshly launched AMD RX 7900 XTX). Indeed, by the time you read this, maybe that RTX 4080 price correction could\u2019ve already happened\u2026As a final note on Lovelace, another blow to Nvidia was delivered by EVGA, one of its larger graphics card manufacturing partners, which announced just before the launch of RTX 4000 GPUs that it wouldn\u2019t be making or selling these products (amidst controversial rumors \u2013 such as \u201cdisrespectful treatment\u201d \u2013 about why). Effectively that wound up EVGA\u2019s operations on the graphics card front, although the firm still supports RTX 3000 boards, of which some are still on sale \u2013 which brings us onto our next point\u2026(Image credit: Future)RTX 3000 stock still hanging aroundAnother issue that Nvidia faced late in 2022 was the amount of RTX 3000 graphics cards that were still on shelves or in warehouses with the RTX 4000 launch looming. That represented a problem because once Lovelace GPUs were released (or even revealed), it\u2019d mean gamers were looking to buy (or wait for) those next-gen graphics cards \u2013 and Nvidia, or more precisely its partners, still had all that RTX 3000 stock to shift, and that\u2019d be interfered with.So, this meant Nvidia employed a strategy in which RTX 3000 GPUs were \u2018layered on top\u2019 of next-gen GPUs, as the company put it. In practice, this meant we got the new RTX 4090 and 4080, the weighty high-end offerings we\u2019ve just been discussing, whereas the rest of the market remained Ampere (RTX 3070, 3060, 3050 \u2013 and the older budget offerings below that).In short, this meant all we got from Lovelace was super-expensive GPUs, allowing breathing room for that whole range of RTX 3000 stock below to sell through. And while throughout 2022, and particularly as the year rolled on, graphics card pricing had been dropping \u2013 well, normalizing from inflated levels, and finally dropping just below MSRP eventually \u2013 that trend stopped dead in November with Nvidia cards. Sadly, RTX 3000 pricing actually rose during that month for many GeForce models, as our sister site Tom\u2019s Hardware, which tracks GPU price tags on a monthly basis, observed, with chunky price rises (urgh) on the Nvidia front for the RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070.Perhaps because people realized they weren\u2019t getting an RTX 4060 anytime soon, at least not going by the grapevine \u2013 and leakage being thin on the ground \u2013 so mid-range options, or certainly mid-to-lower range, are pretty much to look at Ampere for the foreseeable.This is what Nvidia wanted, obviously enough \u2013 to be able to clear that stock \u2013 but a pair of exorbitantly priced next-gen cards, and rising price tags on Ampere GPUs when previously the RTX 3000 series had been dropping in cost significantly, is very much not what gamers wanted. And the way this is working as intended, we presume, is likely another reason as to why we shouldn\u2019t expect an RTX 4060 any time in the near or even medium-term future.(Image credit: Future)Budget GPU woes (again)2022 was another year in which Nvidia neglected the budget end of the GPU market, which is an ongoing theme in the contemporary world of graphics cards, it seems.Last year, we bemoaned the lack of an RTX 3050 at the more wallet-friendly end of the spectrum, and this year, we finally got this graphics card. Shame, then, that it turned out to be, well, not exactly a budget card, with an MSRP of $249 in the US \u2013 which might sound okay, but it\u2019s a good chunk more than xx50 model GPUs that went before it \u2013 and you couldn\u2019t buy the RTX 3050 at that price anyway. It\u2019s still a fair chunk above that recommended price at the time of writing, and it was not far off double upon launch early in the year (and thin on the ground, stock-wise).Nvidia also deployed the GTX 1630 in June, a model actually targeted squarely at the budget arena, but it was so weak sauce (plus it was well overpriced at launch, and still pricey today, for what it is) that the less said about this GPU, the better.Those new offerings for 2022 were not a solution, then, and to heap more misery on the situation, Nvidia could be in the process of making things worse on the cheap GPU front. If the rumor mill is right \u2013 and there\u2019s been some fairly consistent chatter on this \u2013 the RTX 2060 is being discontinued, and the same might be the case for the GTX 1660. While we must take word from the grapevine with a great deal of seasoning, if true, this would leave Nvidia\u2019s line-up at the very cheapest end of the market looking extremely thin. And things are already shaky as it is, as mentioned.Okay, so don\u2019t get us wrong, the budget situation throughout 2022, particularly later on, was better than last year. Mainly because 2021 was an absolute farce, really, with gamers paying seriously silly money for the likes of a GTX 1650 Super at the budget end of the spectrum. But still, even with GPU pricing normalizing to more reasonable levels (finally), and the RTX 3050 being added to Nvidia\u2019s roster, Team Green simply didn\u2019t do enough here, and budget buyers remained restricted in choice, to put it mildly.Plus, don\u2019t forget that as we\u2019ve already touched on, the RTX 4060 looks to be a long way off still, although how \u2018wallet-friendly\u2019 this GPU might be is entirely debatable anyway (the RTX 4050 isn\u2019t in sight either, for that matter; laptop GPUs aside). Apparently what we\u2019ve got for now in the somewhat-more-affordable-department is a refreshed RTX 3060 Ti (with faster VRAM) which was brought into play late in the year \u2013 and that\u2019s not nearly enough. (Plus it\u2019s another sign not to expect the RTX 4060 anytime soon, arguably).Ah, well. Maybe next year will be different for budget desktop GPUs. Here\u2019s hoping.(Image credit: Microsoft)More frame rate boosting with DLSS 3Nvidia DLSS, the company\u2019s well-established upscaling tech, got a third-gen incarnation this year which was revealed in September. DLSS 3 recruited a bunch of new features (Optical Multi Frame Generation, Optical Flow Accelerator; read up more here) to further accelerate frame rates and ensure a smoother gaming experience.There\u2019s been some controversy around DLSS 3 and its exact use cases, along with concerns about increased latency as Techspot reported, which can impact certain games, like twitch shooters as opposed to, say, Microsoft Flight Simulator. But where it works well \u2013 with supported games, and Flight Simulator is very much a highlight here \u2013 it\u2019s a great new tech, and another step up in terms of getting a seriously smooth frame rate.The obvious caveats, though, are that support is thin on the ground thus far, and only RTX 4000 graphics cards need apply. Which makes DLSS 3 feel a bit like a tool that\u2019s being used to help improve the value proposition of the super-pricey Lovelace GPUs which are out there, the cynical might suggest \u2013 although Nvidia has told us there are reasons for the tech being RTX 4000-only. (Namely that it\u2019ll require additional research and engineering to be applied to older Nvidia GPUs, and any benefits wouldn\u2019t be as pronounced).(Image credit: Nvidia, Bethesda)Remixing old games with ray tracingYou know the saying: in with the old, and\u2026 wait a minute, that\u2019s not right. But this was one of the bright ideas Nvidia had on the ray tracing front this year, with RTX Remix. This new tech (built on the Nvidia Omniverse platform) was revealed at GTC 2022 alongside Lovelace graphics cards, and it truly is a modder\u2019s dream, allowing for old games to easily be given a fresh coat of RTX paint with ray tracing and DLSS.Nvidia showed off Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in its remastered glory at GTC, which looked very impressive indeed. The theory is that when it\u2019s released next year, RTX Remix will allow the modding community to spruce up a whole bunch of older games, giving them a new lease of life. An exciting prospect indeed.(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce Now kept streaming aheadIf you couldn\u2019t afford a new GPU, then maybe you signed up for Nvidia\u2019s game streaming service in 2022. Those who did benefited from some solid improvements to GeForce Now, one of which was the ability to stream in 4K for those on Windows PCs and Macs. That was for those gamers on the higher-tier RTX 3080 membership, and there was another useful change with that plan \u2013 namely the ability to sign up for just a month, allowing folks to try it out for a short time and see how smoothly the fastest GeForce Now offering runs for them.Nvidia is building a more attractive streaming option, slowly but surely, and the demise of Google Stadia this year (well, it officially closes down mid-January 2023) has helped make more breathing space in the game streaming arena, something Team Green has been trying to take advantage of, naturally.Nvidia said farewell to ARMNvidia\u2019s attempted acquisition of ARM, a huge $40 billion move, was dogged with problems from the outset. Initiated way back in 2020, the buyout ran into nothing but trouble throughout 2021, culminating in a lawsuit from the FTC to stop the deal proceeding on the grounds that it was anti-competitive. This year, in February, Nvidia finally gave up this ambition and officially terminated its bid for ARM. In the end, given all the opposition and the vehemence of those naysayers, this was hardly a surprise.(Image credit: Future)Concluding thoughtsAs you made your way through this article, you may have found yourself feeling a bit depressed. A lot of what we\u2019ve discussed here is Nvidia\u2019s woes and missteps, and that\u2019s inevitable, because, well, 2022 contained a fair few of them. Most obviously, sky-high pricing for new GPUs, issues around both the RTX 4090 (adapters melting) and RTX 4080 (that canceled version, plus value proposition), and more drawn-out budget graphics card misery.And yet, to be fair to Nvidia, those Lovelace graphics cards represent some seriously impressive pieces of engineering (adapter cables aside), with the RTX 4090 being ridiculously fast, frankly (and a long way ahead of AMD\u2019s rival RDNA 3 flagship, albeit with outliers). DLSS 3 also looks very promising (with the caveats that we mentioned) early doors, and RTX Remix is a seriously nifty idea, too.It\u2019s not like there weren\u2019t positives, then, but too many clouds of negativity were blotted across the sky for Nvidia this year. But even so, guess what \u2013 Team Green is still by far the most dominant desktop GPU power. Indeed, the latest stats we have at the time of writing (for Q3 2022, from Jon Peddie Research) show Nvidia with an 88% market share of discrete graphics cards. 88%! Or what we\u2019d call a Google level of dominance.Is Nvidia untouchable in the desktop GPU space? Could this level of domination be the reason why the company feels confident in pricing new GPUs the way it did with Lovelace? Well, whatever the case, Nvidia better not get too confident, or comfortable on its GPU laurels, as AMD has produced a compelling offering with its RX 7900 XTX flagship \u2013 one very much capable of taking on the RTX 4080, at a lower price point (as we write this) \u2013 and there\u2019s more to come in the RDNA 3 range, of course.Things could start to change quite quickly if Nvidia doesn\u2019t relent in the practice of pushing ever-dizzying premium pricing on its new GPUs, because extracting every last dollar from gamers amidst a cost-of-living crisis could leave Team Green looking at a dwindling reservoir of goodwill in terms of its public perception. Which could lead to more people turning to AMD, or maybe even Intel at the budget end of the GPU spectrum, which Nvidia still seems unwilling to address in a meaningful way.Let\u2019s see how 2023 starts, with the rumored RTX 4070 Ti launch supposed to be happening at CES, and if that goes ahead as predicted, then come on Nvidia: let\u2019s have a pleasant surprise on the pricing front, for once.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

That has changed thanks to requests to produce more-advanced 4nm chips starting in 2024.TSMC is expected to announce the new plan when President Biden and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visit the Phoenix construction site Tuesday.TSMC\u2019s first advanced chip plant in the US was slated to be completed in September, but the open date has been pushed back to March 2023 due to a labor shortage.\u00a0The company is planning to add another plant nearby to produce 3nm chips in the future.What this means for TSMC: The chipmaker can accelerate innovation and essentially skip a generation of 5nm chips, transitioning from 4nm to 3nm production in half the time.TSMC can more quickly reap the benefits of government incentives and the $52 billion Chips and Science Act.This could help TSMC compete more closely with Samsung, which announced mass production of its first-generation 3nm chips in July, with plans to start production in 2023.What this means for Apple, Nvidia, and AMD: These companies can secure future production of chips necessary for their various devices. This level of control will help Apple and others transition away from China.\u00a0Foxconn\u2019s \u201ciPhone City\u201d factory was the flashpoint of weeklong anti-government protests that spread throughout China.Unrest in the manufacturing hub led to a shortfall of 6 million iPhone Pro units, which will lower profits significantly in Q4, traditionally Apple\u2019s busiest season.TSMC\u2019s move to Arizona could set a precedent for other tech suppliers to diversify production to the US and ensure long-term business partnerships.The chipmaker said that it would produce 20,000 wafers monthly at the Arizona facility and that Apple will use about a third of the output. Nvidia and AMD will likely increase orders.What this means for the Biden administration: The news is a big win for proponents of the Chips and Science Act and could entice more manufacturers to participate in incentives, while they last.The production of high-performance chips in Arizona will further widen the gap between the US and China in the tech cold war.TSMC\u2019s commitment helps fulfill the Biden administration goal of bringing manufacturing jobs to the US.E-Mail ChartDownloadThis article originally appeared in Insider Intelligence's Connectivity & Tech Briefing\u2014a daily recap of top stories reshaping the technology industry.

A good place to start might be by showing the child images of the creature and describing its unique features.\nNow imagine trying to teach an artificially intelligent machine what a unicorn is. Where would one even begin?\nPretrained AI models offer a solution.\nA pretrained AI model is a deep learning model \u2014 an expression of a brain-like neural algorithm that finds patterns or makes predictions based on data \u2014 that\u2019s trained on large datasets to accomplish a specific task. It can be used as is or further fine-tuned to fit an application\u2019s specific needs.\nWhy Are Pretrained AI Models Used?\nInstead of building an AI model from scratch, developers can use pretrained models and customize them to meet their requirements.\nTo build an AI application, developers first need an AI model that can accomplish a particular task, whether that\u2019s identifying a mythical horse, detecting a safety hazard for an autonomous vehicle or diagnosing a cancer based on medical imaging. That model needs a lot of representative data to learn from.\nThis learning process entails going through several layers of incoming data and emphasizing goals-relevant characteristics at each layer.\nTo create a model that can recognize a unicorn, for example, one might first feed it images of unicorns, horses, cats, tigers and other animals. This is the incoming data.\nThen, layers of representative data traits are constructed, beginning with the simple \u2014 like lines and colors \u2014 and advancing to complex structural features. These characteristics are assigned varying degrees of relevance by calculating probabilities.\nAs opposed to a cat or tiger, for example, the more like a horse a creature appears, the greater the likelihood that it is a unicorn. Such probabilistic values are stored at each neural network layer in the AI model, and as layers are added, its understanding of the representation improves.\nTo create such a model from scratch, developers require enormous datasets, often with billions of rows of data. These can be pricey and challenging to obtain, but compromising on data can lead to poor performance of the model.\nPrecomputed probabilistic representations \u2014 known as weights \u2014 save time, money and effort. A pretrained model is already built and trained with these weights.\nUsing a high-quality pretrained model with a large number of accurate representative weights leads to higher chances of success for AI deployment. Weights can be modified, and more data can be added to the model to further customize or fine-tune it.\nDevelopers building on pretrained models can create AI applications faster, without having to worry about handling mountains of input data or computing probabilities for dense layers.\nIn other words, using a pretrained AI model is like getting a dress or a shirt and then tailoring it to fit your needs, rather than starting with fabric, thread and needle.\nPretrained AI models are often used for transfer learning and can be based on several model architecture types. One popular architecture type is the transformer model, a neural network that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data.\nAccording to Alfredo Ramos, senior vice president of platform at AI company Clarifai \u2014 a Premier partner in the NVIDIA Inception program for startups \u2014 pretrained models can cut AI application development time by up to a year and lead to cost savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nHow Are Pretrained Models Advancing AI?\nSince pretrained models simplify and quicken AI development, many developers and companies use them to accelerate various AI use cases.\nTop areas in which pretrained models are advancing AI include:\n\nNatural language processing. Pretrained models are used for translation, chatbots and other natural language processing applications. Large language models, often based on the transformer model architecture, are an extension of pretrained models. One example of a pretrained LLM is NVIDIA NeMo Megatron, one of the world\u2019s largest AI models.\nSpeech AI. Pretrained models can help speech AI applications plug and play across different languages. Use cases include call center automation, AI assistants and voice-recognition technologies.\nComputer vision. Like in the unicorn example above, pretrained models can help AI quickly recognize creatures \u2014 or objects, places and people. In this way, pretrained models accelerate computer vision, giving applications human-like vision capabilities across sports, smart cities and more.\nHealthcare. For healthcare applications, pretrained AI models like MegaMolBART \u2014 part of the NVIDIA BioNeMo service and framework \u2014 can understand the language of chemistry and learn the relationships between atoms in real-world molecules, giving the scientific community a powerful tool for faster drug discovery.\u00a0\nCybersecurity. Pretrained models provide a starting point to implement AI-based cybersecurity solutions and extend the capabilities of human security analysts to detect threats faster. Examples include digital fingerprinting of humans and machines, and detection of anomalies, sensitive information and phishing.\nArt and creative workflows. Bolstering the recent wave of AI art, pretrained models can help accelerate creative workflows through tools like GauGAN and NVIDIA Canvas.\n\n\nPretrained AI models can be applied across industries beyond these, as their customization and fine-tuning can lead to infinite possibilities for use cases.\nWhere to Find Pretrained AI Models\nCompanies like Google, Meta, Microsoft and NVIDIA are inventing cutting-edge model architectures and frameworks to build AI models.\nThese are sometimes released on model hubs or as open source, enabling developers to fine-tune pretrained AI models, improve their accuracy and expand model repositories.\nNVIDIA NGC \u2014 a hub for GPU-optimized AI software, models and Jupyter Notebook examples \u2014 includes pretrained models as well as AI benchmarks and training recipes optimized for use with the NVIDIA AI platform.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise, a fully managed, secure, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software, includes pretrained models without encryption. This allows developers and enterprises looking to integrate NVIDIA pretrained models into their custom AI applications to view model weights and biases, improve explainability and debug easily.\nThousands of open-source models are also available on hubs like GitHub, Hugging Face and others.\nIt\u2019s important that pretrained models are trained using ethical data that\u2019s transparent and explainable, privacy compliant, and obtained with consent and without bias.\nNVIDIA Pretrained AI Models\nTo help more developers move AI from prototype to production, NVIDIA offers several pretrained models that can be deployed out of the box, including:\n\nNVIDIA SegFormer, a transformer model for simple, efficient, powerful semantic segmentation \u2014 available on GitHub.\nNVIDIA\u2019s purpose-built computer vision models, trained on millions of images for smart cities, parking management and other applications.\nNVIDIA NeMo Megatron, the world\u2019s largest customizable language model, as part of NVIDIA NeMo, an open-source framework for building high-performance and flexible applications for conversational AI, speech AI and biology.\nNVIDIA StyleGAN, a style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, or GANs. It uses transfer learning to generate infinite paintings in a variety of styles.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA Riva, a GPU-accelerated software development kit for building and deploying speech AI applications, includes pretrained models in ten languages.\nAnd MONAI, an open-source AI framework for healthcare research developed by NVIDIA and King\u2019s College London, includes pretrained models for medical imaging.\nLearn more about NVIDIA pretrained AI models.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Conversational AI | Data Science | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA NeMo | Open Source | Riva \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Freedman \n\nContributions from\nJarred Walton\n\n\nlast updated\n\n2 December 2022\n\n\n\n\nThere are still more questions than answers, but reports of power problems with Nvidia\u2019s new flagship card keep popping up.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments (18)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards are having melting issues \u2014 meltdowns, if you will. Specifically, there have been a several reports that the 16-pin 12VHPWR adapters (used to convert multiple 8-pin PCIe power connectors to the new ATX 3.0 standard) that provide the power to the card have partially melted. In some cases, so has the 16-pin connector on the card itself.\n\nNvidia says that it's aware of roughly 50 instances of this issue, which it says is due to power adapters not being fully plugged into graphics cards. The company has made a point of showing \"lines around the block\" for the 4090, and the fact that cards are still hard to find suggests the company is selling everything it can make. In other words, while these incidents are very serious, they are be statistically rare.\n\nMost of the melting reports are coming from anonymous users on social media, often on Reddit and other forums. These have included numerous models of the RTX 4090, including Nvidia's own RTX 4090 Founders Edition.Here's what we know about the issues with the 16-pin 12VHPWR connector incidents so far.What is happening?Some RTX 4090 owners have reported that the 16-pin 12VHPWR power adapters have melted while plugged into their graphics cards (some also claim that the connectors have melted, too).\n\nSeveral have written that their screens have gone black and that their fans started spinning heavily when this happened. Others have said they happened to check their connectors after reading about connector issues and found that theirs, too, had melted. Many have provided photos, but not much other information.\n\nSeveral have said that they have heard from Nvidia or other card vendors after reporting their melting connector, or that they have received a replacement card.\n\nNvidia said that it was aware of roughly 50 cases globally. Prior to that number being released, many were relying on the r/nvidia subreddit, where members have been keeping a \"List of Confirmed Cases,\" which counts 26 melting issues as of this writing (two of those were using ATX 3.0 PSUs and not the power adapter). An additional table of \"Unconfirmed Cases\" lists six more issues, which are questionable based on image quality, descriptions, or other possible damage.\u00a0Which GPUs are affected?To date, the melting issues have occurred on a variety of RTX 4090 cards, including Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition as well as cards from Asus, Galax, Gigabyte, Inno3D, MSI and Zotac. \n\nAs of this writing, we haven't heard of any similar issues with the newer Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, which uses the same 16-pin connector. That one, however, uses three 8-pin connectors, as opposed to the four 8-pin connectors on the RTX 4090. And it has a lower power rating of 320W compared to 450W.\n\nNone of the five RTX 4090 samples that Tom's Hardware has used have shown any signs of problems with either the 16-pin adapter or connector. We do however make it a point to treat our cards with care, and that includes not plugging in and unplugging the 16-pin connector any more than necessary, as it's officially only rated for 30 cycles.What does the 16-pin 12VHPWR adapter do?The long-running PSU standard, ATX 2.X, can't deliver enough power over one connection to power the RTX 4090 and other high-wattage graphics cards. Indeed, there have been many cards with multiple 8-pin connectors over the last few years \u2014 various third-party RTX 3090 and 3080 family GPUs, as well as RX 6950, 6900, and 6800 XT GPUs have included three 8-pin connectors, and even four in a few rare cases.\n\nATX 3.0, which is slowly rolling out, is supposed to change that by delivering up to 600W over a single 16-pin 12VHPWR connector. But most people still have ATX 2.X PSUs in their systems, and ATX 3.0 PSUs are just now becoming available here and there. The adapter lets people use their existing power supplies and hook up multiple 8-pin connectors to the 16-pin connector on the RTX 4090 cards, providing enough wattage to these power-hungry GPUs.Why are 16-pin connectors on RTX 4090 cards melting?Nvidia has suggested that the issue is caused because 16-pin adapters are not being plugged completely into the graphics card.\n\nPrior to that official statement, there were plenty of theories (some of which, it seems, ended up being right.)\n\nBack in October, Igor's Lab posted that the Nvidia's adapter's \"build quality\u2026 is extremely poor[,]\" and that the 12VHPWR connector isn't inherently the issue. Igor's Lab also suggested that manufacturers should be crimping, rather than soldering, joints in the adapters. Gamers Nexus, however, opened one of its adapters and found it more substantially soldered than the one Igor's Lab had. Igor's Lab had 16AWG 150V rated wires in its power adapter, while Gamers Nexus had a version with 14AWG and 300V rated wires.Gamers Nexus couldn't replicate the melting issues at first, despite mangling several adapters. It put up a poll for 4090 users where it appears less than 10% have the 16AWG 300V wires. More recently, Gamers Nexus published a video where it \"successfully\" caused at least one adapter to melt\u2026 by not plugging the connector in all the way and by putting strain on the cables.\n\nIn November, Jon Gerow, Corsair's PSU expert (who used to publish power supply reviews under the pseudonym JohnnyGuru) weighed in, suggesting that owners aren't fully inserting the connectors, and that a gap between the connector and the socket could be to blame. Soon after, Gerow quietly pulled the article, which he had self-published on his own site.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Initially, there were some concerns that the 12VHPWR connector could fail if the cables were bent in the wrong place. CableMod, a third-party cable manufacturer, published a \"12VHPWR Cable Guide\" claiming that it can't be bent near the plug, and all bends should start at least 35mm from the connector. PSU manufacturer Be quiet! places that distance at 40 mm. This is difficult to do in most PC cases. It also suggested that people need to ensure they're plugging in the cables completely.Gabriele Gorla, director of engineering at Nvidia, told Igor's Lab that two different companies, Astron and NTK, make the adapter that ships with each RTX 4090. It's unclear if one maker is having more issues than the other.(Image credit: Future)Will a third-party cable help?This is murky territory. In the box for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition, the documentation reads:\"Use only the included PCIe Gen 5 compliant power connector adapter for your GeForce RTX 40-series Founders Edition graphics card. Use of non-compliant or third-party power connector adapters may cause technical issues, and may void your manufacturer warranty.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether third-party graphics card companies hold the same rules about warranties and third-party connectors. But Nvidia has said that any user with an issue will have an expedited RMA.We at Tom's Hardware haven't tried any third-party cables. ATX 3.0 PSUs should work, as those cables don't require adapters for the 16-pin connector. However, there are still at least a couple of reports of direct PSU connections melting.\n\nSome companies are already announcing new adapters for the GPU. CableMod, for instance, has a right angle adapter that it says requires less bending.What has Nvidia said about all of this?\u201cWe are actively investigating the reports. We are aware of about 50 cases globally,\" Nvidia wrote on its support site.\n\n\"Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card. To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it's firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.\n\nWe are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card.\"\n\nNvidia and our partners are committed to supporting our customer and ensuring an expedited RMA process, regardless of the cable or card used.\u201d\n\nThe company said that in testing cables returned from customers, a \"wear line\" can be seen, suggesting that the cable wasn't fully inserted into the connector on the card.What has the PCI-SIG said about this?The PCI-SIG (Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group), which is in charge of the spec for the 12VHPWR connection, sent a brief statement to the press on Dec. 1, that in short tells companies making graphics cards to conduct better safety testing. This came after a class-action lawsuit was filed in California. \n\n\"PCI-SIG wishes to impress upon all Members that manufacture, market or sell PCI-SIG technologies (including 12VHPWR connections) of the need to take all appropriate and prudent measures to ensure end user safety, including testing for the reported problem cases involving consumers as alleged in the above-referenced lawsuit,\" the group wrote. \"Members are reminded that PCI-SIG specifications provide necessary technical information for interoperability and do not attempt to address proper design, manufacturing methods, materials, safety testing, safety tolerances or workmanship. When implementing a PCI-SIG specification, Members are responsible for the design, manufacturing, and testing, including safety testing, of their products.\"What do I do if this happens to me?If your adapter or card melts, you may see issues such as the screen going black or your fans spinning faster and louder than usual. We've seen one report where someone suggested they smelled plastic melting. If this happens, unplug your computer and check to see if there's an issue. If there is, stop using the graphics cards and contact the manufacturer. They may want you to RMA (basically return and exchange) your card.\n\nIf it hasn't happened to you, you may be fine! After all, far more RTX 4090's have been sold than reports of melting. But it may also not be a bad idea to keep an extra eye on your system. That being said, don't disconnect and reconnect your adapter more than is strictly necessary, either. Repeated stress could damage the connector and the system in other ways.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Are AMD's cards having similar issues?AMD doesn't use 16-pin connectors\u2013at least not yet. When it launches its next-gen GPUs, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both will use dual 8-pin power connectors, which means that people won't have to deal with adapters at all.What about older cards with 12-pin adapters?Interestingly, Nvidia has used a 12-pin precursor to the PCI-SIG 16-pin connector on the Founders Edition RTX 30-series cards. To our knowledge, no one reported any melting 12-pin adapters over the past two years. RTX 3090 Ti cards also use a 16-pin connector, but they still come with a 12-pin adapter cable.The 16-pin connector is largely the same, but it adds four extra \"sense pins\" that can communicate with the power supply. In our experience, the 16-pin connector does require a bit more force to fully insert. Multiple theories suggest the root cause may be improperly inserted connectors, perhaps pulled out after doing some cable management. But there is no hard proof as yet that this is the only possible cause.Bottom LineWe do not know precisely how many RTX 4090 cards have been sold that use the 16-pin 12VHPWR connector. There are also RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 4080 cards that also use the same connector. By that token, there could be hundreds of thousands of cards with 16-pin connectors now in the hands of consumers, and only a very few of those have failed \u2014 Gamers Nexus claims the graphics card companies are saying the failure rate is between 0.05% and 0.1% right now. So about one in a thousand to one in two thousand.If you have a card that uses a 12VHPWR connector, you're probably safe to use it. Just ensure the connector is fully inserted and that it \"clicks\" into place. Maybe check the connector every so often (without disconnecting it) until we learn more. And If the worst should happen, contact the manufacturer for support.\n\nUpdated November 18, 2022 following an official statement from Nvidia.\nUpdated December 2, 2022 following a statement from PCI-SIG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce RTX 4090\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (18)\n\n\n\nAndrew E.

Which, if it's user error, there definitely should have been.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npalladin9479\n\n\nDarkbreeze said:Well, I've seen plenty of \"normies\" (And others) on this forum over the last six months or so with those cards in their build and can't recall any of them having this problem. Which, if it's user error, there definitely should have been.\nThere are multiple failure modes, user inserting halfway is just one of them. It's likely a combination of multiple things happening at once, bad batch of adapters get made that pins don't quite go far enough, batch gets distributed around. Users opens box, installs card and push's cable in thinking it's all the way in, turns on computer and starts having fun. Later the failure occurs in a very unsafe way.\n\nStuff like this happens all the time and is resolved with the RMA process, what elevates this is the words \"consumer\" and \"potential fire hazard\", the device should of failed before getting hot enough to start that kind of damage or had some warning method to let the user know something is wrong.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkbreeze\n\n\nYes, I understand all that. Has nothing to do with why we haven't seen it on the RTX 3090 ti with identical 16 pin connector and identical 450w power draw though.\n\nBased on the GN deep dive it would seem that \"bad batch of connectors\" probably isn't a thing in this particular situation. More like, somewhat poor quality for ALL connectors, at least in terms of the low quality plating. Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nBut even that, I haven't seen any signs of from any 3090 ti owners, or heard of, at all.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkbreeze said:Yes, I understand all that.

The graphics card is the ASUS GeForce RTX 4070 Ti TUF Gaming OC variant which has the SKU code '90YV0IJ0-M0NA00'. The graphics card is said to launch on 5th January and that's the same launch date that we had reported in our exclusive last month.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\nProduct Unveil - 3rd January, 2023\nProduct Review - 4th January, 2023\nProduct Launch - 5th January, 2023\n\nNow as to what kind of graphics card the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti might be, we came to know that the card might actually end up featuring the same specifications as the \"Unlaunched\" GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB and that will be the exact case. The graphics card isn't going to be positioned as the 4070 as that would mean that NVIDIA was indeed going to offer a 4070-tier card at a $900 US price point.\n\nThe retailer has a counter which says that the card should launch in 31 days from now which points out to the 5th of January. There are also some pictures of what might seem like the RTX 4070 Ti TUF Gaming OC graphics card but they are placeholder images & actually show the ASUS RTX 4090 TUF Gaming graphics card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB 'Official' Specifications (Now Cancelled)\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti will utilize the \"Ada Lovelace\" AD104-400 GPU configuration with 7,680 cores or 60\u00a0 SMs enabled which is the full-fat SKU. The GPU will be packing 48 MB of L2 cache and features a 192-bit bus interface so that's why we are getting up to 12 GB of GDDR6X capacities. The memory is said to be running at 21 Gbps speeds for a memory bandwidth of 504 GB/s. The card is said to be clocked at a 2610 MHz boost clock however the peak frequency will be higher.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB \"Official\" TBP - 285W\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 8 GB \"Official\" TBP - 290W\n\nFor power, the TBP is now set to be rated at 285W which is a 35W decrease versus the RTX 3080 10 GB model and a 5W decrease from the RTX 3070 Ti. The new graphics card is expected to offer better performance than the RTX 3080 but given the specs cut over the 4080 16 GB, there will be a big gap between both models of around 30-40%.\n\nThe most important question is whether NVIDIA will be using the same $899 US pricing for its graphics card or tone down the pricing a bit. We know from benchmarks that the GeForce RTX 4080 12 GB was about on par with the RTX 3090 Ti & faster in a few cases when RT or DLSS was used. AMD is promising up to 40-50% gains with its RX 7900 XT over the 6950 XT at a price of $899 US. So it will be a heated battle between the two cards. But AMD will release their cards a few weeks earlier in December so they will have an advantage there.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series Official Specs:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 DNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAda Lovelace AD102-300Ada Lovelace AD102-250Ada Lovelace AD103-300Ada Lovelace AD104-400Ada Lovelace AD104-250Ada Lovelace AD106-350Ada Lovelace AD107-400\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4NTSMC 4N\n\n\nDie Size608mm2608mm2378.6mm2294.5mm2294.5mm2190.0mm2146.0mm2\n\n\nTransistors76 Billion76 Billion45.9 Billion35.8 Billion35.8 Billion22.9 BillionTBD\n\n\nCUDA Cores163841459297287680588843523072\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs512 / 176TBD320 / 112240 / 80184 / 64136 / 48TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores512 / 128456 / 128304 / 76240 / 60184 / 46136 / 34TBD\n\n\nL2 Cache72 MB72 MB64 MB48 MB36 MB32 MB24 MB\n\n\nBase Clock2230 MHz2280 MHz2210 MHz2310 MHz1920 MHz2310 MHz1830 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock2520 MHz2520 MHz2510 MHz2610 MHz2475 MHz2535 MHz2460 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute83 TFLOPsTBD49 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs29 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs15 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs191 TFLOPsTBD113 TFLOPs82 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs51 TFLOPs35 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs1321 TOPsTBD780 TOPs641 TOPs466 TOPs353 TOPs242 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X16 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X8-16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit256-bit192-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps23.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps21.0 Gbps18.0 Gbps17.0 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s1008 GB/s736 GB/s504 GB/s504 GB/s288 GB/s\n(554 GB/s Effective)272 GB/s\n(453 GB/s Effective)\n\n\nTBP450W425W320W285W200W160-165W115W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$1599 US / 1949 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1469 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nPrice (Current)$1599 US / 1859 EU12,999 RMB (China-Only)$1199 US / 1399 EU$799 US$599 US$399-$499 US$299 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)12th October 202228th December 202316th November 20225th January 202313th April 202324th May / 18th July 202329th June 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich graphics card are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountdown\nNews Source: CowCotLand\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n108\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs;

NVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0 will offer AI workflows for contact center intelligent virtual assistants, audio transcription, digital fingerprinting for cybersecurity, and support for over 50 NVIDIA frameworks and pre-trained models.\n\nNVIDIA has announced the release of AI Enterprise 3.0 to be available in December, along with a partnership with Deutsche Bank. NVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0 will offer AI workflows for contact center intelligent virtual assistants, audio transcription, digital fingerprinting for cybersecurity, and support for over 50 NVIDIA frameworks and pre-trained models.\nWhat is NVIDIA AI Enterprise?\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is a suite of tools and technologies developed by NVIDIA for enterprise-level organizations and businesses looking to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in their operations. The suite includes a range of products and services designed to help organizations build and deploy AI models and tools for managing and scaling AI deployments.\nWe completed a recent deep-dive on some of these features available via NVIDIA LaunchPad.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0\n\nThe new version of AI Enterprise comes as Deutsche Bank announced it would partner with NVIDIA to accelerate the use of AI in financial services as part of its strategy to develop AI-powered speech, vision, and fraud detection applications. The solution workflows introduced in AI Enterprise 3.0 are designed to address applications for enterprises adopting AI to serve customers better and will be made available on the NVIDIA NGC software catalog.\n\nGil Perez, chief innovation officer and head of Cloud & Innovation Network at Deutsche Bank, said:\n\u201cAI and machine learning will redefine banking, and we\u2019re already working closely with NVIDIA to lead the industry in leveraging these technologies to improve customer service and mitigate risk. Accelerated computing enables traders to manage risk and run more scenarios faster while also improving energy efficiency, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise provides the flexibility to support AI development across our hybrid infrastructure.\u201d\nSolution Workflows to Speed Business Success\nThe new AI solution workflows in AI Enterprise 3.0 are meant to solve business challenges while increasing operational efficiency. It will accelerate the data science pipeline and streamline the development and deployment of AI models to automate essential processes and gain faster insights from data.\n\nThe workflows run as cloud-native microservices using NVIDIA AI frameworks and pre-trained models, Helm charts, Jupyter notebooks, and more. Enterprises can deploy the microservices as standalone Kubernetes containers or combine them with other services to create production-ready applications.\nThe contact center intelligent virtual assistant workflow allows enterprises to develop agents that deliver personalized and precise responses in natural-sounding voices. Enterprises will be able to respond to customers around the clock, reducing wait times and freeing up human contact center agents to support complex inquiries and, ultimately, reduce costs. Leveraging AI lets agents better understand customer calls, even when the call audio quality is poor.\n\nUsing automatic speech recognition technology, enterprises can use the audio transcription AI solution workflow to rapidly create accurate transcripts in several languages, including English, Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Russian, Korean, German, French, and Portuguese. Japanese, Arabic, and Italian are expected to be added soon.\nThe transcription workflow leverages customizable GPU-optimized models that enable better understanding, contextual insights, and sentiment analysis with real-time accuracy. The transcripts can improve product development and ramp up contact center agent training.\nThe digital fingerprinting AI solution workflow improves security by helping enterprises fingerprint every user, service, account, and machine across the network to detect anomalous activity. When deployed, the workflow provides intelligent alerts and actionable information to reduce detection time from weeks to minutes.\nPretrained Models provide a View Into Biases\nThe unencrypted pre-trained models and source code in AI Enterprise 3.0 came from the latest release of the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit. The TAO Toolkit is a low-code AI development solution for creating accurate, customized, production-ready AI models for speech and computer vision AI applications.\n\nThe unencrypted models are exclusive to NVIDIA AI Enterprise and support imaging and vision AI tasks for healthcare, smart cities, and retail. Tasks include pathology tumor, people, and vehicle detection and can pose estimation and action recognition.\u00a0The unencrypted pre-trained models are easier to debug and integrate into custom AI applications.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0 also introduces support for a wide range of NVIDIA AI frameworks and\u00a0infrastructure options, such as:\n\nNVIDIA Clara Parabricks and MONAI to improve healthcare: New support for NVIDIA Clara\u00a0Parabricks enables faster, more accurate genomic analysis for sequencing centers, clinical labs,\u00a0genomics researchers, and genomics instrument manufacturers. NVIDIA AI Enterprise also\u00a0supports MONAI, a domain-specific medical imaging AI framework that provides pre-trained\u00a0models and a collaborative, scalable workflow for data labeling and training robust AI models.\nBoosting customer service, safety, sales, and more: The 50+ frameworks\u00a0and pre-trained models include NVIDIA Riva, a GPU-accelerated speech AI software development kit for building and deploying customizable,\u00a0real-time AI pipelines that deliver accuracy in all leading clouds, on-premises, at the\u00a0edge, and on embedded devices. NVIDIA Morpheus enables cybersecurity developers to create\u00a0optimized AI pipelines for filtering, processing, and classifying large volumes of real-time data.\u00a0SDKs in the NVIDIA Metropolis intelligent video analytics platform, such as TAO Toolkit and\u00a0NVIDIA DeepStream for vision AI, are supported, as is the NVIDIA Merlin open-source\u00a0framework for building high-performing recommender systems at scale.\nExpanded certification for the cloud: Provides organizations with a hybrid\u00a0cloud strategy and the flexibility to run the software on GPU-accelerated instances from\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Customers who purchase a license through one of NVIDIA\u2019s channel\u00a0partners can deploy in OCI with full certification and support from NVIDIA on designated OCI\u00a0instances. This is in addition to existing NVIDIA AI Enterprise certification for accelerated\u00a0instances from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and more.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise and NVIDIA extend AI support for hybrid data centers: HPE and\u00a0NVIDIA will deliver a joint offering that provides \u00a0NVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0 support on HPE\u00a0GreenLake and HPE Ezmeral. The solution allows customers to securely speed up AI application\u00a0development by procuring and deploying NVIDIA AI Enterprise on a managed\u00a0HPE GreenLake instance.\nBroadened storage and virtualization support: Support for NVIDIA\u00a0Magnum IO GPU Direct Storage, providing a direct data path between local or remote storage and GPU memory to speed AI workloads. It also delivers expanded virtualization options, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM and VMware vSphere 8.\n\nAvailability\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is available now. Customers can contact NVIDIA partners worldwide for pricing.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0 is expected to be available for customers with current and new subscriptions\u00a0in December. A license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is also included with servers from NVIDIA partners\u00a0that feature NVIDIA H100 PCIe GPUs, including systems from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard\u00a0Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro.\nEnterprises can grow their AI expertise by trying NVIDIA AI workflows and frameworks supported in\u00a0NVIDIA AI Enterprise on NVIDIA LaunchPad at no charge.\n\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0TikTok\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nHarold Fritts\nI have been in the tech industry since IBM created Selectric.

The problem was that the two RTX 4080 variants were very different and those differences were not limited to memory capacity as the naming scheme was hinting.\n\nThat's because in order to cut down the memory capacity without using lower density chips, you also need to reduce the memory bus width. Using different silicon that would result in substantially different performance was not a good move, but this sort of dodgy behavior wasn't new. Nvidia had done it before, for example with the DDR4 version of the GeForce GT 1030.\nThe big mistake was announcing the RTX 4080 12GB and that particular anti-consumer move to the world in the biggest event Nvidia had held in years. Traditionally how they like to handle dodgy product releases is to sneak them out at a later date via a silent launch, meaning far fewer people notice and even fewer seem to care.\n\nWell, this is exactly what they have done with the 8GB variant of the GeForce RTX 3060. Ironically, they launched this product on October 27, just 12 days after unlaunching the 12GB 4080 for having a confusing name.\nAlthough it's true that both the 8GB and 12GB variants of the RTX 3060 are based on the GA106 silicon \u2013 so it is technically the same GPU \u2013 the changes still go well beyond an adjustment to memory capacity. The memory subsystem of the 8GB model has been drastically reduced, the L2 cache is 50% larger for the 12GB model as is the bus width. All in all, bandwidth is 61% greater in the original RTX 3060 model producing 360 GB/s whereas the \"new\" 8GB variant has been slashed to just 224 GB/s \u2013 the same bandwidth as the RTX 3050.\nUltimately, this means the 8GB RTX 3060 is going to be slower than the 12GB model \u2013 and spoiler alert, it's ~15% slower on average \u2013 but in some instances we're seeing margins of over 30%, so it's a big enough deal for us to bring it to your attention.\n\nOne additional note, Nvidia hasn't made any official adjustments to MSRPs, so the 8GB RTX 3060 still comes in at $330. Looking over at Newegg, we can see that the 12GB RTX 3060 starts at $350, with a number of models available for between $350 and $380. Meanwhile, the most affordable 8GB variant comes from Inno3D and it starts at $385, though there are some Asus models on backorder at $360 and $370. Point is, in terms of pricing, there's no distinguishing between the original 12GB models and these new gimped 8GB versions.\nIn Australia we bought a Galax model that we purchased for a 10% discount from the original 12GB version, and you might think, \"Well that's okay,\" but it's not. The GeForce RTX 3060 was released almost 2 years ago, everyone is familiar with how it performs, and those that aren't can quickly consult the bevvy of online benchmarks. Meanwhile, this new 8GB model is nowhere to be found as there isn't a review program, it's up to reviewers to purchase the card and inform consumers.\nIn fact, you might not even know there was an 8GB version or simply assumed the RTX 3060 only came with 8GB of VRAM, just as the 3060 Ti does. The trap here is that unsuspecting consumers could be baited into paying RTX 3060 12GB money, or very near so for a product that's significantly slower.\n\nWe asked Nvidia for an official response about why the 8GB version was released and they simply said it was to offer customers more options. They also stated that the 12GB version was going to remain available in parallel. And just to be clear, this is an Nvidia sanctioned product and not their partners going rogue, rather it's possible partners are obligated to produce it.\nNvidia appears to be looking to clear out their inventory of lower-end Ampere GPUs, and are no doubt keen to maximize profits as they do so. This also allows them to sell defective GA106 silicon for far more than they would get selling it as an RTX 3050.\n\nOur issue is of course that we now have two products called \"GeForce RTX 3060\" and they don't deliver the same level of performance and in many instances it's not even close. And we're not talking about memory bound testing \u2013 as in exceeding the 8GB VRAM buffer \u2013 we're talking about performance when remaining well within the 8GB buffer.\nSo let's take a look at that, we'll go over a few games and then show you a 12 game average. For collecting these results we used fresh data with both 12GB and 8GB RTX 3060 cards using the latest display drivers. Other GPUs are included for comparison purposes.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Cyberpunk 2077, we find that the 12GB model is 13% faster at 1080p when compared to the new 8GB model, not a massive difference but it's certainly noteworthy.\n\nThat margin grows to 18% at 1440p and now we're looking a two different tiers of performance and a noticeably better gaming experience with the original 12GB model.\n\n\nMoving on to Dying Light 2, here we have a game that is clearly memory heavy and as such the 8GB model limits the performance of the RTX 3060 GPU.\n\nThe original card was a massive 35% faster at 1080p, that's a tremendous performance difference for two products sharing the same name, and it's the same story at 1440p. In fact, here we go from a very console-like 34fps with the 8GB version to a much smoother 46 fps using the original 3060.\n\n\nHalo Infinite sees the 12GB model offering 21% greater performance at 1080p, going from 63 fps to 76 fps, another big performance difference for two products that share the same name. The margin remains similar at 1440p, where the original 12GB 3060 was 19% faster.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn sees a smaller 16% performance improvement for the 12GB model over the new 8GB version, though that margin did grow to 20% at 1440p.\n\nBoth results are bad as a double-digit change in performance is unacceptable, especially given the difference in memory capacity plays no role here.\n\n\nWe're also looking at 22% greater performance for the 12GB variant in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, as the new 8GB model drops performance to 85 fps. The margin is similar at 1440p, where the 12GB version is 20% faster, rendering an additional 12 fps.\nPerformance Summary\nThat's enough with the individual game results, you can easily get the idea. On average you can expect 17% better performance with the 12GB model at 1080p, but as we saw that margin can be as high as 35%...\n\n\nIt's a similar story at 1440p, when working within the 8GB buffer the 12GB model was still on average 18% faster as it enjoys significantly more memory bandwidth.\nWhat We Learned\nThe new 8GB version of the GeForce RTX 3060 is noticeably slower than the original, and in a number of instances was significantly slower in our testing. In our opinion this is a horrible anti-consumer move by Nvidia, it serves little more than to line their pockets while misleading and potentially ripping off customers.\nIt's true that pricing could be improved, at which point it might not be bad in terms of value. After all, let's say Nvidia drops the price relative to the 12GB version by 20%, or even 30%, then the 8GB RTX 3060 would start looking pretty great in terms of value, at least compared to Nvidia's own product stack.\n\nWe would agree with that assessment had it been called, let's say the \"GeForce RTX 3060 LE 8GB\" something that makes it clear to prospective buyers this isn't your typical RTX 3060. In that case, we wouldn't really have a problem with this cut-down model and while we'd still prefer a name change entirely, we could at least accept a more honest attempt at making it clear to buyers that this is a different version.\nTo demonstrate just how difficult it is for the uninitiated to even tell which model they're buying, or that there is even a different model, here's the box for our original RTX 3060 and the new 8GB box...\n\nNot amused\nThose operating under the assumption that an RTX 3060 is an RTX 3060 might see an 8GB model selling for a reasonable discount and think they've stumbled upon a bargain, snap it up, only to realize their bargain is quite a bit slower than it would have been otherwise. And for those none the wiser it just means you could have done better, and possibly gone further between upgrades.\nUnfortunately this sort of behavior will continue unless Nvidia faces enough backlash from consumers and the enthusiast community. We're always going to fight against this sort of anti-consumer behavior from corporations, whether it be Nvidia, AMD, Intel, LG, Samsung, MSI, Asus and so on, many of these companies we've taken to task in the past, and we'll continue to do so.\n\nRest assured, if AMD was to pull a similar stunt we'd go after them just as hard, much like when we dedicated several articles to call them out over the plans to axe Zen 3 support for 300 and 400 series motherboards. We were having none of their excuses, we didn't buy into the technical reasons for why they had to end support. Put simply, they misled consumers, we went after them, and they corrected course, and this was made possible thanks to strong push back from the community.\nWe don't expect to see the same thing happen here with Nvidia, but we've done our bit, you've now been made aware of what the 8GB RTX 3060 is, and you know to avoid it at current asking prices.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 12GB on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D on Amazon\nIntel Core i5-13600K on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 61\n\n\n Got something to say?

Interestingly, and maybe not coincidentally, NVIDIA just lowered the price of both Ada Lovelace GPUs in Europe.\n\n\nOptimistically, we'd like to say this because of AMD's impending arrival onto the next-gen GPU battlefield. And maybe that actually played a role in NVIDIA's decision. More likely, though, the ~5 percent price cut on both GPUs probably has more to do with inflation in Germany and its impact on the exchange rate of the Euro. Whatever the case, though, both cards are now officially cheaper in Europe than at launch. Here's a look...\n\n\n\nSource: NVIDIA\n\n\n\nNVIDIA reduced the MSRP of its GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition model from \u20ac1,949 to \u20ac1,849, and the GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition from \u20ac1,469 to \u20ac1,399.Those amount to 5.1 percent and 4.8 percent reductions, respectively. These are official price cuts that appear on NVIDIA's product pages in Germany (which we've spliced together and Google Translated above).\n\n\n\nThis is especially interesting in regards to the GeForce RTX 4080, a GPU that hasn't been without controversy. It started with the initial introduction of two models with different memory configs (16GB and 12GB) and very different specifications. The backlash ultimately prompted NVIDIA to \"unlaunch\" the 12GB model, leaving the 16GB configuration as the only GeForce RTX 4080 SKU.\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 16GB starts at $1,199 in the US, compared to $1,599 for the GeForce RTX 4090. As it turns out, scalpers appear to having a tougher time moving GeForce RTX 4080 models for significant markups. For example, this Gigabyte Eagle OC variant fetched $1,299 on eBay, which is only $100 above the MSRP for a stock-clocked FE model. Same goes for this MSI Ventus 3X model\u2014it recently sold on eBay for $1,291.27 shipped.\n\n\nThere are several listings that show the GeForce RTX 4080 selling for higher markups, but generally speaking, the GeForce RTX 4090 is proving more lucrative for scalpers\u2014some are topping $2,500 or even $2,600 on eBay.\n\n\nGiven that both cards are selling, it's unlikely NVIDIA will be motivated the drop the price on either model any time soon, especially with lower-end models presumably getting announced at or around CES. That could change, though, depending on how AMD's next-gen GPUs fare and are received.\n\n\nIn any event, fist-bump to HardwareLUXX for spotting the revised pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, graphics cards, GPUs, (nasdaq:nvda), ada lovelace, geforce rtx 4090, geforce rtx 4080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Done right, it\u2019s a recipe for bringing advanced manufacturing techniques to every industry and cultivating a highly skilled workforce.\nThe semiconductor industry uses the most complex manufacturing processes and equipment in human history. To produce each chip inside a car or computer, hundreds of steps must be executed perfectly, most already automated with robotics.\nThe U.S. government asked industry where it should focus its efforts on improving this sector. In response, NVIDIA released a 12-page document with its best ideas.\nSupercharged with accelerated computing and AI, a modern fab is also a guidepost for all other types of complex manufacturing \u2014 from making smartphones to shoes \u2014 flexibly and efficiently.\nThe World\u2019s Most Expensive Factories\nSemiconductors are made in factories called fabs. Building and outfitting a new one costs as much as $20 billion.\nThe latest factories rely heavily on computers that are built, programmed and operated by skilled workers armed with machine learning for the next generation of manufacturing processes.\nFor example, AI computing\u00a0can find patterns no human can see, including tiny defects in a product on a fast-moving assembly line. The semiconductor industry needs this technology to create tomorrow\u2019s increasingly large and complex chips. Other industries will be able to use it to make better products faster, too.\nEfficiency Through Simulation\nWe can now create a digital copy of an entire factory. Using NVIDIA technologies, BMW is already building a digital twin of one of its automotive plants to bring new efficiencies to its business.\nNo one has built anything as complex as a digital twin of a chip fab yet, but that goal is now within reach.\nA virtual fab would let specialists design and test new processes much more quickly and cheaply without stopping production in a physical plant. A simulation also can use AI to analyze data from sensors inside physical factories, finding new ways to route materials that reduce waste and speed operations.\nSoon, any manufacturing plant with a digital twin will be more economically competitive than a plant without one.\nVirtual Factories, Real Operators\nDigital twins enable remote specialists to collaborate as if they were in the same room. They also take worker training to a new level.\nSome of the most vital tools in a fab are the size of a shipping container and cost as much as $200 million each. Digital twins let workers train on these expensive systems before they\u2019re even installed.\nOnce trained, workers can qualify, operate and service them without needing to set foot in the ultra-clean rooms where they\u2019re installed. This kind of work represents the future of all manufacturing.\nFactories designed with virtual twins also can optimize energy efficiency, water consumption and maximize reuse, reducing environmental impact.\nWanted: More Performance per Watt\nTomorrow\u2019s factories will need more computing muscle than ever. To deliver it, we need investments in energy-efficient technologies at every level.\nThe circuits inside chips need to use and waste significantly less energy. The signals they send to nearby chips and across global networks must move faster while consuming less power.\nComputers will need to tackle more data-intensive jobs while increasing productivity. To design and build these systems, we need research on new kinds of accelerator chips, accelerated systems and the software that will run on them.\nNVIDIA and others have made great progress in green computing. Now we have an opportunity to take another big step forward.\nA Broad Agenda and Partnerships\nThese are just some of the ways NVIDIA wants to help advance the U.S. semiconductor industry and by extension all manufacturers.\nNo company can do this work alone. Industry, academia and government must collaborate to get this right.\nNVIDIA is at the center of a vibrant ecosystem of 3.5 million developers and more than 12,000 global startups registered in the NVIDIA Inception program.\nThe University of Florida provides a model for advancing AI and data science education across every field of study.\nIn 2020, it kicked off a plan to become one of the nation\u2019s first AI universities. Today it\u2019s infusing its entire curriculum with machine learning. At its heart, UF\u2019s AI supercomputer is already advancing research in fields such as healthcare, agriculture and engineering.\nIt\u2019s one more example of the transformative power of accelerated computing and AI. We look forward to the opportunity to take part in this grand adventure in U.S. manufacturing.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s ideas on the future of semiconductor manufacturing, including how AI is critical to advancing lithography, electronic design tools and cybersecurity processes, read the full document. It\u2019s one of many ways AI can advance public policy.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | GPU Computing | Hardware | New GPU Uses | Public Sector | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Supply chain challenges, labor shortages and economic uncertainty had companies reevaluating their budgets for new technology.\nFor many organizations, AI is viewed as the solution to a lot of the uncertainty bringing improved efficiency, differentiation, automation and reduced cost.\nUntil now, AI computing\u00a0has operated almost exclusively in the cloud. But increasingly diverse streams of data are being generated around the clock from sensors at the edge. These require real-time inference, which is leading more AI deployments to move to edge computing.\nFor airports, stores, hospitals and more, AI brings advanced efficiency, automation and even cost reduction, which is why edge AI adoption accelerated last year.\nIn 2023, expect to see a similarly challenging environment, which will drive the following edge AI trends.\n1. Focus on AI Use Cases With High ROI\nReturn on investment is always an important factor for technology purchases. But with companies looking for new ways to reduce cost and gain a competitive advantage, expect AI projects to become more common.\nA few years ago, AI was often viewed as experimental, but, according to research from IBM, 35% of companies today report using AI in their business, and an additional 42% report they\u2019re exploring AI. Edge AI use cases, in particular, can help increase efficiency and reduce cost, making them a compelling place to focus new investments.\nFor example, supermarkets and big box stores are investing heavily in AI at self-checkout machines to reduce loss from theft and human error. With solutions that can detect errors with 98% accuracy, companies can quickly see a return of investment in a matter of months.\nAI industrial inspection also has an immediate return, helping augment human inspectors on factory lines. Bootstrapped with synthetic data, AI can detect defects at a much higher rate and address a variety of defects that simply cannot be captured manually, resulting in more products with fewer false negative or positive detections.\u00a0\n2. Growth in Human and Machine Collaboration\nOften seen as a far-off use case of edge AI, the use of intelligent machines and autonomous robots is on the rise. From automated distribution facilities to meet the demands of same-day deliveries, to robots monitoring grocery stores for spills and stock outs, to robot arms working alongside humans on a production line, these intelligent machines are becoming more common.\nAccording to Gartner, the use of robotics and intelligent machines is expected to grow significantly by the end of the decade. \u201cBy 2030, 80% of humans will engage with smart robots on a daily basis, due to smart robot advancements in intelligence, social interactions and human augmentation capabilities, up from less than 10% today.\u201d (Gartner, \u201cEmerging Technologies: AI Roadmap for Smart Robots \u2014 Journey to a Super Intelligent Humanoid Robot\u201d, G00761328, June 2022)\nFor this future to happen, one area of focus that needs attention in 2023 is aiding human and machine collaboration. Automated processes benefit from the strength and repeatable actions performed by robots, leaving humans to perform specialized and dexterous tasks that are more suited to our skills. Expect organizations to invest more in this human-machine collaboration in 2023 as a way to alleviate labor shortages and supply chain issues.\n\n3. New AI Use Cases for Safety\nRelated to the trend of human and machine collaboration is that of AI functional safety. First seen in autonomous vehicles, more companies are looking to use AI to add proactive and flexible safety measures to industrial environments.\nHistorically, functional safety has been applied in industrial environments in a binary way, with the primary role of the safety function to immediately stop the equipment from causing any harm or damage when an event is triggered. AI, on the other hand, works in combination with context awareness to predict an event happening. This allows AI to proactively send alerts regarding future potential safety events, preventing the events before they happen, which can drastically reduce safety incidents and related downtime in industrial environments.\nNew functional safety standards that define the use of AI in safety are expected to be released in 2023 and will open the door for early adoption in factories, warehouses, agricultural use cases and more. One of the first areas for AI safety adoption will focus on improved worker safety, including worker posture detection, falling object prevention and personal protection equipment detection.\u00a0\n4. IT Focus on Cybersecurity at the Edge\nCyber attacks rose 50% in 2021 and haven\u2019t slowed down since, making this a top focus for IT organizations. Edge computing, particularly when combined with AI use cases, can increase cybersecurity risk for many organizations by creating a wider attack surface outside of the traditional data center and its firewalls.\nEdge AI in industries like manufacturing, energy, and transportation requires IT teams to expand their security footprint into environments traditionally managed by operational technology teams. Operational technology teams typically focus on operational efficiency as their main metric, relying on air-gapped systems with no network connectivity to the outside world. Edge AI use cases will start to break down these restrictions, requiring IT to enable cloud connectivity while still maintaining strict security standards.\nWith billions of devices and sensors around the world that will all be connected to the internet, IT organizations have to both protect edge devices from direct attack and consider network and cloud security. In 2023, expect to see AI applied to cybersecurity. Log data generated from IoT networks can now be fed through intelligent security models that can flag suspicious behavior and notify security teams to take action.\u00a0\n5. Connecting Digital Twins to the Edge\nThe term digital twin refers to perfectly synchronized, physically accurate virtual representations of real-world assets, processes or environments. Last year, NVIDIA partnered with Siemens to enable industrial metaverse use cases, helping customers accelerate their adoption of industrial automation technologies. Leading companies spanning manufacturing, retail, consumer packaged goods and telco, such as BMW, Lowe\u2019s, PepsiCo and Heavy.AI, have also begun building operational digital twins allowing them to simulate and optimize their production environments.\n\nWhat connects digital twins to the physical world and edge computing is the explosion of IoT sensors and data that is driving both these trends. In 2023, we\u2019ll see organizations increasingly connect live data from their physical environment into their virtual simulations. They\u2019ll move away from historical data-based simulations toward a live, digital environment \u2014 a true digital twin.\nBy connecting live data from the physical world to their digital twins, organizations can gain real-time insight into their environment, allowing them to make faster and more informed decisions. While still early, expect to see massive growth in this space next year for ecosystem providers and in customer adoption.\nThe Year of Edge AI\u00a0\nWhile the 2023 economic environment remains uncertain, edge AI will certainly be an area of investment for organizations looking to drive automation and efficiency. Many of the trends we saw take off last year continue to accelerate with the new focus on initiatives that help drive sales, reduce costs, grow customer satisfaction and enhance operational efficiency.\nVisit NVIDIA\u2019s Edge Computing Solutions page to learn more about edge AI and how we\u2019re helping organizations implement it in their environments today.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | Embedded Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This means that for each hour in which treatment fails to occur, the brain loses as many neurons as it does in more than three and a half years of normal aging.\nWith one of the world\u2019s first portable brain scanners for stroke diagnosis, Australia-based healthcare technology developer EMVision is on a mission to enable quicker triage and treatment to reduce such devastating impacts.\nThe NVIDIA Inception member\u2019s EMVision device fits like a helmet and can be used at the point of care and in ambulances for prehospital stroke diagnosis. It relies on electromagnetic imaging technology and uses NVIDIA-powered AI to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes \u2014 clots and bleeds \u2014 in just minutes.\n\nA cart-based version of the device, built using the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform and NVIDIA DGX systems, can also help with routine monitoring of a patient post-intervention to inform their progress and recovery.\n\u201cWith EMVision, the healthcare community can access advanced, portable solutions that will assist in making critical decisions and interventions earlier, when time is of the essence,\u201d said Ron Weinberger, CEO of EMVision. \u201cThis means we can provide faster stroke diagnosis and treatment to ensure fewer disability outcomes and an improved quality of life for patients.\u201d\n\nPoint-of-Care Diagnosis\nTraditional neuroimaging techniques, like CT scans and MRIs, produce excellent images but require large, stationary, complex machines and specialist operators, Weinberger said. This limits point-of-care accessibility.\nThe EMVision device is designed to scan the brain wherever the patient may be \u2014 in an ambulance or even at home if monitoring a patient who has a history of stroke.\n\u201cWhether for a new, acute stroke or a complication of an existing stroke, urgent brain imaging is required before correct triage, treatment or intervention decisions can be made,\u201d Weinberger said.\nThe startup has developed and validated novel electromagnetic brain scanner hardware and AI algorithms capable of classifying and localizing a stroke, as well as creating an anatomical reconstruction of the patient\u2019s brain.\n\u201cNVIDIA accelerated computing has played an important role in the development of EMVision\u2019s technology, from hardware verification and algorithm development to rapid image reconstruction and AI-powered decision making,\u201d Weinberger said. \u201cWith NVIDIA\u2019s support, we are set to transform stroke diagnosis and care for patients around the world.\u201d\nEMVision uses NVIDIA DGX for hardware verification and optimization, as well as for prototyping and training AI models. EMVision has trained its AI models 10x faster using NVIDIA DGX compared with other systems, according to Weinberger.\nEach brain scanner has an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier module on board for energy-efficient AI inference at the edge. And the startup is looking to use NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano modules for next-generation edge AI.\n\u201cThe interactions between low-energy electromagnetic signals and brain tissue are incredibly complex,\u201d Weinberger said. \u201cMaking sense of these signal interactions to identify if pathologies are present and recreate quality images wouldn\u2019t be possible without the massive power of NVIDIA GPU-accelerated computing.\u201d\nAs a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free, global program for cutting-edge startups, EMVision has shortened product development cycles and go-to-market time, Weinberger added.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news and learn more about NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Jetson | NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Portal remains a timeless classic, with gameplay as fresh, engaging and exciting as it was back in 2007. Relive the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portal reimagined with ray tracing, the groundbreaking AI-accelerated performance of NVIDIA DLSS 3, and the best responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex. Start thinking with portals, with RTX On.\nEach ray of light uses GPU-intensive full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, to accurately model the real-world properties of light, and how that light affects every surface and object. Compared to our work on Quake II RTX and Minecraft with RTX, light bounces up to four times more, and new technologies are incorporated, making Portal with RTX one of the most advanced showcases for simulated light in gaming.

So for the fastest performance, smoothest gaming, and an optimized experience when using NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and full ray tracing, download and install our new Portal with RTX GeForce Game Ready Driver from GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX Full Ray Tracing: The Future Of Video Games\nPortal with RTX offers a preview of gaming\u2019s future, where every frame of gameplay is rendered with stunning full ray tracing, hi-res physically based textures, and cutting-edge technology that makes all of this playable in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing is an advanced, GPU-intensive version of ray tracing, also known as path tracing. It unifies all lighting effects, such as shadows, reflections, global illumination, refraction, and more, into a single ray tracing algorithm. That means every light in Portal with RTX is ray traced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the power of RTX in the fullscreen 4K comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight can be cast from behind the player, or from another room, and in Portal with RTX, light even travels through portals. Glass refracts light, surfaces reflect detail based on their glossiness, reflections can be cast into the scene from behind the player, objects can self-reflect, and indirect light from off-screen illuminates and affects what you see. As you can see from the images and videos on this page, the difference is incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to Quake II RTX and Minecraft with RTX, the full ray tracing introduced by RTX Remix is even more advanced, bouncing light up to four times instead of just once, improving quality, immersion, and the simulation of real-world light. Additionally, we\u2019ve also introduced several new ray tracing techniques that further improve quality, while also being more performant.\nNVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) enables the addition of countless direct light sources, big and small, each casting light and shadows.\nNVIDIA Reservoir Spatio Temporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI) enhances indirect light, enabling it to bathe a scene and illuminate dark corners that are not lit directly. And it also works smarter than previous ray-traced global illumination techniques, improving the efficiency of our ray tracing denoiser.\nA denoiser converts the raw ray-traced output into the beautiful on-screen graphics you experience in Portal with RTX and other ray-traced games. NVIDIA Real Time Denoisers (NRD) is a new spatio-temporal ray tracing denoising library that assists in denoising ray traced images in real-time, with superior performance and quality. Portal with RTX and other new ray-traced games and game updates leverage NRD for maximum quality and performance.\nPortal with RTX also introduces a number of graphical enhancements that improve ray tracing, immersion, realism, and your overall experience.\nVolumetric ray-traced lighting is perhaps the most spectacular, converting the fog effects of old into true, properly simulated volumetrics. Now, thick captivating beams of light pierce through smoke and fog, with light rays realistically scattering, affecting a scene in a realistic manner. There are plenty of others, too, enriching each test chamber in ways developers could only dream of back in 2007.\nPortal\u2019s unique selling point is of course the ability to take anything through a portal, and see through them, something that hadn\u2019t been done before its release. With full ray tracing, light can pass through portals, too, even from the moving High Energy Pellets, causing shadows, reflections and lighting to shift in step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX also introduces ray-traced emissive particles, and emissive game elements, such as our remixed and enhanced Weighted Storage Cube. These all cast light, which is of course fully ray-traced and rendered realistically in the game. For games that make extensive use of particle effects, the upgrade will be jaw-dropping. We\u2019ve also made some fun alternative cubes that can be unlocked by finding QR codes in the game. Scan them with your phone, press Alt+X in-game, go to About > Secrets, enter the code you see on your phone, check the box next to the new entry in the list, and all cubes will be switched to the custom cube you\u2019ve unlocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Portal with RTX, the test facility\u2019s lights get an upgrade, too. The original Portal used point lights exclusively. For a greater variety of lighting, and improved quality, lights of different shapes and sizes have been introduced, along with area lights, enabling entire rooms to be illuminated by a single bright light source, such as the offices that loom over test chambers.\nTo take full advantage of ray tracing, your game assets need to have physically based properties, and ideally be geometrically detailed, too. Without physically based rendering (PBR) materials, light reacts identically on all surfaces. By specifying the attributes of each material and their reflectivity, light bounces, reflects, diffuses and dissipates realistically across each texture.\nAs for surfaces, if they\u2019re flat, as most were in games back in 2007, light won\u2019t react realistically. In the process of remaking each of Portal\u2019s surface materials, we\u2019ve introduced detail, such as bumps, divots and rivets, allowing light to fall across them accurately, bouncing light, creating new shadows, and generating accurate reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the comparison in 4K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maximize the benefit of upgraded materials and surfaces, our team remade many of Portal\u2019s models. Silhouettes were retained to avoid changing their appearance, but in every other respect models were updated, increasing polygon counts and adding geometric detail, allowing them to interact flawlessly with ray tracing, and to look appropriately detailed alongside the game-changing ray-raced effects. A continually-seen example is on the Portal gun: its plastics react differently, and the cylinder is upgraded with ray-traced glass, with accurate fresnel properties, showing accurate real-time reflections that bend and distort across the glass as you attempt to escape from the test facility.\nEven decals, such as bullet holes, blood splatters and scorch marks, have been upgraded with PBR properties. Each texture, model and decal has been reviewed and approved by Valve, ensuring Portal with RTX is evocative of the original game and the upgrades Valve introduced to the testing facility\u2019s assets in Portal 2.\nThe end result is incredible, and with gameplay that\u2019s still as good today as was in 2007, Portal with RTX delivers the definitive experience for anyone discovering Portal for the first time, or returning for a fresh playthrough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX Is Accelerated By NVIDIA DLSS 3\nPortal with RTX\u2019s full ray tracing is beautiful, and incredibly demanding. To experience Portal with RTX at Ultra settings, NVIDIA DLSS and a powerful GeForce RTX GPU are recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Portal with RTX, DLSS 3 enables GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics card owners to experience full ray tracing at 4K at over 60 FPS, a previously unimaginable feat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwners of previous-generation high-performance GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards can leverage the critically-acclaimed DLSS 2 to play at over 60 FPS at 1440p, with Ultra Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a wide array of configurations can play Portal with RTX at 1920x1080, Ultra Settings, with the power of DLSS. For increased performance, settings can be reduced from Ultra to High.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore playing Portal with RTX, please ensure your system matches or exceeds the requirements for CPU and RAM, for the best possible experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor GPUs outside the minimum spec (i.e. RTX 20 Series) and between minimum and recommended (i.e. some RTX 30 Series GPUs) the easiest path to better performance is to use GeForce Experience. Simply download the latest game ready driver (527.56), find Portal with RTX, and click Optimize to automatically configure the best combination of image quality and performance settings for your RTX 20 and 30 Series GPU.\u00a0\nAlternatively we have prepared some recommended graphic settings charts to help guide you to higher frames in your play experience. To adjust your graphics settings in-game press Alt-X to open the Remix graphics window.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese settings target to improve framerates and your experience will vary depending on your system configuration. These settings may also reduce visual quality.\u00a0\nPlease do not alter the Portal \u201cvideo-advanced\u201d settings, as attempting to adjust these settings may lead to instability; press Alt-X to use the Remix graphics settings window instead! If you have already altered Portal advanced video settings we recommend you reset them to default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Responsiveness With NVIDIA Reflex\nAs NVIDIA DLSS revolutionized scaling and performance, NVIDIA Reflex has revolutionized low latency gaming, giving multiplayer gamers a competitive advantage, and making single-player games incredibly responsive. Pinpoint accuracy and timing are key to overcoming Portal with RTX\u2019s most difficult challenges; NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency in Portal with RTX by 33%, making gameplay smooth and more responsive, delivering the reaction time needed in critical moments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX - Built With NVIDIA RTX Remix, The Ultimate Modding Platform\nNVIDIA\u2019s Lightspeed Studios loves bringing RTX to classic games, but each project requires many months of development effort to get everything product-ready. With these challenges in front of us we set out to make a modding platform that enabled gamers and modders of all ability levels to bring ray tracing and NVIDIA technologies to classic games. Combining Open Source technology like DXVK, the latest rendering technology from NVIDIA, and a toolchain built on Omniverse, we were able to achieve this vision. The result is the revolutionary NVIDIA RTX Remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix supports an expansive list of DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with fixed function graphics pipelines. In a compatible game, press the hotkey and the surrounding scene is captured, ready to be enhanced. Then, load into the Remix Application, and use AI to super-res textures and transform materials to be physically based. Rebuild your favorite assets by hand using Omniverse-connected applications like Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance, while you tweak the lighting and set the scene in Remix. Finally, hit a button to compile your changes into a mod that players simply place alongside the game\u2019s .exe to play with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.\nBuilt on NVIDIA Omniverse, RTX Remix solves a multitude of challenges for modders, making classic game graphics easier to mod, and opening the door to modding previously unmoddable games.\nFor graphics modding, it\u2019s a game changer, and with the necessary time and expertise you too can craft a total upgrade like the one we\u2019ve made for Portal.

This means there aren\u2019t enough hours\u2019 worth of speech datasets to easily and accurately create AI models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Telugu.\nAnd that means billions of people are left out of using ASR to improve transcription, translation and additional speech AI applications in Telugu and other low-resource languages.\nTo build an ASR model for Telugu, the NVIDIA speech AI team turned to the NVIDIA NeMo framework for developing and training state-of-the-art conversational AI models. The model won first place in a competition conducted in October by IIIT-Hyderabad, one of India\u2019s most prestigious institutes for research and higher education.\n\nNVIDIA placed first in accuracy for both tracks of the Telugu ASR Challenge, which was held in collaboration with the Technology Development for Indian Languages program and India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology as a part of its National Language Translation Mission.\nFor the closed track, participants had to use around 2,000 hours of a Telugu-only training dataset provided by the competition organizers. And for the open track, participants could use any datasets and pretrained AI models to build the Telugu ASR model.\nNVIDIA NeMo-powered models topped the leaderboards with a word error rate of approximately 13% and 12% for the closed and open tracks, respectively, outperforming by a large margin all models built on popular ASR frameworks like ESPnet, Kaldi, SpeechBrain and others.\n\u201cWhat sets NVIDIA NeMo apart is that we open source all of the models we have \u2014 so people can easily fine-tune the models and do transfer learning on them for their use cases,\u201d said Nithin Koluguri, a senior research scientist on the conversational AI team at NVIDIA. \u201cNeMo is also one of the only toolkits that supports scaling training to multi-GPU systems and multi-node clusters.\u201d\nBuilding the Telugu ASR Model\nThe first step in creating the award-winning model, Koluguri said, was to preprocess the data.\nKoluguri and his colleague Megh Makwana, an applied deep learning solution architect manager at NVIDIA, removed invalid letters and punctuation marks from the speech dataset that was provided for the closed track of the competition.\n\u201cOur biggest challenge was dealing with the noisy data,\u201d Koluguri said. \u201cThis is when the audio and the transcript don\u2019t match \u2014 in this case you cannot guarantee the accuracy of the ground-truth transcript you\u2019re training on.\u201d\nThe team cleaned up the audio clips by cutting them to be less than 20 seconds, chopped out clips of less than 1 second and removed sentences with a greater-than-30 character rate, which measures characters spoken per second.\nMakwana then used NeMo to train the ASR model for 160 epochs, or full cycles through the dataset, which had 120 million parameters.\nFor the competition\u2019s open track, the team used models pretrained with 36,000 hours of data on all 40 languages spoken in India. Fine-tuning this model for the Telugu language took around three days using an NVIDIA DGX system, according to Makwana.\nInference test results were then shared with the competition organizers. NVIDIA won with around 2% better word error rates than the second-place participant. This is a huge margin for speech AI, according to Koluguri.\n\u201cThe impact of ASR model development is very high, especially for low-resource languages,\u201d he added. \u201cIf a company comes forward and sets a baseline model, as we did for this competition, people can build on top of it with the NeMo toolkit to make transcription, translation and other ASR applications more accessible for languages where speech AI is not yet prevalent.\u201d\nNVIDIA Expands Speech AI for Low-Resource Languages\n\u201cASR is gaining a lot of momentum in India majorly because it will allow digital platforms to onboard and engage with billions of citizens through voice-assistance services,\u201d Makwana said.\nAnd the process for building the Telugu model, as outlined above, is a technique that can be replicated for any language.\nOf around 7,000 world languages, 90% are considered to be low resource for speech AI \u2014 representing 3 billion speakers. This doesn\u2019t include dialects, pidgins and accents.\nOpen sourcing all of its models on the NeMo toolkit is one way NVIDIA is improving linguistic inclusion in the field of speech AI.\nIn addition, pretrained models for speech AI, as part of the NVIDIA Riva software development kit, are now available in 10 languages \u2014 with many additions planned for the future.\nAnd NVIDIA last month hosted its inaugural Speech AI Summit, featuring speakers from Google, Meta, Mozilla Common Voice and more.

And in-vehicle compute pushed the envelope with the next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform.\nDelivering up to 2,000 trillion floating operations per second, DRIVE Thor unifies autonomous driving and cockpit functions on a single computer for unprecedented speed and efficiency.\nIn the coming year, the industry will see even more wide-ranging innovations begin to take hold, as industrial metaverse and cloud technologies become more prevalent.\nSimulation technology for AV development has also flourished in the past year. New tools and techniques on NVIDIA DRIVE Sim, including using AI tools for training and validation, have narrowed the gap between the virtual and real worlds.\nHere\u2019s what to expect for intelligent transportation in 2023.\nEnter the Metaverse\nThe same NVIDIA Omniverse platform that serves as the foundation of DRIVE Sim for AV development is also revolutionizing the automotive product cycle. Automakers can leverage Omniverse to unify the 3D design and simulation pipelines for vehicles, and build persistent digital twins of their production facilities.\nDesigners can collaborate between 3D software ecosystems from anywhere in the world, in real time, with Omniverse. With full fidelity RTX ray tracing showing physically accurate lighting and reflections and physical behavior, vehicle designs can be more acutely evaluated and tested before physical prototyping ever begins.\nProduction is the next step in this process, and it requires thousands of parts and workers moving in harmony. With Omniverse, automakers can develop a unified view of their manufacturing processes across plants to streamline operations.\nPlanners can access the full-fidelity digital twin of the factory, reviewing and optimizing as needed. Every change can be quickly evaluated and validated in virtual, then implemented in the real world to ensure maximum efficiency and ergonomics for factory workers.\nCustomers can also benefit from enhanced product experiences. Full-fidelity, real-time car configurators, 3D simulations of vehicles, demonstrations in augmented reality and virtual test drives all help bring the vehicle to the customer.\nThese technologies bridge the gap between the digital and the physical, as the buying experience evolves to include both physical retail spaces and online engagement.\nCloud Migration\nAs remote work becomes a permanent fixture, cloud capabilities are proving vital to growing industries, including transportation.\nLooking ahead, AV developers will be able to access a comprehensive suite of services using NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to design, deploy and experience metaverse applications anywhere. These applications include simulation, in-vehicle experiences and car configurators.\nWith cloud-based simulation, AV engineers can generate physically based sensor data and traffic scenarios to test and validate self-driving technology. Developers can also use simulation to design intelligent vehicle interiors.\nAn autonomous test vehicle running in simulation.\nThese next-generation cabins will feature personalized entertainment, including streaming content. With the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service, passengers will be able to stream over 1,000 titles from the cloud into the vehicle while charging or waiting to pick up passengers.\nAdditionally, Omniverse Cloud enables automakers to offer a virtual showroom for an immersive experience to customize a vehicle before purchasing it from anywhere in the world.\nIndividualized Interiors\nAutonomous driving capabilities will deliver a smoother, safer driving experience for all road users. As driving functions become more automated across the industry, vehicle interiors are taking on a bigger role for automakers to create branded experiences.\nIn addition to gaming, advances in AI and in-vehicle compute are enabling a range of new infotainment technologies, including digital assistants, occupant monitoring, AV visualization, video conferencing and more.\nAI and cloud technologies provide personalized infotainment experiences for every passenger.\nWith NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge, automakers can provide these features across multiple displays in the vehicle. And with software-defined, centralized compute, they can continuously add new capabilities over the air.\nThis emerging cloud-first approach is transforming every segment of the AV industry, from developing vehicles and self-driving systems to operating global fleets.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Omniverse | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It uses automation made possible by the parallel computing capabilities of the bank\u2019s infrastructure, Airoldi notes.\nNext Stop: Machine Learning\nLooking further ahead, Airoldi\u2019s group is mapping the investment bank\u2019s journey into AI.\nIt starts with sentiment analysis, powered by natural language processing. That will help the bank understand market trends more deeply, so it can make even better investment decisions.\n\u201cAI will give us useful ways to map customer and investor behaviors, and we will invest in the technology to develop more AI apps for finance,\u201d said Dova.\nMediobanca\u2019s headquarters is in central Milan, around the corner from the famed Teatro alla Scala.\nTheir work comes as banks of all sorts are starting to apply AI to dozens of use cases.\n\u201cAI is one of the most promising technologies in finance,\u201d said Airoldi, who foresees using it for classical quantitative problems, too.\nIt\u2019s All About the Math\nIn the last few years, the bank has added dozens of GPUs to its infrastructure. Each offers up to 100x the performance of a CPU, he said.\nThat means Mediobanca can do more with less. It reduces its total cost of ownership while accelerating workloads that create competitive advantages such as Monte Carlo simulations used to create and price advanced investment products.\nUnder the hood, great financial performance is based on excellence in math, said Airoldi, who earned his Ph.D. in theoretical condensed matter physics.\n\u201cThe mathematical models and numeric methods of finance are closely related to those found in theoretical physics, so investment banking is a great job for a physicist,\u201d he said.\nWhen Airoldi needs a break from work, you might find him playing chess in the Piazza della Scala, across from the famed opera house, just around the corner from the bank\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Financial Services | GPU Computing | Hardware | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA in Europe \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

McKinsey estimates that AI technologies could deliver up to $1 trillion of additional value yearly for global banking.\nFrankfurt-based Deutsche Bank is a leading global investment bank with more than 80,000 employees in 58 countries worldwide.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s initiatives promise to speed efforts to serve customers worldwide, develop new data-driven products and services, increase efficiency and recruit tech talent.\nTogether, Deutsche Bank and NVIDIA have initially focused on three potential implementations with a multi-year ambition to expand this to over a hundred, which the companies are exploring.\nWith NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, Deutsche Bank\u2019s AI developers, data scientists and IT professionals will be able to build and run AI workflows anywhere, including in its hosted on-premises data centers and on Google Cloud, the bank\u2019s public cloud provider. (In related news, NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA AI Enterprise 3.0.)\nNext-Generation Risk Management\nPrice discovery, risk valuation and model backtesting require computationally intensive calculations on massive traditional CPU-driven server grid farms. Accelerated compute delivers more accurate results in real time, helping provide more value to customers while lowering total costs by as much as 80%.\nMany bank functions that typically process overnight, like risk valuation, can now be run in real time on accelerated compute.\nThis represents a leap forward in how traders can manage risk by running more scenarios faster on a more energy-efficient grid farm.\nRedefining Personalized Customer Service With Interactive Avatars\nDeutsche Bank is exploring how to engage employees, potential recruits and customers more interactively, improving experiences using 3D virtual avatars in real time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nAn early potential implementation enabled Deutsche Bank to create a 3D virtual avatar to help employees navigate internal systems and respond to HR-related questions.\nFuture use cases will explore immersive virtual experiences with banking clients.\nDeriving Insights Out of Unstructured Data\nExtracting critical information from unstructured data has long been challenging. But existing large language models don\u2019t perform well on financial texts.\nTransformers, a type of neural network that learns context and, thus, meaning from data, introduced in 2017, could change this.\nA single pretrained model can perform amazing feats \u2014 including text generation, translation and even software programming \u2014 and is the basis of the new generation of AI.\nDeutsche Bank and NVIDIA are testing a collection of large language models called Financial Transformers, or Finformers.\nThese systems will have the potential to provide early warning signs of counterparty risk, retrieve data faster and identify data quality issues.\nExplore how NVIDIA\u2019s AI solutions and enterprise-level AI platforms drive innovation in financial services.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Financial Services \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And with the introduction of DLSS 3 in October, performance can now be accelerated by up to 4X in fully ray-traced games.\nAlong with the launch of Portal with RTX on December 8th, this holiday season we\u2019re also celebrating a major milestone - the addition of DLSS to over 250 released games and apps! Few technologies have been adopted as quickly by developers across the world, and integrated into every publicly available game engine, allowing budding developers and small indie studios to add DLSS to their projects with just a few clicks.\nDLSS adoption is continually accelerating, and this month it\u2019s coming to December\u2019s biggest releases, including the aforementioned Portal with RTX, plus The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns. And Jurassic World Evolution 2\u2019s existing integration of DLSS 2 gets upgraded to DLSS 3, giving GeForce RTX 40 Series owners even faster performance at the highest resolutions and detail levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Frame Rates\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking revolution in AI-powered graphics, increasing performance on GeForce RTX GPUs using dedicated Tensor Cores.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds.\nCertain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates. In Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, DLSS 3 boosts frame rates by up to 2X.\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide Out Now With DLSS 3 & Ray Tracing\nFatshark\u2019s Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide and Warhammer: Vermintide 2 are phenomenally successful, much-loved four-player co-op action games set in the End Times of the Warhammer Fantasy world.

And there\u2019s also Game Ready support for the addition of DLSS 3 to Jurassic World Evolution 2.\nToday there are over 100 games and over 70 applications available with ray tracing support, including the highest rated and most played 2022 games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Fortnite, F1\u24c7 22, Forza Horizon 5, Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Remastered, Resident Evil Village, The Callisto Protocol, Warhammer 40:000: Darktide, and World of Warcraft: Dragonflight. And this holiday\u2019s biggest titles, like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, are also adding ray tracing.\nFor the definitive experience, gamers should ensure their GPU is ready for today\u2019s advanced ray-traced games, such as Portal with RTX, and future-proofed for tomorrow's biggest hits. Only GeForce RTX can deliver the very best experience, thanks to dedicated Ray Tracing cores, the AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS, and many more features.\nRead on to learn more about our new driver; to download and install on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems, simply fire up GeForce Experience and click the \"Drivers\" tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Portal with RTX - Out Now For Free On PC!\nNow 15 years old, Portal remains a timeless classic, with gameplay as fresh, engaging and exciting as it was back in 2007. Today, we\u2019re releasing a fully ray-traced reimagining of Portal in collaboration with Valve, for free. Called Portal with RTX, it uses the power of GeForce RTX graphics cards to render every aspect of Portal with previously unimaginable, jaw-dropping detail.\nEach ray of light uses GPU-intensive full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, to accurately model the real-world properties of light, and how that light affects every surface and object. Compared to our work on Quake II RTX and Minecraft with RTX, light bounces up to four times more, and new technologies are incorporated, making Portal with RTX one of the most advanced showcases for simulated light in gaming.\nIllumination, shadows, reflections, refraction, and everything in between are all a result of the fully ray traced world, and its interactions with the upgraded and enhanced assets that have been rebuilt hand in hand with Valve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet further details about the tech, enhancements, and new features of Portal with RTX by heading on over to our launch article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\u2019s Next-Gen Update\nOn December 14th, all TheWitcher 3: Wild Hunt PC players will receive a free update that adds various gameplay changes, new quest content, and new graphics features that take full advantage of the latest PCs and laptops.\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nRTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) adds more immersive and realistic outdoor ray-traced lighting\nRay-traced ambient occlusion improves shading around objects occluding light\nRay-traced shadows improve the fidelity, clarity and visibility of shadows\nRay-traced reflections increase the accuracy and quality of reflections on bodies of water and other suitably reflective surfaces\n\nOn top of that, Ultra+ settings increase draw distances, foliage density, background character detail, asset quality, and more. Texture resolutions are increased and environments gain new geometric detail. The list goes on!\nTo accelerate your performance when all of these features are enabled and maxed out, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\u2019s next-gen update also introduces support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, enabling GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers to multiply their performance. All other GeForce RTX gamers can accelerate their frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 2. And everyone can reduce system latency with NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get these next-gen upgrades, simply download and install The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. On December 14th, CD PROJEKT RED will launch the free update, and your game will be automatically enhanced. Stay tuned to their social media pages for further updates and the complete set of patch notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Jurassic World Evolution 2\u2019s DLSS 3 Update\nFrontier Developments, in collaboration with Universal Games and Digital Platforms, is releasing the Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Malta Expansion today.\nSet before the epic events of Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment\u2019s Jurassic World Dominion, the Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Malta Expansion will task players with helping to lead a brand-new enterprise in Malta. Working alongside Cabot Finch and a star-studded cast of characters, including Kayla Watts (voiced by DeWanda Wise), Soyona Santos (voiced by Dichen Lachman), Barry Semb\u00e8ne (voiced by Omar Sy), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott) players will set up parks across three stunning Mediterranean locations.\nAvailable alongside the paid DLC is a free update for all existing players, which includes DLSS 3, and a range of new features, including attacking and eating behaviors for smaller species, five campaign levels now available to play as challenge maps, a range of new skin and pattern colors for select dinosaur variants, and a range of Quality of Life enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith DLSS 3 enabled, your dinosaur parks will be rendered at even faster frame rates, giving you the headroom to max out graphics and crank up the resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nLearn more about GeForce Game Ready Drivers here; download the new GeForce Game Ready 527.56 WHQL driver through GeForce Experience.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can better assist you.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Baidu via VideoCardz)\n\n\n\n\nGiven the rousing flop that was Nvidia's attempted 12GB RTX 4080 I was foolishly hoping the upcoming 4070 Ti would be a shining light for the brand's GPU offering. If these cards came in at a friendly price-point, they could be a great choice for upcoming builds. But after seeing the prices projected by Chinese stores, any optimism I had has largely been dashed. If you're happy to pay about the same amount Nvidia was planning on hawking those aforementioned 12GB 4080s for, then I guess you're in luck.According to VideoCardz, some Chinese retailers have begun taking preorders for the upcoming 4070 Ti cards giving us a look into the potential pricing for the units. These do vary a bunch, especially as the Chinese market tends to focus on custom cards, but it still delivers an indication that the prices on these cards are going to be too damned high.The cheapest offering reported on is the Inno3D RTX 4070 Ti X3 which is going for 7199 RMB or about $1034 USD. Given 4080 cards are quite commonly around $1,200 USD in North American stores, this doesn't exactly bode well.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nBest Buy outs a load of non-MSRP RTX 5070 cards and many are priced above $700 and up near RTX 5070 Ti levels. Ouch!\n\n\n\n\nAMD prices its new Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs at $549 and $599 and we're very excited\n\n\n\nInno3D is also the proud owner of the most expensive card on the list, the Inno3D RTX 4070 Ti iChill which sits at 8399 RMB or $1,206 USD. It's hard to imagine one of these being worth the choice over a straight 4080. We'll no doubt have a play with one of these cards when we can get our hands on them, but I'd be surprised if benchmarking went in favour of the 4070 Ti in that matchup.Cooling off(Image credit: Cooler Master, EKWB)Best AIO cooler for CPUs: All-in-one, and one for all... components.\nBest CPU air coolers: CPU fans that don't go brrr.Other cards in the line-up include a few offerings from Gigabyte. The Gigabyte RTX 4070 Ti Eagle, Gaming OC, AORUS Elite, and AORUS Master are all there, sitting in between the price ranges of about $1,070 and $1,175. There's no sign of the Aero we got a look at last week, but it's likely this will fall somewhere in that range too. Still, at these prices I don't think any of these are cards we're going to be rushing out to recommend.We'll likely see these cards on display at CES with a launch on January 5, but unless Nvidia has some big surprises on the price front there's not much to get excited about. Coming in at the same price that those 12GB 4080s were slated for is a pretty big ooff in my books. \u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nHope CorriganSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterHope\u2019s been writing about games for about a decade, starting out way back when on the Australian Nintendo fan site Vooks.net.

Dubbed the Meta \u201cGrand Teton\u201d the new platform is designed to house 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs while greatly increasing interconnect bandwidth.\nThis is the Meta Grand Teton 8x NVIDIA H100 Machine\nThis is the side view of the massive Meta Grand Teton system with 8x NVIDIA H100 GPUs in a pull-out tray:\nFacebook Meta Grand Teton 8x NVIDIA H100 Platform Tray Out\nOne can see a few common features. For example, Meta is using many OCP NIC 3.0 form factor network cards. There are at least ten that we could on the front of the chassis. In this generation with PCIe Gen5, they can be 200GbE or 400GbE/ 400Gbps IB ports. The company also has an EDSFF (E1) storage array on the front of the chassis and another section for E1.S boot drives. If you want to learn more about EDSFF you can see E1 and E3 EDSFF to Take Over from M.2 and 2.5 in SSDs. This is a great example of the M.2 boot devices being phased out in favor of E1.S.\n\nMeta says that the new system offers significantly more bandwidth, and also simplifies deployment with a single box versus having a CPU head node, a switching box, and then the accelerators.\nMeta Grand Teton Performance Boost\nAt the same time, power is up 2x over the previous generation which is quite impressive. That is a bigger jump than the NVIDIA A100 to NVIDIA H100 jump with the H100\u2019s public specs at 700W. CPU TDP is going up in this generation as is NIC TDP.\nFinal Words\nMeta uses AI all over, and is a leader in the space, so seeking more performance makes a lot of sense here. This is an especially interesting announcement since Meta RSC Selected NVIDIA and Pure Storage for its AI Research Cluster in the NVIDIA A100 generation. Now, Meta has its own training platform. This does not seem like the company\u2019s craziest platform, but it is nice to see some innovation happening in the space. For companies that are not Meta, this platform looks very similar to many of the Supermicro, QCT, and other platforms that we have seen for 8x NVIDIA H100 configurations.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSEDSFFFacebookH100MetaOCPOCP NIC 3.0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleInspur i24M6 2U4N Intel Xeon Server ReviewNext articleThis AIC SB407-TU 60-bay Storage Server Houses over 1PB of Capacity Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n1 COMMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 31, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:45 am                                            \n\n\n\nahahah ! love that name, in French : big tits :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorDec 12, 2022, 02:02pm ESTShareSaveCommentThis article is more than 2 years old.AMD's New Radeon RX 7900 XTX Graphics CardAMD\nIn a battle that seems as old as time, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has launched new gaming GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) based on its latest RDNA 3 microarchitecture, to do battle with chief rival NVIDIA and its latest GeForce RTX 40 series cards that launched back in October of this year. The new Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT are AMD\u2019s newest flagship cards, and the company has managed to deliver a competitive offering for PC Gamers at more attractive price points that deliver a solid value proposition. But before we dig into the particulars on performance and retail pricing, let\u2019s have a high-level look at what makes AMD\u2019s Navi 31 GPU, that powers these new gaming beasts, tick.\n\n\nFor decades now, die shrinks on smaller and smaller semiconductor fab process geometries have delivered gains via faster clock speeds, and the ability to pack more transistors into a chip with better power efficiency characteristics. However, these benefits have started to wane with continually shrinking chip process lithography. As such, chip manufacturers have turned to new \u201cchiplet\u201d based design architectures that allow them to manufacturer multiple more efficient smaller chip dies, and then assemble them in a single multi-chip package for greater efficiency, performance and cost. It used to be that MCM (multi-chip module) packaging was cost-prohibitive. However, as packaging technologies have advanced more recently, the net-net is that chiplets are the way of the future for more complex processor designs, and new AMD\u2019s Navi 31 is the first chiplet-base consumer GPU on the market.\n\nEnter AMD Navi 31 And The First Chiplet-Based Consumer GPUAMD's Navi 31 GPU That Powers Its Radeon RX 7900 Series Graphic CardsAMD\n\nWithout wading too far into the weeds, AMD\u2019s RDNA 3-based (Radeon DNA 3) Navi 31 GPU that powers the new Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT, is comprised of two separate die types, a 300mm2 GCD or Graphics Compute Die and a 6 x 37mm2 (about 222mm2 in total) MCD or Memory Cache Dies. The former is manufactured on a 5nm (nanometer) chip process and the latter on 6nm. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XTX employs 6 MCDs with a 384-bit memory interface (64-bit per die), along with 24GB of GDDR6 memory and 96MB of on-board AMD Infinity Cache, offering 3500GB/s of effective memory bandwidth. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XT only utilizes 5 MCDs to create a 320-bit memory interface to 20GB of GDDR6 memory and 80MB of on-board Infinity Cache, for a total of up to 2900 GB/s of effective memory bandwidth. The more powerful Radeon RX 7900 XTX also has 96 Radeon Compute Units (CUs) and 96 Ray Accelerators, versus the Radeon RX 7900 XT\u2019s 84 CU and 84 Ray Accelerator complement. All in, a Radeon RX 7900 XTX has a 355 Watt board power while a 7900 XT is a 315 Watt design, versus the previous gen 335 Watt Radeon RX 6950 XT, that employs just 80 CUs, 80 ray accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory.\n\nSo, as we can see, AMD was able to pack more resources into a similar or lower power envelope, though the Radeon RX 7900 series also has a myriad of other architecture advancements that bring refinement and additional performance headroom beyond just what these physics advancements have delivered. The good news for PC gamers is that the performance-per-dollar metrics have scaled nicely as well.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nRadeon RX 7900 XTX And RX 7900 Scrap With GeForce RTX 4080 At Better Price PointsAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Graphics Card - $999 MSRPAMD\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps most compelling about AMD\u2019s new Radeon RX 7900 series, is that all of these additional resources and claimed performance gains come at essentially the same price points as the company\u2019s previous gen Radeon RX 6900 series. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 XT 20GB reference design card will retail for $899, while the flagship Radeon RX 7900 XTX, with its higher boost clocks, 24GB GDDR6 memory and fully-enabled Navi 31 GPU will retail for $999. And though AMD targeted GeForce RTX 4080 16GB class performance with these cards, they\u2019re priced at $300 and $200 less, respectively. So with that in mind, let\u2019s look quickly at how the benchmark numbers shake out, from Marco Chiappetta\u2019s Radeon RX 7900 series review at HotHardware.\n\n AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX And 7900 XT Performance - FarCry 6HotHardware.comAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX And 7900 XT Performance - Forza 5 HorizonHotHardware.comAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX And 7900 XT Performance - F1 2022 With Ray TracingHotHardware.com\nThese game benchmarks do a nice job of quickly summarizing AMD Radeon RX 7900 series performance as it has played out so far. Though AMD likely is still wringing additional FPS out of its drivers, generally speaking, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT slot in just above and just below GeForce RTX 4080 performance, depending on game title and graphics settings. The above graphs show all high resolution 4K max quality game settings, and we see the two Radeons sandwich the GeForce RTX 4080 fairly consistently. It\u2019s only with some ray tracing-enabled titles like F1 2022 that we see the new Radeon RX 7900 series trail an RTX 4080 somewhat, as NVIDIA\u2019s 3rd gen RT engines are more powerful on the whole. However, if we look at the case of FarCry 6, which also has ray tracing enabled here, performance scales back in AMD\u2019s favor for the Radeon RX 7900 XTX versus the GeForce RTX 4080.\nThe Wrap-Up - AMD\u2019s Latest Volley Puts The Heat On NVIDIAAMD Radeon RX 7900 Graphics Card - $899 MSRPAMD\nAll told, though AMD can\u2019t claim the top performance crown here with the new Radeon RX 7900 series \u2014 that distinction is firmly set by NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 4090 \u2014 the company has delivered a compelling value proposition with generally better performance-per-dollar metrics, as long as retail pricing drops in at MSRP for reference cards, with similar price points for custom cards from OEM partners like XFX, MSI, ASUS and others. In addition, since Radeon RX 7900 series cards are roughly the same size as previous gen Radeons, they\u2019re easier drop-in upgrades for gamers, versus NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 4080 and 4090, which will require more chassis room and may not fit inside some mid-tower and smaller PC cases.\nWhat did surprise me a little bit, was that power consumption for the new Radeon RX 7900 series is generally a little higher than NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 40 series under load. Although, I\u2019m not sure that will matter much to most desktop PC gamers, especially with standard dual 8-pin PCIe power connectors on the new Radeons, versus NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 40 series 12-pin dongles that require 3 - 4 PCIe power leads patched in.\nIt will be interesting to watch how these two PC graphics powerhouse duke it out in the weeks and months ahead, but in the meantime it appears AMD has a very compelling offering in the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, and at very competitive price points to boot that undercut NVIDIA.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The company hasn't left any clues on its website about what might be announced, but sources are now reporting that the company could debut its long awaited RTX 4070 Ti graphics card. \nIf you aren't familiar with the RTX 4070 Ti, the card originally debuted back in September as the RTX 4080 12GB. The card offered 7,680 CUDA cores and had 12GB GDDR6X memory. While there's nothing wrong with its specifications as a standalone product, it didn't sit right with people at the time, when pricing and performance were compared to the higher tier RTX 4080 16GB model. Furthermore, people felt that the card didn't really deserve the RTX 4080 moniker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, Nvidia seemed to hear the public outcry and eventually made the right move and decided to \"unlaunch\" the card. While it didn't give details about what would happen to the RTX 4080 12GB at the time, reports began to swirl that it could be reborn as the RTX 4070 Ti at a later date. It looks like the time has finally arrived, as new reports state that Nvidia will finally announce the RTX 4070 Ti during CES and that pricing might even come in lower than expected, launching at $799 upon its release.\nWhat makes this news even more exciting is that the specifications for the card popped up momentarily on the Nvidia website, with Twitter user 188\u53f7 grabbing a screenshot before it was pulled. As we head into 2023, there are now plenty of graphics card options available, with newly released offerings from both Nvidia and AMD. For the most part, pricing seems to be relatively stable this generation, but getting your hands on the top-end cards from Nvidia and AMD is still a bit of struggle. Nvidia has yet to officially announce a release date or acknowledge the RTX 4070 Ti, so things could always change. \nSource: Wccftech, 188\u53f7 (Twitter) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

Newegg knows this, as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 has hit its top spot in best-selling graphics cards, with the flagship RTX 4090 GPU taking 3rd place among shoppers.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Takes Up Best Selling GPU Spot At Newegg Followed By RTX 4090 In A Close 3rd Spot\nThis news does come as a surprise as recent reports have shown that the GeForce RTX 4080 has had lacking sales throughout the marketplace. Newegg reports that the store's top seller is the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4080 Gaming OC graphics card ($1,269.99). Interestingly enough, the previous generation graphics cards, such as NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti models, remain a favorite in the top 5 spots with consumers due to the lower pricing found in the RTX 30 series GPUs.\n\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT and Radeon RX 6600 are even farther behind the highest-priced RTX 4090 GPU, even though NVIDIA's graphics card is currently $1,599.99 and both AMD models are $479 and $329, respectively. However, Newegg's competitor Amazon shows different top-selling graphics cards that differ from the PC seller.\n\nWHAT? WHY? HOW?https://t.co/O2C0qlyOcH pic.twitter.com/Ej5O3vGpxr\n\u2014 Hassan Mujtaba (@hms1193) December 13, 2022\n\nAmazon reveals that the top-selling graphics card is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. The RTX 4080 and 4090 cards are much further behind in sales. For instance, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 is in 15th place, while the RTX 4080 is almost twice as far back, sitting in 28th place. What could cause such a dramatic difference in sales? A few factors come into play with comparing Newegg and Amazon. Amazon is a worldwide seller of more than just PC hardware & components. The online retail giant also sells books, clothing, movies, and more, while Newegg is more centralized in what you would find through them.\nAlso, there has always been a history of review moderation on the internet, with Amazon seemingly in the spotlight for third-party sellers \"fluffing\" their products to a five-star rating. And, because retailers do not show sales in numbers of units sold, Newegg or Amazon could have outsold the other on specific GPUs, making it more difficult to say what is genuinely the best-selling graphics card.\nAMD has released the Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX variants ($899 and $999), and on Newegg's website, the cards are at the bottom of the list, even with fantastic pricing. This could dramatically change over the next month as the tech giant has reportedly shipped around 200,000 units for its Q4 2022 supply. We may have to wait to see the best-selling card of 2022 after the year's end to see if AMD's numbers change.\nNews Source: Tom's Hardware\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n174\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n107\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n82\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We are expecting these products to mature soon. Today you can create fantastic images yet they are still hard to control. We will be seeing other types of control where you can doodle or sketch, making it easier to create content. I think this will be really exciting, people can create games or 3D worlds much more easily,\" explained Gal Chechik, Director of AI at NVIDIA, speaking to CTech at Calaclist\u2019s 2023 Forecast conference about the vast potential of generative tech.Chechik explained the reason robotics and self-driving cars are progressing so slowly. \u201cIn these areas we need AI to interact with the physical world. A car, while driving, needs to interact with other cars. It's not just the processing of an image, it needs to respond to other drivers and that changes how other cars react to it - this takes a long time. In order to have a good simulation you need to be really fast and really accurate, otherwise it fails in the real world.\"You can watch the full interview with Chechik in the video above.

Now, developer CD PROJEKT RED is upgrading their open-world role-playing masterpiece with a swathe of enhancements, a suite of advanced ray-traced effects, and NVIDIA DLSS 3 \u2013 totally free of charge for all existing owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cNext-Gen Update\u201d is available now on all storefronts, upgrading your existing installs of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt automatically. Once you load into the DirectX 12 version of the game, you can enable:\n\nRTX Global Illumination (RTXGI), adding more immersive and realistic outdoor ray-traced lighting,\nRay-traced ambient occlusion, improving shading around objects occluding light,\nRay-traced shadows, improving the fidelity, clarity, realism and visibility of shadows,\nRay-traced reflections, increasing the accuracy and quality of reflections on bodies of water and other suitably reflective surfaces,\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 AI-powered performance boosts for GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards,\nNVIDIA DLSS 2, DLSS Super Resolution on all GeForce RTX PCs, laptops and GPUs,\nNVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency by up to 43%, for an even smoother, more responsive experience.\n\nIn addition to all that amazing tech, Ultra+ game settings increase draw distances, foliage density, background character detail, asset quality, and more. Texture resolutions are increased and environments gain new geometric detail. And so much more, which you can read about in full in the patch notes.\nAll of this is best experienced on GeForce RTX systems, thanks to our performance-accelerating Ray Tracing Cores, and DLSS, our best-in-class AI-powered super resolution technology. For further info, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Ray Tracing\nNVIDIA has worked closely with CD PROJEKT RED on numerous projects, and helped bring its awe-inspiring Cyberpunk 2077 ray tracing effects to life. Much of this work was instrumental in helping upgrade The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, enabling the introduction of four high-fidelity ray-traced effects that greatly enhance the realism of the game\u2019s graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Global Illumination (RTXGI)\nIn reality, sunlight bounces, increasing the illumination of nearby surfaces and objects. Furthermore, the color properties of surfaces are absorbed and added to bounces, so for example, bright light bounced from a red wall to a white tiled floor would feature a tinge of red.\nRecreating this effect in games requires ray tracing, and with the addition of NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI), the realistic properties of light can be accurately simulated with our highly performant technique (a lower-precision implementation of RTXGI is also available in the next-gen console edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt).\nRTXGI is utilized in all gameplay and cutscenes, and is truly transformative. Combined with the updated time of day weather conditions, players will now experience a much more realistic image when exploring the massive world of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Colored lighting bounces realistically across the scene and onto characters, the warm glow of the sun is replicated across surfaces rather than just in the sky, and in general scenes appear as you would expect them to in reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Ambient Occlusion\nAmbient Occlusion generates shadows and adjusts shading where objects and game elements occlude light. This often manifests as the smallest, finest shadows around creases in clothing, between pages of paper, and around pebbles on the ground. Without ambient occlusion, games look flat, objects appear to be floating, and realism is greatly diminished.\nWith ray tracing, we can crank up the accuracy and quality of the effect, ensuring every nook and cranny is correctly shadowed, further refining image quality and immersion.\nRay-traced ambient occlusion enhances all gameplay and cutscenes, and works in tandem with RTXGI to make visuals even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Shadows\nUsing ray tracing, we\u2019re adding an extra level of refinement to shadows created by the sun, and the moon. These are intelligently incorporated with the game\u2019s rasterized shadows to increase detail, most noticeably on finely-detailed game elements, and to alleviate shadow aliasing and other common issues.\nThese enhancements help ground objects and shadows, add genuine contact hardening and softening, and in general further improve fidelity, immersion and realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections\nRay-traced reflections primarily enhance large bodies of water and puddles, which previously relied on screen space reflections. With ray tracing, reflections are far more accurate, and occlusion artifacts are eliminated, creating a more cohesive and immersive image.\nRay-traced reflections are also applied to most other surfaces, improving image quality and realism throughout, with added detail most visible on floors, as in the game\u2019s opening scene, on metal armor, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 3: Accelerate The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Frame Rates By Up To 2.3X\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking revolution in AI-powered graphics, increasing performance on GeForce RTX GPUs using dedicated Tensor Cores.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology; developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default.\nIn The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, DLSS 3 increases performance by up to 2.3X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex: Reduce System Latency By Up To 43%\nResponsive gameplay is as important as having a high frame rate, and to ensure The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\u2019s gameplay is super smooth, we\u2019re also brought NVIDIA Reflex to the game.\nReflex feature reduces system latency, meaning your actions occur faster, making gameplay feel snappier and more enjoyable. When enabled, Reflex reduces system latency by up to 43%.\nIn-game, enter the video options and activate NVIDIA Reflex. For even lower latency, select \u201cOn + Boost\u201d, and optimize other parts of your system to further reduce system latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Game Ready Driver Is Available Now\nTo experience The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\u2019s next-gen update at its best, ensure you download and install our new Game Ready Driver. Grab it from GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Experience also provides one-click optimal settings for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\u2019s next-gen update, allowing you to instantly configure the game\u2019s many options for your system\u2019s hardware, immediately giving you optimized gameplay.

That\u2019s mostly due to its streaming video prowess, but there\u2019s also the GameStream system, which let gamers stream PC games from a local Nvidia-powered laptop or desktop. Despite heavily advertising the technology since the original Shield Portable, Nvidia will shut down the streaming service in February. \nThe Shield TV\u2019s GameStream feature runs on a local network, and needs a powerful PC in the same building in order to work. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with Nvidia GeForce Now, the cloud gaming service which streams PC games from an Nvidia data center (and which charges for its most premium features). The latter seems to be the focus of Nvidia\u2019s streaming strategy going forward, and doesn\u2019t appear to be in danger of disappearing at the time of writing. \n\n\nGameStream began its life on the original Shield, the chunky, Android-powered portable that debuted in 2013. At the time it was the best option on the market for low-latency streaming PC games from a desktop to a portable device, even if it did require high-end network equipment to work well. The Shield Portable never got a second-generation device (ditto for the Shield Tablet) but the GameStream service remained a banner feature as Nvidia transitioned the brand into a powerful gaming-focused set-top box. \nThe market is in a different place today. GameStream will disappear with a device update in February 2023. The short email doesn\u2019t give a reason for the shutdown, but it\u2019s a safe guess that the company is transitioning resources from a product feature that\u2019s probably seldom-used into GeForce Now, and the potential subscription revenue it might generate. That\u2019s understandable, but GeForce Now isn\u2019t a one-to-one replacement for GameStream: its library is limited (with some publishers like Activision absent entirely) and users can\u2019t adjust most graphical settings. \n\n\n\n\nIn its announcement email, Nvidia suggests gamers replace GameStream with Steam Link, which works well on the Android TV-powered device. Other services like Moonlight also fit that particular niche. \n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

View All PagesAlthough AMD has made huge inroads into the workstation CPU market, it still hasn't had the same success where graphics acceleration is concerned. NVIDIA continues to rule the workstation GPU roost. Since the release of the Ampere-generation RTX Ax000 series, NVIDIA has launched Ax500 models that widen the range. We took at a look at the mainstream NVIDIA RTX A4500 from PNY and ask the question: should you upgrade from the A4000?\nThe first thing we should mention is that NVIDIA has dropped the Quadro branding with the Ampere professional GPUs. There's an Ada generation just emerging, too, but that is only available with the top-end 6000 model so far. As its number suggests, the A4500 sits between the A4000 and A5000. However, where the A4000 uses NVIDIA's GA104 GPU, the A4500 uses the GA102 like the A5000. That means the GPU is related to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, where the A4000 is related to the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.\nIn terms of specification, the A4500 unsurprisingly sits between the A4000 and A5000. However, it's a little more like the A5000, with a faster base and boost GPU clock, faster memory, and a wider bus width. The memory allocation also sits precisely in between the two other models.\n\nThe key thing, however, is that while the A5000 is almost \u00a31,000 more than the A4000, the A4500 is only \u00a3300 more. That means it could be exactly what you need if the A4000 is just that little bit underpowered but you don't have an extra grand in your budget. So exactly how much more performance do you get for the extra \u00a3300? We ran the A4500 against the A4000 with a suite of professional workloads.
