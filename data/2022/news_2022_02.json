We\u2019ve achieved this through the constant development of new innovations, such as Max-Q, our suite of technologies that optimize laptops to deliver high performance in thin form factors.\nOne key Max-Q advancement is NVIDIA Advanced Optimus, giving GeForce RTX laptop users the best performance, optimized battery life, the lowest gaming latency, and G-SYNC display panels, for tear-free, super smooth gaming.\nAdvanced Optimus automatically selects whether the GeForce GPU or integrated graphics is driving the internal display, and based on what application is running, switches as needed, delivering meaningful, measurable benefits that improve your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA Advanced Optimus?\nNVIDIA Advanced Optimus is an evolution of NVIDIA Optimus, a legacy, game-changing feature. Before its invention, a laptop either ran via low-performance integrated graphics, or high-performance power-intensive GPUs. There was no middle ground, and most importantly, no way to dynamically switch which processor was driving the internal display. Instead, users had to reboot their laptop, and potentially change BIOS settings.\nNVIDIA Optimus introduced a way to dynamically switch between the two graphics processors. The integrated graphics would always drive the display. Profiles from our GeForce drivers told the system when a game or app would benefit from high-performance graphics and GPU acceleration, and the GeForce GPU would be tagged in to render the 3D game and pass the rendered frames to the integrated graphics to display. When the game or app was shut down, display duties went back to the integrated graphics, lengthening the laptop\u2019s battery life. \u00a0\nNVIDIA Advanced Optimus improves upon the original by introducing a hardware-based dynamic display switch that allows GeForce GPUs to directly control the display, rather than routing via the IGP. Bypassing integrated graphics increases game performance, reduces system latency when gaming, and enables the use of G-SYNC variable refresh rate displays, improving users\u2019 experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does NVIDIA Advanced Optimus Enhance A GeForce RTX Laptop?\nUsing benchmarks, we can demonstrate the real-world benefits of NVIDIA Advanced Optimus, versus Optimus and non-Optimus laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming Performance\nFrame rate is king when gaming, and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus delivers considerable increases in frame rates, from 11% to 27%, and beyond, in a wide range of games.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimized Battery Life\nBy intelligently switching between the GeForce GPU and integrated graphics, battery life can be optimized giving you the best performance when you need it, and the best battery life when you\u2019re not gaming. All done seamlessly and automatically without needing to reboot your laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Latency\nSystem latency dictates how responsive your games are. NVIDIA has continually been at the forefront of gaming responsiveness, realizing long ago it\u2019s just as important as a high frame rate. Most recently, we introduced NVIDIA Reflex, a suite of technologies designed to measure and reduce system latency in games, and we\u2019ve detailed how you can make system tweaks to get latency even lower.\nWith NVIDIA Advanced Optimus, we remove the bottleneck between the GPU and the display, reducing latency by up to 22% in popular esports titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC Displays\nBefore NVIDIA invented variable refresh rate G-SYNC displays, PC gamers had to choose between unsightly tearing on their display, or turning on V-SYNC, which increased system latency and made gaming feel sluggish. G-SYNC solved the problem, delivered higher quality displays, and revolutionized the display industry in the process, leading to a golden age of innovation and technological advancement that shows no signs of slowing.\nWith the introduction of NVIDIA Advanced Optimus and its ability to bypass the integrated graphics, laptops can now ship with G-SYNC variable refresh rate displays, eliminating tearing and keeping system latency low.\nBest of all, NVIDIA\u2019s constant innovation following the invention of G-SYNC has directly led to today\u2019s super high quality 4K 120Hz G-SYNC laptop displays, with phenomenal color accuracy, giving users desktop-quality displays on mobile devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m In! Which Laptops Support Advanced Optimus?\nAt time of writing, there are over 50 GeForce RTX 30 Series laptop designs with NVIDIA Advanced Optimus available from our partners at Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer. Some standouts include: Lenovo Legion 5 Pro and Legion 7, Alienware x14, x15, and x17, Razer Blade 15 and Blade 17, and Acer Triton 500 SE.\u00a0 Laptops configurations can vary, please check with your local laptop manufacturer about specific support for Advanced Optimus.\u00a0 \u00a0\nTo learn more about the other innovations available on GeForce RTX laptops, head here, and to learn about new laptop technologies and new games making use of these features, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Making technology comprehensible and relevant.for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorFeb 09, 2022, 06:51pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.(FILES) This file picture taken on July 28, 2016 shows SoftBank Group Representative Masayoshi Son ... [+] speaking at a press conference to announce the company's financial results in Tokyo. - Japan's SoftBank Group said on September 14 it is selling British chip designer Arm to US chip company NVIDIA for up to 40 billion USD, potentially creating a new giant in the industry. (Photo by Kazuhiro NOGI / AFP) / XGTY (Photo by KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images\nWhen Nvidia announced its $40 billion bid to buy the Intellectual Property (IP) vendor Arm from SoftBank in September of 2020, it was an audacious offer and it seemed almost immediately that the odds were stacked against the deal. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is not someone who easily backs down from a challenge. He persevered for 18 months trying to complete this deal, but this week he finally called it quits. Softbank will instead pursue an initial public offering (IPO) for Arm, returning the company to the public market after purchasing the company back in 2016.\n\n\nWhen it was announced that Nvidia and Softbank had made a deal, there was an almost immediate outcry from some Arm customers and end users against it. Many feared that Nvidia would gain unfair access to Arm\u2019s technology to the detriment of other companies. Regulators were concerned that this deal would put too much power into Nvidia\u2019s hands. Arm is an important IP vendor for the entire electronics ecosystem, accounting for more processors than all other processing architectures combined. Nvidia\u2019s stated goal in acquiring Arm was to boost Arm\u2019s R&D development and to strengthen its ecosystem by adding in Nvidia's own graphics and AI IP to Arm\u2019s portfolio. Nvidia had been an Arm licensee and an early supporter of Arm64 (officially known as Armv8). Nvidia is currently developing data center chips using Arm and wanted to Arm be able to compete head-to-head with Intel and AMD x86 processors.\nForbesNvidia To Buy Arm - What's Next?By Kevin Krewell\n\nArm\u2019s fate is of critical importance to most of the semiconductor industry. As I wrote in my original story in 2020: \u201cThe Arm architecture is absolutely essential for every major category of communications and networking equipment from smartphones, to most smartwatches, many networking systems, set-top boxes, and most IoT devices.\u201d And therein was the problem for Nvidia \u2013 it was not considered a viable independent custodian for Arm, as many considered Softbank to be. Nvidia is an Arm customer and it competes with other Arm customers. This potential conflict raised red flags for other Arm customers and government regulators. Nvidia outright said over and over that it would not gain an unfair advantage and would treat all Arm customers fairly. Ultimately, the forces opposed to the deal won out.\nForbesNvidia And Arm Are Aligned On The Future Of Arm, But Is Everyone Else?By Kevin Krewell\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nWhat does this now mean for Nvidia? \n\nFor Nvidia the death of the deal does not change the trajectory of the company much. Nvidia will continue to license the Arm architecture and will develop chips based on Arm IP for various processing applications including data center and embedded designs. Nvidia will use its own internal development team to build custom Arm cores as well as license standard Arm cores. The company's product lines will not suffer, but Nvidia will not be able to influence the future trajectory of Arm directly. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang may feel this is a blow to his bigger aspirations, but that will not impact the company's future success.\n\nThe loss here may be the grander vision Jensen held for the acquisition, rather than economic. But it will likely not slow Nvidia\u2019s growth and now the company might look to other acquisitions. It seems very happy with results of the Mellanox acquisition.\n\n\nOn the positive side, this opens up opportunities for Nvidia to expand through other acquisitions that may be more in line with the company\u2019s strategic goals, less likely to raise the ire of regulators, and potentially at a better value than what Nvidia was offering for Arm.\nWhat does this now mean for Arm? \nThings will be trickier for Arm. With the Nvidia deal now scuttled, SoftBank will take Arm public through an IPO hoping to make some profit. Softbank acquired Arm back in 2016 for $32B, which was a huge deal. To make a profit, Softbank will have to raise somewhere around the $40B that Nvidia was planning to pay, which would make it the largest semiconductor industry IPO in history. Whether the IPO can be priced to reach that goal is going to be a big question mark, especially if there\u2019s a market correction in 2023. The deal with Nvidia was much more predictable for both Softbank and Arm.\nSoftbank invested heavily in Arm to build out design teams and broaden its selection of IP cores. In addition, SoftBank funded Arm\u2019s entrance into new market segments and services. With an IPO looming for 2023, the management team will have to look at the balance sheet more closely to show that there is a significant growth opportunity with Arm and the positive earnings and profit growth to obtain a high multiple on the stock price. While the company is valuable, as an IP licensing company doesn\u2019t generate the higher revenues of chip companies. Perhaps that is one area where Arm might consider changes to its business model in the future \u2013 perhaps selling Arm-based chiplets as the market for standardized chiplets develops.\nIn addition to the Nvidia deal going bust, Arm now has a new CEO \u2013 Arm executive Rene Haas was promoted to CEO and longtime CEO Simon Segars has stepped down, effective immediately.Rene Haas, president of the ARM, one of the main chip designer in the world from the UK, speaks ... [+] during a press conference in Taipei on May 27, 2019.

The latest news that Intel is building a $1 billion fund to help startups that will use Intel foundry business in the future. Part of that announcement was that Intel joined the RISC-V International foundation and made investments in numerous RISC-V companies. This helps level up RISC-V as competition to Arm, even though Arm is also a partner with Intel for the foundry business.\nThis may be the most challenging time for Arm in its recent history. But, at the same time, Arm is at its most successful. The company is still doing extremely well, gaining more and more share in designs for cloud hyperscaler designs, as well as seeing the success of Apple\u2019s own Arm-based M1 silicon in MacBooks. Both Mediatek and Qualcomm recently introduced new mobile processors that use the latest ArmV9 architecture. In general, it looks as though Arm is doing very well now, but the challenge is continuing this momentum after the Nvidia deal collapse.\nOver the next year we can expect to see many changes at Arm as Mr. Haas prepares the company for the IPO by March of 2023 (the deadline set by Softbank). Arm\u2019s balance sheet has been improving over the past two years as Softbank stripped out some of the ISG services business from Arm. Most importantly, Arm will need to show growth, and it may be hard to show significant growth in new architecture licensees, as Arm has largely saturated the market. The potential revenue growth will have to come from licenses and royalties from new cores, which puts the pressure on Arm to feep developing new IP that the market will buy. There\u2019s been a shortage of Arm startups as many of the startup community have been embracing RISC-V. The last big Arm-based startup was Nuvia, which was bought by Qualcomm. This means Arm needs to find new customers like it did with hyperscalers.\nComments from new CEO Rene Haas \nIn a conference call meeting with reports just hours after the news broke, incoming Arm CEO Rene Haas addressed some of those issues. He said he plans to continue to focus on new growth markets, including automotive, data center, and cloud/hyperscalers. The years under Softbank allowed Arm to pull some investments in these areas, which helped accelerate growth. Haas pointed out that the Graviton cloud server design at AWS has inspired other hyperscalers to follow. In addition to the aforementioned growth markets, Haas also hinted at new opportunities for Arm, including the metaverse and the continued growth of intelligent edge devices. Arm-based devices already dominate the AR and VR headsets, and that market is expected to continue to grow.\nHaas believes that Arm\u2019s broad ecosystem with over 15 million developers, standardized architecture, and billions of devices shipped per year will not slow down anytime soon. As such, the new Arm will be much like the classic Arm that Softbank bought back in 2016, but with much greater market diversity and a stronger portfolio. Arm will continue to emphasize efficiency, but now offers better performance and better security. Arm is now putting additional emphasis beyond just the CPU core, with more cross-functional implementations across the entire SoC design. One thing that should keep the UK government happy is that Haas plans to keep Arm headquarters in Cambridge post-IPO, even though he resides in California.\nThere\u2019s a lot of work ahead for the Arm team for the next year, but now there\u2019s a new start and a definitive goal line ahead. Arm is now unchained.\nTirias Research tracks and consults for companies throughout the electronics ecosystem from semiconductors to systems and sensors to the cloud.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $7.43 billion, indicating a 48.5% jump from the year-ago reported figure.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.22 per share, suggesting a significant year-over-year improvement of 56.4%. The company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters, the average surprise being 7.7%. Let\u2019s see how things have shaped up before the announcement. NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Factors to Note Ahead of Q4 Results The continued strength in its data-center business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the pandemic-induced work-from-home wave is expected to have boosted NVIDIA\u2019s fourth-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and the growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds during the to-be-reported quarter. NVIDIA\u2019s growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing and AI are likely to have been driving factors during the period in discussion. A series of blockbuster AAA titles, which pledged support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing technology, might have been a positive as well.  Furthermore, the company\u2019s Automotive and Professional Visualization divisions had shown an improvement in trends over the last three quarters. The automotive segment\u2019s revenues increased 8% year over year in the third quarter, primarily aided by the continued recovery in global automotive production volumes and the ramp-up of self-driving programs. Professional Visualization\u2019s revenues jumped a whopping 144% year over year in the third quarter. This growth mainly resulted from increased sales of notebook workstation graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d) and the ramp-up of Ampere architecture GPUs. Automotive and Professional Visualization trends are expected to have continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. However, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented by governments worldwide to contain the spread of COVID-19 might have partially offset the benefits of solid demand for the remote-working and online-learning hardware infrastructure.

Arm, which licenses designs to Google, Apple, and others, now faces increased competition.Photograph: Phil Ashley/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database \u2192CompanyARMNvidiaEnd UserBig companySectorSemiconductorsTechnologyChipsThe collapse of the biggest chip deal in history will complicate the future for its intended target.The mega-deal would have seen Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest chip company by market capitalization, acquire Arm, a UK company that licenses chip designs that are increasingly vital across the tech industry.The deal\u2019s collapse is a blow to Nvidia, which had hoped to expand its empire beyond chips specialized for graphics and artificial intelligence, and to SoftBank, which acquired Arm in 2016. The cash-and-stock deal was initially valued at $40 billion in September 2020, but the increased value of Nvidia shares since then would have lifted it beyond $60 billion.But the biggest loser may be Arm itself.On the face of it, Arm still seems to occupy an enviable position. The company\u2019s flexible, power-efficient, general purpose designs are used in most smartphones, as well as in cloud computing systems operated by Google and Amazon, laptops from Apple, and even Tesla\u2019s cars.And yet the disintegration of the Nvidia deal leaves the chipmaker with a more challenging road ahead, according to some industry watchers. Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of Tech Insights, a semiconductor analyst firm, says many people believe Arm has \u201cgone soft\u201d since SoftBank bought it. Additionally, the specter of an Nvidia-Arm combination may have spurred investment in an alternative chip architecture.\u201cNvidia was going to invest a bunch of additional resources, something that Arm will now have to do on their own.\u201dStacy Rasgon, senior semiconductor analyst, Bernstein ResearchHutcheson says Nvidia most likely saw an opportunity to reinvigorate Arm and expand its business. But Arm will now need to prove that it has an innovative product road map.Although many companies use Arm\u2019s designs, Hutcheson notes that they often customize those designs to wring more power and efficiency from the chips. This suggests that perhaps Arm could be doing more in terms of performance.The termination of the deal was hardly a shock after months of speculation that it might fall apart. It had faced intense regulatory scrutiny because it would have put Nvidia in control of designs that are vital to competitors. Last November, UK regulators launched an investigation into the deal, and in December the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit to block it.When announcing the decision to abandon the sale on Tuesday morning, Nvidia and SoftBank cited \u201csignificant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction.\u201dSoftBank has since indicated that it may now seek to take Arm public through an IPO.The uncertainty stoked by the potential deal may also have stirred up more competition for Arm. Hutcheson and others say that the deal seems to have increased interest in an open-source alternative chip architecture called RISC-V, which could increase the pressure on Arm to invest and innovate. A chip architecture refers to the design for the silicon components that handle logical operations and data on a chip, together with the basic software instructions for that hardware. ARM uses a proprietary architecture developed over several decades.Keep ReadingSearch our artificial intelligence database and discover stories by sector, tech, company, and more.RISC-V was created in 2010 and has the financial backing of some big tech companies, including Google and Intel. Arm\u2019s chip designs became popular because of their efficiency, but RISC-V\u2019s designs are similarly efficient. What\u2019s more, the open source nature of the architecture means that companies using RISC-V could collaborate on new innovations and work together to solve problems.\u201cI think RISC-V traction has likely accelerated during the Arm negotiations,\u201d says Stacy Rasgon, a senior semiconductor analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cNvidia was going to invest a bunch of additional resources into it to drive it, something that Arm will now have to do on their own.\u201dIn another sign of RISC-V\u2019s momentum, this week Intel announced a $1 billion fund to support its new foundry business, which will involve collaborating with several companies working on RISC-V chips. Job ads posted last September suggest that Apple is exploring RISC-V too.Chinese companies in particular may be drawn to the open source architecture because of concerns about relying on designs that emanate from countries considered geopolitical rivals, such as Japan, the UK, and the US. In October, the ecommerce giant Alibaba announced that it has developed a RISC-V chip for data centers. Huawei and ZTE, two Chinese companies that have lost access to chips affected by US embargoes, are key members of the RISC-V Alliance.Despite the complications, SoftBank is already talking up the potential of an Arm IPO. On Tuesday, CEO Masayoshi Son described it as potentially \u201cthe largest IPO in semiconductor history.\u201dArm says it will be fine going it alone. \u201cThe increasing momentum for Arm\u2019s business has the company well positioned to independently accelerate its growth,\u201d says Phil Hughes, a spokesman for Arm.More Great WIRED Stories\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!The metaverse-crashing life of Kai LennyMaybe green energy needs \u201cinformation batteries\u201dHow to switch from Spotify to Apple MusicFinally, a good use for NFTs: preserving street artNow physical jobs are going remote too\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Explore AI like never before with our new database\ud83c\udfa7 Things not sounding right?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's partners have started sales of the company's entry-level T1000 8GB professional graphics card that combines tiny dimensions with robust display connectivity and low power consumption. The board is designed primarily for light CAD/CAM applications that do not need serious graphics oomph. For performance in games, it promises to offer framerates comparable to that of Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650.\u00a0Nvidia quietly introduced its T1000 entry-level professional graphics card \u2014 based on the previous-generation TU117 GPU (896 CUDA cores, 2.5 FP32 TFLOPS) equipped with 4GB or 8GB of GDDR6 memory with a 128-bit interface \u2014 last May. The card consumes just about 50 W of power (and does not require any additional power connectors), uses a low-profile form-factor and comes with a single-slot cooling system. The board can be installed into any system and drive up to four 4K60 displays or two 8K60 monitors (which use two DP 1.4a connectors per LCD), which makes it one of the world's smallest graphics cards with a multi-4K-monitor capability.\u00a0\u00a0The Nvidia T1000 uses TU117 graphics processor with similar compute performance as Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650, yet since it is equipped with 4/8GB of GDDR6 memory with a 128-bit interface, it could probably be a tad faster in cases where DRAM bandwidth matters.\u00a0\u00a0(Image credit: Elsa)By today's standards, performance of an entry-level offering from 2019 is hardly impressive, but the T1000 was not designed to run games, but rather offer decent performance in CAD/CAM and multi-display (e.g., video walls) applications. Furthermore, its tiny dimensions, four 4K display outputs, and a 50W power consumption are its unique advantages. Even Matrox Graphics does not have a low-profile graphics card with four 4K outputs. Meanwhile, to connect displays with HDMI inputs, Nvidia's T1000 SKUs come with four mDP-to-HDMI converters that are guaranteed to work and are even equipped with a latch that prevents accidental disconnection.\u00a0While the Nvidia T1000 4GB and 8GB professional graphics boards were quietly added to the company's lineup in May, 2021, it's possible we're not seeing until now due to chip short. In Japan, Elsa sells an Nvidia T1000 4GB card with two mDP-to-HDMI adapters for\u00a0\u00a551,700 ($405 without tax), whereas a model with four mDP-to-HDMI converters for\u00a0\u00a555,000 ($431 without tax), reports\u00a0Hermitage Akihabara. By contrast, Elsa's Nvidia T1000 8GB costs \u00a563,470 ($497 without tax), reports\u00a0Akiba PC Hotline.\u00a0In the U.S., PNY charges\u00a0$398\u00a0for its Nvidia T1000 4GB board, but the company won't ship the card until March.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\n4K\nCUDA\nHDMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

In the interview, I asked Kerris questions that are on every investor\u2019s mind, including pointed questions about where real revenue growth will come from, how large is the addressable market exactly, plus what CEO Jensen Huang meant when said that the \u201cOmniverse or the Metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy.\u201d\n\n\nThe Metaverse is particularly challenging for investors as the opportunity is enormous yet getting the timing right and also choosing which companies will participate in the futuristic yet burgeoning virtual economy will not be easy.\n\nHere are the main points we discuss in the video:\n\n\n\n\nWhy the Metaverse Can Exceed Our Current Economy\nHow Universal Scene Description provides the portal to the Metaverse\nThe Importance of Ray-Tracing and the RTX Platform\nIndustrial Virtual Worlds\n\n\n\nWatch the Nvidia Omniverse interview with Beth Kindig and Richard Kerris:\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nCandid Interview with Nvidia: Can the Metaverse Drive Real Revenue Growth\nLast year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cOmniverse or the Metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy.\u201d Many investors look for large addressable markets, so to hear a CEO state that a technology could surpass the size of our current economy is a statement to pay close attention to. In the interview, I asked Kerris what Huang meant, and Kerris\u2019 answer was quite simple: the Metaverse will exceed our current economy because it will be many times larger than the internet.\n\nHere is a direct quote:\n\u201c[The Metaverse]\n is going to be many times bigger than the web because of what a virtual world can do for business, for education, for medical, for all sorts of things including entertainment; we\u2019ve just begun to scratch the surface of these possibilities [\u2026] You\u2019ve probably heard the term digital twin. One example is what it\u2019s going to do to revolutionize the industrial market, design and manufacturing. Well, a digital twin is a true-to-reality twin in synthetic worlds of what happens in the physical world. We are seeing this transform these things because when you can make decisions in that synthetic world before you commit to it in the physical world, you have a lot of cost savings.\u201d \u2013Richard Kerris\n\nAccording to Kerris, in simple terms, the Metaverse is virtual worlds. Rather than being a Ready Player One type experience where you are strapped down with heavy equipment, the Metaverse will instead offer more 3D experiences or environments that replace our current digital experiences.\n\n\nThe Real Value of 3D Virtual Worlds\nIndustrial 3D environments are especially ramping up as 3D virtual worlds result in cost savings, are safer for employees and allow for more iteration on designs. For example, BMW manufactures 2.5 million cars per year, and the company has made a digital twin of its factory to reduce any downtime when the company has to change its process for a new model. In the physical world, a new model affected production whereas now the company can change its process in a synthetic world to eliminate errors and downtime. The new approach helps BWM view their entire factory in simulation mode with photorealistic detail. Another advantage is that data is available immediately and any changes can be made in the planning stage itself, which saves time and money.\nAnother example as to the value of virtual worlds is route planning. Factories can perform route planning in a virtual warehouse in Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse that allows orders to be optimized for automated order picking scenarios. Essentially, warehouses are able to reoptimize factory floor operations as new orders come in or as robots go offline. This optimization training can also save quite a bit of money.\nUniversal Scene Description (USD) Provides the Portal to the Metaverse\nThe portal to the Metaverse is Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description. USD is hailed as one of the most important tools for building the Metaverse as it allows for a persistent experience to where the Metaverse is more connective and has consistency. Metaverse experts tend to reference the internet as a baseline for how the Metaverse will become widely adopted. In this Web 3.0 reference, Pixar\u2019s USD functions like the connective HTML of 3D worlds.\n\u201cIn the early days [of the web], once we started connecting things, we didn\u2019t realize just how big it could be \u2026 one of the things that happened at that time was HTML. HTML allowed for a consistent plumbing or consistent connective tissue between the websites so you didn\u2019t have to have a specific browser or a specific extension installed. Now, we go from one website to another and the videos play the same, the text is great, the images, etcetera. Much of the same kind of thing is going to happen with these virtual worlds because once you can teleport from one virtual world to another virtual world, and the experience of the worlds is about the content instead of the lighting and the materials, we will see a tremendous opportunity take place.\u201d -Richard Kerris, on Universal Scene Description (USD) \nWith persistent experience, the Metaverse can rival Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, as it allows for virtual worlds to break out of siloed experiences. The USD open-source framework allows for the exchange of 3D data and has become a universally supported plugin for developers and creators to use as a baseline.\nNvidia\u2019s Omniverse supports the USD plugin as a portal to access Nvidia\u2019s rendering and graphics products. Apple, Autodesk, and many other companies are also using the framework to create a persistent experience for developers and creators. For example, the iPhone\u2019s LiDAR scanner allows you to scan objects in USD. The scanned images are saved in a USDZ compressed file to be used across other platforms.\nHow Real-Time Ray Tracing Catalyzed Virtual Worlds\nNvidia was originally a hardware company that transitioned to also become a software company, which uniquely positioned the company to deliver ray-tracing to the Metaverse market. Ray-tracing allows for the simulation of light and physics to render graphics, resulting in a much more realistic and complex virtual world. After commercially releasing real-time ray tracing on a chip, Nvidia was then able to leverage RTX GPUs and ray tracing extensions for the renderer in their software simulation platform Omniverse.\n\u201cThere was the big boom moment that took place for all of these things to happen. The first part of that was RTX, which is real-time ray tracing on a chip. It was really a milestone that will be forever remembered. Ray-tracing allows for photorealistic rendering to happen in real time. That means that the worlds we are talking about look more and more indistinguishable from the real world [\u2026] It was such a moment at Nvidia when that happened. I remember the enthusiasm of the computer graphics community. For those of us who have been in [the industry] for awhile, we dreamed of this 30 years ago. We knew it was that impactful of a moment.\u201d -Richard Kerris\nRay-tracing renders 3D models through the physics of light. Through the physical simulation of light, subsurface scattering and light diffusion helps computer vision see things similar to how a human retina works.\nCompanies like Pixar have been able to do 3D rendering and computer-generated imaging for some time in films, television and gaming, however, Nvidia improves this process by adding the real-time capabilities to ray tracing through the RTX platform. Formally, it could take weeks to render animation that is only a few seconds long whereas the RTX platform reduces this time by offering more real-life retina vision. The RTX platform also offers better path tracing and denoising, which was first used for gaming, and now lends itself well to the virtual worlds of the metaverse.\nMore on the RTX Platform\nThe RTX platform provides APIs and SDKs running on Turing GPU architecture for applications to be built with ray tracing and AI-enhanced graphics. More than 200 games and applications use RTX including Minecraft, Fortnite and Cyberpunk. According to Nvidia\u2019s previous earnings call, an estimated 25% of the installed base had adopted RTX GPUs. This is due to an overhaul on GPU gaming architecture as Nvidia has combined Turing RTX GPUs with Ampere RTX GPUs. This allows for AI rendering called Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) to be combined with ray tracing. The success in gaming will only help the proficiency of real-time ray tracing and AI enabled super resolution capabilities for the Metaverse and 3D virtual worlds.\nIndustrial Virtual Worlds\nAutonomous driving is one of the more compelling use cases for the Metaverse given the number of times autonomous vehicle systems were deployed on the roads and yet were pulled from the market due to accidents. Meanwhile, attempting to train models in the physical world (or analog world as Kerris puts it) can take a very long time.\n\u201cIf we go back to the concept of a digital twin, a digital twin doesn\u2019t have to be a factory, it can be a city. We have companies like Ericson who have built digital twins of cities for antenna propagation for the 5G network [\u2026] we\u2019ve been using digital twins in that environment to have a synthetic world that these cars can be trained on that is indistinguishable from the real world, it\u2019s exactly the way things are laid out, but you can have many cars being trained in that world at the same time. What\u2019s most important is you can throw all kinds of predicaments at it so that it learns [..] that those cars in the analog world may never have encountered [..] there\u2019s a much higher degree of confidence in how a [synthetically trained vehicle] will respond.\u201d\nThe Isaac Sim toolkit is a robotics simulation and synthetic data generation tool that helps increase accuracy for robots. It supports a SDK and robotics operating system frameworks package to develop robotics AI and navigation applications. This helps to improve AI-based computer vision by improving the data sets, which in turn are used to train robots for increased understanding of their surroundings.\u00a0The end result is fewer accidents and less human intervention.\nConclusion\nIt\u2019s understandable if investors are skeptical of the Metaverse as the technology is essentially in the early adopter stage. My conversation with Nvidia helps to break down these walls around the virtual economy and how big it can get, which is partly because the internet as we know it is ready for disruption if we are to enable a new depth of digital connection.\nAdditionally, industries are able to reduce errors and increase productivity by using synthetic virtual worlds for training models and robots. Digital twins for factories, cities and other virtual assets can be used to get a product right the first time it is deployed.\nNvidia is a company that is not standing still. Last August, I had predicted Nvidia would surpass Apple to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. The Omniverse is one of many reasons I believe this prediction is still on track to come true.\u00a0\nBeth Kindig and I/O Fund currently own shares of NVDA. This is not financial advice.

In Q4 2021, revenues were at $7.5 billion, a 52% YoY increase. Gaming, data center and professional visualization segments contributed to the overall growth in revenues. In terms of products, high-end desktop/laptop gaming processors, data center GPUs and AI rendering workload-specific hybrid workstations contributed to revenue growth. Networking revenues suffered most from the shortages and disruptions in the supply chain, followed by GPUs. Annual revenues are CY estimates; Source: Company Earnings, Counterpoint estimatesSegment RevenuesGaming gets biggest slice of revenues with 46.7% share at $12.2 bnGaming revenue grew 63.7% YoY to $12.2 billion in 2021The revenue came primarily from its RTX 30 series of GPUs. Steam grew 50% over 2 years and had nearly 28 million active users by the end of Q4 2021, the second largest for a cloud gaming platform.RTX GPUs help NVIDIA realize $2 bn in professional visualization segment Professional visualization revenue almost doubled to $2 billion in 2021, realizing the best year for the segment.Growth due to the COVID-19 driven consumer and enterprise shift to remote workstations that can take higher workloads of AI, 3D renderings and visualizations.Supercomputer compute helps data center to shine in best revenue year everData Center segment reported a growth of 59.1% to $10.2 billion in 2021 to make it a record year for NVIDIA.Offerings across GPU, networking and software, along with synchronization of technologies stemming from the Mellanox acquisition, have made NVIDIA the leader in accelerated computing. The whole suite of offerings and mass adoption of AI technologies in enterprise applications fueled the demand for accelerators. Supercomputing contributed to <1% of overall Data Center revenues.Additionally, demand from hyperscalars and cloud focusing on inference workloads and AI workloads contributed to the sales of NVIDIA A100 GPUs, a high-end accelerator. Specifically, Meta has purchased over 6,000 GPUs for SuperCluster, its AI supercomputer for natural language processing and visualization workloads.Slower lap for automotive revenues with growth of 5.6%This segment proved to be the outlier in NVIDIA's growth story, posting only 5.6% growth at $573 million and a decline of 18.2% from its best year in 2019.We believe the decline is due to shift from legacy cockpit processors and an increased focus on software suites that will contribute to revenues over a period of time.\u2018OEM and Others\u2019 segment sees 5.7% revenue growth on volatilityOEM and others reported $574 million in revenue, up only 5.7% from previous yearCrypto mining contributed about $24 million in the \u2018OEM and Others\u2019 segment for Q4 2021. The annual revenues from CMPs (cryptomining processors) were estimated to be about $550 million in 2021.The visibility of crypto revenues is due to the changes in GPU software launched in Q1 2021 to detect Ethereum Mining Algorithm to ensure the intended supply of GPUs to gamers and dedicated CMPs.The segment continues to be among the company\u2019s key volatile segments as the revenues fell 77% sequentially from the previous quarter. The factors contributing to this volatility include limited stocks of the GPU processors, geopolitical tensions at the Russia-Ukraine border (Ukraine is one of the leading crypto miners in the world) and the increasing climate impact.Strategic SHIFT Observation: Becoming Software HEROAccording to NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, \u201cNVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business\u201d.As the company comes close to executing its triple chip strategy \u2013 CPU, GPU & DPU, with the data center CPU coming next year and sampling late this year, it is extensively focusing on building next-generation software suites that support Metaverse, 3D and robotics.FOCUS: The company is focusing on creating an end-to-end complete stack of firmware that complements and augments the functionalities of hardware that serves as a one-stop solution to implement upcoming technologies and the required compute demanded by them.With the introduction of three prominent software suites, the company intends to have a comprehensive software portfolio covering all hardware products:NVIDIA DRIVE for automotiveNVIDIA AI for data centers and enterprisesNVIDIA Omniverse for individuals and enterprises for creation of virtual contentAt last year\u2019s Nvidia GPU Technology Conference, the company announced that the software suites, particularly the Omniverse, would be made available for free to all creators. The company is betting on the business that would materialize from the connection between a real-world entity like robots or connected cars and the virtual world through digital twins. The software would act as a bridge and the company would reap benefits as the bridge becomes busy and populated!Analyst Takeaways and Future OutlookGaming: As announced at CES 2022, the introduction of the RTX 30 GPU series to laptops will bring the AAA gaming experience and accelerated computing to wider audiences, adding to revenues. Penetration of GeForce NOW in 5G mobile devices, smart TVs and newer titles will continue to augment revenues through software subscription.Data Centers: As the hyperscalars enter the rush of the metaverse and enterprises focus on weaving the AI technologies across all processes, the workloads will increasingly demand the accelerators to achieve objectives. In the short term, the company would be looking to fill the demand gap due to semiconductor shortages in the networking product portfolio.Cryptomining: In the short term, as economies around the world reel under inflation, rising fuel prices and geopolitical tensions in the East, we expect a limited demand coming from miners this year. However, as the metaverse gains momentum, crypto regulations become more clear and enterprises get familiar with the possibilities of the virtual world, the demand will again start shooting up from later this year/early next year.Future Deals: Due to the termination of the ARM-NVIDIA deal, the company has now over $20 billion in cash and will look to augment its growing suite of software and hardware peripheries in networking to develop efficient solution stacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nCategory\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs \n\n\nPublished\nFeb 21, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack To List\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nAMD in 2021: A Year of Great Profits, Market Gains\n\nFeb 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nCES 2022: Chip Biggies See Loads of Action\n\nJan 27, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nFoundry Industry\u2019s Robust Revenue Growth to Continue in 2021\n\nJan 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Automotive Announcements at CES 2022\n\nJan 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm in Driver's Seat To Shape The Future of Mobility\n\nJan 6, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive NAD Module Market Sees Slow Growth in Q3 2021 Due to Tight Supply Chain\n\nJan 6, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nBroadcom Looks to Build on Wi-Fi 6/6E Momentum with End-to-End Wi-Fi 7 Solutions\n\nApr 28, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Server Revenues to Grow 17% YoY in 2022\n\nJun 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center Segment Becomes its Biggest Revenue Contributor for Q1 2022\n\nJun 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\nAI\nAutomotive\nConsumer Electronics\nDisplay\neSIM\nIoT & cIoT\nLocation Platform\nMacro\nManufacturing\nNetworks & Infrastructure\nSemiconductors\nSmartphones\nWearables\n\n\n\nInsights\n\nResearch Notes & Blogs\nCP Conferences\nCP Conversations\nPodcasts\nEvents & Webinars\nWhite Papers\nReviews\nData\nIn the Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nUSA\nAFGHANISTAN\nALBANIA\nALGERIA\nAMERICAN SAMOA\nANDORRA\nANGOLA\nANGUILLA\nANTARCTICA\nANTIGUA AND BARBUDA\nARGENTINA\nARMENIA\nARUBA\nAUSTRALIA\nAUSTRIA\nAZERBAIJAN\nBAHAMAS\nBAHRAIN\nBANGLADESH\nBARBADOS\nBELARUS\nBELGIUM\nBELIZE\nBENIN\nBERMUDA\nBHUTAN\nBOLIVIA\nBOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\nBOTSWANA\nBOUVET ISLAND\nBRAZIL\nBRITISH INDIAN OCEAN TERRITORY\nBRUNEI\nBULGARIA\nBURKINA FASO\nBURUNDI\nCAMBODIA\nCAMEROON\nCANADA\nCAPE VERDE\nCAYMAN ISLANDS\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC\nCHAD\nCHILE\nCHINA\nCHRISTMAS ISLAND\nCOCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS\nCOLOMBIA\nCOMOROS\nCONGO\nCONGO, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE\nCOOK ISLANDS\nCOSTA RICA\nCOTE D'IVOIRE\nCROATIA\nCUBA\nCYPRUS\nCZECH REPUBLIC\nDENMARK\nDJIBOUTI\nDOM.

We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event and don\u2019t have any additional information to share at this time.\u201dThere\u2019s no evidence that the incident is connected to Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.Lapsus$ claimsBloomberg reported on Friday that the incident appeared to involve a \u201crelatively minor\u201d ransomware attack, according to sources.Then on Saturday morning (February 26), dark web intel outfit DarkTracer tweeted screenshots that purportedly showed messages from Lapsus$ actors claiming they had leaked password hashes for NVIDIA employees.In the messages the attackers also revealed plans to release 1TB of stolen data soon, potentially in five batches, if Nvidia it didn\u2019t pay up.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE Flurry Finance heist nets crypto thieves $295kThe next day, on Sunday (February 28), \u2018infosec enthusiast\u2019 Soufiane Tahiri posted additional screenshots supposedly showing Lapsus$ announcing the first data dump, comprising \u201csource code and highly confidential/secret data\u201d.According to Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow, Lapsus$ claimed that Nvidia had \u201csuccessfully hacked back\u201d. Callow posted screenshots apparently showing the group explaining that the company had connected to the attackers\u2019 virtual machine and encrypted its data.However, security expert Marcus Hutchins responded: \u201cTo me this sounds a lot like LAPSUS$ installed Nvidia\u2019s corporate agent on their own machine then triggered a data loss prevention policy, which they mistook for ransomware because they\u2019re morons.\u201dLapsus$ only announced itself at the turn of the year with attacks on Portuguese media conglomerate Impresa and various other targets.RELATED Bridgestone Americas \u2018disconnects\u2019 manufacturing facilities following \u2018security incident\u2019\n\n\n\n\nCyber-attacks\n\nUS\n\nRansomware\n\nNorth America\n\nEnterprise\n\nData Leak\n\nData Breach\n\nCybercrime\n\nHacking News\n\nNetwork Security\n\nCompliance\n\nIndustry News\n\nOrganizations\n\nEmail Security\n\nMalware\n\nHardware\n\nGaming\n\nDark Web\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam Bannister\n\n\n\n@Ad_Nauseum74 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page requires JavaScript for an enhanced user experience.\n\n\nLatest Posts\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re going teetotal \u2013 It\u2019s goodbye to The Daily Swig\n\n02 March 2023\nWe\u2019re going teetotal \u2013 It\u2019s goodbye to The Daily Swig\nPortSwigger today announces that The Daily Swig is closing down\n\n\n\nBug Bounty Radar\n\nThe latest bug bounty programs for March 2023    \n28 February 2023\nBug Bounty Radar\nThe latest bug bounty programs for March 2023\n\n\n\nIndian gov flaws allowed creation of counterfeit driving licenses\n\n28 February 2023\nIndian gov flaws allowed creation of counterfeit driving licenses\nArmed with personal data fragments, a researcher could also access 185 million citizens\u2019 PII\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurp Suite\nWeb vulnerability scanner\nBurp Suite Editions\nRelease Notes\n\n\nVulnerabilities\nCross-site scripting (XSS)\nSQL injection\nCross-site request forgery\nXML external entity injection\nDirectory traversal\nServer-side request forgery\n\n\nCustomers\nOrganizations\nTesters\nDevelopers\n\n\nCompany\nAbout\nCareers\nContact\nLegal\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nInsights\nWeb Security Academy\nBlog\nResearch\n\n\n\n  Follow us\n\u00a9 2025 PortSwigger Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Part of the Xcelerator portfolio of software and services, Simcenter\u2122 STAR-CCM+\u2122 2022.1 software brings CUDA-enabled GPU acceleration to deliver faster turnaround times at lower hardware investment costs to CFD simulation within design and engineering organizations of every size.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSiemens and NVIDIA are opening the door to a whole new era of CFD simulation acceleration techniques with Simcenter STAR-CCM+. With GPU-enabled technology, users can achieve faster turnaround time of CFD simulations at significantly lower per-simulation cost,\u201d said Stamatina Petropoulou, Technical Product Management,\u00a0 Siemens Digital Industries Software. \u201cThis technology will enable engineers working on external aerodynamics, aerospace, building and infrastructure / civil engineering applications, etc. to massively improve their simulation throughput at equivalent hardware investments with an increased per-dollar performance of GPUs compared to CPUs.\u201dRunning a set of industrial-grade external vehicle aerodynamics simulations, the engineers at Siemens and NVIDIA were able to demonstrate how usage of GPUs could reduce required hardware compute investments by up to 40%* and the power consumption down to 10% of the CPU equivalent, while maintaining identical simulation turnaround times.\u00a0Comparison of GPU- and CPU-based equivalent simulations: GPU run time and number of CPU cores required to reach almost identical turn-around times for the same vehicle aerodynamics CFD on GPUs and CPUs. GPUs see legend. Compute-optimized CPU instance: dual-socket Intel Xeon Gold (40 cores per node).While CPU-based high-performance computing in conjunction with highly scalable CFD parallelization allows for massive speed-ups in absolute times to solution, it comes at the cost of high hardware or cloud computing investments. The technology at hand is a game changer and Siemens is at the leading edge with some of the most credible partners in the field.\"Siemens' Simcenter STAR-CCM+ is giving an incredible boost to CFD simulations by using NVIDIA GPU technology via the CUDA platform and accelerated libraries.\u201d Said Niveditha Krishnamoorthy, Developer Relations Manager, NVIDIA. \u201cLeveraging NVIDIA GPU architecture, Simcenter STAR-CCM+ users can now run more simulations, faster, and can gain critical insights for their design and operation workflows without compromising on accuracy.\u201d*\u00a0 To learn more about the GPU benchmarking, please visit our blog here:https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/gpu-acceleration-for-cfd-simulationSiemens Digital Industries Software is driving transformation to enable a digital enterprise where engineering, manufacturing and electronics design meet tomorrow.

He has been at Arm for more than 30 years.\nHe will be replaced by Arm's president of intellectual property Rene Haas.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            PTW rebrands as Side\n          \n\n\n\n            Warner Bros games revenue dropped 29% during Q4 2024\n          \n\n\n\n            Madbox opens new studio in Annecy, France\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Batchelor: James is Editor-in-Chief at GamesIndustry.biz, and has been a B2B journalist since 2006.

The company\u2019s current CEO, Simon Segars, is leaving his post, effective today, with Rene Haas, the president of Arm\u2019s IP group (and former Nvidia VP and general manager of its computing products business), taking his role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the deal is now off the table, Arm says it is exploring a public offering in lieu of the acquisition. The current plan is for the IPO to happen sometime within the next 12 months.\nThe Financial Times first reported that the deal had collapsed earlier today.\nAs Haas told me in an interview shortly before today\u2019s announcement, Segars\u2019 decision to leave the company was very much a personal choice. \u201cHe has decided that at this stage of his career, the time and energy required to take the company public and everything around that was not something he wanted to sign up to,\u201d Haas said. \u201cSo he\u2019s going to step down. I\u2019m going to take over for him.\u201d\n\u201cRene is the right leader to accelerate Arm\u2019s growth as the company looks to re-enter the public markets,\u201d said Masayoshi Son, founder and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. \u201cI would like to thank Simon for his leadership, contributions and dedication to Arm over the past 30 years.\u201d\nHaas noted that Arm\u2019s business today is stronger than ever.\n\n\u201cWe are very enthusiastic and excited about this next chapter for the company,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe company\u2019s been doing great. [\u2026] Revenue and profitability levels never seen by Arm before and certainly not seen before we joined SoftBank. But, probably more importantly, the diversification of the business relative to what it looked like pre-SoftBank, we\u2019re a much stronger company now in areas like the cloud and the data center, we\u2019re a much stronger company in markets like automotive and we have a huge opportunity for future markets such as IoT and metaverse.\u201d\nWhile Haas wouldn\u2019t comment any further on Nvidia\u2019s and SoftBank\u2019s decision, noting that the deal finally collapsed today, he admitted that the discussions about a leadership change had started earlier.\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed that the acquisition didn\u2019t go through, we are, at the same time, very excited about our prospects going forward and can\u2019t wait to get this next chapter started,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaas wouldn\u2019t say just yet what that will look like, but he noted that the company will continue its efforts to push into the CPU and GPU market, as well as continue its efforts in the AI space.\n\u201cContinuing what we\u2019ve been doing and executing on that is going to be really important, because we\u2019ve demonstrated a recipe on how to grow the business and we definitely want to continue that,\u201d he said.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed this.\n\u201cArm has a bright future, and we\u2019ll continue to support them as a proud licensee for decades to come,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cArm is at the center of the important dynamics in computing. Though we won\u2019t be one company, we will partner closely with Arm. The significant investments that Masa has made have positioned Arm to expand the reach of the Arm CPU beyond client computing to supercomputing, cloud, AI and robotics. I expect Arm to be the most important CPU architecture of the next decade.\u201d\nIn some ways, today\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. After the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to block the merger, arguing that the combined company would be able to \u201cunfairly undermine Nvidia\u2019s rivals,\u201d Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was preparing to abandon its plans. In the U.K., where Arm is headquartered, the merger hit similar roadblocks in recent months, as well as with EU antitrust regulators.\nIn the end, an Nvidia that dominated the GPU and AI accelerator market and also owned the IP to the chips that power virtually every smartphone and IoT device rang all kinds of alarm bells. The two companies would\u2019ve likely had to make considerable changes to their deal to get it through the regulatory process.\nNvidia first announced its plans for this mega-merger in September 2020. At the time, Nvidia CEO Huang argued that this would allow his company to create \u201ca company fabulously positioned for the age of AI.\u201d\nThroughout all of this, Nvidia\u2019s and Arm\u2019s leadership publicly remained optimistic that the deal would eventually pass muster with the regulatory authorities. Knowing that there would be some pushback, the two companies had always given themselves a lot of time to close this deal, with an expected closing date of March 2022, 18 months after the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent months, both companies admitted that they would miss this date. They were also up against a bit of a deadline of September 2022, after which SoftBank would keep its $1.25 billion breakup fee, though now that the deal is off, SoftBank will keep it anyway.\nIf the $40B Nvidia-Arm deal is dead, what does it mean to big tech M&A?\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nARM, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Hardware, IP Group, nvidia, Simon Segars, Softbank, SoftBank Group, Startups, United Kingdom \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFrederic Lardinois\t\n\n\n\nEditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he joined TechCrunch in 2012, he founded SiliconFilter and wrote for ReadWriteWeb (now ReadWrite).

Omniverse provided the tools to create such a highly detailed environment.\n\u201cOmniverse is the only platform that\u2019s able to visualize such a vast amount of components in high fidelity and make the simulation physically accurate,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cMy work is a proof of concept \u2014 if Omniverse is fit to visualize Santa\u2019s factory, it\u2019s fit to visualize the daily material provisioning load for a real-world automotive factory, for example, which has a similar order of complexity.\u201d\nIpolog recently provided BMW with highly detailed elements like racks and boxes for a digital twin of the automaker\u2019s factory.\nWith the help of ipolog software and other tools, BMW is creating a digital twin-based factory of the future with NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables the automaker to simulate complex production scenarios taking place in more than 6 million square meters of factory space.\nDigital twin simulation speeds output and increases efficiency for BMW\u2019s entire production cycle \u2014 from the examination of engineering detail for vehicle parts to the optimization of workflow at the factory-plant level.\nWagner used Omniverse Kit, a toolkit for building Omniverse-native extensions and applications, to create the santa-facturing environment.\nThe developer is also exploring Omniverse Code \u2014 a recently launched app that serves as an integrated development environment for developers to easily build Omniverse extensions, apps or microservices.\n\u201cThe principle of building on the shoulders of giants is in the DNA of the Omniverse ecosystem and the kit-based environment,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cExisting open-source extensions, which any developer can contribute to, provide a good base from which to start off and quickly create a dedicated app or extension for digital twins.\u201d\nVisualizing the \u2018Santa-Factory\u2019\nUsing Omniverse, which includes PhysX \u2014 a software development kit that provides advanced physics simulation \u2014 Wagner transformed 2D illustrations of the santa-factory into a physically accurate 3D scene. The process was simple, he said. He \u201cpiled up a lot of elements and let PhysX work its magic.\u201d\nA 2D representation of Santa\u2019s workshop turned into a 3D rendering using Omniverse.\nTo create the glacial North Pole environment, Wagner used the Unreal Engine 4 Omniverse Connector. To bring the trusty elves to life, he brought in animations from Blender. And to convert the huge datasets to Universal Scene Description format, Wagner worked with Germany-based 3D software development company NetAllied Systems.\nA rendering of elves tending to reindeer near Santa\u2019s workshop, created with NVIDIA Omniverse.\nWhat better example of material supply and flow in manufacturing than millions of toy parts getting delivered to Santa\u2019s workshop? Watch Wagner\u2019s stunning demo of this, created in Omniverse:\n\nSuch use of digital twin simulations, Wagner said, allows manufacturers to visualize and plan their most efficient workflow, often reducing the time it takes to complete a manufacturing project by 30 percent.\nLooking forward, Wagner and his team at ipolog plan to create a full suite of apps, extensions and backend services to enable a manufacturing virtual world entirely based on Omniverse.\nLearn more about the santa-facturing project and how Wagner uses Omniverse Kit.\nAttend Wagner\u2019s session on digital twins for manufacturing at GTC, which will take place March 21-24.\nCreators and developers can download NVIDIA Omniverse for free and get started with step-by-step tutorials on the Omniverse YouTube channel.

Though we won\u2019t be one company, we will partner closely with Arm.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia terminated its $40 billion bid to acquire British chip designer Arm due to \u201csignificant regulatory challenges,\u201d the chipmaker confirmed early Tuesday morning.\nArm\u2019s current owner, Japan-based SoftBank Group, will take the chip designer public through an initial public offering, Nvidia and SoftBank said in a joint press release, confirming reports from several hours before that said the Nvidia-Arm deal had collapsed.\nNvidia and SoftBank said the decision was mutual, resulting from \u201csignificant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction, despite good faith efforts by the parties.\u201d\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\n[RELATED: The 10 Hottest Semiconductor Companies To Watch In 2022]\n\u201cArm has a bright future, and we\u2019ll continue to support them as a proud licensee for decades to come,\u201d said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. \u201cArm is at the center of the important dynamics in computing. Though we won\u2019t be one company, we will partner closely with Arm.\u201d\nSoftBank announced that it will start preperations for an IPO of Arm within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Arm was previously a public company prior to SoftBank acquiring it in 2016 for $32 billion.\nArm also announced it had appointed Rene Haas, head of the Arm IP Products Group, as the company\u2019s new CEO and board member in preparation for the IPO. Haas succeeds Simon Segars, who is stepping down from his CEO and board roles after 30 years with the company.\n\u201cArm is becoming a center of innovation not only in the mobile phone revolution, but also in cloud computing, automotive, the Internet of Things and the metaverse, and has entered its second growth phase,\u201d said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi So in a statement. \u201cWe will take this opportunity and start preparing to take Arm public, and to make even further progress.\u201d\nAs part of the agreement, SoftBank will retain a $1.25 billion break-up fee that was prepaid by Nvidia. Nvidia will also retain its 20-year Arm license, which the chipmaker has been using in part to design a data center CPU that will take on Intel and AMD in high-performance computing. The chipmaker uses Arm technology in other products, including the BlueField family of data processing units.\nThe termination of the deal comes two weeks after Bloomberg reported that Nvidia had told partners that it doesn\u2019t believe its $40 billion acquisition of Arm would close in the face of serious concerns from regulators in the United States, United Kingdom and European Union.\nOne solution provider contacted recently by CRN questioned the benefit Nvidia\u2019s pursuit of Arm would have brought to the channel.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why Nvidia needs to own Arm when Arm is open. From my position as a partner, I feel like they\u2019re still going to be able to bring the same solutions to me as if they owned Arm,\u201d Eliot Eshelman, vice president of strategic accounts and high-performance computing initiatives at Microway, a Plymouth, Mass.-based Nvidia partner, told CRN in December after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the acquisition over antitrust concerns.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to design whatever CPU, GPU, networking mix that they can dream up, and I\u2019m going to be able to ship it, and it doesn\u2019t matter who owns Arm,\u201d Eshelman said.\nSeveral analysts said the Nvidia-Arm deal was unlikely to go through after the FTC lawsuit, which added to apprehension from other regulators that the merger would harm competition.\nIn its December lawsuit, the FTC said Arm\u2019s role as the \u201cSwitzerland\u201d of the semiconductor industry is a prime reason why it believes Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of the British chip designer would harm competition in the data center market, among other markets.\nMany companies, including Apple and Amazon, license Arm\u2019s technology to build their own processors, and Nvidia\u2019s direct rivals, Intel and AMD among them, also rely on Arm for some products such as FPGAs and SmartNICs. AMD uses Arm for security chips in its EPYC server processors.\nIf Nvidia were to acquire Arm, the FTC alleged that it would create uneven access to Arm\u2019s technology between Nvidia and other companies. This would reduce competition and, in turn, reduce product quality, innovation and choice while also increasing prices for customers, the agency said.\nNvidia had repeatedly promised that it would invest in Arm\u2019s research and development, maintain Arm\u2019s open licensing model and \u201ccreate more opportunities for all Arm licensees and expand the Arm ecosystem.\u201d This, however, did not allay the concerns of the FTC and other regulators, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, which was also investigating the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With fewer face-to-face meetings, finding ways for architects to effectively communicate design ideas and exchange feedback with each other and their clients, especially in real time, can be difficult.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo improve remote collaboration, architects must tackle three key obstacles:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSimplifying the exchange of design data\u00a0\nHaving a single source of truth for 3D design projects\u00a0\nCreating high-quality visuals that communicate design intent\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise is built for real-time 3D design collaboration. The platform provides high-performance and physically accurate simulation for complex 3D scenes like skyscrapers or cityscapes, and the ability to connect leading 3D design applications to achieve seamless, collaborative workflows.\u00a0\u00a0\nOmniverse Enterprise enables architects around the world to easily collaborate, share photorealistic scenes across teams and devices, accelerate design workflows and reduce the number of review cycles \u2013 all while working from any location. \nBringing Design Data Together\u00a0\nProfessionals across disciplines use a wide range of advanced software tools and applications. To collaborate on designing buildings, users must share and exchange all their assets. But often, the data that\u2019s imported and exported between those disparate software tools ends up in lost time. This can result in errors due to data translation problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description, an open-source 3D scene description and file format, is a foundational element for Omniverse that enables interoperability when using the platform. USD eases the exchange of design data because teams can synchronize all their assets from different applications.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith Omniverse Enterprise, architects no longer need to worry about data preparation to import-export between tools because the platform provides one-click interoperability between leading architectural design software products such as Autodesk Revit, McNeel Rhino, Trimble SketchUp, and Epic Games Unreal Engine.\u00a0\n\nSharing a Virtual Space\nOmniverse Enterprise boosts efficiency for remote teams by providing a single view of shared 3D scenes while multiple software applications run live. This means that changes and iterations are made on a single-source-of-truth dataset, removing the need for redundant file copies.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith this capability in Omniverse Enterprise, users don\u2019t need to be in the same room to simultaneously collaborate on projects, and teams are not stuck in a linear design workflow.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhether working concurrently or in a live group session, teams can work on the same 3D model or scene \u2013 and see real-time updates on design changes. This streamlines the workflow further, enabling architects to complete projects faster, while working from the office, onsite or at home.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage courtesy of Horizon Productions.\nCreating High-Fidelity Visualization\u00a0\nBuilt on NVIDIA RTX technology, Omniverse Enterprise lets users view high-fidelity renders of architectural models in real time. Teams can instantly share ray-traced or path-traced renders to any device for their clients to view.\u00a0\nWith NVIDIA RTX and Omniverse Enterprise, professionals can save time and iterate more quickly on projects with photorealistic visualization of 3D models. Architectural design teams can meet tight deadlines for competitions and bid submission, speed up design reviews and iterations, and prepare more compelling client presentations.\u00a0\u00a0\nArchitects and designers can also easily tackle obstacles to remote collaboration. Leading architecture firms like CannonDesign, IBI Group, KPF and Woods Bagot use Omniverse Enterprise to bring design teams together virtually, and thousands of individual architecture, engineering and construction professionals are exploring the powerful capabilities of Omniverse.\u00a0\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise running on NVIDIA RTX, geographically dispersed project teams can maximize productivity, enhance communication and boost innovation while collaborating on the same 3D digital model from anywhere.\u00a0\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations.\u00a0\nRegister for free to discover how NVIDIA accelerates AECO design workflows at GTC, taking place March 21-24. \u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse Enterprise | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The system will also deliver AI features inside the vehicle, including driver and occupant monitoring and advanced visualization, leveraging the DRIVE IX software stack.\nThe iconic maker of modern luxury vehicles and the leader in AI computing will work together to build software-defined features for future Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles with continuously improving automated driving and intelligent features, from 2025.\n\nThe result will be some of the world\u2019s most desirable vehicles, preserving the design purity of the distinct Jaguar and Land Rover personalities while transforming the experiences for customers at every step of the journey.\nThese vehicles will be built on a unified computer architecture that delivers software-defined services for ongoing customer value and innovative new business models. The combination of centralized compute and intelligent features upgraded over the air also enhances supply chain management.\nThe next step in this reimagination of responsible, modern luxury is implementing safe and convenient AI-powered features.\n\u201cOur long-term strategic partnership with NVIDIA will unlock a world of potential for our future vehicles as the business continues its transformation into a truly global, digital powerhouse,\u201d said Thierry Bollor\u00e9, CEO of Jaguar Land Rover.\nEnd-to-End Intelligence\nFuture Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will be developed with NVIDIA AI from end to end.\nThis development begins in the data center. Engineers from both companies will work together to train, test and validate new automated driving features using NVIDIA data center solutions.\nThis includes data center hardware, software and workflows needed to develop and validate autonomous driving technology, from raw data collection through validation. NVIDIA DGX supercomputers provide the building blocks required for DNN development and training, while DRIVE Sim enables the necessary validation, replay and testing in simulation to enable a safe autonomous driving experience.\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse, engineers can collaborate virtually as well as exhaustively test and validate these DNNs with high-fidelity synthetic data generation.\nJaguar Land Rover will deploy this full-stack solution on NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion \u2014 the central nervous system of the vehicle \u2014 which features the DRIVE Orin centralized AI compute platform \u2014 the car\u2019s brain. DRIVE Hyperion includes the safety, security systems, networking and surrounding sensors used for autonomous driving, parking and intelligent cockpit applications.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Orin\nThe future vehicles will be continuously improved and supported throughout their lifetimes by some of the world\u2019s foremost software and AI engineers at NVIDIA and Jaguar Land Rover.\n\u200b\u200b\u201cNext-generation cars will transform automotive into one of the largest and most advanced technology industries,\u201d said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. \u201cFleets of software-defined, programmable cars will offer new functionalities and services for the life of the vehicles.\u201d\nA Responsible Future\nThis new intelligent architecture, in addition to the transition to zero emissions powertrains, ensures Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will not only transform the experience of customers, but also benefit the surrounding environment.\nIn addition to an all-electric future, the automaker is aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039, incorporating sustainability into its long-heralded heritage.\nBy developing vehicles that are intelligent and backed by the high-performance compute of NVIDIA, Jaguar Land Rover is investing in technology that is safe for all road users, as well as convenient and comfortable.\nThis attention to responsibility in the new era of modern luxury extends the unique, emotional attachment that Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles inspire for even more decades to come.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As Aiden, an especially-gifted outsider, you\u2019ll have to navigate across the streets and rooftops dodging and fighting bandits and special infected, helping Survivors and Peacekeepers, until circumstances force you to take a side, irrevocably changing the lives of everyone.\nLearn everything you need to know about PC edition\u2019s exclusive enhancements, and get your system ready for Dying Light 2 Stay Human by installing our new Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human PC Ray Tracing\nIf you\u2019ve got a GeForce RTX graphics card, desktop or laptop, or are playing on GeForce NOW, you can amp up your Dying Light 2 Stay Human experience with five DirectX 12 Ultimate ray-traced effects that further enhance the graphics of Techland\u2019s new title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Global Illumination\nElectricity is a scarce commodity, and as such is reserved for life saving UV lights that keep infection and the beasties at bay. That makes the sun and moon the primary light sources in Dying Light 2 Stay Human, and with ray tracing the quality of the illumination they offer can be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoors locations are more accurately illuminated, with colored lighting bouncing and naturally changing the appearance of the terrain and objects. And indoor areas are realistically illuminated and darkened by the presence and absence of light, respectively, to the extent that your flashlight becomes absolutely necessary, ramping up the tension, and the horror when you get jumped by a hidden special infected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith ray tracing, Dying Light 2 Stay Human\u2019s global illumination is greatly refined, giving GeForce RTX players a more natural, more realistic graphical presentation that immerses you in the action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Sun Shadows\nDying Light 2 Stay Human\u2019s sun and moonlight is used to cast dynamic shadows from all game elements. By enabling ray tracing, the quality of these shadows are improved, giving players realistic contact hardening and softening, and greater shadow detail. Shadow aliasing is eliminated, shadow draw distance is increased, and overall everything looks better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections\nEnabling ray-traced reflections enhances almost all of Dying Light 2 Stay Human\u2019s metallic and glass surfaces with improved reflectivity that dynamically affects their appearance based on the time of day and actions occurring in the world around them.\nWith much of the world in ruins, pixel-perfect mirror-like reflections aren\u2019t on the cards, though you can see geometry and Aiden\u2019s model reflected on surviving, albeit filthy windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainly, ray-traced reflectivity makes decayed metal surfaces far more realistic, with visuals that match their surroundings, further refining graphics for a more immersive experience. Natural lighting, a subtle sheen, a smidge of reflectivity; it all helps when crafting a realistic world for players to explore for 80 hours or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Ambient Occlusion\nAmbient occlusion is an important if often overlooked effect, adding natural shadowing between where light is occluded, between objects and where objects intersect with a surface, for instance. With ray tracing, the quality of the effect can be greatly improved, once again refining the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a massive city, ray-traced ambient occlusion is visible in every scene, enhancing visuals every second. Whether around a vehicle, on a bush, or on a character\u2019s clothing, this ray-traced effect makes a massive difference to the quality of the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Flashlight\nAlmost every videogame flashlight illuminates a small cone exclusively where the player looks. In reality, much of a room is illuminated to some degree, and intensely bright rays from the flashlight\u2019s main beam bounce whenever they strike a surface, adding extra illumination.\nUsing ray tracing, reality can now be recreated, adding a transformative effect to Dying Light 2 Stay Human that illuminates entire rooms, helping you spot lurking enemies and approaching foes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a fullscreen comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickly survey entire areas using your full field of view, and get the upper hand on the dastardly enemies of Dying Light 2 Stay Human.\nAltogether, the five ray tracing options deliver a massive boost to Dying Light 2 Stay Human\u2019s graphics, giving GeForce RTX gamers the ultimate experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS: Accelerate Dying Light 2 Stay Human Frame Rates By Up To 2x\nMaxing out Dying Light 2 Stay Human\u2019s graphics, cranking the resolution, and enabling all that ray-traced goodness will tax even the best system. Which is why Techland are launching Dying Light 2 Stay Human with full support for NVIDIA DLSS, enabling GeForce RTX gamers to more than double frame rates.\nWith NVIDIA DLSS, you get the highest levels of image quality without sacrificing performance. For example, DLSS can add better-than-native reconstruction on thin objects with fine lines. For instance, note the reconstruction of the chain link fence and how DLSS restores the fine details in our example below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human Game Ready Driver: Get Your System Ready\nGeForce Game Ready Drivers deliver the best experience for your favorite games.

Artists from NVIDIA used Omniverse, Autodesk 3ds Max and Substance 3D Painter to capture the essence of the room, creating detailed 3D models with realistic lighting.\n\nJust for Reference \u2014 It Begins With Images\nTo kick off the project, lead environment artist Andrew Averkin looked at various interior images to use as references for the scene. From retro furniture and toys to vintage record players and sturdy bookshelves, these images were used as guidance and inspiration throughout the creative process.\n\nThe team of artists also collected various 3D models to create the assets that would populate and bring mood and atmosphere to the scene.\nFor one key element, the writer\u2019s table, the team added extra details, such as texturing done in Substance 3D Painter, to create more layers of realism.\n3D Assets, Assemble!\nOnce the 3D assets were completed, Averkin used Autodesk 3ds Max to assemble the scene connected to Omniverse Create, a scene composition app that can handle complex 3D scenes and objects.\nWith Autodesk 3ds Max connected to Create, Averkin had a much more iterative workflow \u2014 he was able to place 3D models in the scene, make changes to them on the spot, and continue assembling the scene until he achieved the look and feel he wanted.\n\n\u201cThe best part was that I used all the tools in Autodesk 3ds Max to quickly assemble the scene. And with Omniverse Create, I used path-traced render mode to get high-quality, photorealistic renders of the scene in real time,\u201d said Averkin. \u201cI also used Assembly Tool, which is a set of tools that allowed me to work with the 3D models in a more efficient way \u2014 from scattering objects to painting surfaces.\u201d\nAverkin used the Autodesk 3ds Max Omniverse Connector \u2014 a plug-in that enables users to quickly and easily convert 3D content to Universal Scene Description, or USD \u2014 to export the scene from Autodesk 3ds Max to Omniverse Create. This made it easier to sync his work from one app to another, and continue working on the project inside Omniverse.\n\nA Story Rendered Complete\nTo put the final touches on the Storyteller project, the artists worked with the simple-to-use tools in Omniverse Create to add realistic, ambient lighting and shadows.\n\u201cI wanted the lighting to look like the kind you see after the rain, or on a cloudy day,\u201d said Averkin. \u201cI also used rectangular light behind the window, so it could brighten the indoor part of the room and provide some nice shadows.\u201d\n\nTo stage the composition, the team placed 30 or so cameras around the room to capture its different angles and perspectives, so viewers could be immersed in the scene.\nFor the final render of The Storyteller, the artists used Omniverse RTX Renderer in path-traced mode to get the most realistic result.\nSome shots were rendered on an NVIDIA Studio system powered by two NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.

In fact, edge applications are driving the next wave of AI computing\u00a0in ways that improve our lives at home, at work, in school and in transit.\nLearn more about what edge AI is, its benefits and how it works, examples of edge AI use cases, and the relationship between edge computing and cloud computing.\nWhat Is Edge AI?\u00a0\nEdge AI is the deployment of AI applications in devices throughout the physical world. It\u2019s called \u201cedge AI\u201d because the AI computation is done near the user at the edge of the network, close to where the data is located, rather than centrally in a cloud computing facility or private data center.\nSince the internet has global reach, the edge of the network can connote any location. It can be a retail store, factory, hospital or devices all around us, like traffic lights, autonomous machines and phones.\nEdge AI: Why Now?\u00a0\nOrganizations from every industry are looking to increase automation to improve processes, efficiency and safety.\nTo help them, computer programs need to recognize patterns and execute tasks repeatedly and safely. But the world is unstructured and the range of tasks that humans perform covers infinite circumstances that are impossible to fully describe in programs and rules.\nAdvances in edge AI have opened opportunities for machines and devices, wherever they may be, to operate with the \u201cintelligence\u201d of human cognition. AI-enabled smart applications learn to perform similar tasks under different circumstances, much like real life.\nThe efficacy of deploying AI models at the edge arises from three recent innovations.\n\nMaturation of neural networks: Neural networks and related AI infrastructure have finally developed to the point of allowing for generalized machine learning. Organizations are learning how to successfully train AI models and deploy them in production at the edge.\nAdvances in compute infrastructure: Powerful distributed computational power is required to run AI at the edge. Recent advances in highly parallel GPUs have been adapted to execute neural networks.\nAdoption of IoT devices: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things has fueled the explosion of big data. With the sudden ability to collect data in every aspect of a business \u2014 from industrial sensors, smart cameras, robots and more \u2014 we now have the data and devices necessary to deploy AI models at the edge. Moreover, 5G is providing IoT a boost with faster, more stable and secure connectivity.\n\nWhy Deploy AI at the Edge? What Are the Benefits of Edge AI?\u00a0\nSince AI algorithms are capable of understanding language, sights, sounds, smells, temperature, faces and other analog forms of unstructured information, they\u2019re particularly useful in places occupied by end users with real-world problems. These AI applications would be impractical or even impossible to deploy in a centralized cloud or enterprise data center due to issues related to latency, bandwidth and privacy.\nThe benefits of edge AI include:\n\nIntelligence: AI applications are more powerful and flexible than conventional applications that can respond only to inputs that the programmer had anticipated. In contrast, an AI neural network is not trained how to answer a specific question, but rather how to answer a particular type of question, even if the question itself is new. Without AI, applications couldn\u2019t possibly process infinitely diverse inputs like texts, spoken words or video.\nReal-time insights: Since edge technology analyzes data locally rather than in a faraway cloud delayed by long-distance communications, it responds to users\u2019 needs in real time.\nReduced cost: By bringing processing power closer to the edge, applications need less internet bandwidth, greatly reducing networking costs.\nIncreased privacy: AI can analyze real-world information without ever exposing it to a human being, greatly increasing privacy for anyone whose appearance, voice, medical image or any other personal information needs to be analyzed. Edge AI further enhances privacy by containing that data locally, uploading only the analysis and insights to the cloud. Even if some of the data is uploaded for training purposes, it can be anonymized to protect user identities. By preserving privacy, edge AI simplifies the challenges associated with data regulatory compliance.\nHigh availability: Decentralization and offline capabilities make edge AI more robust since internet access is not required for processing data. This results in higher availability and reliability for mission-critical, production-grade AI applications.\nPersistent improvement: AI models grow increasingly accurate as they train on more data. When an edge AI application confronts data that it cannot accurately or confidently process, it typically uploads it so that the AI can retrain and learn from it. So the longer a model is in production at the edge, the more accurate the model will be.\n\nHow Does Edge AI Technology Work?\nLifecycle of an edge AI application.\nFor machines to see, perform object detection, drive cars, understand speech, speak, walk or otherwise emulate human skills, they need to functionally replicate human intelligence.\nAI employs a data structure called a deep neural network to replicate human cognition. These DNNs are trained to answer specific types of questions by being shown many examples of that type of question along with correct answers.\nThis training process, known as \u201cdeep learning,\u201d often runs in a data center or the cloud due to the vast amount of data required to train an accurate model, and the need for data scientists to collaborate on configuring the model. After training, the model graduates to become an \u201cinference engine\u201d that can answer real-world questions.\nIn edge AI deployments, the inference engine runs on some kind of computer or device in far-flung locations such as factories, hospitals, cars, satellites and homes. When the AI stumbles on a problem, the troublesome data is commonly uploaded to the cloud for further training of the original AI model, which at some point replaces the inference engine at the edge. This feedback loop plays a significant role in boosting model performance; once edge AI models are deployed, they only get smarter and smarter.\nWhat Are Examples of Edge AI Use Cases?\u00a0\nAI is the most powerful technology force of our time. We\u2019re now at a time where AI is revolutionizing the world\u2019s largest industries.\nAcross manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, transportation, energy and more, edge AI is driving new business outcomes in every sector, including:\n\nIntelligent forecasting in energy: For critical industries such as energy, in which discontinuous supply can threaten the health and welfare of the general population, intelligent forecasting is key. Edge AI models help to combine historical data, weather patterns, grid health and other information to create complex simulations that inform more efficient generation, distribution and management of energy resources to customers.\nPredictive maintenance in manufacturing: Sensor data can be used to detect anomalies early and predict when a machine will fail. Sensors on equipment scan for flaws and alert management if a machine needs a repair so the issue can be addressed early, avoiding costly downtime.\nAI-powered instruments in healthcare: Modern medical instruments at the edge are becoming AI-enabled with devices that use ultra-low-latency streaming of surgical video to allow for minimally invasive surgeries and insights on demand.\nSmart virtual assistants in retail: Retailers are looking to improve the digital customer experience by introducing voice ordering to replace text-based searches with voice commands. With voice ordering, shoppers can easily search for items, ask for product information and place online orders using smart speakers or other intelligent mobile devices.\n\nWhat Role Does Cloud Computing Play in Edge Computing?\u00a0\nAI applications can run in a data center like those in public clouds, or out in the field at the network\u2019s edge, near the user. Cloud computing and edge computing each offer benefits that can be combined when deploying edge AI.\nThe cloud offers benefits related to infrastructure cost, scalability, high utilization, resilience from server failure, and collaboration. Edge computing offers faster response times, lower bandwidth costs and resilience from network failure.\nThere are several ways in which cloud computing can support an edge AI deployment:\n\nThe cloud can run the model during its training period.\nThe cloud continues to run the model as it is retrained with data that comes from the edge.\nThe cloud can run AI inference engines that supplement the models in the field when high compute power is more important than response time. For example, a voice assistant might respond to its name, but send complex requests back to the cloud for parsing.\nThe cloud serves up the latest versions of the AI model and application.\nThe same edge AI often runs across a fleet of devices in the field with software in the cloud\n\nLearn more about the best practices for hybrid edge architectures.\nThe Future of Edge AI\u00a0\nThanks to the commercial maturation of neural networks, proliferation of IoT devices, advances in parallel computation and 5G, there is now robust infrastructure for generalized machine learning. This is allowing enterprises to capitalize on the colossal opportunity to bring AI into their places of business and act upon real-time insights, all while decreasing costs and increasing privacy.\nWe are only in the early innings of edge AI, and still the possible applications seem endless.\nLearn how your organization can deploy edge AI by checking out the top considerations for deploying AI at the edge.\nDive deeper into edge computing on the\u00a0NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | Explainer | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing \n\t\t\t\t\tLoad Comments\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The recognition was awarded by a Guinness World Records adjudicator Wednesday at Stanford University\u2019s Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center, named for NVIDIA\u2019s founder and CEO, a Stanford alumnus.\nThe landmark study behind the world record was led by Dr. Euan Ashley, professor of medicine, of genetics and of biomedical data science at the Stanford School of Medicine. Collaborators include researchers from Stanford, NVIDIA, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Google, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of California at Santa Cruz.\nCaption: An adjudicator from Guinness World Records presented the record to the project\u2019s collaborators this week. Image credit: Steve Fisch, courtesy of Stanford University.\n\u201cI think we are in unanimous agreement that this is nothing short of a miracle,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, at the event. \u201cThis is an achievement that did go down in the history books, and will inspire another five and 10 years of fantastic work in the digital biology revolution, in which genomics is driving at the forefront.\u201d\nDiagnosing With a Genome in Record Time\nThe researchers achieved the record speed by optimizing every stage of the sequencing workflow. They used high-throughput nanopore sequencing on Oxford Nanopore\u2019s PromethION Flow Cells to generate more than 100 gigabases of data per hour, and accelerated base calling and variant calling using NVIDIA GPUs on Google Cloud. A gigabase is one billion nucleotides.\n\u201cThese innovations don\u2019t come from one individual, or even one team,\u201d said Greg Corrado, distinguished scientist at Google Research, at the event. \u201cIt really takes this group of people coming together to solve these problems.\u201d\nTo accelerate every step \u2014 from Oxford Nanopore\u2019s AI base calling to variant calling, where scientists identify the millions of variants in a genome \u2014 the researchers relied on the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks computational genomics application framework. They used a GPU-accelerated version of PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant, a pipeline developed by Google and UC Santa Cruz\u2019s Computational Genomics Laboratory.\n\u201cI believe that the innovations that we\u2019ll see in biology and medicine in the coming century are going to depend on this kind of collaboration much more than the siloed R&D centers of the past,\u201d Corrado said.\nNew Possibilities for Patient Care\nUltra-rapid genome sequencing isn\u2019t about setting world records. Cutting down the turnaround for a genetic diagnosis from a couple weeks to just a few hours can provide doctors with rapid answers needed to treat critical care patients, where every second counts.\nAnd, as the technology becomes more accessible, more hospitals and research centers will be able to use whole genome sequencing as a critical tool for patient care.\n\u201cGenomics is still at the beginning \u2014 it\u2019s not the standard of care,\u201d said Powell. \u201cI believe we can help make it part of the standard by reducing the cost and the complexity and democratizing it.\u201d\nNot content with the five-hour record, the team is already exploring ways to decrease the DNA sequencing time even further.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one promise we will make. We will smash this record very quickly in collaboration with Euan and his team, and NVIDIA and Google,\u201d said Gordon Sanghera, CEO of Oxford Nanopore Technologies.\nHear more about this research from Dr. Euan Ashley by registering free for NVIDIA GTC, where he\u2019ll present a talk titled \u201cWhen Every Second Counts: Accelerated Genome Sequencing for Critical Care\u201d on Tues., March 22 at 2 p.m. Pacific.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news here. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | GTC 2022 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Advancements in ray tracing simulate lighting and shadows to create stunning, photographic scenes, resulting in realism and deeper gaming immersion.\nResolution is the size of the image, measured in pixels. A pixel is the smallest physical point on a display, the building block of any onscreen visual. A larger number of pixels, or \u201chigher resolution,\u201d delivers sharper details and visuals that can accommodate a wider variety of colors, leading to stunning graphics.\nStandard HD monitors are 1080p resolution, 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels tall. Displays with 1440p, aka 2K screens, are 2560 x 1440 and contain 4x more pixels than HD for incredible graphical fidelity. Some newer Macbooks have 1600p resolution displays \u2014 a 2560 \u00d7 1600 pixel count.\nFPS measures the number of times an image is rendered or redrawn per second onscreen by the graphics card.\nRefreshes must be extremely quick to represent fluid, smooth movement. Key frame rates include 30, 60 and 120 FPS. These thresholds are leaps in performance that have matched new generations of displays.\nHow come every game can\u2019t play at 4K resolution and 120 FPS? Simply put, there are trade-offs.\nGPUs and CPUs working in tandem perform a variety of tasks, such as rendering graphics, particle effects like explosions, and visual effects, all of which become exponentially harder when graphical settings are maximized.\nMost game developers prioritize delivering buttery-smooth graphics by perfecting frame rate. From there, they increase resolution and FPS for the best possible visual experience.\nWith a handful of hardware checks, you can unlock the maximum resolution and FPS with a GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership, beginning with the display.\nSetup the Display to Unlock 1440p (or 1600p) at 120 FPS\nStart by maximizing the display resolution.\nOn most Windows PCs, click the Start button, Control Panel, and then, under Appearance and Personalization, select Adjust screen resolution. Then, click the drop-down list next to Resolution, move the slider to the highest resolution and click Apply. On Mac, choose the Apple menu, then System Preferences > Displays > Scaled, then choose the highest resolution.\nNext, unlock a maximum of 120 FPS.\nWhile some games are capable of 120 FPS, the display needs the capability to refresh just as fast. This is measured in Hertz. The higher the display Hertz, or Hz, the smoother and more responsive gameplay feels.\n60Hz is great for everyday computing tasks and the standard for gaming. The 120Hz threshold offers extraordinary visual quality that all gamers should experience.\nSome displays have a refresh rate higher than 120Hz. On these displays, members will still stream at up to 120 FPS. But the higher refresh rate helps lower click-to-pixel latency, which refers to the amount of time it takes from a physical action, like pressing a controller button in a soccer game, to when it\u2019s reflected on the screen, like the player attempting a shot.\nLower click-to-pixel latency adds responsiveness to fast-paced games and is especially critical for competitive gamers, where milliseconds can be the fine margin separating victory and defeat.\nMembers have the option to play at 120 FPS on a laptop with a 120Hz display, such as the newly announced MacBook Pros, or connect to a compatible 120Hz+ display, such as NVIDIA G-SYNC monitors.\nTo change the refresh rate on PC, click the Start button, then Settings\u00a0 > System\u00a0 > Display\u00a0 > Advanced display settings, selecting Refresh rate and the desired Hertz. On Mac, select the Apple menu, access System Preferences, click Displays, navigate the Refresh Rate pop-up menu and choose the requisite Hertz. For further details, visit Windows Central or Apple Support.\nTo connect to a 120Hz+ display, check the laptop for a compatible video port.\nOne of the following will work for PC: USB-C (DisplayPort or Thunderbolt), HDMI (1.4 for 1080p, or HDMI 2.0 or later for 1440p) DisplayPort 1.2 and Mini DisplayPort 1.2.\n\nOn Mac, look for a USB-C, Thunderbolt (1/2/3), HDMI (1.4 for 1080p, or HDMI 2.0 or later for 1440p), Mini DisplayPort 1.2 or USB 4 port.\n\nNext, look for a compatible port on the monitor. Any of the above will do.\nIdentifying ports can be tricky, but Digital Trends and Apple have useful articles for PC and Mac, respectively.\nTo finish, simply acquire the necessary cable and connect devices by plugging them in.\nReady for GeForce RTX 3080 graphical goodness.\nCombinations of cables and connections will work, like HDMI to HDMI or USB-C to DisplayPort. However, performance may vary slightly.\nAccording to testing, the optimal connection to maximize graphics performance on laptops is USB-C to DisplayPort. With Mac, a USB-C (Thunderbolt) adaptor to Thunderbolt to DisplayPort connection works best.\nSome laptops can connect with a simple docking station or a hub, but double check as not all can output maximum resolution and FPS.\nFor a complete guide of compatible connectors, read our support articles for Windows and macOS.\nMaximize Streaming Settings on PC and Mac\nWith hardware sorted out, adjust streaming settings.\nGeForce NOW has a convenient built-in network test that automatically detects the best streaming settings, but only up to 1080p at 60 FPS. This happens in the cloud, so gamers get a great experience and can jump in to play immediately. If the test determines an internet connection can\u2019t maintain resolution, GeForce NOW may select a lower resolution.\nFor maximum resolution, open the GeForce NOW app, go to Settings, Streaming Quality and select Custom. This will open the Details drop-down menu where Resolution can be adjusted to match the maximum size \u2014 1440p for PC and iMacs, and 1600p on select Macbooks.\nCranking FPS up to 120 requires slight modifications.\n\nOpen GeForce NOW, go to Settings, Streaming Quality and select Custom mode.\nChange Max bit rate to Auto (our recommendation) or select the desired value.\nSet Frame Rate to 120 FPS or higher. If the display can output 144Hz, set to 144 FPS.\nSelect VSync and choose Adaptive for good latency and smooth streaming. Turning Vsync off may lower latency even further, but may cause video tearing during gameplay.\n\nUsers may be tempted to set frame rates to 120 FPS with 60Hz or less displays, which will reduce latency but result in tearing on screen. Choose the experience you most prefer. It may vary by game.\nGame settings in GeForce NOW are automatically optimized for 1440p and 120 FPS in our most popular games. Changes shouldn\u2019t be needed to get the best in-game experience.\nFeel free to change settings as needed. To save custom in-game graphics, open Settings and turn on IN-GAME GRAPHICS SETTINGS. Otherwise, graphics will revert back to recommended settings.\n\nMaximizing display settings will differ depending on the platform.\nStreaming on SHIELD TV With 4K HDR\nGeForce NOW members can play PC games with 4K resolution and HDR at 60 FPS in exceptional 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound on SHIELD TV.\nCyberpunk 2077. Image curiosity of CD PROJEKT RED.\nSetup is quick and easy. On a TV that is 4K-HDR-compatible, access the menu, click Settings > Stream Quality and run a network test.\nGeForce NOW optimizes graphics settings for the most popular games to stream 4K HDR at 60 FPS on SHIELD. No changes to settings are needed. Similar to PC and Mac, settings can be saved with the Save my changes feature.\nTo play HDR-compatible games, look for the HDR badge. The GeForce NOW team configures HDR games individually, and will continue to onboard new titles in the coming months.\nLook for the HDR and RTX badges.\nGeForce NOW provides gamers the freedom to save games in the cloud, then pick up and play on the go, retaining a true PC experience.\nGeForce NOW at 120 FPS on Android Mobile Devices\u00a0\nGeForce NOW RTX 3080 memberships stream at up to 120 FPS on select Android devices.\nSupported phones include the Google Pixel 6 Pro and Samsung S20 FE EG, S21, S21+, S21 Ultra and Note20 Ultra 5G, with plans to add new phones and tablets over time.\nGaming on the go never looked this good.\nNot all phones enable 120Hz by default. It\u2019s the maximum performance, which some users don\u2019t need, and can reduce battery life.\nEnable 120Hz for Samsung devices by following these instructions \u2014 or check out the phone\u2019s user guide.\nWith game settings adjusted, it\u2019s game time, hoop!\nWith Great Internet Comes Ultra-Low Latency\nAs a cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW benefits from a strong internet connection.\nPC and Mac need at least 35mbps for streaming up to 1440p or 1600p at 120 FPS. SHIELD TV requires 40mbps for 4K HDR at 60 FPS. And Android requires 15mbps for 720p at 120 FPS, or 25mbps for 1080p at 120 FPS.\nWe strongly recommend a hardwired Ethernet connection. A 5GHz WiFi connection also provides a great gaming experience.\nCheck out the recommended routers automatically optimized for GeForce NOW.\nNext, run the GeForce NOW in-app network test to measure latency by opening GeForce NOW, navigating to Server Location and selecting Test Network.\n\nInternet service provider and proximity to the closest server are two variables that can impact the overall experience \u2014 and are likely out of most members\u2019 control. But there are ways to improve the home network setup for a top-tier cloud gaming experience.\nRead more about reducing latency in cloud gaming.\nGet Gaming in GeForce RTX 3080\nInterested in RTX 3080 in the cloud?

No one wants to purchase a new video card only to see the next generation launch a week later, bringing higher performance at the same price. \nNvidia's very first GeForce graphics card was the GeForce 256 in 1999, although the company had already been making GPUs for a number of years. Nvidia was founded by Jensen Huang who left a position at AMD designing microprocessors to explore the potential of GPUs to revolutionize computing as well as gaming. The GeForce cards continued to see improvement and refinement over the years before reaching the GeForce RTX 20-series, the first GPU to feature real-time ray tracing capabilities. This is\u00a0still one of the top achievements in GPU design and a core part of the latest GeForce cards.\nRelated: RTX 3050: Where You Have The Best Chance At Buying One\nNvidia typically updates its GPU architecture every one to two years. For example, the GeForce GTX 10-series first appeared in 2016 and it was not until 2018 before the RTX 20-series was released. One of the biggest updates ever came in 2020 and saw the GeForce RTX 30-series blow away everything that came before. Earlier GPUs often got annual updates but the improvements were not as impressive. 2020 was also the year that COVID-19 began to shake up the global supply chain, and the effects are still being felt. Normally, a GPU architecture update would have been expected to arrive this year but that is uncertain at the moment. New cards based on the GeForce RTX 30-series were announced by Nvidia at CES in January, including the RTX 3050 as\u00a0a 'low-cost' model, and new laptop GPUs, the RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti. No new cards based upon the RTX 30-series are expected this year. If a new architecture does appear in 2022, it would likely come in September, following the pattern of the RTX 20 and 30-series. \n                        Are Nvidia Cards Just For Gaming?\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPUs are designed to run the same process across a vast amount of data simultaneously, known as parallel computing. By comparison, a CPU has a relatively tiny number of cores or threads for processing, optimizing for general computing that requires big changes in what is done next based on the previous result. Intel and AMD are leaders in PC chip design for sequential processing and a single thread blasts through its task at incredible speed.\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 GPU can simultaneously perform operations on over 10,000 cores. The best CPUs from Intel and AMD count threads in double-digit figures, meaning a GPU will crush a CPU in parallel processing. That is what makes these chips ideal for gaming, graphics processing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining. Unfortunately, the latter purpose tends to create a high demand for the most expensive and latest Nvidia cards.\nNext: Graphics Cards With Ray Tracing: The Best Options\nSource: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKurt Russell's 10 Best Movies And TV Shows\n\t\t\n\n\nKurt Russell\n\nOne of the most legendary movie stars of all time, Kurt Russell's best movies and TV shows are filled with classics and modern hits.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nColin McCormick\n\n\n24 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Victoria Is So Opposed To Piper Staying In Thailand After The White Lotus Season 3\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGreg MacArthur\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJonathan Frakes Made Me Even More Excited About Star Trek\u2019s Next Show, Especially After Section 31\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJohn Orquiola\n\n\n54 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMoana 2's Biggest Twist Makes Moana The Most Impressive Disney Princess Ever\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nEidhne Gallagher\n\n\n44 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\"My Way of Giving Back\": Evangelion Creator Unpacks His Motivation For Joining Mobile Suit Gundam's New Anime\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nHannah Diffey\n\n\n24 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPredator: Badlands Sounds Awesome, But Now I'm Worried About Prey 2 After Hearing This Update\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCathal Gunning\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood American Family Cast & Character Guide\n\t\t\n\n\nGood American Family\n\nThe cast of Good American Family had to portray complicated real people in a controversial story, but they all rose to the challenge tremendously.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDennis Quaid's New Paramount+ Crime Series Debuts With Strong Rotten Tomatoes Score\n\t\t\n\nDennis Quaid's new Paramount+ crime series debuts with a strong Rotten Tomatoes score from critics ahead of its premiere later this week.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThis One Ridiculous Revenge Of The Sith Detail Suggests Palpatine Was Low-Key OBSESSED With The Death Star\n\t\t\n\n\nEmperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious\n\nI completely missed this subtle Death Star Easter egg in Revenge of the Sith, but it confirms Palpatine's obsession with this superweapon.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tChris Pratt & Millie Bobby Brown's New Sci-Fi Movie Becomes Netflix Global Hit Despite 16% Rotten Tomatoes Score\n\t\t\n\n\nChris Pratt\n\nChris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown's new sci-fi movie has become a global hit on Netflix despite its dismal 16% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t10 Great Movies About Long, Hard Journeys\n\t\t\n\nPlenty of great movies feature long, arduous journeys, in which a character\u2019s mental state is reflected in their physical circumstances. \n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\"I Hope The Audience Will Be Open To That Kind Of Change\": After George R.R.

The company confirmed the threat actor, which it did not identify by name, has begun leaking the information online.\u00a0\n\"Our team is working to analyze that information,\" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"We do not anticipate any disruption to our business or our ability to serve our customers as a result of the incident.\"\nNvidia said it worked to harden its computer network, retained incident response experts and notified law enforcement agencies. The incident was discovered on Feb. 23. The company said the attack was unrelated to the Ukraine war and said ransomware was not deployed.\u00a0\nLapsus$, a group based in Latin America,\u00a0claimed last week\u00a0that it attacked the company and stole more than 1 TB of data, according to VX-Underground, which collects malware source code and samples.\nDive Brief:\n\nNvidia is investigating a cybersecurity incident that reportedly impacted operations at the leading U.S. chipmaker in recent days.\nThe Telegraph on Friday reported that an incident may have \"completely compromised\" internal Nvidia\u00a0systems. It remained unclear whether data was stolen or deleted or computer systems were merely disrupted.\u00a0\n\"We are investigating an incident,\" a Nvidia spokesman told Cybersecurity Dive by email. \"Our business and commercial activities continue uninterrupted. We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of this event and don\u2019t have any additional information to share at this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nThe security incident against Nvidia comes as the U.S. closely monitors critical infrastructure security, including the information technology sector, for spillover cyberattacks, a byproduct of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0\nNvidia's chips are core not only to the gaming industry and professional computing, but also increasingly for the automotive sector. Nvidia has AI partnerships with leading tech providers and researchers, including Microsoft Azure and VMware. In January, the company announced plans to support Facebook\u2019s Meta AI supercomputer.\u00a0\nLast week, Nvidia reported fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP profits was up 71% from a year ago to $3.3 billion, while revenues increased 53% to $7.6 billion.\u00a0\nNvidia commands more than 80% of the market for discrete graphics processing units, according to Jon Peddie Research.\u00a0\nNvidia was one of many suppliers hit by supply chain constraints last year driven, in part, by demand, which limited its revenue.\u00a0\n\"Our demand is greater than our supply,\" said Jensen Huang, CEO, founder and president, of Nvidia speaking during Q4 earnings on Feb. 17, according to a Motley Fool transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nCyberattacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion\u2011dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others. More information at https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/.\nAbout Jaguar Land Rover: Reimagining the future of modern luxury by design\u202f \nJaguar Land Rover is reimagining the future of modern luxury by design through its two distinct, British brands.\nOur current model range embraces fully electric, plug\u2011in hybrid and mild\u2011hybrid vehicles, as well as the latest diesel and petrol engines. Our class\u2011leading Jaguars and Land Rovers are in demand around the world and in Fiscal 2020/21 we sold 439,588 vehicles in 127 countries. Land Rover is the global leader of luxury SUVs through its three families of Range Rover, Discovery and Defender. Jaguar is the first ever brand to offer a premium all\u2011electric performance SUV, the Jaguar I\u2011PACE. \nAt heart we are a British company, with two major design and engineering sites, three vehicle manufacturing facilities, an Engine Manufacturing Centre and a Battery Assembly Centre in the UK. We also have vehicle plants in China, Brazil, India, Austria and Slovakia. Three of our seven technology hubs are in the UK \u2013 Manchester, Warwick (NAIC) and London \u2013 with additional sites in Shannon, Ireland, Portland, USA, Budapest, Hungary and Shanghai, China. \nCentral to our Reimagine strategy is the electrification of both the Land Rover and Jaguar brands with two clear, distinct personalities. All Jaguar and Land Rover nameplates will be available in pure electric form by the end of the decade. This marks the start of the company\u2019s journey to become a net zero carbon business across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039.\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors since 2008, Jaguar Land Rover has unrivalled access to leading global players in technology and sustainability within the wider Tata Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Links\n\n\nlandrover.com\n\n\njaguar.com\n\n\njlr.com\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\nUser Licence\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nCOOKIE POLICY\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\n\nJob Title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Preferences\n\nDaily roundup\n\nWeekly News\n\nMonthly Newsletter\n\n\n\n\nI want updates about\n Jaguar\n Land Rover\n Jaguar Land Rover Corporate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree to Terms\n\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n > TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n > USER LICENCE\n > PRIVACY POLICY\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The bots understand and speak Thai with 97 percent accuracy, according to Areoll Wu, deputy general manager of CP All.\nThis kind of innovation is a key value for CP All, which partners with several industry groups and national agencies on an annual awards program to encourage research and entrepreneurship in Thailand.\nCP All\u2019s system uses NVIDIA DGX systems and the NVIDIA NeMo framework for natural language processing training, and the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for AI inference and model deployment.\nKeeping Up With the Calls\nCP All\u2019s 7-Eleven call centers manage customer inquiries in many business domains \u2014 including e-commerce, finance and retail \u2014 which each have area-specific expert representatives. The centers typically get nearly 250,000 calls a day, according to Kritima Klomnoi, project manager at Gosoft, a subsidiary of CP All.\n\u201cReducing hold time for customers is a key measure of our service performance,\u201d Klomnoi said. \u201cNVIDIA technologies offer us a 60 percent reduction in the call load that human agents must handle, allowing employees to efficiently tackle more unique and complex problems raised by customers.\u201d\nUsing AI-driven automatic speech recognition services, CP All\u2019s customer phone calls are transcribed in real time. When a customer service bot recognizes a question based on the NVIDIA-powered intelligent FAQ system, it immediately provides an answer using text-to-speech technologies.\nOtherwise, the AI quickly analyzes and routes calls to the appropriate employee who can assist in resolving the query in its specific business domain. CP All has also automated all e-commerce order-tracking inquiries using AI.\nAdapting to the Thai Language\nWhen first exploring conversational AI, the CP All team faced the challenge of getting the model to recognize the nuances of the Thai, Wu said.\nStandard Thai uses 21 consonants, 18 pure vowel sounds, three diphthongs and five tones \u2014 making it a complex language. NVIDIA NeMo \u2014 a framework for building, training and fine-tuning GPU-accelerated speech and natural language understanding models \u2014 helped CP All work through the intricacies.\n\u201cThe toolkit\u2019s pretrained models and tools made the process of deploying our service much less daunting,\u201d said Wu. \u201cWith the help of NeMo, we were able to quickly build and improve our AI language models, which are now optimized to understand and speak the unique Thai language.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wu, the NeMo framework enabled a 97 percent accuracy in CP All\u2019s Thai language models, more than tenfold the accuracy achieved previously.\nLooking forward, CP All plans to expand its AI services to more business domains and scale to millions of concurrent sessions on NVIDIA GPU inference architecture.\nLearn more at CP All\u2019s panel at GTC, running March 21-24.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Customer Stories | NVIDIA NeMo | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This operating expense will be accounted for in the first quarter of Nvidia's fiscal 2023, which began on February 1.\nBack in 2020, when Nvidia announced its desire to buy Arm, Nvidia promised Arm's parent Softbank a $2bn package up front to sweeten the deal. The takeover was ultimately derailed by competition watchdogs, however, so now Nvidia has to write off that arrangement with Softbank. As we reported last week, Arm's parent is expected to bag $1.25bn in breakup fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction,\" Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, noted [PDF] alongside the release of her company's Q4 figures this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a call earlier today with Wall St analysts to discuss the quarter, CEO Jensen Huang took some time to address the failed attempt to acquire Arm.\n\nWe gave it our best shot. But the headwinds were too strong and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal\n\n\"We believed that would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and help Arm expand into new markets benefiting all foreign customers in the entire ecosystem,\" Huang said.\nNvidia, we're told, worked closely with Arm and Softbank in attempts to reassure regulators that Nvidia would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem.\n\"We gave it our best shot. But the headwinds were too strong and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal,\" Huang said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe failed $66bn takeover won't, we're told, affect Nvidia's long-term strategy, which continues to be developing hardware-accelerated computing.\n\nFTC celebrates after Nvidia-Arm deal collapses\nArm's $66bn sale to Nvidia is off: Deal collapses after world's competition regulators raise concerns\nNvidia reportedly prepares for un-Arm'd combat with rivals: $40bn takeover may be abandoned\nMeta says it's building world's largest AI supercomputer out of Nvidia, AMD chips\n\n\"We are on track to launch our Arm-based Grace CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads, in the first half of next year,\" Huang said, later adding that we should expect \"a lot of CPU development around the Arm architecture.\"\nNvidia has a 20-year architectural license from Arm, which grants Nvidia \"the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets\" to deliver on its three-chip strategy involving CPUs, GPUs, and DPUs. What that means is, Nvidia \u2013 like Apple, AMD, Samsung, and others \u2013 has a license from Arm to create its own highly customized Arm-compatible CPU cores from scratch for whatever purpose it desires. Organizations without an architectural license have to pick and choose CPU cores from Arm's catalog.\n\"Whether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job, and together with partners in the computer industry, offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time,\" Huang said.\n\nThe anatomy of the deal\n\nNvidia's planned acquisition of UK-based Arm collapsed last week after opposition from regulators, which expressed concerns about the union potentially stifling competition. America's FTC sued in December to prevent the deal, and the British expressed national security concerns as a reason to intensify its probe of the deal. The China Antitrust Authority was also scrutinizing the specifics.\nMicrosoft, Qualcomm, Google, and others were concerned that Nvidia's purchase of Arm could lead to restricted access to the architecture, ecosystem, and chip designs. Arm's blueprints are licensed for components in most smartphones, tablets, and embedded and network-connected electronics, among other things, and are making their way into PCs and servers.\nWith the Arm merger consigned to the trash, Nvidia can move on to business as usual, which seems to be moving along just fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the three months to January 31 of calendar 2022 \u2013 the fourth quarter of Nvidia's fiscal year 2022 \u2013 the company reported revenue of $7.6bn, growing by 53 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. Net profit was $3bn, up 106 per cent year-over-year.\n\nThe year-on-year increases for the quarter and fiscal year reflect higher sales of GeForce GPUs\n\nA little under half of the quarterly revenue came from sales of gaming GPUs, which totaled $3.4bn, up by 37 per cent from the year-ago quarter. The rest was mostly data-center-grade accelerators ($3.3bn) and professional graphics products ($640m).\n\"The year-on-year increases for the quarter and fiscal year reflect higher sales of GeForce GPUs,\" Kress said.\nGPUs have been in short supply with prices going up and available inventories being swiped by scalpers and crypto-miners. Nvidia claimed it was trying to push GPUs into the hands of gamers, and away from cryptocurrency mining, with its Lite Hash Rate feature to discourage mining use.\n\"Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, though we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and our ability to accurately estimate it,\" Kress wrote.\nFor the full fiscal year, Nvidia reported revenue of $26.9bn, which was up by 61 per cent year-over-year. Net profit tallied $9.75bn, up by 125 per cent.\nNvidia is projecting first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue to be about $8.1bn, plus or minus two per cent. That $1.36bn Arm write-off will appear as an operating expense.

The cache is an archive that is almost 20GB large.\nWhile the U.S. chipmaker giant has yet to confirm a breach on its network, the threat actor has been active with messages about the alleged hack since February 24.\nNvidia silent to extortionist's claims and leak\nReplying to a request for comments from BleepingComputer on Friday about an incident that reportedly took down some of its systems for two days,\u00a0Nvidia said\u00a0that it was investigating what looked like a cyberattack.\nIn a reply to BleepingComputer, a company spokesperson said that Nvidia will issue an updated statement on Sunday but it never came. Several subsequent requests from us remained unanswered.\nReporting on the outage and what caused it,\u00a0The Telegraph\u00a0cited an insider saying that the intrusion \u201ccompletely compromised\u201d the company\u2019s internal systems.\nLapsus$ said that they stole 1TB of data from Nvidia and that they were prepared to publish it unless the company paid a ransom demand.\nThe first round of messages from Lapsus$ included a leak of what the actor said were hashed passwords of all Nvidia employees and a claim that the company hacked back to encrypt their virtual machine with the data.\n\nIn an odd move, the extortion group removed all messages related to the Nvidia and resumed the stream of communication today with a note reiterating that they \u201chacked Nvidia.\u201d\nIn multiple messages today, Lapsus$ provided more details about their incursion. \u201cWe were into nvidia systems for about a week, we fastly escalated to admin of a lot of systems,\u201d the actor said.\n\nThey said they stole important files during the breach that include \u201cstuff, schematics, driver, firmware,\u201d and that they are willing to sell some of it:\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting for nvidia to contact us. We are also selling a full LHR V2 (GA102-GA104) -> we hope it will soon be removed by nvidia\u201d - Lapsus$\n\nLHR is Nvidia\u2019s lite hash rate technology that enables graphics cards to reduce a GPU\u2019s mining capacity. The Lapsus$ extortion group hopes that Nvidia will remove this limitation.\nFor this reason, they\u2019re asking the GPU maker to remove the LHR limitations in the GeForce RTX 30 Series firmware, threatening to leak the folder with the hardware specifications.\n\nThe actor also claims to have documentation, company private tools, SDKs, \u201cand everything about falcon\u201d - Nvidia\u2019s proprietary control processor.\nThe next message was a link to \u201cpart one of Nvidia data,\u201d hosted on Amazon infrastructure, containing \u201csource code and highly confidential/secret data from various parts of NVIDIA gpu driver. Falcon, LHR, and such.\u201d\n\nAccording to the threat actor, Nvidia filed an abuse report to stop the sharing. However, Lapsus$ switched to leaking the info over torrent and said that they would not re-upload the file.\nThe size of today\u2019s data leak that Lapsus$ claims to have stolen from Nvidia is around 20GB and consists of an archive named \u201cintegdev_gpu_drv.rar.\u201d\nThe actor says that the archive includes important source code and that they have enough information for a good developer to be able to create a bypass for Nvidia's LHR.\nThey also added that they're selling a LHR bypass that would disable the technology \u201cwithout flashing anything.\u201d This would enable a cryptocurrency mining operation to make the most of Nvidia graphic cards.\nFor now, Nvidia is keeping quiet about Lapsus$ claims and the data they shared. It is unclear how damaging this leak is to Nvidia or what secrets it may contain but there is a good chance for sensitive data to be present in a document archive of about 20GB.\nShortly before publishing this article, Nvidia responded with the following statement to BleepingComputer's request:\n\n\u201cWe are investigating an incident. Our business and commercial activities continue uninterrupted. We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event and don't have any additional information to share at this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nNew Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUsThe AI race: Dark AI is in the lead, but good AI is catching upLook up: The new frontier of cyberthreats is in the skyNew Darcula phishing service targets iPhone users via iMessagePolish Space Agency offline as it recovers from cyberattack\n\n\n\n\nCyberattack\nGPU\nLapsus$\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIonut Ilascu   \n              Ionut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.

Our class-leading Jaguars and Land Rovers are in demand around the world and in Fiscal 2020/21 we sold 439,588 vehicles in 127 countries. Land Rover is the global leader of luxury SUVs through its three families of Range Rover, Discovery and Defender. Jaguar is the first ever brand to offer a premium all-electric performance SUV, the Jaguar I-PACE.\nAt heart we are a British company, with two major design and engineering sites, three vehicle manufacturing facilities, an Engine Manufacturing Centre and a Battery Assembly Centre in the UK. We also have vehicle plants in China, Brazil, India, Austria and Slovakia. Three of our seven technology hubs are in the UK \u2013 Manchester, Warwick (NAIC) and London \u2013 with additional sites in Shannon, Ireland, Portland, USA, Budapest, Hungary and Shanghai, China.\nCentral to our Reimagine strategy is the electrification of both the Land Rover and Jaguar brands with two clear, distinct personalities. All Jaguar and Land Rover nameplates will be available in pure electric form by the end of the decade. This marks the start of the company\u2019s journey to become a net zero carbon business across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039.\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors since 2008, Jaguar Land Rover has unrivalled access to leading global players in technology and sustainability within the wider Tata Group.\nJaguar Land Rover PR social channels:\u202f\r\n- Twitter:\u202f@JLR_News\u202f\r\n-\u202fLinkedIn:\u202fJaguarLandRover\u202f\nFor more information, visit www.media.jaguarlandrover.com.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and features of NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, including the NVIDIA DRIVE platform, DRIVE Hyperion, DRIVE Orin, NVIDIA DGX, DRIVE Sim, and NVIDIA Omniverse; the benefits and impact of NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Jaguar Land Rover; all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles being built on the NVIDIA DRIVE software-defined platform; next-generation cars transforming auto into one of the largest and most advanced technology industries; and fleets of software-defined, programmable cars being enhanced with new functionalities and services for the life of the vehicle are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

It's Arm Holdings. You know, the company NVIDIA wanted to buy for $40 billion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsif Khan\n\n\nFebruary 7, 2022 10:20 PM\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nSad news out of giant corporate merger land this evening as the $66 billion Arm Holdings acquisition by NVIDIA has collapsed under regulatory scrutiny and fear of a monopoly. Arm's technology is at the core of many consumer electronics devices we use every day, and the deal was viewed as anticompetitive by regulators and many other competitors in the semiconductor industry. Softbank, Arm's current parent company, has a plan to turn the lemon of a deal into some lemonade. An Arm Holdings IPO\u00a0will instead be the way forward.\u00a0\n\nThe original valuation of the NVIDIA deal for Arm Holdings valued the transaction at around $40 billion of combined cash and NVDA shares in September 2021. At the peak of NVIDIA's stock valuation in November, the deal was set to net Softbank almost $90 billion. As of today, the deal was still set to bring in close to $66 billion if it were able to close. The FT was the first to report the news of the collapsed deal, but they put everything behind a paywall over there.\n\nSad Jensen is sad.\n\nAccording to several people close to the deal, NVIDIA abandoned the deal earlier on Monday. Apparently, NVIDIA even offered to maintain sales to Arm's other customers following the deal, and UK regulator did not agree it would be effective enough. The deal was largely viewed as anticompetitive by regulators, consumers, and many large tech companies.\u00a0Some folks in the market may have been ahead of this news. NVIDIA (NVDA) shares are down 28% from the all-time high hit in late November 2021.\n\nNVIDIA shares have been going down for some time, as many began to realize the $40 billion ARM deal may have face insurmountable regulatory headwinds.\n\nThe good news today is that we all will hopefully have a chance to buy shares of Arm Holdings. This company is at the heart of so many amazing products and ecosystems, it will truly be one stock to immediately put on the old watch list. As for the timing of the IPO, or valuation, we have no idea. Softbank will be motivated to move, because they just lost out on one of the sweetest pay days in the history of technology mergers and acquisitions.\u00a0\n\nThis article is only meant for educational purposes, and should not be taken as investment advice.

This GFN Thursday looks at one of the tier\u2019s major benefits: ultra-low-latency streaming from the cloud.\nThis week also brings a new app update that lets members log in via Discord, a members-only World of Warships reward and eight titles joining the GeForce NOW library.\nFull Speed Ahead\nThe GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership tier is kind of like magic. When members play on underpowered PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, SHIELD TVs, Android devices, iPhones and iPads, they\u2019re streaming the full PC games that they own with all of the benefits of GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs \u2014 like ultra-low latency.\n\nA few milliseconds of latency \u2014 the time it takes from a keystroke or mouse click to seeing the result on screen \u2014 can be the difference between a round-winning moment and a disappointing delay in the game.\nThe GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership, powered by GeForce NOW SuperPODs, reduces latency through faster game rendering, more efficient encoding and higher streaming frame rates. Each step helps deliver cloud gaming that rivals many local gaming experiences.\nWith game rendering on the new SuperPODs, all GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will feel a discernible reduction in latency. However, GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members playing on the PC, Mac and Android apps will observe the greatest benefits by streaming at up to 120 frames per second.\nThe result?

From the map, we can see these two plots are located about three streets, or a 5- to 7-minute walk, apart. The projects are called Plantation Creek and Parc Flora @ Tengah.  We\u2019re quite excited about the development of Tengah, set to be Singapore\u2019s first 'Forest Town'. The new BTO estate, which will also have Singapore\u2019s first 'car-free' town centre, will enjoy connectivity to new MRT stations on the upcoming Jurong Region Line, a bus interchange that\u2019s in the works, and abundant walking and cycling paths. With 35% more BTO flats set to be launched in 2022 and 2023, we're really looking forward to what's in store. But for now, let's take a closer look at the BTO February 2022 projects in Tengah.

Source: HDB Tengah is an up-and-coming neighbourhood so there are no resale flats in this HDB town. But you can check out previous HDB BTO 2021 Tengah launches or apply for a Sale of Balance (SBF) flat next May or November.

There are 713 units of 4-room and 5-room homes planned.   Story continues Meanwhile, the second Tengah HDB BTO Feb 2022 project, Parc Flora @ Tengah, is at the junction of Tengah Drive and Tengah Garden Walk. This smaller Tengah project will offer 560 units of 2-room Flexi, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats.Those with green fingers rejoice because there will be plenty of community gardens around for you to do your thing! You can also reap the benefits of being close to nature by taking a walk through one of the many green spaces or biking down the cycling paths.Parc Flora @ Tengah is closer to the upcoming bus interchange in Tengah. In terms of MRT connectivity, it is also close to Tengah MRT station, within walking distance of Tengah Plantation MRT station on the east line and Hong Kah MRT station on the south line. This gives residents here better connectivity than Plantation Creek.Plus, residents of Parc Flora @ Tengah will be near the upcoming Town Council as well as Tengah Central and a neighbourhood centre that\u2019s integrated with a polyclinic.Seeing that there\u2019ll be 2-room Flexi units available in Parc Flora @ Tengah, we're guessing it is meant to cater to seniors too. The more accessible location will definitely benefit less mobile elderly.With the larger 4- and 5-room units on offer, Plantation Creek seems suitable for larger families or even multi-generation living.It will be right beside a proposed health and medical care facility. Just across the expressway is Jurongville Primary School, a proposed nursing home, and the redeveloped Jurong Polyclinic. However, do note the first Plantation Creek is close to the busy Pan-Island Expressway. Thankfully, there seems to be a green space separating the flats and road, so hopefully, that will function as a sound barrier.Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO Tengah Feb 2022 Launch) Unit typeTengah BTO Price (HDB BTO Feb 2022): Plantation Creek and Parc Flora @ TengahTengah BTO Price (HDB BTO Nov 2021): Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ TengahPrevious Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO May 2021)Previous Tengah BTO Price (HDB BTO Feb 2021) 2-Room FlexiFrom $132,000From $119,000From $113,000From $110,000 3-RoomFrom $231,000From $194,000-From $209,000 4-RoomFrom $309,000From $312,000From $299,000From $298,000 5-RoomFrom $420,000From $428,000From $404,000- The February 2022 Tengah BTO flats is one of the more affordable options in this sales launch. Despite the slightly more accessible location of Parc Flora @ Tengah, the prices for Plantation Creek and Parc Flora @ Tengah are the same.There are no resale HDB flats in Tengah to benchmark prices against. The first BTO flats in Tengah should be ready by 2023, which means that the first batch of resale flats will start appearing around 2028.In terms of 'investment' value, you can look out for price appreciation in the long-term, especially with the completion of key developments such as the Jurong Region Line (to be completed by 2029), as well as the up-and-coming second Central Business District in the West: Jurong Innovation District and Jurong Lake District (from 2040).Too bad about the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail though, but those land parcels will go towards even more existing developments in Jurong, which is great for Tengah residents-to-be!Budgeting for Your Tengah Feb 2022 BTO Home LoanThe HDB BTO Tengah Feb 2022 flats are likely to be among the most affordable. To help you budget for your potential new home, we've included price estimates of the Tengah Feb 2022 launch.

It's free!Plantation Creek and Parc Flora @ Tengah BTO Amenities (HDB BTO Feb 2022 Launch)Live in Peace and Quiet, Surrounded by Nature and GardensTengah would be the ideal neighbourhood for nature lovers who prefer their living spaces to be peaceful, away from the frantic rush and crowds of the city. If you like living in the West or don\u2019t mind a longer commute, these projects are great for you.Avid gardeners will also appreciate living here as there\u2019ll be plenty of lush community gardens to flex your green fingers. Proud plant parents can have both indoor plant pots on their HDB balcony and tend to vegetables in the community gardens in the estate.Stay Active in this 'Car-free' Town with Parks, Nearby Sporting FacilitiesWhat better way to enjoy all the verdant views in this new HDB town than going for a walk? Those who love to stretch their legs or cycle without the fear of traffic can do so on the dedicated walking and cycling paths. There\u2019s also a large central park to take a stroll at.The whole town will be surrounded by trees, with aptly named parks in the estate to explore, such as the proposed Forest Corridor and Forest Fringe.For Plantation Creek, there will be a health and medical care facility nearby, while Parc Flora @ Tengah will be within walking distance of a proposed sports and recreation centre. Residents can also travel to the nearby HDB towns of Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok and Jurong for even more amenities such as Civil Service Club @ Bukit Batok, Bukit Batok Swimming Complex, and Jurong East Sports Centre.Get Around Singapore with Ease, Once the JRL is CompletedCurrently, Tengah remains inaccessible and out of the way. The first batch of Tengah residents will have to rely on existing bus links or MRT stations from nearby towns to get around. But that will change once the Jurong Region Line opens in stages from 2027 to 2029.Comprising east, west and south segments, the 24km-long JRL comprises a total of 24 stations. There will be 62 driverless and fully-automated car trains plying the JRL, serving major nodes that include Jurong Industrial Estate, the Jurong Innovation District, Nanyang Technological University and more. The three interchange MRT stations will be Jurong East, Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay.Who knows, by the time the first BTO flats in Tengah fulfil their MOP in 2028, property prices might have increased sharply due to the new developments. Not to mention, Tengah will also have its very own bus interchange.Shopping Malls Close ByIn the initial years, Tengah residents-to-be will need to venture to neighbouring towns for their retail therapy needs. Big malls in surrounding towns include Westgate, Jem, JCube and IMM in Jurong; Jurong Point and Boon Lay Shopping Centre in Boon Lay; West Mall in Bukit Batok; and Lot One Shoppers\u2019 Mall and Keat Hong Shopping Centre in Choa Chu Kang.There\u2019s likely to be at least one shopping mall planned in Tengah Central.

Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) has announced its plans to appoint a developer to jointly redevelop its Comcentre headquarters along the Orchard Road belt. The redevelopment will maximise the Comcentre\u2019s site potential and increase building efficiency with a view to unlocking value from the property, says the telco in its Feb 23 statement.  The total cost of development, including land costs, is estimated to be in excess of $2 billion. As part of its capital recycling strategy, Singtel will divest Comcentre to a joint venture company formed with the appointed developer and hold a majority stake in this joint venture. The building will be redeveloped into a next-generation office development, which will house Singtel\u2019s modern new headquarters besides offering progressive and optimised hybrid workplaces to other tenants. The new building is expected to have a total gross floor area (GFA) of over 110,000 sqm comprising Grade A office buildings, a retail component and Singtel\u2019s existing Orchard Exchange. It plans to include a future underground connection to Somerset MRT station on the North South Line. Singtel has also obtained in-principle approval from the Singapore Land Authority to extend the lease on all the lots that make up Comcentre to 2089. The redevelopment will incorporate the latest sustainable designs and digital technologies.  As the anchor tenant, Singtel will occupy around 30% of the space. The remaining space will be leased out to other tenants, which will generate recurring income for the telco in the long term. \"We\u2019ve had the privilege of working out of the iconic Comcentre building in the Orchard Road belt since 1979. We\u2019re truly excited to be working with the authorities to rejuvenate the Orchard Road precinct to prepare for the post-pandemic world and reinvigorate our future workplaces,\u201d says Singtel group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon. \u201cWith the redevelopment of Comcentre, we aim to establish a new standard for the global office of the future by combining the latest technologies and sustainable workspaces to create pleasant, collaborative and connected environments for our employees and other building occupants, catering to the increasing adoption of hybrid work strategies,\u201d he adds. Maximising the unique development potential of Comcentre will significantly enhance its value in a vicinity where Grade A office developments are in short supply. We strive to optimise the capital we can unlock from existing assets to fund our growth initiatives including 5G and the regional expansion of our data centre business. We will continue to seek out opportunities to crystallise value from our extensive portfolio of assets.\u201d   Story continues The new Comcentre is expected to be completed in 2028.\"The new Comcentre will cater to our evolving business needs and showcase the digital workplace of the future featuring 5G solutions. This reimagined Comcentre is the latest exciting step in Singtel's transformation since we started our strategic reset last year. We aim to create an environment that stimulates greater innovation, collaboration and engagement, inspiring our people to do their best work and serve our communities. This will be a magnet for talent who want to co-create and collaborate in an innovative environment. The redevelopment of our headquarters also supports our vision to build a greener and sustainable future and will further facilitate our efforts to reach net zero for our own operations,\u201d says Yuen.Singtel will relocate from the Comcentre in 2024 to prepare for the redevelopment.Shares in Singtel closed at $2.56 on Feb 22.Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge SingaporeSee Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Singtel launches industry's first all-in-one platform for 5G and edge computing Singtel still set for recovery despite 3QFY2022 earnings miss: analysts Singtel sees 23.8% higher net profit of $734 mil in 3QFY2021 Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

With Singapore being such a beautiful Garden City, there are just too many HDB BTO projects to feature at a time. You probably realised that in recent years, almost all of the new HDB BTO projects feature sprawling rooftop gardens, greener yet functional fixtures and so on, instead of cold, hard concrete.  Yup, it\u2019s part of the SG Green Plan, aiming to transform Singapore into a more sustainable and greener city by 2030. Add to this HDB\u2019s existing urban greenery solutions and the many community gardens we see coming up in newer developments, with Tengah\u2019s as a prime example. Plus, living near nature and green spaces can benefit us too. Not only does it keep us cool by lowering urban heat, looking at foliage can reduce our stress levels and motivate us to stay fit. Indoor plants can even clean the air in our homes! We even have our own PropertyGuru Green Score for homeowners who ensure that their next property is sustainable and eco-friendly. Ahhh, but we digress. Here are seven more HDB BTO projects with \u2018chio\u2019 gardens and eco-friendly features for your viewing pleasure (and perhaps to consider for your future home). More HDB BTO Projects with Green Features, Part of SG Green Plan In the second iteration of HDB BTO projects with pretty gardens and eco-friendly features, you\u2019ll find HDB BTO projects that boast sea views (Punggol Northshore district), massive green decks, those that are close to nature (whether man-made or not) and one that towers above all with an unbeatable vantage point, 48 storeys high.

Casa Clementi: Massive Green Deck with 660m Jogging Track   sg-green-plan-bto-hdb-sustainability-garden (1)   Source: Surbana Jurong   Story continues Casa Clementi, completed in 2012, is one of the largest HDB projects to date, with over 2,234 units. The up to 40-storey-high development sits on a massive 56,630 sqm plot of land, of which almost 30% is a sprawling landscaped deck (15,460 sqm) over the basement carpark. About half of that space is dedicated to green planters.The development has also clinched many awards, including the 2014 Green Award - Silver Prize in the World Landscape Planning Design Competition. It was also recognised by NParks\u2019 Landscape Excellence Assessment Framework.Looking out of their HDB windows, residents can enjoy the verdant view instead of being hit with the glare from bare concrete. The greenery is also surprisingly self-sustaining, with thoughtful built-in features that include sub-surface drainage modules, careful selection of plants that require minimal maintenance, and a network of irrigation lines to deliver nutrients and water.This green deck also houses community amenities such as fitness and play stations, open plazas and even a perimeter pathway that doubles up as a 660m jogging track.Browse all available HDB flats for sale in Clementi on PropertyGuru.Related article: 60 Freshly MOP-ed HDB Resale Flats in Singapore to Expect in 2022/20232.

The new park is set to be a rest stop for migratory birds that you can spot from September to March every year. Time to invest in a pair of binoculars so you can birdwatch while relaxing on one of the many benches made from reused felled timber.Bidadari Park also houses the $25 million man-made Alkaff Lake that\u2019s the size of two football fields, a 700-metre heritage walk, experiential trails, a boardwalk, and a kids\u2019 play area. There will even be a couple of community gardens around the park for residents to flex their green fingers.Related article: Feb 2021 Toa Payoh Bidadari BTO Review: Prime Location With Great MRT AccessIn addition, residents of Bidadari will get their water from an underground service reservoir (built beneath the community lawn in Bidadari Park) \u2013 Singapore\u2019s first \u2013 that will help to boost water pressure during periods of high demand.Of course, within the development itself, ParkEdge @ Bidadari has its own playgrounds and fitness stations, roof gardens atop two residential blocks, and a multi-storey carpark that is linked via sky bridges to residential blocks.Browse all available HDB flats for sale in Toa Payoh on PropertyGuru.3.

For someone who had occupied a conventional C-suite office for decades, it was an eye-opener. \u201cI was told that a lot of the WeWork members there are entrepreneurs or those in their second careers, people who want to maintain an office they could go to every day, and those who are in consulting jobs,\u201d she recounts.  See also: Asia Pacific cities face the challenge of sustainable growth: ULI\u2019s Khoo Teng Chye It was proof that the end of corporate life does not mean the end of one\u2019s career. \u201cThere\u2019s no hard-stop to retirement these days; it\u2019s just moving on to the next season,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just retire from corporate life to pursue things that you are passionate about, that you feel are purposeful.\u201d A long-time real estate consultant, Ong\u2019s credentials and track record speak for themselves: CEO of Edmund Tie from 2015 until her retirement in July 2021, she remains a board member at the firm. Prior to that, she was the firm\u2019s executive director and head of research & consultancy for two decades from 1995, when it was founded by the eponymous Edmund Tie.    Koh: Learning never stops. Even as seniors, we can continue learning (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp SIngapore) A new season Having spent over 26 years with Edmund Tie, Ong does not see her identity being defined by her work. \u201cI can be a CEO for a season, but when I leave, that designation is gone. And when that happens, I revert to being a nobody,\u201d she observes. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how you see yourself in your family \u2014 as a wife, mother, daughter and sister. So don\u2019t hold on to designations.\u201d Since her retirement, Ong has reverted to using her maiden surname Koh. She is now in the \u201clearning, unlearning and relearning\u201d phase, she says. \u201cI need to unlearn some of the things that I\u2019ve done wrongly, or rather, were appropriate at that time but perhaps now, there\u2019s a new way of doing these things,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s going back to the fundamentals. It\u2019s also a time of reflection.\u201d  In fact, she was one of \u201c18 outstanding Singaporeans\u201d who were given the SkillsFuture Fellowship by President Halimah Yacob, the patron of the awards, at a ceremony on Dec 10, 2021, at Marina Bay Sands. The SkillsFuture Fellowship is the highest accolade for those who are respected masters of skills in their particular fields, who champion lifelong learning and are committed to mentoring others. Koh is the only one in the real estate sector to be conferred the honour. \u201cLearning never stops,\u201d she says. \u201cEven as seniors, we can continue learning.\u201d   Story continues   Kampong Admiralty, Singapore\u2019s first public housing project with flats for the aged (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Communal, luxe living for seniorsBeyond her profession, Koh was the chair of Urban Land Institute (ULI) Singapore for two years, from 2019 until 2021. She remains active at ULI, and has aligned her mission with the organisation\u2019s: to shape the future of the built environment, and to have a transformative impact on communities worldwide. \u201cReal estate, at the end of the day, is not just about bricks and mortar, but about people and communities,\u201d she says.A parent of two grown-up sons, Koh believes it is time to simplify her life. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have our kids tied down to us,\u201d she says. Hence, she believes there is a market for communal living for seniors. Not spartan living like college student dormitories, she emphasises, but with some luxury features, \u201cbecause we want to indulge ourselves a little\u201d.Besides luxury features, communal living for seniors should provide a social network with various interest groups, such as cycling, birding, gardening or art. \u201cSeniors are seeking more experiences, whether it\u2019s travel, connecting with like-minded people or starting small businesses,\u201d Koh continues. \u201cI think there\u2019s a huge market out there. Tapping the silver dollar can be gold.\u201d  The community plaza at Kampung Admiralty integrated development (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)As of 2021, the fastest-growing age group in Singapore is those above 65 years, which grew 5.6% y-o-y, according to the Singapore Department of Statistics. They account for 16% of the Singapore resident population today. By 2030, it is expected that one in five residents will be 65 years or older.In Singapore, the length of stay in nursing homes is said to range from five to 15 years. In the US, which has a wide array of aged care options, from retirement villages to assisted living, the typical duration of nursing home stay is just two years.\u201cI think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have an option, especially with one in 10 seniors above the age of 60 suffering from dementia,\u201d says Koh. \u201cAnd dementia is very difficult on the caregiver. When families can\u2019t manage, the only option is a nursing home, which is expensive, and we are using our resources inefficiently.\u201d  Rooftop community park at Kampung Admiralty (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Assisted living in new BTO flatsThe government offered its first assisted living public housing with the launch of new flat typology aimed at seniors in Bukit Batok a year ago. Named Harmony Village, it was launched as part of the HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) exercise in February 2021. Services offered in the BTO flats for seniors include 24-hour emergency monitoring and response service, basic health checks, simple home fixes and activities at the communal spaces within the development. (Find HDB flats for rent or sale with our Singapore HDB directory)Last November, another BTO launch at Yew Tee offered 68 two-room flexi flats for seniors across a 10-storey residential block. An integrated development, its amenities include a hawker centre, polyclinic, a community club, community garden and kidney dialysis centre. The flats will come with elderly-friendly fittings and smart distribution boards that allow the adoption of smart-home features and monitoring of energy consumption.In 2017, the government launched Kampung Admiralty, which offered Singapore\u2019s first public housing project with flats for the aged, integrated with public facilities and services such as a medical centre, community plaza and a rooftop community park.  Kampung Admiralty Medical Centre, one of the facilities at the integrated development (Photo: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)\u201cIt\u2019s good that the government is already starting to look at elderly-friendly facilities and services \u2014 with Kampung Admiralty, Harmony Village and Yew Tee \u2014 but what about the private sector?\u201d Koh comments. \u201cThose who are rich can have your 24-hour nurses and other services. But for the majority, is there a middle ground that we can explore?\u201dUnderserved middle groupIn Koh\u2019s opinion, there is a broad swath of the senior living market that remains underserved \u2014 a transition between independent living and nursing homes in the private sector. \u201cWe do need something in between \u2014 assisted living \u2014 where we can provide a community that can look out for each other,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should do something about it now. We don\u2019t want to institutionalise our seniors by putting them into nursing homes ahead of their time.\u201dKoh took a design-thinking workshop recently as part of a group project, and applied it to the design of senior-friendly housing.

You might need to pay for overseas shopping, buy property and investments, or send money to loved ones. Fortunately in Singapore, there are many apps and services available that you can use to transfer money both domestically and internationally. In this article, we have narrowed them down to five of the most popular apps for international and Singapore money transfers. Western Union: Popular Money Transfer App for Market Access and Global Reach Western Union is one of the most popular platforms for international money transfers. The platform recorded 268 million transfers made globally in 2021, averaging 31 transfers per second. The main draw of this platform is that it has one of the widest reaches, if not the widest reach, of any money transfer app: as of 2022, the platform operates in more than 200 countries and territories.  The app does have its limitations. Firstly, it does not support domestic money transfers within Singapore. This largely relegates the platform to international transfers. Secondly, the platform has a daily transfer limit of 1,000 SGD, a weekly transfer limit of 3,000 SGD and a monthly transfer limit of 6000 SGD. Some may find this too restrictive. These transfer limits make Western Union less suitable for large-scale wire transfers.   money transfer online   Nevertheless, the sheer range of countries that this service covers makes it a good choice for those looking to transfer money to a country that other platforms do not serve. SingX: Popular Money Transfer App for Large, Same-Day Transfers SingX is another widely-used wire transfer service, with a payment coverage spanning more than 170 countries. It allows you to transfer up to SGD 1,000,000 from Singapore to another country, though the amount is subject to restrictions that each country imposes. This is particularly useful for individuals remitting large sums of money to India as there are no additional restrictions on the money sent. Apart from the generous transfer limit, another draw of this platform is the speed that the money is transferred. For most countries that the platform serves, the money is delivered within a single day. Instarem: Popular Money Transfer App for Rewards InstaRem stands out from the pack of money transfer apps with its loyalty program (called InstaPoints) and cashback promotions. You can accumulate InstaPoints upon joining the platform and when you execute transactions. Redeeming InstaPoints can help you to save on your transaction fees. The platform is also known for its transparency: it sources rates directly from Reuters so you are aware of what you are paying for.   Story continues The service does have its downsides. It can take up to 2 days to transfer money through the platform, which is slightly longer than the time taken to transfer money through competing platforms.  bank wire transfer online  Nevertheless, the rewards program can be appealing to those who need to transfer money frequently.DBS Remit: Popular Traditional Bank App for Money TransfersAs the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS offers a vast suite of financial services. One such service is DBS Remit, which is DBS\u2019 platform for international money transfers. DBS Remit boasts several features that give it a leg up over its competitors. The platform offers same-day transfers for selected markets, does not impose transfer fees on transactions and provides better rates if you transfer SGD 50,000 or more.However, transferring money to some countries can take up to four working days. There is also a daily transfer limit of SGD 200,000 for sending money to most of these countries. This makes DBS Remit less suitable for transferring sums that exceed that amount. In addition, the bank charges a handling commission fee of SGD 10 for incoming transfers to a SGD or Foreign Currency Current Account, though it can be waived if you are a DBS Treasures member.  online bank transfer  Nevertheless, DBS\u2019 reputation as one of the leading consumer banks in Singapore makes their money transfer service a solid choice.WorldFirst: Popular Money Transfer App for BusinessesWorldfirst is a popular money transfer platform for businesses. Since its inception in 2004, the platform has served more than 250,000 businesses around the world. It offers two types of accounts. The International Payments Account is designed for importers with overseas suppliers and the International Collections Account is designed for exporters and businesses operating in e-commerce marketplaces.Unlike some other money transfer apps, Worldfirst has no minimum or maximum transfer limits. This makes it a flexible option for transferring any sum of money. However, Worldfirst charges you a fee of SGD 10 for each transaction if you\u2019re using the International Payments Account. Another important point to consider is that Worldfirst closed down its consumer account offering in 2021. This makes the platform a better choice for businesses rather than private consumers.  international money transfer  A better no-fee money transfer service for individuals would be SendFX, which is also known as Send. Like WorldFirst, SendFX offers no-fee money transfers, making it one of the more affordable wire transfer services.ConclusionEach money transfer service has its strengths and weaknesses.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 3yephotography via Getty Images By Faris Mokhtar (Bloomberg) \u2014 To much of the outside world, Singapore is a capitalist utopia of low taxes and prosperity for all. In reality, the city-state is starting to have serious doubts about its widely admired model. A growing fear among locals that social mobility has slowed is pushing the government to re-examine some of the policies that have made it one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  Workers from overseas were among the first to get caught in the cross hairs. Hiring criteria got tighter after competition for jobs became a theme of the 2020 election, with the ruling People\u2019s Action Party suffering the worst parliamentary results since taking office in 1965. Now the rich may be next in line. The government is exploring expanding its wealth tax system \u2014 in addition to existing levies on property and cars \u2014 as establishment figures including the central bank chief and the finance minister publicly sound the alarm about disparities. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has signaled tax changes are likely to be announced in the city-state\u2019s annual budget on Feb. 18. Read More: What to Expect in Singapore\u2019s Budget The cracks in Singapore\u2019s economic model \u2014 widening wealth inequality and challenges in buying inexpensive housing \u2014 have appeared in many large cities around the world. Covid-19 has only compounded those problems, decimating livelihoods everywhere and pushing as many as 150 million people globally into extreme poverty, according to World Bank estimates. Meanwhile, the collective fortune of the world\u2019s 500 richest people surged by more than US$1 trillion.  \u201cIncome inequality is rising but wealth inequality is probably more glaring, largely because asset values have increased over time,\u201d said Ho Kwon Ping, a local tycoon and former journalist who is regarded as one of Singapore\u2019s public intellectuals. \u201cMeritocracy in Singapore is clearly not a slogan which the power elites only pay lip service to, but social mobility is less than before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government realizes that we need to improve the system.\u201d Signs of Luxury Singapore\u2019s considerable wealth has been built on its status as a stable, open, technologically advanced economy with low taxes. Inheritance, dividends, investment income and capital gains are all untaxed. That\u2019s made it a hub for the world\u2019s richest, from Facebook Inc. co-founder Eduardo Saverin to gaming billionaire Forrest Li. It\u2019s also spawned a local boom in private banking, family offices and asset management. Signs of luxury are everywhere. Sales of high-end bungalows \u2014 the city\u2019s equivalent of mansions \u2014 tripled in 2021, according to Knight Frank Singapore. Golf memberships have jumped 40% from pre-pandemic rates, costing as much as S$350,000 for locals and more for expats.   Story continues Opinion: Will a Wealth Tax Affect Singapore\u2019s Rivalry With Hong Kong?But in 2020, Singapore\u2019s overall median household income fell for the first time in a decade, with the poorest tenth of the population hardest hit. Real incomes declined 6.1% to a median S$560 a month, although those incomes rebounded by 4.7% in 2021.Low-income workers are left struggling to make ends meet. In one recent case, a pest-control technician was jailed after refusing to take a Covid test. He was afraid of having to isolate and lose a S$100 monthly work attendance allowance. The incident prompted Singapore\u2019s President Halimah Yacob \u2014 whose position is largely ceremonial \u2014 to call for better pay at the lower end of the scale.And while the wealthiest amass multiple properties, the poorest residents are often crammed into tiny public housing units.Jalinah Jamaludin lives with her husband and 10 children \u2014 aged between eight and 21 \u2014 in a two-room government rental apartment measuring 410 square feet. The 45-year-old is full-time caregiver to her husband, who is medically unfit to work, so their only income is government assistance of S$1,900 per month. That barely covers their basic needs, she said.\u201cMy husband and I eat once a day so our kids can have more,\u201d she said. She wishes the government would place larger families in bigger rental units.\u201cI stressed to my children that education is very important, that they need to study hard so that they can have good jobs and support the family,\u201d she added. \u201cI can just hope for the best.\u201dClimbing the LadderSince independence in 1965, Singapore\u2019s mantra has been: Work hard and you\u2019ll rise up the ladder. Education and home ownership are seen as the key enablers of class mobility. While the country\u2019s social compact is anchored to individual and family responsibility \u2014 a reflection of Confucian values among a population that is mostly ethnically Chinese \u2014 the government will assist those struggling.Rags-to-riches stories are abundant, historically speaking. Billionaire Goh Cheng Liang, who is 94 years old and one of Singapore\u2019s richest people, started out selling fishing nets and low-quality paint. Education Minister Chan Chung Sing, one of the frontrunners to succeed the prime minister, was raised by a single mother who worked two jobs.For many, the climb seems slower now.Meritocracy \u201cdid work when Singapore was still a developing nation,\u201d said Nydia Ngiow, Singapore-based managing director at strategic policy advisory firm Bower Group Asia. \u201cBut successes are now few and far between, and the field has become more uneven.\u201dEducation has become more widely accessible over time, but also more stratified. Elite schools are located in expensive neighborhoods, and children who live nearby or whose parents are alumni get preferential access. The state\u2019s top scholarships, which lead to guaranteed jobs on graduation, still often go to students from the best schools, although government efforts have helped to diversify the pipeline in recent years.Housing is even more central to financial security. Close to 80% of the population live in government-built flats, which in general are well-maintained, and buying a state-subsidized apartment is a common way into the property market. After a few years, owners can sell at a profit and move into a more valuable home. A government flat \u201cis not just a shelter but also a key investment asset,\u201d as Prime Minister Lee put it in 2010.But skyrocketing prices mean the average private property now costs about 15 times median household earnings, according to DBS Group Research published in October. Middle-class buyers are getting squeezed out, and prices are expected to keep rising.\u201cRising prices have pushed some potential, cash-poor buyers into the rental market,\u201d said Jennifer Chia, a partner at TSMP Law Corp. who heads the firm\u2019s corporate real estate, banking and finance practices. Soaring inflation also makes it difficult for would-be homeowners to save, she added.Divisive FaultlineInequality was a hot-button issue even before the pandemic.A study published in 2017 by the Institute of Policy Studies, a local think-tank, suggested that Singapore\u2019s sharpest social divisions were defined by class rather than race or religion. The following year, research commissioned by OnePeople.sg \u2014 the national body promoting harmony \u2014 also identified class as the nation\u2019s most divisive faultline.Once the pandemic erupted in 2020, the impact on livelihoods was clear. Median household income among applicants seeking financial assistance from local charity Beyond Social Services plunged 69% between April and September 2020, from S$1,600 a month to S$500.Singapore is not without protections for poorer residents. The government spends more than 30% of the annual state budget on affordable education, healthcare and housing. Efforts to make the best schools more accessible include upping the number of places for children with no ties to the schools and abolishing grouping students based on grades. Meanwhile households in one- or two-room government units receive more state assistance than those in larger apartments.But Singapore has several weaknesses that make tackling inequality particularly difficult, said Ng Kok Hoe, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.Public financial assistance, for example, has stringent eligibility criteria and is not enough to meet most people\u2019s basic needs, Ng said.\u201cSupport tends to be ungenerous and strictly targeted. In other words: too little, too late,\u201d he added. He sees \u201cconsiderable room\u201d to increase taxation at the top end.Hard to TrackEstablishment figures have called for more action.\u201cThose who are more affluent should pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said in October, adding that the government was studying wealth-tax options. Central bank chief Ravi Menon has suggested the country shift away from taxing income and towards taxing wealth, highlighting property and inheritance as potential avenues.Even among the city\u2019s wealthiest residents, there are some who are in favor.\u201cWealth taxes globally are very necessary, because it\u2019s not income but wealth inequality which is the most glaring divide between the super rich and the rest of the world,\u201d said tycoon Ho, whose Banyan Tree Holdings Ltd. runs luxury hotels and resorts in 28 countries.\u201cThe problem is that our economic policy is based partly on attracting the super-wealthy,\u201d he added. \u201cThe challenge is how to extract more from them without scaring them away.\u201dPrime Minister Lee has also pointed out that wealth is harder to track than income.\u201cIt\u2019s amorphous, you can squeeze it here and it pops up in different forms elsewhere,\u201d he said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in November.\u201cWe need to find a system of taxation which is progressive and which people will accept as fair,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFair means everybody needs to pay some. But if you\u2019re able to pay more, well, you should bear a larger burden.\u201dThe government hasn\u2019t endorsed measures like a minimum wage, which is supported by the main opposition Workers\u2019 Party. Instead, it favours what it calls a \u201cprogressive wage model,\u201d which targets sectors like the cleaning industry and allows workers to earn higher salaries as they upgrade skills.How to Tax WealthOpinions differ on how Singapore might tax wealth.Ideas floated in recent months include duties on inheritance or a luxury home tax similar to the one proposed in the U.K. Jamus Lim, a Workers\u2019 Party member who is also an economist at the Essec Business School near Paris, has proposed a tax of 0.5% on net wealth in excess of US$10 million, rising to 2% for wealth above US$1 billion.Wealth taxes tend not to contribute significantly to state coffers, though. Switzerland\u2019s version only generates about 3.5% of government revenue \u2014 the highest proportion among countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.A similar tax rate in Singapore would generate about S$2.7 billion in government revenue \u2014 roughly one-seventh of the corporate income tax receipts expected in fiscal year 2021, said Christopher Gee, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies where he leads the governance and economy department.Nonetheless, a similar tax in Singapore could still fund spending in key areas such as climate change mitigation or supporting an ageing populace, Gee said.It would also signal a willingness to narrow the wealth gap, said Donald Low, a former senior civil servant in Singapore who is now a professor at the Institute of Public Policy of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\u201cRaising revenue is not the main objective of having wealth taxes \u2014 at least not in Singapore\u2019s case,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, it is to signal a commitment to social equity.\u201dEven with higher taxes, Singapore has a lot to offer wealthy people, especially from other parts of Asia. Political turmoil and harsh Covid restrictions are drastically reducing the appeal of Hong Kong, Singapore\u2019s key regional rival for talent and capital. Meanwhile China\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d drive is making wealthy businesspeople uneasy.\u201cIntroducing low and simple wealth taxes will hardly dent Singapore\u2019s value proposition to the global elite,\u201d Low said. \u201cOn the contrary, not doing so is to leave money on the table. We\u2019re giving too much away to attract rich people to Singapore.\u201d\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.

Lim Hee Liat, the former executive chairman and founding shareholder of Kimly, has pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD). Kimly\u2019s former executive director, Vincent Chia Cher Kiang, has likewise pleaded guilty to the charges against him by the CAD.  The charges levelled against Lim and Chia were in relation to Kimly\u2019s failure to notify the Singapore Exchange (SGX) that its acquisition of Asian Story Corporation was an interested person transaction (IPT). As such transactions were required to be announced immediately, Kimly was deemed to have committed an offence under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). Lim and Chia have both resigned as directors of Kimly on Nov 11, 2021. According to court documents released on Feb 16, Lim and Chia were slapped with fines of $150,000 and $100,000 respectively by the state courts on the same day. Both were disqualified from acting as directors of any company for a period of five years. Despite the CAD charge, analysts from RHB Group Research and DBS Group Research remained buoyant on the counter, according to their reports released in November 2021. RHB analyst Jarick Seet even views the case as no longer being an overhang factor, and that the eventual closure of the CAD case will be positive for Kimly in the long term. Shares in Kimly closed flat at 40 cents on Feb 16.

(PHOTO: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images By Danny Lee (Bloomberg) \u2014 One of the last air links between two key Asian financial hubs has been severed, with Hong Kong banning Singapore Airlines Ltd.\u2019s budget carrier Scoot from flying to the city for two weeks after passengers tested positive for Covid on arrival. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines services from Amsterdam are also prohibited from Feb. 21 to March 6, Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Health said in a statement Monday evening. The ban was imposed after a passenger on a Feb. 18 flight tested positive on arrival in Hong Kong, while two others failed to comply with travel requirements.  Scoot confirmed its daily TR980 flight from Singapore to Hong Kong has been suspended. The Hong Kong government said four Scoot passengers tested positive within the seven-day period of Feb. 13 to 19. A Feb. 22 service by Cathay Pacific Ltd.\u2019s HK Express unit is now the sole flight from Singapore to Hong Kong remaining this month. The route was one of the busiest in the world before the pandemic hit. Singapore Airlines was on Feb. 16 blocked for two weeks from flying to Hong Kong, which has become increasingly cut off as it tries to gain control of its worst outbreak since the pandemic began. More than 7,500 new cases were reported Monday and the government is considering tighter social-distancing measures. Cathay operated one flight to and from Singapore in February and has just one next month, on March 19, its website showed. That\u2019s in stark contrast to the 252 monthly flights scheduled pre-pandemic, according to previously published timetables. Air travel in and out of Hong Kong continues to be challenging. Hong Kong has banned flights from nine countries including the U.K. and U.S. as well as transit travel from everywhere except Taiwan and mainland China. Most people who manage to get into the city face two weeks mandatory hotel quarantine. \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg L.P.

(PHOTO: Screenshot/MCI YouTube channel)   SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore's goods and services tax (GST) will be raised from next year, and it will be staggered out in two steps: from 7 to 8 per cent on 1 January 2023, and from 8 to 9 per cent on 1 January 2024. Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced the hike during his Budget speech on Friday (18 February), and said that the revenue from the GST hike will go towards supporting Singapore's healthcare expenditure and to take care of the senior citizens.  \"I have carefully considered the overall situation: the ongoing (COVID-19) pandemic, the state of our economy, and the outlook for inflation. Our revenue needs are pressing, but I also understand the concerns that Singaporeans had about the GST increase taking place at the same time as rising prices,\" he said. \"Therefore I have decided to delay the GST increase to 2023 and to stagger the increase over two steps.\" Measures to cushion GST hike To cushion the impact of the GST hike on Singaporeans, Wong announced an additional top up of $640 million to the $6 billion Assurance Package announced by his predecessor, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, in Budget 2020. The Assurance Package unveiled by Heng provided all adult Singaporeans with cash payouts of between $700 and $1,600 over five years, so most households will get enough to offset at least five years' worth of additional GST expenses. The new $6.6 billion package unveiled by Wong will now provide these payouts:  Cash payout - $700 to $1,600 for every Singaporean aged 21 and above over the next five years. U-Save rebates - $330 to $570 additional U-Save rebates for eligible households over the next four years. GST voucher (Seniors\u2019 Bonus) - $600 to $900 cash payout for eligible seniors aged 55 and above over the next three years. MediSave top-ups - $450 top-up over the next three years for Singaporean children aged 20 and below and seniors aged 55 and above. CDC vouchers - $400 vouchers ($200 each in 2023 and 2024) for all Singaporean households.  The government will also be providing more permanent support by enhancing the GST Voucher scheme in three ways: Service and conservancy charges rebate will be made a permanent component of the scheme. The assessable income threshold for GST vouchers will increase from $28,000 to $34,000 to cover more Singaporeans. Higher cash payouts: Those residing in homes with annual values of below $13,000 will see cash payouts increase from $300 to $500 by 2023. Those residing in homes with annual values between $13,000 and $21,000 will see payouts increase from $150 to $250.    Story continues GST hike held off last year amid COVID-19 pandemicThe GST hike was announced by DPM Heng in 2018. The increase was held off last year as Singapore grappled with COVID-19, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated in his New Year message that the Government will have to \"start moving\" on the hike as the economy emerges from the pandemic.The GST was introduced in 1994 as part of a shift from direct taxes to indirect ones to boost Singapore's international competitiveness. It was first raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent over 2003 and 2004 - by one percentage point at a time - and then to 7 per cent in 2007.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The assurance package meant to cushion the impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike has been increased to $6.6 billion, following Finance Minister Lawrence Wong\u2019s announcement of an additional $640 million injection to the package.  The enhanced assurance package will provide significant payouts to Singaporeans over the next five years, said Wong during his speech. Every adult Singaporean will receive cash payouts totalling $700 to $1,600. Eligible seniors will receive a special GST Voucher (GSTV) \u2013 Cash (Seniors\u2019 Bonus) totalling $600 to $900, while eligible HDB households will receive additional U-Save rebates totalling $330 to $570, depending on flat type. All Singaporean children and seniors will receive MediSave top-ups totalling $450, while all Singaporean households will receive two tranches of Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers worth $200 each in 2023 and 2024. The vouchers can be used at all participating heartland merchants and hawkers, as well as major supermarkets. \u201cFor the majority of Singaporean households, the offsets from the assurance package will cover at least five years of additional GST expenses. For lower-income households they will receive more, with offsets covering about 10 years worth of additional GST expenses,\u201d said Wong.  To further support vulnerable households, the government will top up the CCCs ComCare Fund by $5 million over five years, aside from a $12 million provision to self-help groups over four years. The GSTV scheme which currently has three components \u2014 cash payout, MediSave top-up and utilities rebates will be enhanced in three ways. The service and conservancy charges rebate will be made a permanent component of the GSTV scheme, the assessable income threshold for the GTSV cash will be increased from $28,000 to $34,000, and the quantum of the GSTV will be increased. The GSTV cash payout will be increased to $500 for those residing in homes with annual values of $13,000 and below. For those residing in homes with annual values between $13,000 to $21,000, the payout will be $250. \u201cThe enhanced permanent GSTV scheme will provide continuing offsets for the GST expenses of lower to middle-income households and most retiree households beyond the transitional period covered by the assurance package,\u201d said Wong.  He added that the enhanced GSTV will fully offset the total GST that retiree households living in one to 4-room HDB flats have to pay. \u201cMany retiree households and bigger flats will also have the GST offset by a significant amount. For low-income households who do not have elderly members, the GSTV will offset about half their total GST expenses every year,\u201d   Story continues Both the assurance package and the enhanced permanent GSTV scheme will be implemented together before the GST rate increase.\u201cBesides the offsets in the assurance package, the permanent GSTV ensures that [low-income households] will receive significant support on a continuing basis. This is why the GST increase will not hurt low-income households.

Here's what investors should keep in mind if the Ukraine situation erupts. Our government trade tracker caught Pelosi\u2019s 169% AI winner. Discover how to track all 535 Congress member stock trades today.\r\nInvestors have been monitoring developments in Ukraine on a daily basis for several weeks. The Russia-Ukraine turmoil has weighed on the market in recent weeks, sending the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY down 10% year to date.\nInvestors can look back at previous periods of U.S. wars for a potential gauge of what to expect if the U.S. gets involved in the Ukraine conflict in a significant way.\nWar On Terror: The most recent example of an unexpected U.S. military conflict came during and after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. In the two years following the attack, the U.S. launched large-scale military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the stock market struggled.\n\nFrom Sept. 10, 2001 to Sept 10, 2003, the S&P 500 dropped 7.4% overall. Tech sector stocks were hit particularly hard. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK dropped 12.9% during that two-year stretch, but some tech stocks got hit particularly hard. For example, shares of chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation NVDA dropped 66% in the two years following the Sept. 11 attacks.\nNot surprisingly, a handful of defense and aerospace stocks performed extremely well during the early years of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. During a weak period for the market overall, shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT jumped 33.7% in the two years following the Sept. 11 attacks.\nAnalysis: Are US Sanctions Against Putin Too Weak? Or Does Biden Have A Secret Cyber Plan In Waiting?\nPrevious U.S. Conflicts: The good news for investors is that it's certainly no guarantee that war means stock prices will fall.\n\nDuring World War II from Sept. 1, 1939 to Aug. 31, 1945, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 50%, or roughly a 7% annual return.\nDuring the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War from March 1965 to March 1973, the S&P 500 gained a modest 29.1%.\n\nOf course, there are several unique aspects of the conflict in Ukraine that make this situation different than during past wars. Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer, and the U.S. and other nations around the world would almost certainly leverage economic sanctions against Russia if it were to launch a full-scale invasion.\nThose sanctions could threaten the global oil supply, sending energy prices higher. A full-scale Ukrainian conflict could also further disrupt global supply chains that have already been hurt by the pandemic. Supply chain issues are already partly to blame for historically high food price inflation.\nBenzinga's Take: One way to play defense against market uncertainty is to rotate out of stocks with troubled balance sheets that may have benefited from U.S. pandemic stimulus. Instead, profitable companies with strong balance sheets, valuable brands and U.S.-centered businesses could hold up relatively well during times of war.\nSPYSPDR S&P 500$567.150.77%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum66.68Growth-Quality-Value-Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewLMTLockheed Martin Corp$467.000.18%NVDANVIDIA Corp$119.51-1.78%XLKSPDR Select Sector Fund - Technology$215.820.88%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Cook\n\n\nFeb 07, 20226:30 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto illustration by Slate.

They find these bright and colorful posts annoying reminders of a game they find uninteresting, too popular, or encouraging self-absorption.\nBut for others, these posts go beyond annoying\u2014they\u2019re inaccessible.\nWhile haters can simply skim past these results, it\u2019s a very different story for someone who uses a screen reader, braille keyboard, or other assistive technology. Assistive technology is designed to interpret digital content for the person using it: for example, screen reader technology (such as VoiceOver, TalkBack, NVDA, and JAWS) reads the content presented on a screen aloud to someone who is blind, has low vision, or is light sensitive.\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, assistive technology users have expressed grievances with emoji-heavy content similar to Wordle\u2019s results. Our feeds were filled with posts laden with the \u201ctriangular flag\u201d emoji last year as people got in on the \u201cred flag\u201d meme, presenting concerns about accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for the Slate Culture Newsletter\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox.\n\n\n\n        Thanks for signing up!

Crystal Preston-Watson, an accessibility engineer and screen reader user, demonstrates how these Wordle results are presented in her feed using TalkBack, the built-in Android screen reader:\n\nThis is quick and dirty so I didn't get time to add captions yet. This was captured on a Pixel 6 with TalkBack. https://t.co/FMBPM4gXps pic.twitter.com/mZNZ4N6U7Q\u2014 Crystal Preston-Watson (@ScopicEngineer) January 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of a neat visual depiction of a player\u2019s Wordle journey, screen reader users receive a long, indecipherable list of \u201cgreen square,\u201d \u201cyellow square,\u201d and \u201cwhite large square.\u201d Different screen readers may present slight variations on these results depending on their user\u2019s preferences; for example, some screen reader users have set higher speed reading to skim a page. Scott Nixon, an accessibility advocate who uses a screen reader, expressed his annoyance: \u201cThey are horrible and mean nothing. [It] takes my iPhone over a minute to read it, and that\u2019s at 65 speed.\u201d\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          Culture\n        \n\n\n\n\n                        \n            How the Stars of Disney\u2019s New Snow White Managed to Piss Off Almost Literally Everyone\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            Bill Burr Has Never Been Hotter.

It\u2019s Really About Something Else.\n          \n\n\n\n                        \n            Netflix\u2019s New No. 1 Hit Is One of the Best Shows of the Year\n          \n\n\n\nMarian Avery, an accessibility advocate and senior content designer, said that as someone who can\u2019t tell the difference between yellow and green, she only learned there were green squares involved when someone else tweeted their results. \u201cI refuse to go near Wordle because I know it\u2019s even more inaccessible for others,\u201d she said.\nSo we know that Wordle results have accessibility issues. But what do we do about it?\nBefore anyone grabs a torch and pitchfork, we should consider the context in which Wordle came about. Josh Wardle, the software engineer who created Wordle, said he made a prototype in 2013 and dusted it off during the pandemic for his partner, who liked word games. The game has become much bigger than he originally imagined, so he may not have considered the need for accessibility.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the New York Times, which recently acquired Wordle for more than a million dollars, has the resources to improve Wordle\u2019s inclusivity and has made a commitment to inclusion and accessibility. We may expect some changes to come to Wordle and its results.\nUntil then, it is on all of us as players of this game to make sure the content we share is inclusive\u2014after all, part of the fun of Wordle is creating shared experiences with others.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to share a more accessible Wordle score\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of sharing directly from Wordle, share results as an image with alt text as an accessible option. We can use the wa11y.co tool, developed by Cariad Eccleston, to generate descriptive alt text for our results. Here is how:\nCopy score results from Wordle.Paste results into a social media post.Take a screenshot of the Wordle result in the post.Crop the screenshot only to include the Wordle resultsNavigate to wa11y.co, paste in the Wordle score and copy the output.In a new, blank post, add the score screenshot from earlier.Paste the output from wa11y.co as the alt text to the screenshot.\nIf you follow these quick, simple steps, you can ensure everyone can enjoy your content. It is essential that what we build, share, create has accessibility in mind from the start.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Internet Culture\n            \n\n\n              Social Media\n            \n\n\n              Disability\n            \n\n\n              Accessibility\n            \n\n\n              Wordle\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nGroup Subscriptions\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

SoftBank will retain the $1.25 billion that Nvidia had already prepaid to lock in the deal, while Nvidia will retain its 20-year license for Arm's chip designs. SoftBank now plans to spin off Arm in an IPO before the end of March 2023.\nNvidia agreed to buy Arm back in September 2020 to create the \"world's premier computing company for the age of AI.\" It had initially planned to close the deal by September 2021, but a barrage of competitive, regulatory, and internal problems derailed the massive deal. Let's review the three main reasons Nvidia's bid for Arm failed, and how its failure might impact the chipmaker's future.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\n1. Protests from competitors\nArm doesn't produce any chips on its own. Instead, it licenses its low-power chip designs to a wide range of chipmakers, including Nvidia, Qualcomm (QCOM -0.86%), and Apple. Arm-based chips now power approximately 95% of the world's smartphones, and they're gradually creeping into PCs, data centers, and connected cars as well.\nArm is based in England, but it's often referred to as the \"Switzerland of the semiconductor industry\" because it doesn't favor any single chipmaker. SoftBank's takeover of Arm in 2016 sparked a few concerns, but it passed because the Japanese conglomerate didn't produce any chips of its own.\nNvidia, however, produces its own Arm-based CPUs for set-top boxes, gaming consoles, connected cars, and data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying Arm would have granted Nvidia access to advanced Arm designs before other chipmakers, enabled it to block other chipmakers from licensing those designs, and allowed it to license Arm's designs for free. Meanwhile, Nvidia's Arm-based competitors would still have needed to pay royalties and licensing fees to Arm -- so Nvidia could have sold its own Arm-based chips at lower prices while profiting from its direct competitors.\nNvidia repeatedly declared it would maintain Arm's neutrality, but Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google all objected to the deal.\n2. Regulatory headwinds\nThose protests attracted the attention of antitrust regulators in the U.S., the U.K., Europe, and China. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) started investigating the deal last February. Last December, it sued Nvidia to formally block the deal.\nIn the U.K., the deal faced probes from Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the U.K. Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Those investigations led to a deeper national security probe last November. The European Union also launched an investigation into the deal last February, which led to a full-blown antitrust probe last October.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn China, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) also kept the deal in limbo as it weighed the impact of an American chipmaker taking control of Arm's designs, which are widely used by Chinese chipmakers.\nAll those regulatory headwinds indicated that Nvidia had bitten off more than it could chew, and highlighted the importance of Arm remaining neutral and independent from the control of a single chipmaker.\n3. An unresolved legal battle in China\nEven if the regulators had approved Nvidia's takeover of Arm, it would still have needed to resolve a messy executive battle at Arm China, a joint venture that Arm owns a 47% stake in.\nArm China's CEO Allen Wu was ousted in 2020 for allegedly using his position to promote investments in his own firm, Alphatecture. However, Wu refused to leave, and he sued Arm China -- as well as the three executives who were appointed to replace him -- to maintain control of the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftBank's inability to resolve this ugly conflict, along with the regulatory challenges in China, likely contributed to Nvidia's decision to end the deal. SoftBank's unresolved issues with Arm China could also still impact its IPO plans for Arm, since Wu has been blocking Arm from auditing the joint venture.\nWhat does this mean for Nvidia's investors?\nNvidia ultimately wasted $1.25 billion, or 5% of its projected revenue this year, on the deal. That's definitely a setback, but Nvidia's core business still has a bright future without Arm.\nNvidia still controlled 83% of the discrete GPU market in the third quarter of 2021, according to JPR, and that market dominance puts it in a strong position to profit from the secular expansion of the gaming, data center, professional visualization, and cryptocurrency mining markets. Its own Arm-based CPU business also has plenty of room to grow in connected cars, data centers, and popular game consoles like the Nintendo\u00a0Switch.\nThat's why analysts still expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to grow 60% and 74%, respectively, this fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, investors shouldn't fret too much over Nvidia's failure to buy Arm. It will likely allocate that cash toward other investments, acquisitions, buybacks, or higher dividends instead -- and those moves could strengthen its core business while making it more attractive investment for long-term investors.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Whether it was the dire launch that saw Nvidia's own website fail, the Best Buy partnership that hasn't slowed widespread scalping, or easily averted anti-mining limiters introduced mid-2021, Nvidia's decision-making has punished PC gaming enthusiasts most of all. Nvidia has no solutions at hand, unfortunately. What it does have, however, is a new line of RTX 40 Series graphics cards potentially arriving later this year.The speculation stems from recent Twitter messages shared by reliable industry analyst Greymon55. Greymon55 has been hyping the technology behind \"Lovelace,\" Nvidia's assumed codename for the RTX 40 Series graphics cards, for some time. In a recent discussion about Lovelace, Greymon55 was asked when the graphics cards would \"hit ground.\" Greymon55, perhaps surprisingly, responded by confirming that Nvidia's Lovelace RTX 40 Series graphics cards will \"be available in September.\"RELATED: Nvidia and AMD Prices Are Steadily Coming Back DownGreymon55 has set expectations for the Lovelace range of GPUs very high so far. Asked how powerful they expect Lovelace to be, Greymon55 says they expect \"2-2.5x 3090\" in terms of performance, referring to what they believe will be RTX 40 Series counterpart to the RTX 3080, the RTX 4080. Going into further detail about the 4080 chip, which they refer to as the AD102, Greymon55 also tells their followers to start looking at a TGP of up to 850W. That extra performance will come at a hefty power cost. \n\n\n\nIt should be clarified that Greymon55 isn't reporting leaked information or rumors. They state that their tweets are just their own \"thoughts and guesses\" based on information that has been shared within the industry. It's just that they're very in-tune with GPU news and familiar with the industry to a degree that makes their thoughts worth acknowledging.\nWith that in mind, Greymon55 doesn't provide any further elaboration regarding why they believe Nvidia's RTX 40 Series graphics cards will begin to arrive in September. Another industry insider, Kopite7kimi, said in 2021 that they believed the RTX 40 Series cards would arrive in Q3 2022. They said at the time that it wasn't new information, either, so it seems like a poorly kept secret.\nAs for what graphics cards should be expected to be released in September, early predictions are that Nvidia won't deviate from the norm. The RTX 4070, 4080, and 4090 are the three cards that will most likely be released, mirroring the RTX 30 Series launch with the RTX 3070, 3080, and 3090. Whether PC gaming enthusiasts would be able to actually pick one up one of Nvidia's new cards without paying aftermarket prices from scalpers or crypo miners, expectations should probably be set low.\nMORE: GPU Comparison: Nvidia RTX 3050 Vs.

We first covered the deal in September of 2020 in NVIDIA to Acquire Arm in Major Shift. After well over a year of not getting regulatory approval, the deal is now officially off.\nNVIDIA \u2013 Arm Merger Canned and a New Path Forward\nThis is one of those deals that there were certainly two camps on. Many said there would be no way it would go through. Personally, I thought that given a different administration and political atmosphere the deal would have gone through. When I took antitrust in law school, this deal would have gone through. Ultimately what doomed the deal was the political pressure from various governments.\nNVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Architecture And Spec List\nThe path forward for Arm is interesting. Rene Haas is the new CEO of Arm following the failed acquisition. Since Arm is currently owned by SoftBank in Japan, the next step will be to IPO the company to provide an exit for SoftBank. SoftBank will reap a huge windfall and a large part of that is because the markets, in general, have pushed valuations much higher over the past few years. Before going IPO, Arm may need to address its China operation especially since China is such a large market for Arm.\nNVIDIA Grace GTC 2021 CPU And GPU Close Up\nFor NVIDIA, it can still license Arm, but it is now a chip provider without a CPU architecture. Its rivals Intel and AMD have x86 and have Arm licenses. Apple uses its Arm cores with its GPU IP pushing NVIDIA out of that ecosystem. RISC-V is set as a potential disruptor in some markets to Arm\u2019s dominance, but\u00a0Intel just joined RISC-V International and is aggressively focused on that ecosystem building its foundry business. To be clear, NVIDIA does not need a CPU architecture, and it has become an extremely valuable company without one.\nFinal Words\nThe bigger question is what happens next. With the UK pushing against the acquisition of the Japanese-owned Arm that will become something that the US may very well use for the next UK company acquisition. Likewise, China just gave the go-ahead for AMD-Xilinx, but it never gave approval for this deal.\nRene Haas Day 1 Arm CEO\nGoing forward, we expect NVIDIA to push hard on extracting software revenue from the AI ecosystem. MLPerf has taught us that NVIDIA has competition, but a virtual monopoly on a large swath of the AI hardware space. The company\u2019s direction lately has been to introduce software support and features for the enterprise to further increase revenue, at a high margin, without having to ship more GPUs. That is NVIDIA\u2019s key growth driver now as that software push is akin to \u201cWintel\u201d in the late 90\u2019s, except NVIDIA has both the software and the hardware.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSARMNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleIntel joins RISC-V International and Invests Another Billion in FoundryNext articleASUS USB-C2500 2.5GbE USB 3 Adapter Review Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

ARM Global in the UK has cut him off from acquiring anymore IP, but he is using ARM license revenue in China to fund his little escapade and the CCP seems to be permitting this. This is total IP theft and while ARM Global is trying to ban any fabs producing product without a proper license, this guy seems to be \u201cin\u201d with many of the Chinese sourced products that utilize an embedded ARM technology. As long as there is demand in China for this ARM spinoff, he will continue to exist. But his reach outside China will be cutoff eventually by ARM Global.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfuzzyfuzzyfungus\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            February 9, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:42 am                                            \n\n\n\nObviously Nvidia had some sort of bigger plan in mind(whether it be allocating ARM\u2019s R&D to their purposes or doing a little squeezing of everyone who has no realistic short to mid term alternative to licensing ARM cores; which is basically everyone) to offer the downright stratospheric amount of money that they were offering; but in terms of Nvidia\u2019s freedom to implement ARM stuff have they actually lost anything by failing to aquire?\nMy understanding was that Nvidia has been doing fully custom armv8 implementations from Denver through Carmel, which implies that they have the highest level of flexibility in terms of what they can do with the ISA; and they enjoy the right to license whatever bits of ARM IP that are for sale to anyone on the same terms as the rest of the market.\nIt seems as though Nvidia has lost any exclusivity-based plays; but that they still enjoy full freedom of action in terms of ARM implementations. Am I missing or misunderstanding a detail?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomih\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            February 12, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:11 pm                                            \n\n\n\n@fuzzyfuzzyfungus\nNVidia valuation is $618 billion.

This would make it the largest GPU ever produced, not only on the 5nm process node but also in all existence. But that's not all, now a new rumor has popped up over at Chiphell Forums which alleges that the GPU could feature over 140 Billion transistors.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostWell, just how much are 140 Billion transistors? For comparison, the current flagship data center chips such as AMD's Aldebaran for Instinct MI200 series and NVIDIA Ampere GA100 for the A100 accelerators feature just 58.2 and 54.2 Billion transistors, respectively. That's almost a 2.5x overall transistor count bump for the Hopper GH100 GPU if the rumor holds true.\n\nIn terms of density, the NVIDIA Ampere A100 amounts to 65.6M transistors per mm2, while the Aldebaran GPU (based on its speculated die size of 790mm2) should have a density of 73.6M transistors per mm2. Assuming that the GH100 measures around 900mm2, its density should easily cross 150M transistors per mm2. That's more than twice the density increase on the 5nm process node.\nBut once again, these are all rumored figures and will only be applicable to the monolithic GH100 Hopper GPU. The MCM GPU is an entirely separate entity based on rumors and will come as the GH102 GPU. We don't know the exact specifications except what research papers & rumors have told us. But all in all, the NVIDIA Hopper GPU, both, in its monolithic and MCM form, will offer a serious increase in transistor count and feature advanced 5nm packaging solutions.\nNVIDIA Hopper GPU - Everything We Know So Far\nFrom previous information, we know that NVIDIA's GH100 accelerator would be based on TSMC's 5nm process node. Hopper is supposed to have two next-gen GPU modules so we are looking at 288 SM units in total.\nWe can't give a rundown on the core count yet since we don't know the number of cores featured in each SMs but if it's going to stick to 64 cores per SM, then we get 18,432 cores which are 2.25x more than the full GA100 GPU configuration. NVIDIA could also leverage more FP64, FP16 & Tensor cores within its Hopper GPU which would drive up performance immensely. And that's going to be a necessity to rival Intel's Ponte Vecchio which is expected to feature 1:1 FP64.\n\nIt is likely that the final configuration will come with 134 of the 144 SM units enabled on each GPU module and as such, we are likely looking at a single GH100 die in action. But it is unlikely that NVIDIA would reach the same FP32 or FP64 Flops as MI200's without using GPU Sparsity.\nBut NVIDIA may likely have a secret weapon in their sleeves and that would be the COPA-based GPU implementation of Hopper. NVIDIA talks about two Domain-Specialized COPA-GPUs based on next-generation architecture, one for HPC and one for DL segment. The HPC variant features a very standard approach which consists of an MCM GPU design and the respective HBM/MC+HBM (IO) chiplets but the DL variant is where things start to get interesting.\u00a0 The DL variant houses a huge cache on an entirely separate die that is interconnected with the GPU modules.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nLLC Capacity\nDRAM BW\nDRAM Capacity\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n(MB)\n(TB/s)\n(GB)\n\n\nGPU-N\n60\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-1\n960\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-2\n960\n4.5\n167\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-3\n1,920\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-4\n1,920\n4.5\n167\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-5\n1,920\n6.3\n233\n\n\nPerfect L2\ninfinite\ninfinite\ninfinite\n\n\n\n\nVarious variants have been outlined with up to 960 / 1920 MB of LLC (Last-Level-Cache), HBM2e DRAM capacities of up to 233 GB, and bandwidth of up to 6.3 TB/s. These are all theoretical but given that NVIDIA has discussed them now, we may likely see a Hopper variant with such a design during the full unveil at GTC 2022.\nNVIDIA Hopper GH100 'Official Specs':\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardTesla K40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla V100 (SXM2)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)\n\n\n\n\nGPUGK110 (Kepler)GM200 (Maxwell)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GV100 (Volta)GA100 (Ampere)GH100 (Hopper)GH100 (Hopper)\n\n\nProcess Node28nm28nm16nm16nm12nm7nm4nm4nm\n\n\nTransistors7.1 Billion8 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion21.1 Billion54.2 Billion80 Billion80 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die Size551 mm2601 mm2610 mm2610 mm2815mm2826mm2814mm2814mm2\n\n\nSMs1524565680108114132\n\n\nTPCs1524282840545766\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SM19212864646464128128\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SM64432323232128128\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores2880307235843584512069121459216896\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores9609617921792256034561459216896\n\n\nTensor CoresN/AN/AN/AN/A640432456528\n\n\nTexture Units240192224224320432456528\n\n\nBoost Clock875 MHz1114 MHz1329MHz1480 MHz1530 MHz1410 MHzTBDTBD\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)N/AN/AN/AN/A125 TOPs1248 TOPs\n2496 TOPs with Sparsity1600 TOPs\n3200 TOPs2000 TOPs\n4000 TOPs\n\n\nFP16 ComputeN/AN/A18.7 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs312 TFLOPs\n624 TFLOPs with Sparsity1600 TFLOPs2000 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP32 Compute5.04 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs19.4 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs With Sparsity800 TFLOPs1000 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute1.68 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)48 TFLOPs60 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR54096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM26144-bit HBM2e5120-bit HBM2e5120-bit HBM3\n\n\nMemory Size12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 80 GB HBM2e @  2.0 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @  3.0 Gbps\n\n\nL2 Cache Size1536 KB3072 KB4096 KB4096 KB6144 KB40960 KB51200 KB51200 KB\n\n\nTDP235W250W250W300W300W400W350W700W\n\n\n\nNews Source: HXL (@9550pro)\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n81\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n18\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

In a twist of fate, the ransomware group that has claimed responsibility for the attack has now been hacked themselves. \nNvidia has reported a cyberattack recently that has left its development tools and its email systems \"completely compromised.\" The company is still investigating the attack with not much information released about it up to this point in time This is not the first time something like this has happened to Nvidia since it had its GeForce Now data leaked last year, but it is still a worrying situation.\nRELATED: Nvidia Spending Billions to Secure Components for 4000 Series\nThe ransomware group calling itself \"Lapsus\" has claimed responsibility for the attack. Lapsus has posted screenshots and threatened to release proprietary source code and directory listings if Nvidia doesn't pay up. In the wake of this, Lapsus has now experienced its own ransomware attack that it is blaming on Nvidia, as if the company has done it in retaliation. It hasn't been confirmed nor denied that Nvidia was behind the counter-hack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter data leaked from GeForce Now such as Sony AAA game titles that could be involved, this kind of attack is something unfortunately familiar to Nvidia and the tech industry at large. However, it's very rare to see ransomware hackers that take responsibility for cyberattacks being given a taste of its own medicine.\nTo some, it may be oddly satisfying to hear about an instance of a ransomware group that has already held a big company to ransom after a cyberattack being hacked themselves. Hackers are very destructive in the gaming and tech worlds alike, even causing a site like Koei Tecmo's to shut down amid its own attack. Groups like this can do things that sometimes not even the most effective security cannot anticipate.\nNvidia has been focused on launching its new GTX 40 Series GPUs, therefore the possible use of hacking as a countermeasure to protect that data might not be out of the question, though indeed out of character. However, the company would arguably be stooping down to Lapsus' level if Nvidia had actually hacked the ransomware group as a countermeasure. It's unlikely it did, but cyber attacking hackers can sometimes lead to even worse retaliation from said hackers such as fighting fire with fire and starting an all-out war. The fact that Lapsus even found a way to get into Nvidia's systems, a company that is big enough to have loads of cybersecurity, means that it's unprecedented what it could do to make things worse for the corporation and its employees.

Try maneuvering a Kenyan minibus through traffic or dropping seed balls on deforested landscapes.\nOr download Africa\u2019s Legends and battle through fiendishly difficult puzzles with Ghana\u2019s Ananse or Nigeria\u2019s Oya by your side.\nGames like these are connecting with a hyper-connected African youth population that\u2019s growing fast.\nAfrica is the youngest region in the world.\nSixty percent of the continent\u2019s population is under 25, and by 2030 the UN predicts the youth population to Africa will increase by 42 percent.\nDisposable incomes are rising and high-speed internet connections are proliferating, too.\nAfrica is projected to have more than 680 million mobile phone users by the end of 2025, driving a surge in the number of gamers.\nAcross the region 177 million or 95 percent of gamers use mobile devices.\nAs a result Africa is the fastest-growing region for mobile game downloads, according to mobile insights firm App Annie.\nKenya\u2019s Usiku Games and Ghana\u2019s Leti Arts are among the new generation of African game developers who are pioneering games that connect with the experiences, challenges and histories of these gamers.\nEach is developing mobile games aimed at educating youth on a continent where 41 percent of the population is under 15.\nAnd more are coming: in January, South African startup Carry1st raised $20 million from marquee investors such as Andreesen Horowitz and Google for a mobile game publishing platform targeting the African market.\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be better. Market research firm Mordor Intelligence expects gaming revenue on the continent to grow at a 12 percent annual rate through 2026 compared to 9.6 percent for the entire world.\nA Path for Africa\u2019s Gaming Developers\nAs creators of Okoa Simba, the first game developed in Kenya to be published globally, Nairobi-based Usiku Games believes it can serve as a role model for future game developers in Africa.\nUsiku Games is determined to reach younger audiences with educational messages that are embedded within compelling games and animations.\n\u201cOur games directly influence the knowledge and behavior of youth on topics such as gender-based violence, mental health, sexual and reproductive health, education, and peaceful resolution of conflicts,\u201d said Usiku Games founder and CEO Jay Shapiro.\nOne of its projects includes working in Unreal Engine with NVIDIA technologies to create a 3D game focused on HIV prevention and contraception for teen girls.\n\n\u201cFor game developers such as myself, this is about making something that will capture the imagination and inspire vulnerable youth in Africa, and all parts of the world,\u201d said Shapiro, a Toronto native, who has lived in Singapore, New York, Mexico and Cambodia. \u201cI want to\u00a0 create rich, visually compelling stories that impact and serve the next generation.\u201d\nCreating Visual Stories With NVIDIA GPUs\nAs the first gaming studio in Ghana, Leti Arts, founded in 2009, uses NVIDIA GPUs to help build mobile games and digital comics based on African history and folklore.\n\u201cGames with African settings made by Africans are the best way to cultivate a sense of cultural authenticity,\u201d said Leti co-founder and CEO Eyram Tawia.\nA comic and computer game enthusiast since junior high school, Tawia, a Mandela Washington Fellow, the flagship program of the U.S. Government\u2019s Young African Leaders Initiative, wanted to turn the stories he\u2019d heard and drawn as a child into immersive experiences.\n\u201cArt and culture contribute just as much to an economy as jobs,\u201d Tawia said . \u201cThey help increase a community\u2019s social capital, attracting talent, growth and innovation.\u201d\nThe nine-person company\u2019s most successful games include Africa\u2019s Legends (2014) and The Hottseat (2019).\nThe long-term vision for Leti Arts is to make games from Africa for the world. Tawia says the high quality of its games enables gamers to better relate with the games and content being produced.\nThe continent is home to a growing number of game studios. In addition to Usiku Games and Leti Arts they include Maliyo Games, Kirro Games, Kayfo Games and others.\nMore games, and game developers, are coming. Tawia and Leti Arts have worked to mentor talent through internships, boot camps and workshops.\nLast year Leti trained and supported over 30 game developers in partnership with\u00a0 ITTHYK Gaming and sponsored by Microsoft.\nTolo Sagala is the heroine of Leti Arts\u2019 \u201cAfrica\u2019s Legends \u2013 The Game.\u201d\nExpanding the Omniverse\nBoth Usiku and Leti Arts, which are members of NVIDIA Inception, a global program designed to nurture cutting-edge startups, are also exploring NVIDIA Omniverse for real-time 3D design collaboration, AI-powered animation and game development.\nWith Africa\u2019s gaming industry worth well over half a billion dollars in 2021, investments are also booming for African gaming startups.\n\u201cAs Africa\u2019s demand for local and regional gaming content grows, more startups are entering this space,\u201d said Kate Kallot, head of Emerging Areas at NVIDIA.\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s gaming landscape is punctuated by a growing base of startups and studios who are challenging the norms of traditional games, and their impact is anticipated to reach well beyond the continent itself to other game developers and audiences.\u201d\nLearn more about Leti Arts and Usiku Games, among others, by catching up on our GTC session focused on the African gaming industry.\u00a0\nAnd check out\u00a0 entrepreneur and Leti Arts founder Eyram Tawia\u2019s book, \u201cUncompromising Passion: The Humble Beginnings of an African Game Industry\u201d (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2016).\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Game Development | Gaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Hitting Mesa 22.1-devel today is the most notable driver work we've seen in years for the open-source NV30 and NV40 (GeForce 6 / 7 series) graphics cards.\r With the latest Mesa code, the NV30/NV40 open-source Gallium3D driver is now making use of the NIR-to-TGSI path by default. This allows making use of the NIR intermediate representation through more of the internal driver handling before going back to the TGSI IR that is then used by the shader compiler -- a step short of adapting rewriting the driver to use NIR itself.\rThe GeForce 5/FX through GeForce 7 series are affected by this NIR-to-TGSI change in the Nouveau NV30 driver code. Utilizing NIR allows for benefiting from more of the common optimizations shared among the newer graphics drivers and all-around is much better optimized and suited these days than TGSI as the original Gallium3D IR. It was last year Radeon's R300 driver added NIR-to-TGSI too.\r Both last year's R300 NIR-to-TGSI work as well as this NV30 driver activity was handled by longtime Mesa developer Emma Anholt. The modern Mesa GPU drivers all go for NIR and with more of these vintage, seldom-maintained drivers moving to NIR-to-TGSI, it may allow for more code clean-ups and improvements to the code-base moving forward.\rNVIDIA's Nalu promotional material from back in the GeForce 6 days. With the change to use NIR-to-TGSI by default, there still is a debug option for using just TGSI if wanting to compare the performance or bisect regressions. When testing with Shader-DB, using NIR-to-TGSI led to around 13% less instructions needing to be generated for NV30 GPUs and around a 12% savings for NV30. GPR register use in affected shader programs were also around 25% less with using NIR-to-TGSI. A very nice win and incremental improvement for this older Nouveau driver code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorFeb 28, 2022, 02:41pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.The hacking group LAPSUS$, which is claiming responsibility for compromising Nvidia servers and stealing over 1TB of data last week, has issued it's ransom demand: Remove the mining hashrate limiters on the company's RTX 3000-series graphics cards.\nHacking group behind Nvidia attack demands hashrate limits be removed on RTX 3000-series graphics ... [+] cards. KATWIJK, NETHERLANDS - JANUARY 3: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of digital cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is arranged on a circuit board of a hard drive on January 3, 2021 in Katwijk, Netherlands.  (Photo by Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nNvidia introduced limiters on cards sold after the launch of the RTX 3060, which was the first to introduce a limiter, although that was circumvented with a leaked driver. Since then, though, all Nvidia third party RTX 3000-series cards have had hashrate limiters employed that hard-lock mining performance at around half what the card could usually do.\n\nThese light hashrate or LHR cards were an attempt to increase cards available for gamers during the peak of the pandemic, with many being snapped up for crypto mining, specifically for Ethereum currency. Combined with the microchip shortage, graphics cards have had poor availability and high prices in general, but miners have received the lion's share of the blame.\n\nNvidia's RTX 3000-series cards have been highly sought after for crypto mining but the inbtroduction ... [+] of hashrate limiters made them less attractiveAntony Leather\nIn the large data trove stolen by the group, is what they claim is a full LHR unlock, which the group will make available for sale. This wouldn't likely worry Nvidia from most angles and certainly wouldn't hurt sales, but in addition, if Nvidia fails to comply, it will also release a 'hw folder'. This, according to the group, contains potentially sensitive and valuable information.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\n\n\nThis comes a week after another supposed unlocking tool was released, which turned out to be full of malware. This time, things could turn out differently and the hakc on Nvidia's servers was widely reported.\n\nGraphics card prices are beginning to fall after two years of record prices putting them out of reach for many, with AMD suffering similar issues with its Radeon graphics cards. If an LHR removal tool is created, it could set things back significantly, but also see significant increases in Ethereum mining hashrates if RTX 3000-series cards with the LHR limiter are suddenly unleashed.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The AMD Radeon graphics cards are currently priced at an average of 45% over MSRP, a drop from 63% last month while the NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards are priced at 57% MSRP versus last month's 77% price hike.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power EfficiencyAMD Radeon & NVIDIA GeForce graphics card prices hit their lowest in 2022 as GPU availability improves. (Image Credits: 3DCenter)\nBut it's not just prices that have improved, as you can see from the monthly chart shared by 3DCenter, the availability of GPUs and the respective graphics cards is now at its best since the start of 2021 & continues to improve. In Europe, particularly, almost all stores are stocked with graphics cards in good quantities which means that the only issue that is as of right now is the prices and that, as mentioned above, seems to be improving too.\nAMD Radeon RX 6000 Series Graphics Card Prices (RDNA 2 GPUs) via 3DCenter:\n\n\n\n\n6500XT\n6600\n6600XT\n6700XT\n6800\n6800XT\n6900XT\n\n\n\n\nmiser\n244-370\u20ac\n455-644\u20ac\n\u20ac529-737\n779-1078\u20ac\n1049-1439\u20ac\n1149-1547\u20ac\n1398-1799\u20ac\n\n\nalternates\n249-379\u20ac\n469-509\u20ac\n\u20ac579-619\n\u20ac849-999\n1099\u20ac\n1239-1299\u20ac\n1489-1699\u20ac\n\n\nCaseking\n273-328\u20ac\n504\u20ac\n623-737\u20ac\n817-1269\u20ac\n1142-1147\u20ac\n1198-1471\u20ac\n1549-1845\u20ac\n\n\ncomputer universe\n279-350\u20ac\nN/A\n\u20ac599-723\n\u20ac860-999\nN/A\n1449\u20ac\n1499-1729\u20ac\n\n\nHardwarecamp24\n266\u20ac\n479-519\u20ac\n549-594\u20ac\n\u20ac806-969\nN/A\n1239-1289\u20ac\n1419-1489\u20ac\n\n\nmedia market\n276-319\u20ac\nN/A\n619-669\u20ac\n829-920\u20ac\n1159-1229\u20ac\n1299\u20ac\n1499-1639\u20ac\n\n\nMindfactory\n244-308\u20ac\n455-559\u20ac\n\u20ac529-603\n789-860\u20ac\n1069-1129\u20ac\n1149-1280\u20ac\n1398-1499\u20ac\n\n\nnotebooks cheaper\n259-319\u20ac\n469-519\u20ac\n589-649\u20ac\n\u20ac779-999\n1049-1195\u20ac\n1179-1269\u20ac\n1449-1699\u20ac\n\n\nPro Shop\n320-370\u20ac\nN/A\nN/A\n949-1029\u20ac\n1299-1399\u20ac\n1599-1699\u20ac\n1599-1799\u20ac\n\n\nList Price\n$199\n$329\n$379\n$479\n$579\n$649\n$999\n\n\nSurcharge\nfrom\u00a0+17%\nfrom\u00a0+32%\nfrom\u00a0+33%\nfrom\u00a0+55%\nfrom\u00a0+73%\nfrom\u00a0+69%\nfrom\u00a0+33%\n\n\nChange as of 22nd January\n\u201326PP\n\u201316PP\n\u201318PP\n\u201318PP\n\u201325PP\n\u201319PP\n-10PP\n\n\nAvailability\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to AMD Radeon graphics cards, the RX 6000 series lineup is now available at better prices than the GeForce parts.

The GeForce RTX 3050, the most recent launch, currently sits at 49% over MSRP. A detailed video by Moore's Law is Dead highlights the whole pricing situtation:\n\nNow it needs to be remembered that the previous major price hike and price drop that we saw last year was purely a result of the mining boom and mining crash, respectively. The same is happening right now and while mining did get pretty significant earlier this month, it is rebounding and GPU prices are expected to go up with manufacturers expected to hike the prices by another 10-20% for high-end components. As such, we should wait and see if this price adjustment continues or we see another price inflation moving into mid of 2022.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n100\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

NVIDIA announced the deal in 2020, and since then it faced significant regulatory scrutiny all over the world as bodies raised concerns about the impact of the acquisition on market competition. Rumors that NVIDIA's management had canceled their bid surfaced before the company's earnings call yesterday, and at the event, NVIDIA's chief executive officer Mr. Jen-Hsun Huang and its chief financial officer Ms. Collette Kress shared their take on the affair. Mr. Huang, who did not hold back previously of his praise of Arm's business model, had few words to say about the deal, while Ms. Kress described the impact the fall through would have on her company's earnings for the ongoing quarter.\nNVIDIA Chief 'Appreciates' Regulatory Concerns For Arm Merger & Expresses Optimism For His Company's Datacenter Effort\nBefore Mr. Huang and Ms. Kress shared their take on the deal's termination, NVIDIA provided a brief summary of the impact that the affair will have on its income statement for its ongoing quarter. This was in the form of a brief note made in its CFO commentary that the company shares with investors at every earnings report event.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM MemoryThis document stated that:\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp. (SoftBank) announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge (the Arm Write-off) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.\nFollowing the earnings release, Mr. Huang delivered his pre-prepared remarks for the termination at the earnings call. These were rather muted in nature and attempted to keep a positive spin on the effort despite the impact it will have on NVIDIA's cash flows.\nNVIDIA Corporation's depiction of its Cambridge-1 Artificial Intelligence Supercomputer announced at the same time as the Arm acquisition. The Cambridge-1 will be located in the United Kingdom, with NVIDIA investing ~$52 million in the system aimed at helping drug companies leverage modern day computing in their research efforts. Image: NVIDIA Corporation\nMr. Huang stated at the event that:\nThanks, Colette. Last week, we terminated our efforts to purchase Arm. When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believed that would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all our customers in the entire ecosystem. Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide.\nWe appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong, and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal. NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before.\nOur focus is accelerated computing. We are on track to launch our Arm-based CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads in the first half of next year. Our 20-year architectural license to Arm's IP allows us the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets. We will deliver on our three-chip strategy across CPUs, GPUs, and DPUs.\nWhether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job. And together with partners in the computer industry, offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time. Back to you, Colette.\n\nMs. Kress then shred details about NVIDIA's operating expenses for the current quarter, the bulk of which will now be affected by the termination. She stated that the expenses, which represent direct and indirect costs incurred by a company for conducting business, should be around $3.55 billion, out of which $1.36 billion will be the termination payment made to Arm. In other words, 38% of the non-product, non-interest and non-tax expenses that NVIDIA will incur in the ongoing quarter will be due to the fact that it failed to secure regulatory approval for what would have been one of the biggest deals in the history of the semiconductor industry.\nLater during the call, Mr. Huang reiterated his company's plans to diversify NVIDIA from a company that primarily designs and sells graphics processing units (GPUs) to a firm that has a presence in a variety of industries such as robotics, automotive, cloud computing, data centers and other applications. Wall Street expects the company to significantly grow its revenue this year and touch $35 billion by January next year.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n153\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n108\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Our class\u2011leading Jaguars and Land Rovers are in demand around the world and in Fiscal 2020/21 we sold 439,588 vehicles in 127 countries. Land Rover is the global leader of luxury SUVs through its three families of Range Rover, Discovery and Defender. Jaguar is the first ever brand to offer a premium all\u2011electric performance SUV, the Jaguar I\u2011PACE. \nAt heart we are a British company, with two major design and engineering sites, three vehicle manufacturing facilities, an Engine Manufacturing Centre and a Battery Assembly Centre in the UK. We also have vehicle plants in China, Brazil, India, Austria and Slovakia. Three of our seven technology hubs are in the UK \u2013 Manchester, Warwick (NAIC) and London \u2013 with additional sites in Shannon, Ireland, Portland, USA, Budapest, Hungary and Shanghai, China. \nCentral to our Reimagine strategy is the electrification of both the Land Rover and Jaguar brands with two clear, distinct personalities. All Jaguar and Land Rover nameplates will be available in pure electric form by the end of the decade. This marks the start of the company\u2019s journey to become a net zero carbon business across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039.\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Motors since 2008, Jaguar Land Rover has unrivalled access to leading global players in technology and sustainability within the wider Tata Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nImages\n\n\n\n16 February 2022\nJaguar Land Rover announces partnership with NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  Download\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaguar Land Rover announces partnership with NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Download\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n                                                      Hi Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                      Low Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            View larger image\n                                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Download\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n                                                      Hi Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                      Low Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            View larger image\n                                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  Back\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jaguar Land Rover announces partnership with NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Download Options\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n                                                      Hi Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                      Low Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partnership image (featuring Jaguar Land Rover CEO Thierry Bollor\u00e9 and Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Download Options\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n                                                      Hi Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                      Low Res\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nImages\n\n\n\n\n\n16 February 2022\n\nJaguar Land Rover announces partnership with NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 February 2022\n JAGUAR LAND ROVER ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP WITH NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Download\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JAGUAR LAND ROVER ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP WITH NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n Embed Code\n                                  \n\n                                    Download\n                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 February 2022\n JLR NVIDIA Partnership Introduction Film -

Starting in 2025, all JLR vehicles will come with Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end Drive Hyperion platform installed, the companies said.Hyperion is the latest iteration of Nvidia\u2019s Drive platform that allows automakers to customize their own driving features. And Orin is the chipmaker\u2019s system-on-a-chip, similar to Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving chip or Intel\u2019s Mobileye EyeQ. This new hardware will form the basis for a new suite of driving features, including advanced driver assistance systems, automated parking, and autonomous driving, the companies said.Starting in 2025, all JLR vehicles will come with Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end Drive Hyperion platform\u201cOrin is the AI brain of the car, and Drive Hyperion is the central nervous system,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, Nvidia\u2019s vice president for automotive.JLR wouldn\u2019t say which models would be receiving which features as a result of this deal. But we can guess some of the broad outlines, based on Nvidia\u2019s other automotive deals, including Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, TuSimple, Cruise, Zoox, and a host of Chinese EV startups. Whatever they are, they will be befitting JLR\u2019s mission to provide a luxury vehicle experience to its customers, said Francois Dossa, executive director of strategy at JLR.\u201cThis is a very dynamic collaboration that we\u2019re having with Nvidia,\u201d Dossa said. \u201cSo we know that we\u2019re going to add more and more features corresponding to the modern luxury that we want to offer our customers.\u201dShapiro described the capabilities enabled by Nvidia\u2019s Drive Hyperion platform as \u201chighly automated and full self-driving.\u201d Given the level of confusion that exists around autonomous vehicles, largely as a result of inaccurate marketing and bad journalism, I asked Shapiro to define what he meant by those terms. Here\u2019s what he said:Highly automated, in many cases, would mean you could get onto a freeway and a car will drive itself. It will maintain a safe distance, it will stay in the lanes, potentially it could change lanes automatically or upon request, things like that. Full self driving is you get in the car, and it will take you from A to B and you don\u2019t have to touch anything. And again there\u2019s a wide spectrum.Later, Dossa clarified that JLR was working on Level 3 autonomous technology, which describes driving features that don\u2019t require human supervision under specific conditions, like a mapped highway.Dossa clarified that JLR was working on Level 3 autonomous technology(Most AV companies, including Waymo and Cruise, have said they are skipping Level 3 and working exclusively on Level 4 technology. The reason is that Level 3 is seen as being potentially dangerous, given the likelihood that drivers will be confused about when they need to take over control of the vehicle, and could become overly complacent.)JLR has a deal with Waymo, in which the Alphabet-owned company works with the automaker to outfit its I-Pace electric SUVs with autonomous driving hardware and software. Waymo is operating a fleet of its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in California.JLR has also said it will be all-electric by 2025. And while its plans are clearly ambitious, the automaker has been slow to embrace electrification and automation. Its only fully electric car to date is the I-Pace, which has struggled to make inroads against more established electric carmakers. Even then, the car is built by a contractor, rather than being produced by JLR in-house.See More: Autonomous CarsCarsJaguarNewsNvidiaTechTranspoMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event\u00a0and don't have any additional information to share at this time.\"\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nMajor Russian IT service provider hit with cyberattack\n\n\n\n\nDDoS attacks take down game studio servers, causing DayZ and Arma network outages\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph report says that the company's email systems and developer tools were suffering from outages in the last two days from what is believed to be a malicious intrusion into the company's network, though no culprit has been identified or even if the problem is a cyberattack.There is no evidence at this point implicating bad actors in Russia or Russian security services in the disruption, but western governments have been on heightened alert for potential retaliatory cyberattacks from Russia after the imposition of sanctions following Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.Nvidia is best known for making graphics processors, but it has established itself in other critical areas like machine learning and cloud services, giving the company larger national security exposure than in the past.So far, it isn't known if anything was taken from Nvidia servers or if the disruption was purely that, disruption for the sake of disruption.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Analysis: we're not saying its definitely Russia, but...The obvious connection people are making is that this apparent cyberattack happened just as Russia invaded Ukraine, which suffered its own slew of cyberattacks all week.That is still circumstantial evidence at best, and it's premature to point fingers. This is especially true since there are plenty of bad actors out there who would love to dig into Nvidia's systems for malice and profit, and what better time to do that than a moment when the entire world is primed to blame Russia for such an attack?Still, the cyberattack \u2013 if that's what this is \u2013 doesn't just coincide with the invasion of Ukraine, but the imposition of US export controls on semiconductors and other high-tech computer technology. So, if Russia were going to retaliate, why not strike out at one of the world's largest semiconductor companies, which just so happens to be based in the US?There is a lot of literal and metaphorical fog of war right now, and it's always best to reserve judgment until we know more of the facts on the ground, which is something that we simply don't have right now.Nvidia gives up its pursuit of an Arm acqusition\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

For accelerated computing, it supports nodes with four NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\nThe XH3000 also flexibly employs network options including NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand and NVIDIA ConnectX-7 InfiniBand and Ethernet adapters to scale these powerful computing nodes to HPC systems capable of 10 mixed precision AI exaflops.\nHybrid HPC+AI+Quantum System\nThe result is a flexible, hybrid computing platform capable of running the most demanding HPC simulations, AI jobs and even emerging workloads in quantum computing.\nThe BullSequana XH3000 \u201cwill no doubt enable, through the gateway of exascale, some of the key scientific and industrial innovation breakthroughs of the future,\u201d said Rodolphe Belmer, CEO of Atos, in a virtual event revealing the system.\nWith customers in more than 70 countries, Atos is #1 in supercomputing in Europe, India and South America and especially renowned in France, where it maintains its headquarters as well as a manufacturing and R&D base.\nA Broad Collaboration\nOptimizations for the XH3000 were among the first projects for EXAIL, the joint Excellence AI Lab that Atos and NVIDIA announced in November.\nJohn Josephakis, global vice president of sales and business development for HPC/supercomputing at NVIDIA, congratulated the team behind the system in a video message.\n\u201cBy combining the well-known expertise Atos has with NVIDIA AI and HPC technologies and work at our joint lab, this platform will allow researchers to get significant insights much faster to grand challenges both in supercomputing and industrial HPC,\u201d he said.\nEXAIL\u2019s work spans climate research, healthcare and genomics, quantum computing, edge AI/computer vision and cybersecurity. Its researchers can access application frameworks such as NVIDIA Clara for healthcare and NVIDIA Morpheus for security as well as the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK for quantum computing and the NVIDIA HPC SDK that runs hundreds of scientific and technical applications.\nA Long, Productive Relationship\nAtos built one of Europe\u2019s first supercomputers to employ the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the JUWELS Booster at the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Center. It uses 3,744 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs to deliver 2.5 exaflops of mixed-precision AI performance.\nTo provide a deeper understanding of climate change, Atos and NVIDIA researchers will run AI models on the system, currently ranked No. 8 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers. Julich researchers used the system in April to conduct a state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulation.\nLast year, Atos led deployment of BerzeLiUs, a system built on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and Sweden\u2019s largest supercomputer. The company also has delivered supercomputing infrastructure in Europe, India and South America based on NVIDIA DGX systems.\nNext up, Atos is building Leonardo, a supercomputer at the Italian inter-university consortium CINECA. It will pack 14,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on an NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand network and is expected to become the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer, capable of 10 exaflops of mixed-precision AI performance.\nWith the first glimpse of the BullSequana XH3000, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s much more to come from the collaboration of Atos and NVIDIA.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | HardwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Energy | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Quantum-2 | NVIDIA Research | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is stumping up a ton of cash to secure enough manufacturing capacity for its next-gen GPUs, according to a new report, which could be great news in terms of the effort to end the current graphics card shortage.This comes from\u00a0Hardware Times,\u00a0which claims that Nvidia is going to dip into its coffers to the tune of almost $10 billion (around \u00a37.3 billion, AU$14 billion) in order to book enough 5nm capacity at TSMC to secure the production of chips for next-gen \u2018Lovelace\u2019 products.As you may be aware, what will presumably be the RTX 4000 series is supposedly dropping down to 5nm, from the current 8nm with Ampere GPUs, a move which should give Nvidia plenty of room to boost performance with these incoming graphics cards that are expected to arrive later in 2022.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAnother gloomy Nvidia RTX 5000 rumor suggests next-gen GPUs will be price hiked over the MSRP in many cases, and I\u2019m getting worried now\n\n\n\n\nSorry, AMD, Nvidia's price tags for its RTX 5000 GPUs could win me over\n\n\n\nOf course, TSMC\u2019s 5nm is a cutting-edge process and competition among big tech firms is fierce where it\u2019s concerned, hence it isn\u2019t surprising Nvidia is having to dig deep into its pockets, at least in theory.Analysis: Capacity wars \u2013 Team Green vs Team RedNvidia spending big in this way, if true, would hardly be a surprise as mentioned. We\u2019ve been promised (more or less) a serious uptick in production and stock levels for Team Green\u2019s GPUs as the second half of 2022 rolls around, and given the inventory woes which have plagued gamers trying to buy RTX 3000 graphics cards, Nvidia will want to ensure that launch stock of RTX 4000 models isn\u2019t thin on the ground. Otherwise the unleashing of next-gen GPUs will be greeted by sighs and \u201chere we go again\u201d type comments.Nvidia will naturally have its eye on rival GPU maker AMD, too, because Team Red has already been making positive noises about its graphics cards becoming easier to buy in the future. AMD has underlined that its purchase of Xilinx will really help bolster its supply chain, and that the company has a long-term strategy for ensuring stock problems are considerably eased going forward, procuring enough \u201cshare of capacity\u201d when it comes to chipmakers.This will be part of that fierce competition Nvidia faces on 5nm, in theory, as AMD is rumored to be using that process for its higher-end RDNA 3 GPUs which are also scheduled to arrive later in 2022, to face off against RTX 4000.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Whatever the case, and however this battle for manufacturing capacity pans out in the GPU arena, we\u2019ll just be thankful to (hopefully) see more graphics cards on shelves later this year.Don\u2019t forget that Intel is also entering the market with its Alchemist cards, the desktop versions of which are expected to debut in Q2, with speculation suggesting that Team Blue will have robust levels of supply from launch. That\u2019s another compelling reason Nvidia won\u2019t want to fail to cater for demand this year, of course, and could pay through the nose potentially to avoid any scenario where it falls short.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for youVia PC Gamer\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

The 3080 Ti represents a minor refresh to coincide with the latest range of gaming laptops powered by Intel Alder Lake and AMD Ryzen 6000 processors. It's also the fastest laptop GPU Nvidia will be offering in early 2022, superseding the original RTX 3080.\nThe RTX 3080 Ti Laptop isn't your typical refresh though, because Nvidia have create new silicon for this product, namely GA103. Before this, the largest die Nvidia were using in laptops was GA104 but this new GA103 die gives us access to more processing cores without the need to go all the way up to massive GA102 silicon, which would be somewhat impractical for laptop form factors.\n\nOn the spec sheet, there are two main improvements to the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop over the RTX 3080 Laptop chip. The new 3080 Ti packs 58 SMs, up from 48, which is a 21 percent increase and now gives us 7424 CUDA cores.\nHowever, to fit inside similar 80-150W power limits, rated clock speeds have been dropped from a maximum of 1710 MHz boost down to 1590 MHz, so FP32 performance hasn't increased by the full 20%. And while Nvidia does list up to 150W of available power, several laptop vendors will likely be offering this with up to 175W of power based on what we're seeing.\n\nThe other main improvement is the memory speed, going from 14 Gbps to 16 Gbps GDDR6, and Nvidia is dropping the 8GB configuration to only offer 16GB of VRAM with the 3080 Ti Laptop chip. The same memory bus is used, but an increase in bandwidth and memory speeds now match AMD's current line-up.\nAs an important side note, we're still looking at a confusing situation where the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU is not the same as the desktop RTX 3080 Ti card, and it's not even close.\nThe desktop model packs 80 SMs, higher boost clock speeds, and faster GDDR6X memory on a wider bus. So despite sharing the same name, it feels a bit misleading to call the laptop GPU a \"3080 Ti\" when the desktop model has 38% more CUDA cores and many other advantages. Not going to harp on this point much further, but it's something to be aware of.\n\nOur test platform for today's review was provided by XMG, this is one of the laptops we used for reviewing the new Intel Core i7-12700H CPU which is based on the Alder Lake architecture.\nThe XMG GM7AG8M 17-inch chassis we have on hand runs on that Intel processor, plus 32GB of DDR5 memory in a dual-stick configuration. The RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU is configured at 150W with 5W of dynamic boost, but just to be clear, there are multiple configurations of the RTX 3080 Ti that will all have the same advertised name, but different power limits.\nAn 80W configuration in a slimmer, smaller laptop will be significantly slower than the results we show today, which are representative of high-power flagship laptops.\n\nIn addition, this machine offers a nice 1440p 240Hz IPS display and I'm loving this shift towards 1440p displays for new generation laptops as these GPUs should be good enough to handle them.\nFor testing we'll be benchmarking and comparing GPUs at 1080p, with the display connected to the iGPU. This is the most limited configuration and is how many laptops are run in a hybrid or Optimus mode. Then we also have 1440p results with the GPU connected directly to the display, which is the most GPU limited and representative of laptops with a mux switch (to enable or disable the integrated graphics) or external display use.\nGaming Benchmarks\nLet's kick off testing with Watch Dogs Legion. Running at 1080p using Ultra settings, the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop is a highly capable GPU offering 13% higher performance than the RTX 3080 Laptop, though at a slightly higher power usage in practice from a similar power range.\nBut we're very much sitting in the range of mid-range to high-end desktop configurations, falling just 13% short of a desktop RTX 3080 configuration we tested earlier. This is well behind the real RTX 3080 Ti for desktops, but similar to what is possible from an RTX 3070.\n\n\nAt 1440p, the gap between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti laptop models closes, and the gap widens to the desktop RTX 3080. The 3080 Ti for laptops is slightly faster, but it's kinda negligible at just a 4% margin. With that said, this laptop GPU is good for over 60 FPS on average using ultra settings, which is a very playable frame rate for this sort of title.\n\nIn Metro Exodus we find something a bit different. Our RTX 3080 Ti configuration is a little behind the RTX 3080 laptop model, by just a few frames - and this is despite the new Alder Lake CPU being faster for gaming than previous 11th-gen parts.\nTo me this suggests the game might be favoring frequency and that shift in going up in CUDA cores but down in frequency versus the 3080 might be hurting here. It's also possible that given the overall power budget, which now needs to factor in higher clocked and more power consuming memory potentially at the cost to GPU power, things just haven't quite aligned in favor of the Ti model.\n\nAnd this isn't an outlier at 1080p, it's also the case at 1440p where Metro Exodus is still very GPU limited using Ultra settings. That's a disappointing regression for the new Ti model but this wasn't the case with most other games tested.\n\n\nIn Red Dead Redemption 2, the RTX 3080 Ti does pretty well compared to the RTX 3080 in average frame rates, despite a small regression in 1% low numbers. The new Ti model is 10% faster at 1080p, but not really at the level of a desktop system equipped with a powerful RTX 3080 GPU. Meanwhile at 1440p, the RTX 3080 Ti is merely matching the RTX 3080's average performance in a laptop, making the new Ti model rather pointless.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is the other game we tested where the RTX 3080 Ti laptop configuration we used was slower than our previous RTX 3080 system from MSI, despite what should be a more favorable overall platform. The difference is very small, just a few FPS in total, but I would have expected the new Ti refresh to be in the range of 5-10% faster in this very performance intensive game. Not saying it performs badly or anything as you can easily get over 60 FPS at 1080p, but comparatively it's a bit disappointing.\n\nAt 1440p it slips a few FPS behind the RTX 3080 Laptop model, though it's still enough performance to match AMD's Radeon RX 6800M in a similar power range. Unfortunately for those wanting to buy a laptop as a desktop replacement, the new RTX 3080 Ti in Cyberpunk is 33% slower than the desktop RTX 3080, let alone the RTX 3080 Ti - you simply can't match a 320W desktop GPU with just 150W of available power.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, the RTX 3080 Ti is 7% faster in average frame rates when compared to the RTX 3080 at 1080p, so that's a small but respectable result, and not a regression like in two of the games we've looked at so far. This keeps the 3080 Ti a decent margin ahead of AMD's RX 6800M and other GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile at 1440p, the margin between the 3080 and 3080 Ti closes to just a few FPS, which is negligible. Performance is excellent in general, offering 100 FPS at 1440p using the highest quality preset, and the margin is smaller versus the desktop RTX 3080 compared to other games which is nice to see.\n\n\nSome games on a laptop are going to be more CPU limited than others. Rainbow Six Siege is one such example at 1080p, where most of the gains seen here are attributable to the new Intel 12th-gen CPUs.\nAs I expect pretty much all RTX 3080 Ti laptops to feature new generation CPUs, this is definitely a benefit to a new laptop vs a last-gen model, but it may not necessarily be the GPU alone that is doing the work. For example, at 1440p in this same game, the margin between systems closes up a fair bit and the benefit to getting the new 3080 Ti model with a 12th-gen CPU drops to just 5% in terms of 1% low performance, not 25% like we saw at 1080p.\n\n\nAnother example of a CPU limitation is Hitman 3. At 1080p these sorts of laptops can quickly run into a wall when you have a fast enough GPU - the 12700H is providing most of the huge 30% performance gains we see over the last-gen RTX 3080 configuration, even beating our desktop test result for the 3080.\nBut at 1440p, the GPU becomes much more relevant, and now the margin between the 3080 Ti and 3080 shrinks to just a few percent in favor of the new Ti model.\n\nWe're still working on some new game benchmarks that we'll be using across 2022's laptop GPU comparisons but here's a sneak preview of how the RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU fares.\n\nIn Forza Horizon 5 using the Ultra preset at 1440p we see an average frame rate of 90 FPS, another great result that makes this GPU well suited to smooth gameplay.\n\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy at 1440p, the 3080 Ti is very impressive, pushing over 120 FPS using the Ultra preset which is highly playable on new laptop displays.\n\nIn Deathloop once again using Ultra settings, we see a similar result with 90 FPS highly achievable which is more than enough for this sort of title.\n\nThen for ray tracing performance, in Guardians of the Galaxy, the RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU can hit a 60 FPS average using the highest quality ray tracing settings at 1440p without using DLSS, so that's very solid levels of performance and can only go up from there should you choose to enable DLSS Quality for example.\n\nFar Cry 6 ray tracing is also highly playable and the large 16GB VRAM buffer prevents any stuttering issues at 1440p, which is an issue with the RTX 3070 laptop configuration as you can see in the chart.\nWhat We Learned\nOverall, the RTX 3080 Ti is a very capable GPU for gaming laptops and was able to put up 60 FPS or near to 60 FPS in basically all of the games we tested, even at 1440p using high or ultra settings.\nIn some games it can even do quite a bit better than that, offering a medium or high refresh rate experience without sacrificing much from visuals. In isolation, a product like the 3080 Ti Laptop is well suited to this new generation of 2022 laptops that will be more often featuring 1440p displays, mux switches, and large performance gains for the CPU.\nHowever, it also doesn't seem like a very necessary or revolutionary upgrade for the laptop market. Despite being technically crowned the \"fastest\" laptop GPU you can get, it's only marginally faster than the RTX 3080 for laptops in a similar power class - around 10% better at 1080p, and only ~5% faster at 1440p. In two of the games tested, it ended up slower than the RTX 3080 laptop configuration, which was disappointing to see, though I expect this to be an outlier and not the norm.\n\nThis kind of small performance gain presents a situation for laptop buyers. If you can find an RTX 3080 Ti laptop with a similar configuration at the same price as an older RTX 3080 laptop, we see no issues at all. You'll also almost certainly benefit from new platform advantages, like an upgraded CPU and better display.\nBut for pure gamers, I'd find it hard to recommend an RTX 3080 Ti laptop if it was more expensive than an RTX 3080 system, which usually are expensive enough as is. The performance gains are minor and if a newer system with the Ti was more expensive, you'd definitely want it to feature a faster CPU and come with other benefits like more RAM or SSD space.\nWe should note, these margins aren't too different to what is seen on the desktop side, where the RTX 3080 Ti is less than 10% faster than the RTX 3080, so the laptop market is also seeing the typical very marginal gains at the high end wallet-gouging segment. But we do want to reiterate that the RTX 3080 Ti GPU on laptops is nowhere near as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti for desktops, and ends up 20 to 30 percent slower than the RTX 3080 desktop GPU in most cases \u2013 there's no substitute for desktop gaming power if sheer performance is what you're after.\nThe RTX 3080 Ti for laptops is closer to the RTX 3070 desktop GPU based on our testing, which is no slouch of a card. The 3070 is very good, but it's just at the top of the desktop market.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptops on Amazon\nIntel Core i7-12700H Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptops on Amazon\nRyzen 7 5800H Laptops on Amazon\n\nFurther Testing\nSince we published this review of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU, we have run additional benchmarks and comparisons you may be interested in:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Desktop vs. Laptop GPU\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU Review\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 10\n\n\n Got something to say?

Learn More\n\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang didn\u2019t get to fulfill his dream of acquiring Arm for $80 billion. Regulators held the deal up and Huang  called off the deal after \u201cgiving it our best shot.\u201d \nBut his company is still going strong. Nvidia\u00a0reported revenues of $7.64 billion for its fourth fiscal quarter ended January 30, up 53% from a year earlier. Gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization market platforms each achieved record revenue for the quarter and year.\nThat shows the company has a lot of breadth as it figures out what it will do in the wake of the Arm deals collapse. And Huang said he has high hopes for his three-chip strategy, the Omniverse, the metaverse, and self-driving cars. I had a short time to interview Huang after the company reported earnings this week. \nHere\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.\nVentureBeat: What is your post-Arm strategy? Do you have to communicate your strategic direction in light of [the Arm deal being called off]?\nJensen Huang: Not really anything. Because we never finished combining with Arm. So any strategies that would have come from the combination were never talked about. And so our strategy is exactly the same. We do accelerated computing for wherever there are CPUs (central processing units) . And so we\u2019ll do that for x86. And we\u2019ll do we do that for Arm. We have a whole bunch of ARM CPUs, and system-on-chips (SoCs) in development. And we\u2019re enthusiasts. We do all that. We have a 20-year license to Arm\u2019s intellectual property. And we\u2019ll continue to take advantage of all that and all the markets. And that\u2019s about it. Keep building CPUs, GPUs (graphics processing units), and DPUs (data processing units).\nVB: So it\u2019s your three-chip strategy? Would you consider RISC-V now that the Arm deal is not happening?\nHuang: We use RISC-V. We\u2019re RISC-V users inside our GPUs. We use it in several areas. For system controllers, inside the Bluefield GPU, there is a RISC-V acceleration engine, if you will, a programmable engine. And we use RISC-V when it makes sense. We use Arm when it makes sense. We use x86 when it makes sense.\nVB: And how are you viewing progress on the metaverse? It seems like everybody\u2019s a lot more excited about the metaverse, and the Omniverse is always part of that conversation.\nHuang: Let\u2019s see. Omniverse for enterprise is being trialed and being tested in about 700 or so different companies around the world. We have entered into some major licenses already. And so our numbers are off to a great start. People are using it for all kinds of things. They\u2019re using it for connecting designers and creators. They\u2019re using it to simulate logistics warehouses, simulate factories. They\u2019re using it for synthetic data generation because we simulate sensors physically and accurately. You could use it for simulating data for training AIs that are collected from LiDAR, radars, and of course cameras. And so they\u2019re using it for the simulation part of the software development process. You need to validate software as part of the release process. And you can put Omniverse in the flow of robotics application validation. People are using it for digital twins, too. \nA scene from an Ericsson Omniverse environment.\nVB: You\u2019re going to make the biggest digital twin of all, right? [Nvidia plans to make a digital twin of the Earth as part of its Earth 2 simulation, which will use AI and the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers to simulate climate change and predict how the planet\u2019s climate could change over decades].\nHuang: We\u2019re off building or scoping out the architecture and building the ultimate digital twin. \nVB: And do you feel like we\u2019re also heading towards an open metaverse? Will it be sufficiently open as opposed to a bunch of walled gardens?\nHuang: I really do hope it\u2019s open and I think it will be open with Universal Scene Description (USD). As you know, we\u2019re one of the largest contributors, the primary contributor, to USD today. And it was invented by Pixar. It\u2019s been adopted by so many different content developers. Adobe adopted it, and we have gotten a lot of people to adopt it. I\u2019m hoping that everybody will go to USD and then it will become essentially the HTML of the metaverse.\nVB: What is your confidence level in the automotive division and how we are moving forward with self-driving cars? Do you feel like we are getting back on track after the pandemic?\nHuang: I am certain that we will have autonomous vehicles all over the world. They all have their operating domains. And some of that is just within the boundaries of a very large warehouse. They call them AMRs, autonomous moving robots. You could have them inside walled factories, and so they could be moving goods and inventory around. You could be delivering goods across the last mile, like Neuro and others. All these great companies are doing last-mile delivery. All of those applications are very doable, so long as you don\u2019t overpromise. \nAnd I think there will be thousands and thousands of applications of autonomous vehicles, and it\u2019s a sure thing. This year is going to be the inflection year for us on autonomous driving. This will be a big year for us. And then next year, it\u2019ll be even bigger next year. And in 2025, that\u2019s when we deploy our own software where we do revenue sharing with the car companies.\nAnd so if the license was $10,000, we shared 50-50. If it\u2019s a subscription base of $1,000 or $100 a month, we share 50-50. I think I\u2019m pretty certain now that autonomous vehicles will be one of our largest businesses. \n\n\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

This includes playback problems as well as issues with storage permissions and PLEX Media servers.While NVIDIA previously released hotfixes to address the problems, those required a bit more effort and were not Google certified. They also have some limitations, such as the inability to roll back from the HotFix or download/update Disney+ from the Play Store.Fortunately, this official update should do the trick, as per the changelog provided on the NVIDIA blog. These are the most notable fixes included in the update:Resolves PLEX Media Server issueFixes storage permissions on media player, file browser, and emulator appsFixes stutter when playing interlaced contentThe update also includes fixes to YouTube TV, restores access to Kodi system files, and plenty of other bug fixes related to audio, accessories, and more. SHIELD Experience Upgrade v9.0.1 (33.1.0.283) is arriving now on Shield TV devices and will roll out over the \"next few days.\" With any luck, Shield TV devices should be back to normal with this update.\n\n\n\nAndroid TV\nNVIDIA Shield TV\n\n\n $149.99 at Amazon $149.99 at Walmart $149.99 at Best Buy\nStill one of the bestIf you're looking for an exceptional Android TV experience, the NVIDIA Shield TV is one of the best.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a shame that current generation Nvidia and AMD cards put a low priority on power efficiency and performance per watt. Big benchmark numbers sell cards more so than relative power consumption numbers. But, there are many users who don't run beefy power supplies or use OEM systems that can\u2019t accommodate enormous graphics cards. There\u2019s a market for low power cards.\u00a0Sadly though, there aren\u2019t any current generation GeForce or Radeon cards that have a low enough TDP to omit PCIe power connectors. Even the weak RX 6500 XT can't manage it, but there is an Ampere card that can. It\u2019s the workstation oriented RTX A2000. It features a 70W TDP which is low enough to draw power exclusively from the PCIe slot. Can it game though? That very question was asked and answered by youtuber RandomGamingHD, who ran the little A2000 though a suite of benchmarks.\u00a0The A2000, despite its intended workstation optimization, is perfectly capable of gaming and it supports ray tracing and DLSS. It's a low profile dual slot card that features a blower style cooler and it won\u2019t have any issue integrating into virtually any system.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nGraphics cards are so demanding now there are devices with tiny screens that plug into connectors and monitor temperatures\n\n\n\n\nHere are the best gaming rig deals you can get for the measly cost of an Nvidia RTX 5090\n\n\n\nThe RTX A2000 is built with the GA106 GPU, the same as that which powers the desktop RTX 3050 and RTX 3060. Its shader count is 3328, which is much higher than the 2560 of the RTX 3050. To achieve its low power rating, the A200 is clocked much lower, with a 562/1200MHz base/boost clock compared to the 1552/1777MHz clocks of the 3050. However, the desktop 3050 has a base 130W TDP, a full 60W more than the A200.\u00a0The results show that the A2000 competes surprisingly well with the desktop RTX 3050 despite its significant clock disadvantage. RandomGamingHD shows the A2000 is able to comfortably play games at 1080p and even 1440p if you dial back the settings. Sure, its not an RTX 3090 or RX 6900 XT slayer, but at 70W, it offers excellent power efficiency, and that's the major takeaway from this experiment.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021Sadly, as the A2000 is a workstation card, it's very expensive. At $1,070 it's far too expensive to compete with the RTX 3050 and RTX 3060, but it serves as a good example of what\u2019s possible when power efficiency is the design goal, and not brute force.\u00a0I use a 75W passive GTX 1050 in a secondary PC, and I love it specifically because it\u2019s a silent and low power option. I\u2019m sure I'm not the only one who values these characteristics. \u00a0A current generation sub 75W GeForce or Radeon card would earn a lot of fans. I\u2019m ready with my wallet open.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nRadeon\n\n\nChris SzewczykSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterChris' gaming experiences go back to the mid-nineties when he conned his parents into buying an 'educational PC' that was conveniently overpowered to play Doom and Tie Fighter. He developed a love of extreme overclocking that destroyed his savings despite the cheaper hardware on offer via his job at a PC store. To afford more LN2 he began moonlighting as a reviewer for VR-Zone before jumping the fence to work for MSI Australia.

Following the announcement ARM's CEO stepped down and will be replaced by Rene Haas.\n\nNvidia says it wasn't able to persuade regulators that the deal won't affect ARM's free licensing model and even offered to set up a separate entity that will hold the chip design licenses. As a result of the failed deal, SoftBank, which is the current owner of ARM, will get $1.25 billion break fee.\nSoftBank officially confirmed that it's now planing to make ARM public in an attempt to recoup part of the expected cash inflow from the failed  sale.\nNew Arm CEO Haas said in an interview that the last year and a half was wrapped in uncertainty as the Nvidia-ARM acquisition was hanging in limbo. And despite the fact that ARM has never been better financial-wise, it is forced to let some of its employees go.\nPeople familiar with the matter say that the company has plans to go public in the US, although that hasn't been explicitly confirmed. SoftBank only said that it's planning to make ARM publicly traded without specifying more details at this point.\nSource 1 \u2022 Source 2\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n\n\n\nNvidia Shield TV gets Android 11\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces 12GB version of RTX 3080 with more CUDA cores\n\n\n\n\n\nFTC is suing Nvidia over Arm acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm stands firmly against Nvidia's acquisition of Arm\n\n\n\n\n\nReader comments\n\n? \nAnonymous\n\n\nIVZ \n13 Feb 2022\n\nBut Rene Haas is from Nvidia..

And with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, MR factory enables remote designers and artists to collaborate in one virtual space.\nThese advanced solutions help the company accelerate design workflows and take virtual productions to the next level.\nImages courtesy of MR Factory.\n\u201cNVIDIA is powering this new workflow that allows us to improve creative opportunities while reducing production times and costs,\u201d said \u00d3scar Olarte, co-founder and CTO of MR Factory. \u201cInstead of traveling to places like Australia or New York, we can create these scenarios virtually \u2014 you go from creating content to creating worlds.\u201d\nSetting the Virtual Stage for UEFA Champions\u00a0\nMR Factory received the UEFA Champions League Finals opening ceremony project when there were heavy restrictions on travel due to the pandemic. The event was initially set to take place at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Stadium, the largest sporting arena in Turkey.\nMR Factory captured images of the stadium and used them to create a 3D model for the music video. But with the pandemic\u2019s shifting conditions, the UEFA changed the location to a stadium in Porto, on Portugal\u2019s coast \u2014 with just two weeks until the project\u2019s deadline.\n\nMR Factory had to quickly create another 3D model of the new stadium. The team used NVIDIA technology to achieve this, with real-time rendering tools accelerating their creative workflows. To create the stunning graphics and set up the scenes for virtual production, MR Factory uses leading applications such as Autodesk Arnold, DaVinci Resolve, OctaneRender and Unreal Engine.\n\u201cOne of the most exciting technologies for us right now is NVIDIA RTX because it allows us to render faster, and in real time,\u201d said Olarte. \u201cWe can mix real elements with virtual elements instantly.\u201d\nMR Factory also uses camera-tracking technology, which allows it to capture all camera and lens movements on stage. They use that footage to then combine live elements with the virtual production environment in real time.\nOver 80 people across Spain worked on the virtual opening ceremony and, with the help of NVIDIA RTX, the team was able to complete the integrations from scratch, render all the visuals and finish the project in time for the event.\nMaking Vast Virtual Worlds\u00a0\nOne of MR Factory\u2019s core philosophies is enabling remote work, as this provides the company with more opportunities to hire talent from anywhere. The studio then empowers that talent with the best creative tools.\nAdditionally, MR Factory has been developing the metaverse as a way to produce films and television scenes. The pandemic accentuated the need for real-time collaboration and interaction between remote teams, and NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise helps MR Factory achieve this.\n\nWith Omniverse Enterprise, MR Factory can drastically reduce production times, since multiple people can work simultaneously on the same project. Instead of completing a scene in a week, five artists can work in Omniverse and have the scene ready in a day, Olarte said.\n\u201cFor us, virtual production is a way of creating worlds \u2014 and from these worlds come video games and movies,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re building a library of content while we\u2019re producing it, and the library is compatible with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\u201d\nMR Factory uses a render farm with 200 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, which provide artists with the GPU memory they need to quickly produce stunning work, deliver high-quality virtual productions and render in real time.\nMR Factory plans to use Omniverse Enterprise and the render farm on future projects, so they can streamline creative workflows and bring virtual worlds together.\nThe same tools that MR Factory uses to create the virtual worlds of tomorrow are also available at no cost to millions of individual NVIDIA Studio creators with GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX, Omniverse and other powerful technologies behind the latest virtual productions by registering for free for GTC, taking place March 21-24. \n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Omniverse Enterprise | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are officially three days past January and NVIDIA seems to either have forgotten about the RTX 3090 Ti graphics card or something has gone really bad with the new flagship.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Delay Could Be Linked To Not Enough 'Full-Fat' G102 GPUs, Also\u00a0 Custom Models Listed in APAC Markets For Over $4000 US\nIn the latest video by Moore's Law is Dead, it is reported how NVIDIA has been silent with its AIB partners and hasn't communicated anything so far regarding the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card. The graphics card was meant to be announced in late January. The 27th was the last date which we knew about through the rumor mill but that didn't happen But neither of them saw any announcement regarding the graphics card.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingSo what's the issue? Well, it's still all mere speculation but MLID's sources do point out a few things which we have also heard from our own sources. First of all, it was reported that the card had PCB and BIOS-related issues and that they were later resolved. But the latest on the RTX 3090 Ti is that NVIDIA doesn't even have enough Ampere GPUs to produce the GeForce flagship in meaningful quantities.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti does utilize the same GA102 GPU that is featured on the RTX A6000 and it's been more than a year since the original Geforce RTX 3090 was launched so one would expect that the yields over at Samsung would've gotten better. But the RTX 3090 Ti doesn't utilize just any GA102 GPU, it will feature the full-fat die, with everything enabled and it also has higher clock speeds which is why the TGP jumped from 350W to 450W. And it looks like producing Ampere GA102 dies that hit the right clocks with the right power is proving to be a difficult task for NVIDIA.\nBut it begs the question, why did NVIDIA showcase the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti in the first place if they knew that producing such as GPU would be so hard. They could've instead waited for the right time to unveil the card but it is likely they wanted to make a statement that they were still going to be the king of the hill, knowing that AMD would have an RDNA 2 refresh somewhere down the line in 2022. The other factor which we all seem to be dismissing is whether or not the new 21 Gbps dies that power the 3090 Ti's memory side are available in good quantities. These dies are going to offer higher speeds and double the capacity and GDDR6X was already a major constraint in production of the original lineup. So we have to consider that too.\nBut while the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is 'indefinitely' delayed, there are still several retailers who are listing unreleased custom models and pricing them around the $4000 US price point. One such retailer in Vietnam has started taking pre-orders with pricing starting from around 88 million VN\u0110 for GALAX's Gamer EX Black model which isn't even the top model that the manufacturer will have to offer. The top model from GALAX, the HOF Extreme, is likely to be priced at around $6000 US+.

The NVIDIA GeForce MX550 GPU scored 5014 points in the PassMark test, similar to AMD's Vega integrated graphics found on its Ryzen 5000 APUs. On the G3D Mark test, the MX550 was pitted against the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS iGPU. Regardless, the AMD Vega iGPU scored 4968 points, a difference of 46 points (0.9% less), showing that NVIDIA's low-level GeForce GPU barely outperformed the Ryzen 9 5900HS integrated graphics processor.\nSource: PassMark\nThe G3D score illustrates an overview of the test suite. These values only arise if all the tests in a singular suite have been conducted. There are a minuscule amount of test samples available in this particular case, so the scores between the two brands are for one MX550 score and nine Ryzen 9 5900HS samples. It is notable that PassMark GPU benchmarks are not highly regarded and are rarely used.\nSource: PassMark\nThe lack of raytracing and DLSS support is apparent on NVIDIA's new MX550 graphics processor, making it less than suitable for any gaming, but that is not its primary focus. The MX550 will possibly be billed as a replacement GPU that is perfect for everyday consumer use, focused on remote working and casual gaming.\nBut what's important to note is that even if the TDP falls between 15-25W, a discrete GPU will take in more power, reducing the overall battery life of the laptop versus an integrated solution. The company has not currently verified the exact TDP of NVIDIA's MX550. We expect to hear more over the next few months since NVIDIA has mentioned a release sometime this spring.\nNVIDIA GeForce MX Series GPU Family Specifications:\n\n\n\nGPU NameGPU ArchitectureCUDA CoresGPU ClockMemory SpeedMemory BusTDP\n\n\n\n\nGeForce MX570Ampere GA1072048TBA - 1155 MHz12 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX550Turing TU1171024TBA - 1320 MHz12 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 450Turing TU117896540 - 1575 MHz10 Gbps GDDR664-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 430Turing TU117896TBA - TBA MHz10 Gbps GDDR6\n7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 350Pascal GP1076401354-1468 MHz7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 350Pascal GP107640746-937 MHz7 Gbps GDDR564-bit15W\n\n\nGeForce MX 330Pascal GP1083841531-1594 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 310Pascal GP1082561341-1379 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 250Pascal GP1083841518-1582 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 250Pascal GP108384937-1038 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit10.5W\n\n\nGeForce MX 230Pascal GP1082561518-1531 MHz6/7 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 150Pascal GP1083841468-1531 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 150Pascal GP108384937-1038 MHz5 Gbps GDDR564-bit10W\n\n\nGeForce MX 130Maxwell GM1083841122-1242 MHz6 Gbps GDDR564-bit25W\n\n\nGeForce MX 110Maxwell GM108256963-993 MHz1.8 Gbps DDR364-bit10W\n\n\n\n\nNews Sources: TUM_APISAK, Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D 3D V-Cache CPUs Now Available \u2013 The Best Gaming & Content Creation Package Ever!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n151\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Board Partners Silently Increase Prices Of Radeon RX 9070 Series; Base Models Priced At Up To $130 Higher\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTesla Warns Trump Administration That Tariffs Could Make Its Production Costs Jump\n\n\n\n63\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n48\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n2317\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor Retailer Reports Selling Over 5,000 Units of AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs on Launch Day, Working Quickly to Restore Inventory\n\n\n\n2093\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1526\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorFeb 17, 2022, 02:14pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA CEO Jenson Huang and Jaguar Land Rover CEO Thierry Bollor\u00e9 shaking hands. NVIDIA\nThis week, NVIDIA and Jaguar Land Rover announced their partnership to equip all Jaguar and Land Rover cars with NVIDIA's full-stack NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform. The DRIVE Hyperion 8 was announced at NVIDIA's GTC 2021 event back in November, targeting level 4 (L4) self-driving capabilities. Jaguar Land Rover is the second vehicle manufacturer to adopt NVIDIA's full suite of automotive solutions, and I have to say it is an exciting one.\n\n\nA common theme between Intel Mobileye, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA is that partnerships matter in the autonomous driving space. Partnerships matter essentially on two fronts. Firstly, the autonomous vehicle (AV) space is relatively new. Legacy automotive manufacturers have years of experience in the automotive industry, and they are mixing with the top computing manufacturers in the tech industry. It also matters because of the interoperability factor almost inherent to the AV space.\n\nA vehicle to autonomously drive itself requires an incredible amount of computing power and an abstract and mature stack of AI and ML software. It is no short feat, and for the industry to move forward, interoperability is a key factor in getting past the initial friction of the technology. The reason interoperability is so important to AV innovation is that it puts the technology in the hands of automotive manufacturers to make the industry decisions as the new technology is introduced.\n\n\nJaguar Land Rover has opted to adopt NVIDIA's DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform and all of NVIDIA's AV offerings, which gives us greater insights into the position of each intelligent driving platform. With Qualcomm adding ADAS to its digital chassis and Intel Mobileye moving in the direction of Robo taxis from its ADAS roots, NVIDIA is \u00a0positioned for success in L4 consumer AV. Jaguar Land Rover sees that and is all-in on NVIDIA. While the first out car won\u2019t be L4 but L3, the capability is there.\n\nAll in on NVIDIA DRIVE\nThis new partnership seems to go against much of what I have said in the previous paragraphs about interoperability and putting the technology in the hands of automotive manufacturers so they may do as they will. However, it seems as though Jaguar Land Rover is placing the AV portion of its Reimagine strategy in the hands of NVIDIA, and that is not a bad thing.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nReimagine is Jaguar Land Rover's strategy to go all-electric in all of its vehicles by 2025 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across all of its supply chain, products, and operations by 2039. While ambitious, NVIDIA fits into this goal very well and has a lot to offer in terms of active safety, automated driving and parking systems, and ADAS.\n\nNVIDIA is a leader in advanced computing and AI, and its DRIVE Orin SoC and Hyperion 8 platform have a lot to show for it. Drive Orin is its SoC tailored for AV systems and its Drive Hyperion 9 platform is its modular computer architecture that includes sensors, safety systems, security systems, and networking systems. DRIVE Orin in Jaguar Land Rover vehicles will run the Jaguar Land Rover operating system. On top of NVIDIA's full AV stack, it will leverage NVIDIA DGX to train AI models and DRIVE Sim software built on NVIDIA Omniverse. NVIDIA's offerings check all the AV boxes for safety, efficiency, and the experience Jaguar Land Rover is looking for in a premium luxury vehicle.\n\n The all new Range Rover in front of the NVIDIA building. NVIDIA\nJaguar Land Rover is positioning itself to develop the intense AI and ML needed for true and reliable AV systems. NVIDIA has positioned itself as the leader in providing a high computing platform for AVs. Likewise, I think Jaguar Land Rover is a great partner for NVIDIA to be fully invested in its AV technology. Like all bleeding-edge technology, AV is a premium feature for luxury vehicles. By the time Jaguar Land Rover AVs hit the road in 2025, Jaguar Land Rover will be positioned as a luxury carmaker and a luxury all-electric carmaker. And, you cannot have an autonomous vehicle with it being all-electric.\nWrapping up\nNVIDIA and Jaguar Land Rover is a great partnership. Both are positioning themselves to be luxury L4 consumer AV leaders. While I do not think that Qualcomm or Mobileye is behind in the AV space, I do believe NVIDIA is the one who has shown enough to position itself as the leader in Consumer L4 AV. Intel Mobileye is heading in the direction of Robo taxis, and from what I have seen, Qualcomm's digital chassis is positioning itself as a leader in ADAS.\nI am excited to see what NVIDIA and Jaguar Land Rover come up with in its 2025 fleet of AV, all-electric vehicles. Both companies are working closely together to create safe, efficient, and luxurious self-driving cars with NVIDIA's full stack of AV offerings. This partnership is one to keep a close eye on.\n\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this article.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including 8x8, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Applied Micro, ARM, Aruba Networks, AT&T, AWS, A-10 Strategies, Bitfusion, Blaize, Box, Broadcom, Calix, Cisco Systems, Clear Software, Cloudera, Clumio, Cognitive Systems, CompuCom, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics, Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Frame (now VMware), Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google (Nest-Revolve), Google Cloud, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Ion VR, Inseego, Infosys, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation, MapBox, Marvell, Mavenir, Marseille Inc, Mayfair Equity, Meraki (Cisco), Mesophere, Microsoft, Mojo Networks, National Instruments, NetApp, Nightwatch, NOKIA (Alcatel-Lucent), Nortek, Novumind, NVIDIA, Nuvia, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Oracle, Poly, Panasas, Peraso, Pexip, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Poly, Portworx, Pure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus, Rayvolt E-Bikes, Red Hat, Residio, Samsung Electronics, SAP, SAS, Scale Computing, Schneider Electric, Silver Peak, SONY, Springpath, Spirent, Splunk, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, Synopsys, Tanium, TE Connectivity, TensTorrent, Tobii Technology, T-Mobile, Twitter, Unity Technologies, UiPath, Verizon Communications, Vidyo, VMware, Wave Computing, Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra, Zededa, and Zoho which may be cited in blogs and research.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The use of a smaller node dramatically alters the fundamental performance capabilities and even the essential viability of your chip. That's why industry giants like Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and Nvidia all spend billions to secure their supply. If they don\u2019t pay up, then there's no (or fewer) chips for you!According to Hardware Times, Nvidia is set to pay the exorbitant amount of nearly $10 billion to secure its share of TSMC 5nm capacity. Nvidia is geared up to produce its next generation Ada Lovelace GPU on TSMC's N5 node. Of course this next gen GPU family is likely to be referred to as the RTX 40 series. No one outside of the management of both companies knows extactly how the fees break down or the timeframe, but as noted by Hardware Times, Nvidia spent $9 billion in just the third quarter on inventory and prepayment for future products. This would indicate that Nvidia is already paying through the nose well in advance.Securing 5nm production is critical to the success of the RTX 40 series. A node shrink can deliver a combination of higher clocks and better power efficiency, and this can make the difference between winning or losing a head to head battle. Though oversimplifying things, It may be that Nvidia\u2019s use of Samsung 8nm is a reason that its products cannot clock as high as 7nm products from AMD, despite using more power.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nMSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia\n\n\n\n\nTSMC reportedly plots 2027 start date for its 3 nm US fab, but will that be in time to save next-gen GPUs from tariffs?\n\n\n\nThe other advantage the use of a smaller node offers is better yield.

More chips per wafer equals more profit.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2022The GPU shortage of 2021 may have caused gamer anxiety, but it sure didn\u2019t do Nvidia any harm, with the company reporting gaming revenue in the January quarter of $3.42 billion, up 37% from the same period a year prior.\u00a0The great hope is that mining demand is beginning to drop off, as crypto prices fall and PoW GPU mining falls out of favour, leaving more graphics cards to make their way into the hands of gamers, and not those of miners.As gamers, all we want to do is have reasonably priced options available to us when we want them. Let\u2019s hope that there\u2019s enough 5nm capacity to go around to at least satisfy gamer demand.

Follow AuthorFeb 08, 2022, 01:10pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Masayoshi Son and SoftBank will try a different exit option now that their planned sale of Arm is no ... [+] more.Getty Images\nIt was supposed to be the biggest semiconductor merger of all time. Now, it\u2019s officially fallen apart.\n\nIndustry giant Nvidia has abandoned its plans to buy Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer, a collapse that comes after many months of wrangling with antitrust enforcers. In the end, the challenges were too many to overcome. Regulators in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe had all launched separate investigations of the deal, which would have allowed Nvidia to take control of a company that licenses its designs and intellectual property to many of Nvidia\u2019s rivals. \u00a0\n\n\nThe cash-and-stock takeover was worth $40 billion when it was first announced in September 2020. Since then, Nvidia\u2019s stock price has more than doubled thanks to a boom in semiconductor demand, causing the value of the would-be transaction to soar past $60 billion. It was even higher a few months ago: The recent tech-stock rout has been unkind to Nvidia, lopping some $200 billion off its market cap.\n\nNvidia and Arm are not the first semiconductor companies to run into regulatory issues with a planned mega-deal. As high-tech chips become critical infrastructure for more and more industries\u2014including ones with serious national-security implications\u2014government watchdogs have grown increasingly wary of consolidation in the space.\n\n\nEarlier this month, Taiwan\u2019s GlobalWafers and Germany\u2019s Siltronic were forced to abandon a would-be $5 billion combination (at least for now) after German regulators failed to complete a review of the deal before the required deadline. Back in 2018, Qualcomm scuttled a $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors after failing to win regulatory approval in China. Like Nvidia and Arm\u2019s attempt, it also would have been the biggest semiconductor deal ever if it had been completed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNot every major transaction in the space, though, falls apart. There\u2019s also been a string of recent 11-figure takeovers in the sector that came to fruition. Semiconductor technology and the demands of clients are evolving so fast that it\u2019s difficult for R&D departments to keep up, making M&A an attractive option for major companies looking to expand their product offerings. \u00a0\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\n\nJust last week, regulators in China approved AMD\u2019s purchase of Xilinx, removing what\u2019s believed to be the last major hurdle for a $35 billion deal. Last August, Analog Devices bought Maxim Integrated in a move worth nearly $21 billion. Inphi and Cypress Semiconductor have both been subject to $10 billion takeovers over the past two years.\n\nThe sale of Arm to Nvidia would have been a lucrative exit for SoftBank, the Japanese tech investor that has owned Arm since conducting a $32 billion acquisition back in 2016. Instead of tens of billions of dollars, SoftBank will for now settle for $1.25 billion\u2014the value of a non-refundable deposit the company received at the deal\u2019s signing.\n\n\nBut SoftBank and CEO Masayoshi Son are already eyeing a different way to cash in. The company now plans to conduct an IPO for Arm sometime between now and next March. If and when that listing occurs, it will likely be one of the biggest public debuts so far in the 2020s. It may also be able to stake another kind of historical claim.\n\u201cWe are excited to go to Plan B,\u201d Son said of the strategic shift. \u201cPlan B is to have a big IPO, a very successful IPO, probably one of the largest IPOs in semiconductor history.\u201d\nThe biggest chip acquisition ever is dead. The biggest chip IPO ever might be next.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

For the past year or so, it's been difficult for anyone to get hold of a new Nvidia or AMD product, and with team red recently announcing the RDNA 3, the next era of the graphics technology is fast approaching. In an effort to combat the potential issues down the line, it seems as though team green is eager to make sure it can make its next range of cards. \nIn a recent report from Hardware Times, Nvidia has spent around $9 billion dollars in a bid to secure 5nm chips from TSMC for the company's upcoming 4000 series. Compare this to last year, during the same quarter, in which Jensen Huang and co spent $2.54 billion. With everything that's been going on with this generation, and the difficulty with which it's been to produce and sell GPUs, it's not too surprising that the tech giant is taking steps to ensure it has a better chance of meeting supply with demand once the next generation kicks in.\nRELATED: Nvidia Refusing to Disclose Further Details About the Elusive RTX 3090 Ti\nLate last year, it was rumored that the Nvidia 4000 series could be out in the middle of this year. However, the report goes on to say that it's looking more like Lovelace will be available September time, so that's more towards the latter parts of Q3. The question will be whether or not tech companies, graphics card or otherwise, will be able to make amends as, while the deficit continues to rage on, there is the possibility that things may start to improve over the coming months, though no one can be 100% certain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel believes the semiconductor shortage could go on until 2023, so that means that, providing the next generation of GPUs hits this year, there is likely to still be some problems at the manufacturing end, which will affect the consumer market of course. On top of Nvidia spending billions for 5nm chips, Intel has also said it wants to produce \"millions\" of its Arc cards to combat the ongoing difficulties.\nWith graphics cards now starting to come down in price a bit, though still a long way from MSRP, there's still some pessimism in the industry. However, given the knowledge of what's been going on, Nvidia looking to secure components for the 4000 series could make things a little bit easier. Whether it will actually work remains to be seen.\nMORE: With the GPU Shortage, Gaming Laptops and Pre-Builts Are The Only Alternative\nSource: Hardware Times \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSave on GameSir Cyclone 2, a Wireless Controller With Hall Effect Triggers and Customization Features\n\t\t\n\n\nGame Deals\n\nThe GameSir Cyclone 2 controller is now more affordable, offering precise input and multiple connectivity options.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatti Robinson\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSony Working on PlayStation Controller With Unique Feature\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCharming Holiday\n\n\nMar 11, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro is Even More Expensive Outside the US\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIncredible Xbox Series X Deal Found at Pawn Shop\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nSarah Fields\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Launch Sales Numbers Compared to PS4 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGabriel Machado Pureza\n\n\nNov 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAtari Reveals New Console\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nOph\u00e9lie Castelot\n\n\nAug 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDestiny 2 Weekly Reset: New Nightfall, Challenges, and Rewards\n\t\t\n\n\nDestiny 2\n\nThe weekly reset for Destiny 2 is live and here are all of the new details including Nightfall strike, seasonal missions, challenges, and much more.\n\n\nPosts\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAfter TMNT, the Sky is the Limit for Call of Duty Collabs\n\t\t\n\n\nCall of Duty\n\nCall of Duty has been home some pretty out-there collaborations, but after its most recent TMNT crossover, the sky is now the limit.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOne Piece: Why Didn\u2019t The World Government Stop Luffy Faster?\n\t\t\n\n\nOne Piece\n\nWhy didn't the World Government stop Luffy before he became so strong?\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Avoid Taking Fall Damage in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nNaoe and Yasuke can die from fall damage in Assassin's Creed Shadows, both directly and indirectly, but there are ways to avoid or minimize it.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Reach the Highest Point on the Map in Assassin's Creed Shadows (Happy Place)\n\t\t\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nThe highest point on the map in Assassin's Creed Shadows is Mount Hakkyo, which is on the southeastern border of the Yamato province.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Legend of Zelda Series is Begging for a Total Reboot Focused on One Character\n\t\t\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda\n\nIf Nintendo ever decides to reboot the Legend of Zelda franchise, then there is one character who could make such a move work.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Get A Ranged Weapon for Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Microsoft is Not Releasing an Xbox Rival to the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssassin's Creed Shadows Isn't the Only Reason March 20 is an Important Day for Video Games\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Team\nOur Audience\nAbout Us\nPress & Events\nContact Us\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nCareers\nTerms\nPrivacy\nPolicies\n\n\nGame Rant is part of the\n                            Valnet Publishing Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Valnet Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While no decision has been made on where to list the company, it is understood that the US is favoured as it generally results in higher valuations for technology stocks.Many of Arm\u2019s extensive client base said that takeover by Nvidia would end its status as the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, with the US company able to control the technology and licensing of chip designs to rivals.In 2018, the US company Qualcomm abandoned its $44bn, two-year pursuit of the Dutch chip maker NXP after failing to secure approval in China, a victim of a trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorArmComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If the acquisition had gone through, it would have given Nvidia control of a company whose chip designs are used by those major companies and others around the globe, including Amazon, Huawei and Apple.\nWhen mergers and acquisitions cross geographic boundaries, regulators apply more scrutiny, said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester. In the U.S., President Joe Biden has pushed for greater crackdowns on anticompetitive deals, and the FTC has responded with enhanced oversight as well as a review of current merger guidelines.\n\n\n\nAfter facing heightened regulatory scrutiny, Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of chip designer Arm Ltd. has been called off.\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the U.S. applied pressure to the deal, with the FTC suing to block the merger in December 2021. Meanwhile, other governments including the U.K. and European Union applied even more pressure than the U.S., O'Donnell said. As the chip shortage continues to be a problem, there is a growing focus on localizing chip production, and the U.K. wanted to keep one of the world's top chip design companies in house.\n\"Political desires to foster technology on their home turf are the major drivers for this new atmosphere,\" O'Donnell said. \"But recent supply chain vulnerabilities obviate a need to bring better geographic balance to the supply.\"\n\nChip shortage led to greater scrutiny\nSupply chain vulnerabilities and the hit to semiconductor chip production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused countries to become more sensitive about the global balance of production, O'Donnell said.\nCurrently, the semiconductor manufacturing market is concentrated in Asia, where roughly 80% of chips are made. Both the U.S. and EU have increased their efforts to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing back to their shores, which brought more pressure to the Nvidia-Arm acquisition, he said.\n\n\n\n    I see the collapse of this deal as a win for the U.K., where Arm is based. \n   \n\nGlenn O'Donnellanalyst, Forrester\n   \n\n\n\n\"I see the collapse of this deal as a win for the U.K., where Arm is based, and for competitors like Intel and AMD,\" O'Donnell said.\nThe deal was ultimately doomed because it concerned access to chip designs used in everything from cell phones to data centers, said Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder of analyst firm Deep Analysis. He said there was also concern Nvidia could restrict access to those designs.\nHeavy regulatory scrutiny affected this acquisition, but Pelz-Sharpe said it's debatable if this level of scrutiny will affect future mega deals.\n\"How much of a bellwether this is remains to be seen,\" he said. \"It may just be a one-off, but there is a widening gap between regulators and their concerns on either side of the Atlantic, so this could embolden [similar] challenges in the future.\"\nMakenzie Holland is a news writer covering big tech and federal regulation.

However, despite similar list prices, the RTX 3060 is now being sold for considerably more than the RX 6600 due to stock shortages. If you want a rock-solid 1080p GPU and price doesn't matter, this is it.\n\nForIncredible 1080p performanceCan handle 1440pGreat valuePower efficientAgainstNot good for crypto miningCosts more than the RX 6600 at most retailers\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 6600\n\n\n $304.65 at Amazon $349.99 at HP US Check Walmart\nAMD's counterpunch AMD's Radeon RX 6600 costs quite a bit less than the NVIDIA RTX 3060, and it offers similar raw performance.

Still, it costs quite a bit less and still crushes 1080p gaming.\n\nForQuiet under loadExcellent 1080p performanceGood valueGreat efficiencyCosts less than the RTX 3060 at most retailersAgainstWeak ray tracing, no DLSS\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 and the AMD Radeon RX 6600 are both popular options for anyone who wants to squash 1080p gaming. Though they were both released with the same $329 list price, stock shortages and scalping have driven up prices at most retailers. As it stands at the time of writing, the RX 6600 can be purchased for hundreds of dollars less.NVIDIA RTX 3060 vs. AMD RX 6600 tech specsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060AMD Radeon RX 6600ArchitectureAmpereRDNA 2Shader/stream3,5841,792Tensor/TMU112112RT/ray2828Clock1,320MHz1,626MHzBoost clock1,780MHz2,491MHzMemory12GB GDDR68GB GDDR6Bus width192-bit128-bitTransistors13.25 billion11.06 billionNodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 7nmTDP170W132WRecommended PSU550W300WSlot sizeTwoTwoNVIDIA RTX 3060 vs. AMD RX 6600 performanceThe RTX 3060 and the RX 6600 have feature sets \u2014 including Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), and ray tracing \u2014 that differ, but raw performance is similar. If you're searching for a cheap GPU that can handle 1080p and don't care much about the extra features (which I cover in the next section), the RX 6600 is the go-to pick while GPU prices remain distorted due to stock shortages and scalping. You can generally find it for hundreds less.Running 3DMark synthetic benchmarks, the RX 6600 actually edges out the RTX 3060 in everything but Time Spy and Port Royal (which measures ray-tracing capabilities). That makes sense, as NVIDIA's ray tracing is far more mature at this point compared to AMD.Getting into actual gaming performance, we measured a bunch of games at 1440p to check the top-end performance of these cards. Performance is almost on par in real-world gaming, with the RTX 3060 eking out a few more frames than the RX 6600.Image 1 of 10These are some of the best graphics cards for 1080p gaming, and you should expect to see high frame rates from both cards. Neither card is going to be great at ray tracing, but the RTX 3060 will deliver a better result. One other thing to note is that the RTX 3060 comes with 12GB of VRAM, while the RX 6600 comes with 8GB of VRAM. This likely won't impact much, unless you're planning on keeping this card for as long as possible. In that case, more VRAM might come in handy down the road.NVIDIA RTX 3060 vs. AMD RX 6600 featuresSource: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)Each of these mid-range GPUs comes packed with its respective set of features. On NVIDIA's side, ray tracing and DLSS are a potent combination that can make your games look better, boost performance considerably, or both at the same time. NVIDIA's ray-tracing capabilities are more mature; if you are focusing on realistic lighting, stick with NVIDIA.AMD also has ray tracing, though performance isn't up to snuff with NVIDIA. And on the DLSS side, AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution is a worthy competitor, though it's not yet available in as many games. I wrote an article comparing AMD's FSR with NVIDIA's DLSS for a deeper look at the two technologies.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Source: AMD (Image credit: Source: AMD)There's also AMD's Radeon Super Resolution (RSR), which is coming Q1 2022 as a complement to FSR. It's a spatial upscaling technique similar to FSR, but it's available in far more games due to its implementation at a driver level. My article comparing Radeon Super Resolution and FidelityFX Super Resolution has more information.To make things even more confusing, NVIDIA answered with Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR). It's an upgrade to older tech, but the bottom line is that it can make your games look better by rendering at a higher resolution before downscaling to fit your monitor's native resolution. It only works on RTX cards, but its driver-level implementation means it can work in pretty much any game. My comparison of NVIDIA DLSS vs. DSR vs. DLDSR can help to further decipher all these acronyms.AMD is gaining ground on NVIDIA in terms of extra features, though NVIDIA is still out front. That's even before getting into things like NVIDIA Studio and NVIDIA Broadcast. If you're focused more on the price-to-performance ratio, the AMD RX 6600 is the clear winner due to wonky pricing. But if you're more interested in using all the extra features that NVIDIA has to offer, you're not going to lose out on any performance by going with the RTX 3060.\n\n\n\nMonster at 1080p\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n $392.66 at Amazon $409.75 at Amazon $699 at Walmart\nThe NVIDIA RTX 3060 is going to cost you more in the current GPU market, but its feature set is still superior to that which comes with the RX 6600.
