Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: \"Apple and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index\u2019s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. NVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).

Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has achieved significant financial gains from her recent investment in Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a prominent company in artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors. On Nov. 22, Pelosi acquired 50 call options for Nvidia with a strike price of $120, expiring on Dec. 20, 2024. The transaction value ranged between $1 million and $5 million\u200b\u200b.  As of early 2024, Pelosi has reportedly made nearly $500,000 from this investment, surpassing her annual government salary of approximately $223,500. This gain is attributed to Nvidia\u2019s stock performance, which has seen an increase of over 21% in value since Pelosi\u2019s acquisition\u200b\u200b, according to Finbold.

How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.  Pelosi\u2019s investment in Nvidia has drawn attention because of her track record of successful trades in Congress. Along with her husband, a venture capitalist, Pelosi has made substantial profits from trading call options in various blue-chip companies. However, her stock trades often face scrutiny, with some accusing her of using insider information to make lucrative trades\u200b\u200b. Pelosi\u2019s investment decisions and their timing have been a topic of debate. While some criticize her for potential insider trading, others commend her strategic investment choices. The rise in Nvidia\u2019s stock value, partly because of the high demand for its chips in AI computing, has contributed significantly to Pelosi\u2019s recent financial success from this investment\u200b\u200b.  Nvidia has impacted sectors like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, semiconductors and gaming. Founded in 1993, the company has evolved from a primary focus on high-end gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) to a broad presence in autonomous vehicles and data centers. In fiscal 2023, the company\u2019s financial performance was outstanding, with a third-quarter revenue of $18.1 billion and a net income of $9.2 billion. This success is largely because of its strategic focus on AI and accelerated computing, with key products like the H100 GPU and the Grace Hopper H200 AI Superchip. Nvidia\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Azure for cloud-based AI solutions and its significant data center revenue growth demonstrates its strong position in the tech industry\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Nvidia\u2019s success and growth offer valuable insights and opportunities for startups. As Nvidia demonstrates, focusing on cutting-edge technologies and strategic collaborations can drive significant growth and market leadership. For startups, particularly those in tech industries, Nvidia\u2019s approach highlights the importance of innovation, adaptability and strategic partnerships.   Story Continues Investing in startups offers the potential for significant financial returns, especially in high-growth sectors like technology and AI, akin to Nvidia\u2019s success in these fields.Don\u2019t Miss:Average retirement income in America has been revealed \u2013 Will you make enough each month?

Growth stocks have rewarded investors over the past several years, thanks to the hyper growth and mind-numbing expansion of technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Data from the CFA Institute showed that since the end of the financial crisis, growth stocks outperformed value stocks by 144% through June 2018. The study highlighted that this massive outperformance was not a \"fluke\" since most of the growth stocks studied were trading at decent valuation multiples during 2009 and they also saw earnings growth during the period which was analyzed in the study.  In theory, growth stocks tend to underperform during a high interest rate environment when investors turn to realistic valuations and move away from risky assets. But what happened last year was the opposite of this. That means Mr. Market really cares about AI and the impact it is creating. That's why investors are still happy to buy technology stocks trading at higher multiples. Many analysts believe we are going through the beginning of the AI revolution and the AI products and services mega-cap technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0are making will have far-reaching consequences on human progress. Can Growth Stocks Continue to Outperform in 2024? Financial markets defied all expectations last year and avoided the much-feared recession. But will the AI-related euphoria and economic resilience help the stock market this year? UBS said in its 2024 market outlook report that it would be \"historically unusual\" if the US economy ends up avoiding recession after the rate hikes of 2022 and 2023. But the report said there is a reason for optimism this time as UBS expects no significant economic contraction in 2024 even though it sees a slowdown in growth. Should You Invest in Quality Stocks with Higher Multiples? In this environment, UBS recommended investors to pile into quality stocks. The firm said quality stocks can have higher valuations on a relative basis but it said quality stocks would be worth paying for this year. \"Quality stocks have historically outperformed in the late stages of the business cycle, including in periods of economic contraction, which should offer portfolio protection if the economy slows more than we expect. The quality tilt also aligns with our preference for US technology companies, which should be among the key beneficiaries of AI-related demand for both hardware and software. Quality stocks typically have higher valuations than the overall index, but we think that quality is worth paying for in 2024. Investors can find quality stocks within US tech; stable quality-income and high-quality cyclical stocks in Europe; and in select names in Asia.\"    Story Continues   Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On  Israel Englander of Millennium ManagementMethodologyIn this backdrop, we decided to see which stocks with extreme revenue growth are on the radar of billionaire investors.\u00a0 For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with EPS growth of over 30% over the past five years, sales growth of over 25% over the past five years and quarter-over-quarter sales growth of over 25% posted in the most recent quarters.

Can it repeat that feat?\n\nThe past five years have been rewarding for Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) investors. The semiconductor specialist's stock is a solid multibagger, turning a January 2019 investment of $1,000 into $14,550 as of this writing.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nThis terrific jump in Nvidia's stock price over the past decade can be attributed to the outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings. This growth is fueled by multiple catalysts, including the booming demand for gaming hardware, the growing demand for high-performance computing applications, the increasing deployment of semiconductors in cars, and now the need for graphics cards for training artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nThe good part is that Nvidia is setting itself up to deliver even stronger returns over the next five years through its aggressive product roadmap, which should allow it to capitalize on multiple multi-billion-dollar opportunities. It's worth noting that the company pointed out a couple of years ago that it sees a $1 trillion revenue opportunity across several end markets such as automotive, gaming, enterprise software, and chips and systems.\nGiven that it's on track to finish fiscal 2024 (which will end this month) with $59 billion in revenue, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth accelerating big time over the next decade as it dives deeper into its addressable market. Let's look at the reasons why that may happen and where the stock could be after five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is growing at an eye-popping pace that shows no signs of slowing\nWhen Nvidia reported its fiscal 2019 results five years ago, the company generated annual revenue of $11.7 billion. So, Nvidia's revenue is on track to increase 5 times in a space of five years considering its fiscal 2024 forecast, translating into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%. A similar CAGR over the next five years would take Nvidia's annual revenue to a whopping $295 billion in fiscal 2029.\nHowever, certain Wall Street analysts believe that Nvidia could do even better. Take Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, for example. He predicts that Nvidia could generate annual revenue of $300 billion in 2027 from selling AI chips alone, thanks to having a solid 75% share of this fast-growing market. While that may seem outrageous at first, a closer look at the market for AI chips indicates that Nvidia could indeed hit that ambitious mark.\nIt's well known that Nvidia is the biggest player in one of the hottest tech niches right now -- AI chips -- which has allowed the company to record a terrific jump in revenue and earnings over the past year.\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this market for AI chips is at the beginning of a huge growth curve. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices estimates that the market for AI accelerators could jump to $400 billion in 2027, a big jump from last year's estimate of $45 billion. Citi analysts expect Nvidia to maintain a giant 90% share of this market over the next two to three years, despite the efforts its rivals are making to cut Nvidia's lead in this market.\nThat's because Nvidia has doubled down on the pace of innovation in AI chips, which should help it maintain a solid share of this market in the long run. As such, the possibility of Nvidia indeed generating $300 billion in annual revenue from AI chip sales after five years cannot be ruled out. It can hit that mark even if its share falls to 75% -- as Rakesh suggests -- considering that the overall AI chip market size is anticipated to hit $400 billion as per AMD's estimates.\nThe good news is that Nvidia is looking to flex its muscles beyond the AI accelerator market. The company recently revealed new consumer-focused graphics cards people can use to run AI applications right on their desktops and laptops for gaming, creating large language models (LLMs), customizing generative AI models, and even inferencing applications. For instance, Nvidia claims that its new RTX 4080 Super graphics card \"generates AI video 1.5x faster -- and images 1.7x faster -- than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU.\"\nGiven that the demand for devices that can run AI at the edge -- such as smartphones, personal computers, and cameras -- is expected to clock annual growth of 26% through 2032 and generate $143 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, Nvidia is doing the right thing by tapping this market early.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, considering the other notable catalysts that Nvidia could benefit from, it won't be surprising to see the company's top line head closer to $300 billion after five years. If that's indeed the case, investors can expect the stock to deliver outstanding gains once again over the coming five years.\n\nInvestors can expect the stock to make them richer\nNvidia has a five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 20. As we are assuming that the company's revenue growth over the next five years can match the rate it has clocked in the past five, we can expect Nvidia to maintain its average sales multiple over the next five years as well. Based on a top line of $300 billion after five years, a sales multiple of 20 points toward a market cap of a whopping $6 trillion. That would be way higher than Nvidia's current market cap of around $1.35 trillion.\nHowever, Nvidia carries a discounted forward price-to-sales ratio of 14. Assuming a similar multiple after five years means that its market cap could increase to $4.2 trillion using the $300 billion revenue estimate. Again, that points toward a 3x jump in Nvidia's stock price over the next five years.\nAll this indicates that investors can expect Nvidia to jump substantially over the next five years and multiply their investments once again, making it a top growth stock to buy right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitigroup is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

The company has also been going strong since January 1 and is up 15.46% in the first weeks of 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n40 mins ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Source: Finbold\nNVDA stock even helped certain market-minded politicians significantly boost their already major 2023 returns.\nStill, as with most things in life, New Year 2024 is full of promise, but also few guarantees that it will be smooth sailing from start to finish, and deciding whether or not to invest in Nvidia requires careful analysis of many factors.\nIs buying NVDA a good idea in 2024?\nAt the onset of 2024, Nvidia\u2019s stock appears to be one of the most obvious winning buys for any savvy investor.\u00a0\nThe company is an important player in the microchip industry and has \u2013 along with other infrastructure providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) through its AWS cloud service \u2013 been a major beneficiary of the opening stages of the AI boom.\nNvidia is also set to start shipping its most advanced microchip to date \u2013 the H200 \u2013 and has, at least at surface level, successfully navigated the challenges stemming from new restrictions on exports to China.\nDespite its strong 2023 performance, the semiconductor giant was even considered one of the cheapest big tech stocks in mid-December.\nChallenges ahead for NVDA stock?\nDespite all of these positive factors, certain challenges persist. The first of these comes in the form of the reported reluctance of Chinese companies to settle for microchips modified to comply with the new restrictions.\nFurthermore, certain long-standing customers of Nvidia, such as Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) have been taking steps throughout 2023 to reduce their dependence on the American company.\nAdditionally, the current geopolitical situation is permeated by instability, and certain ongoing events \u2013 such as the partial blockade of the Red Sea \u2013 present a danger to global supply chains.\nFinally, the most recent inflation figures have somewhat dampened hopes for economic recovery and a swift decrease in interest rates \u2013 and indeed, certain major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) believe investors are likely to be disappointed in 2024.\nDo Wall Street analysts recommend buying NVDA?\nAll in all, despite the continued existence of some uncertainties, the 53 analysts taken into account by TradingView are almost unanimous in recommending Nvida\u2019s shares to investors and traders.\nAs many as 41 believe the tech company to be a \u201cstrong buy\u201d and another 8 mark it as a \u201cbuy.\u201d Only 4 analysts believe Nvidia is a \u201chold,\u201d and none of the 53 recommend selling the stock.\nNVDA analyst recommendations. Source: TradingView\nThe 12-month price targets for the company are also largely bullish. The average forecast predicts a 19.59% upside, estimating that NVDA will enter 2025 worth approximately $666.\nThe most optimistic analysts are even more bullish and see the shares of the chip-maker reaching as high as $1,100 before the year is out, while the more cautious among them see a downside of 26.26% and a decline to $410.\nNVDA technicals.

Available in a few days, streamers will be able to stream multiple encodes concurrently, providing optimal viewing experiences for all viewers.\u00a0\nTwitch Enhanced Broadcasting\nToday, many streamers must choose between higher resolution and reliable streaming. High-quality video provides more enjoyable viewing experiences but causes streams to buffer for viewers with low bandwidth or older viewing devices. Streaming lower-bitrate video allows more people to watch the content seamlessly, but introduces artifacts.\nTwitch \u2014 the interactive livestreaming platform \u2014 provides server-side transcoding for top-performing channels, meaning it will create different versions of the same stream for different bandwidth levels, improving the viewing experience. But the audience of many channels are left with a single stream option.\nTwitch, OBS and NVIDIA have collaborated on a new feature to address this \u2014 Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting, releasing in beta later this month. Using the high-quality dedicated encoder (NVENC) in modern GeForce RTX and GTX GPUs, streamers will be able to broadcast up to three resolutions simultaneously at up to 1080p.\n\nIn the coming months, Enhanced Broadcasting beta testers will be able to experiment with higher-input bit rates, up to 4K resolutions, up to 5 concurrent streams, as well as new codecs. The new codecs include the latest-generation AV1 for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which provides 40% more encoding efficiency than H.264, and HEVC for previous-generation GeForce GPUs.\nTwitch Enhanced Broadcasting releasing in beta later this month.\nTo simplify set up, Enhanced Broadcasting will automatically configure all OBS encoder settings, including resolution, bit rate and encoding parameters. A server-side algorithm will return the best possible configuration for OBS Studio based on the streamer\u2019s setup, taking the headaches out of tuning settings for the best viewer experiences.\nUsing the dedicated NVENC hardware encoder, streamers can achieve the highest quality video across streaming bitrates, with minimal impact to app and game performance.\nSign up for the Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting beta today at twitch.tv/broadcast. Twitch will enroll participants on a first-come, first-served basis, starting later this month. Once a creator has been enrolled in the beta, they\u2019ll receive an email with additional instructions.\nTo further elevate livestreams, download the NVIDIA Broadcast app, free for RTX GPU owners and powered by dedicated AI Tensor Cores, to augment broadcast capabilities for microphones and cameras.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

According to Economic Daily News, NVIDIA is also providing advanced packaging services to Intel, with a monthly capacity of about 5,000 units. It is expected to join NVIDIA\u2019s advanced packaging supply chain as early as the second quarter in 2024, grabbing a share of TSMC\u2019s related orders.\nIndustry sources cited by the Economic Daily News\u00a0believe that Intel\u2019s participation will help alleviate the tight supply of AI chips.\nTSMC declined to comment on the rumors on January 30th. As per industry sources cited by Economic Daily News, Intel\u2019s entry into NVIDIA\u2019s advanced packaging supply chain is expected to lead to a significant increase of nearly ten percent in total production capacity.\nAs per\u00a0industry analysis cited in the report, even with Intel joining to provide advanced packaging capacity for NVIDIA, TSMC remains NVIDIA\u2019s primary supplier for advanced packaging. When considering the expanded production capacity of TSMC and other related assembly and testing partners, it is estimated that they will supply approximately 90% of advanced packaging capacity for NVIDIA.\nSupply chain sources cited by the report further indicate that TSMC is ramping up its advanced packaging production capacity. Production capacity is estimated to increase to nearly 50,000 units in the first quarter of this year, representing a 25% increase from the estimated nearly 40,000 units in December last year.\nWhile Intel may potentially provide NVIDIA with nearly 5,000 units of advanced packaging capacity, this accounts for about 10% of the total. However, Intel is reportedly not involved in NVIDIA\u2019s AI chip foundry orders.\nIntel has advanced packaging capacity in Oregon and New Mexico in the United States and is actively expanding its advanced packaging capabilities in its new facility in Penang. It is noteworthy that Intel previously stated its intention to offer customers the option to only use its advanced packaging solutions, expected to provide customers with greater production flexibility.\nIndustry sources also indicate that the previous shortage of AI chips stemmed from three main factors: insufficient capacity in advanced packaging, tight supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3), and some cloud service providers placing duplicate orders. However, these bottlenecks have gradually been resolved, and the improvement rate is better than expected.\n(Photo credit: Intel)\nRead more\n\n[News] Intense Competition with Samsung and Intel in Advanced Processes; TSMC Speeds Up 2nm Progress\n\n\n\nPlease note that this article cites information from Economic Daily News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Intel\n Nvidia\n TSMC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Article \n[News] Semiconductor Equipment Sales in Japan Reach Nearly JPY 3.3 Trillion in 2023\n \n\nNext Article \n[News] Flash Memory May Enter the Era of 280 Layers, and There\u2019s More to Come\n \n\n\n\nSubject\n\n Latest \n Semiconductors \n Display \n Optical Semiconductors \n Energy \n Consumer Electronics \n Telecommunications \n Emerging Technologies \n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[News] Applied Materials Faces $400M Revenue Loss as Part of Maintenance Services Halted in China\n\n\n2025.02.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[News] TSMC Reportedly Advancing Groundbreaking for Third Arizona Fab to June\n\n\n2025.02.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[News] China's Three 10-Billion-RMB Semiconductor Projects Advance Progress\n\n\n2025.02.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nSite Map\nAbout Us\nResearch Report\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nMembership Terms & Conditions\nCareers at TrendForce\nContact Us\n\n\n\n            \u00a9 2025 TrendForce Corp.

It also said electric vehicles are using its automated driving system. Li Auto (LI) and other EV makers have selected Nvidia Drive Thor for their fleets.\nShares broke out on the news and have rallied more than 5% from a buy point of 505.48. That puts the stock on track to becoming the fourth-biggest company by market cap.\nThe leader in AI chips rallied 239% in 2023 and hit an all-time high 505.48 just before the year ended. Then it topped, the 505.48 buy point of its base in heavy volume on Jan. 8.\nThe company is expected to release its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb. 21.\nNVDA Stock: Third-Quarter Earnings\nShares broke out of a double-bottom base just ahead of third-quarter earnings in November.\nA week before reporting results, Nvidia announced at the SC23 supercomputing conference in Denver a new artificial intelligence computing platform and an advanced data-center chip. That sent the stock to its all-time high.\nDespite a blockbuster quarter, shares fell after the earnings report. The company said profits came in at $4.02 a share on sales of $18.12 billion for the period that ended Oct. 29. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $3.37 a share on sales of $16.19 billion.\nCompared with the year-ago quarter, Nvidia earnings soared 593%, while sales saw a 206% spike. The period was also the second-straight quarter in which the chip leader reported triple-digit growth in both metrics.\nDemand from data centers was the chief reason. Nvidia\u2019s data-center sales jumped 279% from the year-earlier period to a record $14.51 billion. Data-center sales also increased 41% from the second quarter.\nWhen it filed its earnings report, Nvidia projected sales of $20 billion for the fourth quarter ending in January. That translates to 231% growth from the prior year, and came in ahead of analyst views for $17.96 billion.\nNVDA stock analysts now expect 236% growth in per-share earnings to $11.22 for fiscal 2024, which ends this month. After that, Wall Street sees profit growth sharply decelerating to 67% in fiscal 2025.\nAI Products Drive Growth But Competitors Catch Up\nNvidia has earned a reputation for being a trailblazer. The company was an early pioneer in the graphics processors that many say drastically improved computer gaming. Along with gaming, Nvidia chips now are used in such industries as health care, automobiles and robotics.\nSee also\u00a0 Unlocking the Future of Commerce: How PayPal is Making Crypto More AccessibleIn March, generative AI took a leap with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. According to the company, Nvidia\u2019s AI-capable supercomputer paved the way for the \u201ciPhone moment of AI.\u201d\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. After three quarters of declining year-over-year sales and four quarters of tapering earnings, the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the two most recent quarters.\nBut other chip companies have been fast to catch up. In December, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) launched a new AI chip that competes with Nvidia\u2019s advanced products.\nTop Ratings For Nvidia\nNvidia stock shows exceptional technical strength and boasts a best-possible score of 99 on both its Composite Rating and EPS Rating. Its Relative Strength Rating of 97 also shows that it outperforms the vast majority of stocks in the Investor\u2019s Business Daily database.\nNvidia also is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led the 2023 stock rally. The other stocks are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN). Some of these tech titans are customers that rely on Nvidia\u2019s advanced chips. It is also one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven of 2024.\u201d\nNVDA stock currently ranks first in the fabless semiconductor group, which holds 39th place among IBD\u2019s 197 industry groups. The AI stock frequently appears on the IBD 50, IBD Sector Leaders and Tech Leaders lists. Further, the stock is on IBD Leaderboard.\nIn November, NVDA stock jumped 15% and outperformed the Nasdaq\u2019s 10.70% gain. But in December, it finished up 6%, just above the Nasdaq\u2019s 5.5% advance for the month.\nIs NVDA A Stock A Buy?\nCritically, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating for NVDA stock is D+. That shows that interest among institutional buyers in the last 13 weeks has waned.\nDespite a strong third quarter and positive growth outlook, funds have not been net investors in the stock. That shows there may be better opportunities out there.\nStill, overall worldwide AI chip revenue will grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, according to a recent report from research firm Gartner. That is set to double by 2027 to $119 billion\nFurther, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reportedly has a price target of 700 for the AI leader. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also finds that company\u2019s valuation attractive and has the same price target.\nNVDA stock is not a buy right now. Shares are extended from a buy zone that originated from a flat base\u2019s 505.48 entry.\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\nTICKER\nMARKET CAP IN BILLIONS\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\nMSFT\n$2,935\n\n\nApple\nAAPL\n$2,942\n\n\nAlphabet\nGOOGL\n$1,815\n\n\nAmazon.com\nAMZN\n$1,586\n\n\nNvidia\nNVDA\n$1,415\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\n\nHow Can Businesses Choose Between HITRUST and SOC 2 Certification?\n\nby The FINANCIAL March 4, 2025 0 \n\nBusinesses dealing with sensitive information must meet strict security and compliance rules.

So, let\u2019s analyze what lies ahead for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) in the chip landscape this year. Read on to know more\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mangeet Kaur Bouns Jan 23, 2024  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Stories\n\n\u2022 Has the Next Bear Market Already Arrived?\n\u2022 How Low Will Stocks Go?\n\u2022 Why is Stock Market Outlook So Uncertain?\n\u2022 Trump or the Fed More Important to Stock Investors?\n\u2022 Investors in \u201cWait and See\u201d Mode\nView All Top stories\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe semiconductor industry\u2019s 2024 outlook appears promising, driven by the recovery in demand, especially in two prominent end markets, PCs and smartphones and numerous technological innovations. Moreover, the heightened attention to the strategic importance of chip manufacturing to national and economic security is a crucial catalyst of the industry\u2019s growth.\nAmid this backdrop, fundamentally sound chip stock Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) seems well-poised to capitalize on the industry\u2019s tailwinds. However, given its mixed prospects, investors could wait for a better entry point in NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).\nSemiconductors are a crucial component in multiple applications across end-use sectors, including consumer electronics, automotive, computing, networking and communications, industrial equipment, healthcare, military, and clean energy. In addition, the growing popularity of technologies like AI, machine learning, and IoT will offer growth opportunities to chip companies.\nIn 2023, the semiconductor industry had a challenging year, the seventh downturn since 1990, with sales projected to decline 9.4% (to $520 billion) for the year. However, the industry is well-positioned to rebound in 2024, with global chip sales reaching an impressive $588 billion, indicating a 13% year-over-year growth. The memory sector is a vital driver of this growth.\n\n\nIn terms of end markets, both PC and smartphone sales are anticipated to increase by 4% this year, following declines of 14% and 3.5% in 2023, respectively. Returning to growth for these two end-use sectors is very important for the semiconductor industry.\nAs we enter 2024, semiconductor companies will increasingly emphasize on product innovations, targeting developments in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) and boosting demand for high-performance GPUs in data centers and high-performance computing (HPC).\nAccording to Deloitte, the market for AI chips appears to be strong in 2024 and is predicted to reach more than $50 billion in sales for the year or 8.5% of the value of all chips to be sold. In the long term, some forecasts suggest that AI chips (mainly gene AI chips) could total $400 billion in sales by 2027.\nFavorable government initiatives further drive the chip industry\u2019s prospects. In August 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS Act of 2022 into a law that allocated about $52.70 billion over the next five years to boost domestic manufacturing and research and development (R&D) of semiconductors.\n3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR\u201cResurgent market demand and increased government incentives worldwide are powering an upsurge in fab investments in key chipmaking regions and the projected 6.4% rise in global capacity for 2024,\u201d said Ajit Manocha, SEMI President and CEO.\nAs per SEMI\u2019s latest quarterly World Fab Forecast report, the global semiconductor capacity is projected to rise by 6.4% this year to reach record high 30 million wafers per month (wpm) mark for the first time after increasing 5.5% to 29.6 wpm in 2023.\nGiven the industry trends in mind, let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of the two Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stocks.\nStock to Hold:\n\n\nStock #2: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\nNVDA designs and manufactures computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software.

From its hub in Singapore, the company has operations that stretch from Australia to India.\nTrusted Engines of AI\nThe new data centers will act as trusted engines of generative AI. The most transformative technology of our time, generative AI and its ability to amplify human intelligence and productivity are attracting users worldwide.\nNations are creating large language models tuned to their local dialects, cultures and practices. Singtel sits at the center of such opportunities among Southeast Asia\u2019s vibrant Chinese, Indian, Malay and other communities.\nSingtel\u2019s initiative supports Singapore\u2019s national AI strategy to empower its citizens with the latest technology. The plan calls for significantly expanding the country\u2019s compute infrastructure as well as its talent pool of machine learning specialists.\nFor businesses in the region, having a known, local provider of these computationally intensive services provides a safe, easy on-ramp to generative AI. They can enhance and personalize their products and services while protecting sensitive corporate data.\nTaking the Green Path\nSingtel is committed to democratizing AI and decarbonizing its operations.\nIts latest data centers are being built with an eye to sustainability, including in the selection of materials and use of liquid cooling. They adopt best practices to deliver less than 1.3 in PUE, the power usage effectiveness metric for data center efficiency.\nSingtel will use its Paragon software platform to orchestrate how the new AI applications work in concert with its mobile and broadband services. The combination will enable edge computing services like powering robots and other autonomous systems from AI models running in the cloud.\nA Full-Stack Foundation\nThe company will offer its customers NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform for building and deploying AI applications, including generative AI. Singtel will also be an NVIDIA Cloud Partner, delivering optimized AI services on the NVIDIA platform.\nBecause Singtel\u2019s data centers use NVIDIA\u2019s proven reference architectures for AI computing, users can employ its services, knowing they\u2019re optimized for leading AI performance.\nSingtel already has hands-on experience delivering edge services with NVIDIA AI.\nLast May, it demonstrated a digital avatar created with the NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA NeMo platforms that users could interact with over its 5G network. And in 2021, Singtel delivered GPU services as part of a testbed for local government agencies.\nNew AI Role for Telcos\nSingapore\u2019s service provider joins pioneers in France, India, Italy and Switzerland deploying AI factories that deliver generative AI services with data sovereignty.\nTo learn more about how Singtel and other telcos are embracing generative AI, register for a session on the topic at NVIDIA GTC.

Using the power of Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs, RTX Video HDR allows GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their HDR panel\u2019s ability to display more vivid, dynamic colors, preserving intricate details that may be inadvertently rendered unidentifiable due to video compression.\nRTX Video HDR and RTX Video Super Resolution can be used together to produce the clearest livestreamed video anywhere, anytime. The combined features work on Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and the VLC media player (via the RTX branch).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video HDR will be released as part of new Game Ready and Studio Drivers later this month, and can be enabled via the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX Livestreaming: Twitch, OBS & NVIDIA To Enable Multi-Encode Broadcasting This Month\nWhen setting up their broadcasts, most Twitch streamers must choose between a higher resolution output, or reliable streaming to more devices. High-quality video provides more enjoyable viewing experiences, but causes streams to buffer for viewers with low bandwidth. Streaming lower-quality video allows more people to watch the content seamlessly, but introduces artifacts and renders content at a lower resolution.\nTwitch offers server-side transcoding for top-performing channels, meaning different versions of the same stream will be created for different bandwidth levels, improving the viewing experience. However, many channels are left with a single stream option.\nTwitch, OBS and NVIDIA have collaborated on a new feature to address this problem: Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting, releasing in beta later this month. With this new feature, GeForce RTX GPU owners will be able to broadcast up to three streams simultaneously; an increase to five encodes is planned for a later release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn future updates, Twitch will test higher-input bit rates as well as new codecs, which will enable streamers to broadcast at up to 4K at 60 frames per second for the first time. The new codecs include the latest-generation AV1 for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which provides 40% more encoding efficiency than H.264, and HEVC for previous-generation GeForce GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetty Images Releases AI Image Generation Tools Powered By NVIDIA Picasso\nToday, iStock by Getty Images is releasing a GenAI service built on NVIDIA Picasso, an AI foundry for visual design.

As such, it\u2019s crucial to stay ahead of the curve by anticipating potential trends that aim to change the retail game.\nNVIDIA\u2019s first annual \u201cState of AI in Retail and CPG\u201d survey \u2014 conducted among industry professionals \u2014 provides insights into the state of AI adoption in retail, its impact on revenue and costs and the emerging trends shaping the future of the industry.\nWith more than 400 respondents globally, including C-suite leaders and other executives, general managers and individual contributors, the survey consisted of questions covering a range of AI topics, top use cases, biggest challenges, infrastructure investment initiatives and deployment models.\nImproving Operational Efficiencies Is a Top Priority\nTo stay ahead in a highly dynamic market, retailers are actively considering how AI can help them meet evolving customer preferences, address labor shortages and drive sustainability efforts. AI has already proved to be a game-changer for retailers, with 69% reporting an increase in annual revenue attributed to AI adoption. Additionally, 72% of retailers using AI experienced a decrease in operating costs.\nAI is enhancing operational efficiency, elevating customer experiences and driving growth. The top five current AI use cases were as follows:\n\nStore analytics and insights\nPersonalized customer recommendations\nAdaptive advertising, promotions and pricing\nStockout and inventory management\nConversational AI\n\nWhile retailers are actively implementing AI, there are still areas they plan on exploring. These include further investing in AI infrastructure to overcome challenges related to inadequate technology and lack of AI talent, exploring the potential of the metaverse for consumer engagement and operational efficiency while also leveraging AI for brick-and-mortar stores to provide convenience and personalized customer experiences, transforming customer experiences using generative AI, and ensuring data privacy and protection in generative AI adoption.\nGenerative AI Is Changing Customer Experiences\nGenerative AI prominently emerged in several of the top AI use cases for retail. The use cases ranged from multimodal shopping advisors for personalized product recommendations; adaptive advertising, promotions and pricing; product tagging and cataloging; identification of similar and complementary products; as well as deployment of brand avatars for automated customer service.\nRetailers recognized the transformative potential of generative AI, with 86% expressing a desire to use it to enhance customer experiences. Respondents acknowledged that incorporating AI into business practices and solutions could revolutionize customer engagement, optimize marketing strategies and streamline operational processes.\nStaying Ahead With an Omnichannel Approach\nTo stay competitive, the survey indicated the importance of an omnichannel approach that integrates numerous online and offline channels to provide consumers with a consistent experience.\nThe results showed that ecommerce was the most used channel, with 79% of retailers actively participating. Mobile applications also gained traction, with over half of retailers using them to bridge the gap between digital and physical shopping experiences.\nDespite the rise in digital shopping, 30% of respondents say physical stores have the biggest revenue growth opportunity (ranked second behind ecommerce) and remain the channel with the most AI use cases for retailers. Given the emphasis on intelligent stores and their central role in the omnichannel experience, use cases such as store analytics and loss prevention will continue to be critical investments.\nInvesting in AI Infrastructure\nWhile AI adoption is still in its early stages, retailers are committed to increasing their AI infrastructure investments. Over 60% of respondents plan to boost their AI investments in the next 18 months.

This limited player interactions, which tended to be transactional, short-lived and, as a result, skipped by a majority of players.\n\u201cGenerative AI-powered characters in virtual worlds unlock various use cases and experiences that were previously impossible,\u201d said Purnendu Mukherjee, founder and CEO at Convai. \u201cConvai is leveraging Riva ASR and A2F to enable lifelike NPCs with low-latency response times and high-fidelity natural animation.\u201d\nTo showcase how ACE can transform NPC interactions, NVIDIA worked with Convai to expand the NVIDIA Kairos demo, which debuted at Computex, with a number of new features and inclusion of ACE microservices.\nIn the latest version of Kairos, Riva ASR and A2F are used extensively, improving NPC interactivity. Convai\u2019s new framework allows NPCs to converse among themselves and gives them awareness of objects, enabling them to pick up and deliver items to desired areas. Furthermore, NPCs gain the ability to lead players to objectives and traverse worlds.\nThe Audio2Face and Riva automatic speech recognition microservices are available now. Interactive avatar developers can incorporate the models individually into their development pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

Explore distant lands, fight bigger and more awe-inspiring machines, and encounter astonishing new tribes as you return to the far-future, post-apocalyptic world of Horizon.\nThe land is dying. Vicious storms and an unstoppable blight ravage the scattered remnants of humanity, while fearsome new machines prowl their borders. Life on Earth is hurtling towards another extinction, and no one knows why.\nIt's up to Aloy to uncover the secrets behind these threats and restore order and balance to the world. Along the way, she must reunite with old friends, forge alliances with warring new factions and unravel the legacy of the ancient past \u2013 all the while trying to stay one step ahead of a seemingly undefeatable new enemy.\nThe Complete Edition also includes Burning Shores, the story expansion that picks up after the conclusion of the main game, along with bonus content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition launches later this year, GeForce RTX gamers can activate DLSS 3 from day-one to multiply their performance, or those with fast enough frame rates can use DLAA to maximize their image quality.

Using the latest version of RTX Remix, the modders are rebuilding materials with PBR properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve\u2019s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the project\u2019s announcement in August, Orbifold Studios has recruited new modders via the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website, and now boasts a team 65 modders strong. In the time since, the expanded team has been hard at work building enhanced assets and remixing the game\u2019s beloved levels. In their new trailer, Orbifold is showcasing their latest work on Half-Life 2\u2019s spooky Ravenholm, the zombie infested town that creeped players out back in 2004.\nAs with the Portal projects, almost every asset is being reconstructed in high fidelity, and full ray tracing is being leveraged to bring cutting-edge graphics to Half-Life 2. In Ravenholm, average world textures have 8X the pixels, and are brought to life with Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) and PBR.\u00a0\nMonstrous creatures like the zombies feature almost 30X the geometric detail in Half-Life 2 RTX, going from 4,200 triangles to a staggering 75,590 triangles. Father Grigori, similarly, is now composed of 68,341 polygons. Weapons have been updated, with the Gravity Gun featuring 7X the textures, and 70X the polygonal detail. Now the materials of your weapon, the glass, metals and plastics, react to the world around you, catching light, shadows and color as you move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nReload animations have been updated, and each time you fire your weapon, the muzzle flashes illuminate the darkest rooms. Orbifold Studios has even used Valve\u2019s Hammer editor to rebuild the particles and explosions in Half-Life 2 to modern standards, which combined with full ray tracing, means fire glows and swells, and explosions cause smoke to propagate through light, imbuing clouds with beams of color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nUsing RTX Remix, the team has added realistic lighting and shadowing to each part of Ravenholm, greatly enhancing the moody, dimly lit streets, abandoned buildings, and ingenious traps set up by Father Grigori. See for yourself in the new Half-Life 2 RTX trailer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further enhance image quality, Half-Life 2 RTX features NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction. Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model, elevating the image quality of ray-traced effects and full ray tracing to new heights, further enhancing detail and realism.\nIn the trailer, DLSS 3.5 allows foliage to look more detailed, and shimmer less. It also makes fire, flashes of light, and shadows render more responsively. With DLSS 3.5, when you move through Ravenholm with your flashlight, every shadow you create will dynamically appear in the world and update in real-time with your movements.\nFor further updates about the project, stay tuned to the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website; if you\u2019re a modder, you can also sign up to join the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 Launching March 22nd With DLSS 3 & Ray Tracing\nDragon\u2019s Dogma is Capcom\u2019s single player, narrative driven action-RPG series that challenges the players to choose their own experience \u2013 from the appearance of their Arisen, their vocation, their party, how to approach different situations and more. Now, in this long-awaited sequel, the deep, explorable fantasy world of Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 awaits.\nOn your journey, you\u2019ll be joined by Pawns, mysterious otherworldly beings, in an adventure so unique you will feel as if accompanied by other players while on your own adventure. All of these elements are elevated further through physics technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and the latest in graphics, to create a truly immersive fantasy world in Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2.\nAt launch on March 22nd, GeForce RTX gamers will receive the definitive PC experience thanks to the day-one inclusion of NVIDIA DLSS 3, ray-traced reflections, and ray-traced lighting.

This new feature automatically converts SDR video into more vibrant HDR video that can be watched on any HDR10-compatible display.\nWe\u2019re also Game Ready for four new DLSS games: Enshrouded, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, TEKKEN 8, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA Ultra Low Latency Mode is now compatible with DirectX 12 titles. When enabled in the NVIDIA Control Panel, this setting increases PC responsiveness by reducing the render queue.\nDownload and install our new Game Ready Driver from the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com, and read on to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER Out Now \nThe GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is available now, starting at $799. It features more cores and more memory, increasing the frame buffer to 16GB, accompanied by a 256 bit memory bus. It\u2019s the perfect GPU to max out your high refresh 1440p panels and it can even game at 4K. Creators will also love it for video editing and rendering large 3D scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is 1.6X faster than the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, and 2.5X faster with DLSS 3 in the most graphically demanding games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s media has put the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER through their suites of benchmarks; here\u2019s what several sites had to say about our newest GPU:\n\n\u201cThe ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER arrives at the same $799 price point of its predecessor, but offers more cores, more video memory, and ultimately more performance across every workload.\u201d -HotHardware\n\u201cIf you're rocking a high-refresh-rate ultrawide display or connecting a gaming rig to a G-SYNC-compatible 4K OLED TV, you've got an absolute beast here.\u201d -TweakTown\n\u201cIf it beats out the RTX 3090, just imagine the kind of upgrade it will deliver for owners of popular cards like the GTX 1070 and RTX 2070.\u201d -PC Gamer\n\u201cIf you're in the market for a high-end Nvidia GPU and you haven't upgraded in a few years, it's a great card.\u201d -Tom\u2019s Hardware\n\u201cIt\u2019s a solid performer with a significantly better price/performance ratio than its predecessor. We can\u2019t argue with that. And once you factor in ray tracing performance, DLSS, and Frame Generation, at $799 this is a lot of GPU\u201d -PC Perspective\n\u201cThe ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is a really great video card for gamers and enthusiasts at the $799 price point.\u201d -The FPS Review\n\n\u00a0The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is available in stock-clocked and factory-overclocked configurations from ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC.

Using the power of Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs, RTX Video HDR allows GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their HDR panel\u2019s ability to display more vivid, dynamic colors, preserving intricate details that may be inadvertently rendered unidentifiable due to video compression.\nRTX Video HDR and RTX Video Super Resolution can be used together to produce the clearest live streamed video anywhere, anytime. The combined features work on Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.\nTo enable RTX Video HDR and Video Super Resolution on any HDR10-compatible display:\n\nDownload and install the newest available Game Ready or Studio Ready driver\nEnsure Windows\u2019 HDR features are enabled in System > Display > HDR\nOpen the NVIDIA Control Panel by right clicking your desktop\nNavigate to Adjust Video Image Settings on the left nav of the app\nTick \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d and \u201cHigh Dynamic Range\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, open any of the aforementioned apps and watch a SDR video - it will be automatically converted to HDR, and have improved detail and sharpness. For additional information, check out our RTX Video FAQ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video HDR is yet another example of how GeForce RTX Tensor Cores and AI can further enhance your experience, for free. NVIDIA DLSS significantly accelerates performance in games and creative apps, NVIDIA Broadcast supercharges mics and cams, transforming any room into a home studio, NVIDIA Canvas turns simple brushstrokes into realistic landscape images, and the NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta, beginning January 22nd, enables modders to upgrade classic games with RTX technologies and textures enhanced by Generative AI.\nStay tuned to discover the next applications of AI to enhance your work, leisure and play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Enshrouded: Launching January 24th With DLSS 2 \nThe realm of Embervale is lost. In their greed for magical power, your ancestors unleashed a pestilence that consumed the world. You are Flameborn, last ember of hope of a dying race. Awaken, survive the terror of a corrupting fog, and reclaim the lost beauty of your kingdom in Enshrouded. Venture into a vast world, vanquish punishing bosses, build grand halls and forge your path in this co-op survival action RPG for up to 16 players from Keen Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Enshrouded launches into Early Access today, GeForce RTX gamers can immediately activate DLSS 2 to accelerate frame rates by 93% on average at 4K, with max settings enabled. Take a first look at Enshrouded with DLSS 2 in our new, exclusive RTX comparison video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose without an upgraded rig can still experience Enshrouded with all the benefits of DLSS 2 and RTX ON by streaming it from the cloud thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce NOW Priority and Ultimate memberships. Members can play over 1,800 of the real and full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Xbox and over 100 supported PC Game Pass titles, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft and GOG.com.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Featuring DLSS 3\nKazuma Kiryu\u2019s back in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and SEGA\u2019s Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the latest game in the Yakuza series, launching January 26th.

Adapt your party\u2019s skills to the situation with outlandish jobs and customizations to strategically subdue enemies with over-the-top moves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt launch, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will include support for DLSS 3, giving GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers the highest levels of performance possible in the eagerly anticipated title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For TEKKEN 8, Featuring DLSS 2 \nGet ready for the next chapter in the legendary fighting game franchise, TEKKEN 8! Completely redesigned character visuals, featuring elaborate, highly-detailed models built from the ground up, and high-fidelity graphics break the limits of new-generation hardware by adding a new weight and atmosphere to TEKKEN\u2019s signature battles. Vivid environments and destructible stages combine to create an overwhelming sense of immersion, creating the ultimate play experience.\nTEKKEN 8 continues the tragic saga of the Mishima and Kazama bloodlines, and their world-shaking father-and-son grudge matches starting from 6 months after the closure of the last match. The story of Jin Kazama's growth and determination marks a new chapter in the timeless saga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching January 26th, TEKKEN 8 gets even better on GeForce RTX desktops and laptops thanks to the day-one inclusion of DLSS 2, helping more games achieve a locked 60 FPS with details and effects cranked to the max.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For  Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Launching February 2nd With DLSS Super Resolution \nOn February 2nd, enter the world of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, developed by Rocksteady Studios, the creators of the Batman: Arkham series, and published by Warner Bros. Games. In this third-person action shooter, the ultimate band of misfits must do the impossible to save the world: kill the Justice League. And if you pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game, you can start your mission on January 30th with Early Access.\nJoin the newly \u201crecruited\u201d members of Amanda Waller\u2019s infamous Task Force X (aka the Suicide Squad), Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang and King Shark, as they set out on an impossible mission to Kill the Justice League. Drop into an expansive and dynamic open-world Metropolis ravaged by Brainiac\u2019s invasion and terrorized by the heroes who once protected it.\nEach Squad member brings their own traversal mechanics to help them navigate a sprawling and battle-torn Metropolis, combining free-roaming exploration and combat verticality for an unforgettable experience. Players are free to experiment with a variety of different play styles to unleash maximum damage on their enemies. Whether in single player or online with up to three of your friends, players can take on this suicide mission their own way.\nPost-launch, players can expect a continuously evolving Metropolis with free new playable villains, environments, weapons, in-game events, and more, all included with purchase of the base game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn PC, leverage the power of your GeForce RTX GPU to enhance your experience in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Use dedicated RT Cores to enable ray-traced reflections, and use your GPU\u2019s Tensor Cores to activate NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution.\nIf your frame rates are fast enough already, instead consider activating NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta - Available Now\nThe NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta is available now!

The system will be named Freyja in honor of the powerful, life-giving Norse goddess associated with the ability to predict the future.\nFreyja will be used to build a human diversity atlas for drug target and disease-specific biomarker discovery, providing vital diagnostics for monitoring disease progression and regression. The system will also help develop AI-driven precision medicine models, potentially enabling individualized therapies for patients with serious diseases.\nAmgen plans to integrate the DGX SuperPOD, which will feature 31 NVIDIA DGX H100 nodes totaling 248 H100 Tensor Core GPUs, to train state-of-the-art AI models in days rather than months, enabling researchers to more efficiently analyze and learn from data in their search for novel health and therapeutics insights.\n\u201cFor more than a decade, Amgen has been preparing for this hinge moment we are seeing in the industry, powered by the union of technology and biotechnology,\u201d said David M. Reese, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Amgen. \u201cWe look forward to\u00a0 combining the breadth and maturity of our world-class human data capabilities at Amgen with NVIDIA\u2019s technologies.\u201d\nThe goal of deCODE founder and CEO K\u00e1ri Stef\u00e1nsson in starting the company was to understand human disease by looking at the diversity of the human genome. He predicted in a recent Amgen podcast that within the next 10 years, doctors will routinely use genetics to explore uncommon diseases in patients.\n\u201cThis SuperPOD has the potential to accelerate our research by training models more quickly and helping us generate questions we might not have otherwise thought to ask,\u201d said Stef\u00e1nsson.\nPutting the Tech in Biotechnology\nSince its founding in 1996, deCODE has curated more than 200 petabytes of de-identified human data from nearly 3 million individuals.\nThe company started by collecting de-identified data from Icelanders, who have a rich heritage in genealogies that stretch back for centuries. This population-scale data from research volunteers provides unique insights into human diversity as it applies to disease.\ndeCODE has also helped sequence more than half a million human genomes from volunteers in the UK Biobank.\nBut drawing insights from this much data requires powerful AI systems.\nBy integrating powerful new technology, Amgen has an opportunity to accelerate the discovery and development of life-changing medicines. In March 2023, NVIDIA announced that Amgen became one of the first companies to employ NVIDIA BioNeMo, which researchers have used to build generative AI models to accelerate drug discovery and development. Amgen researchers have also been accessing BioNeMo via NVIDIA DGX Cloud, an AI supercomputing service.\n\u201cModels trained in BioNeMo can advance drug discovery on multiple fronts,\u201d said Marti Head, executive director of computational and data sciences at Amgen. \u201cIn addition to helping develop drugs that are more effective, they can also help avoid unwanted effects like immune responses, and new biologics can be made in volume.\u201d\nBy adopting DGX SuperPOD, Amgen is poised to gain unprecedented data insights with the potential to change the pace and scope of drug discovery.\n\u201cThe fusion of advanced AI, groundbreaking developments in biology and molecular engineering and vast quantities of human data are not just reshaping how we discover and develop new medicines \u2014 they\u2019re redefining medicine,\u201d Reese said.\nLearn about NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform for healthcare and life sciences.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Customer Stories | DGX Cloud | Events | Genomics | GPU | Hardware | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Among the new models is the Alienware AW3225QF, one of the world\u2019s first 240Hz 4K OLED gaming monitor, the Philips Evnia 49M2C8900, one of the world\u2019s first ultrawide DQHD 240Hz OLED gaming monitors, and LG\u2019s 2024 new 144Hz OLED and wireless TV lineup, which are available in a multitude of screen sizes, from 48 inches to a whopping 97 inches.\nAt CES, we also announced two new G-SYNC innovations: G-SYNC on GeForce NOW, and G-SYNC Pulsar technology.\nG-SYNC technology comes to the cloud with GeForce NOW, vastly improving the visual fidelity of streaming to displays that support G-SYNC. Members will see minimized stutter and latency for a nearly indistinguishable experience from a local gaming experience.\nG-SYNC Pulsar is the next evolution of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology, not only delivering a stutter-free experience and buttery smooth motion, but also a new gold standard for visual clarity and fidelity through the invention of variable frequency strobing. This boosts effective motion clarity to over 1000Hz on the debut ASUS ROG Swift PG27 Series G-SYNC gaming monitor, launching later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith G-SYNC Pulsar, the clarity and visibility of content in motion is significantly improved, enabling you to track and shoot targets with increased precision\nNo longer will users have to choose between the smooth variable refresh, or the improved motion clarity of Ultra Low Motion Blur (ULMB) \u2013 our new G-SYNC Pulsar technology delivers all the benefits of both, working in perfect harmony to deliver the definitive gaming monitor experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS ROG Swift PG27 Series G-SYNC gaming monitors with Pulsar technology launches later this year\nRead on for further details about our new CES 2024 G-SYNC announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Generation: Introducing G-SYNC Pulsar Technology\nNVIDIA\u2019s journey in display technology has been marked by relentless innovation. The launch of G-SYNC in 2013 eradicated stutter by harmonizing the monitor\u2019s refresh rate with the GPU\u2019s output. This was just the beginning.\nFollowing G-SYNC, we introduced Variable Overdrive, enhancing motion clarity by intelligently adjusting pixel response times. Then we incorporated HDR, bringing richer, more vibrant colors and deeper contrast, transforming the visual experience. Additionally, the expansion into broader color gamuts allowed for more lifelike and diverse color representation, while the introduction of wider refresh rate ranges further refined the smoothness of on-screen action\u2014catering to both high-speed gaming and cinematic quality, and everything in between.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Breakthrough Innovation Of G-SYNC  Pulsar\nTraditional VRR technologies dynamically adjust the display\u2019s refresh rate to match the GPU\u2019s frame rate, effectively eliminating stutter.  To evolve VRR further, the aspiration has always been in unifying it with advanced strobing techniques to eliminate display motion blur (not to be confused with in-game motion blur visual effects). Display motion blur is caused by both slow LCD transitions, and the persistence of an image on the retina as our eyes track movement on-screen. Slow pixel transitions can\u2019t keep up with fast-moving objects, leading to a smear effect. These slow transitions can be eliminated by Variable Overdrive\u2014but motion blur born out of object permanence in the eye can only be removed by strobing the backlight.\nHowever, strobing the backlight at a frequency that is not fixed causes serious flicker\u2014which, until now, had prevented effective use of the technique in VRR displays.\nFor over a decade, our engineers have pursued the challenge of marrying the fluidity of VRR timing with the precise timing needed for effective advanced strobing.\nThe solution was a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts strobing patterns to varying render rates. NVIDIA\u2019s new G-SYNC Pulsar technology marks a significant breakthrough by synergizing two pivotal elements: Adaptive Overdrive and Pulse Modulation.\nWith Adaptive Overdrive, G-SYNC Pulsar dynamically adjusts the rate at which pixels transition from one color to another, a vital technique to reduce motion blur and ghosting. This process is complicated by VRR technology, where the refresh rate fluctuates in tandem with the GPU's output. G-SYNC Pulsar\u2019s solution modulates overdrive based on both screen location and refresh rate\u2014ensuring that clarity and blur reduction are maintained across a spectrum of speeds, and across the entire screen space.\nComplementing this, the technology also intelligently controls the pulse's brightness and duration\u2014key to maintaining visual comfort and eliminating flicker. Flickering, often a byproduct of strobing methods used to diminish motion blur, can disrupt the gaming experience and cause viewer discomfort. By adaptively tuning backlight pulses in response to the constantly changing game render rate, G-SYNC Pulsar creates a consistent and comfortable viewing experience, effectively accommodating the display's dynamic nature.\nMerging these two adaptive strategies, G-SYNC Pulsar transcends previous challenges associated with enhancing VRR with strobing backlight techniques. Prior attempts have often stumbled, leading to flickering and diminished motion clarity. However, G-SYNC Pulsar\u2019s innovation ensures perfect synchronization between overdrive and backlight pulse with the screen's refresh cycle.\nThis represents a leap beyond incremental updates or a combination of existing technologies: it is a radical rethinking of display technology\u2014necessitating the development of new panel technology, and representing a fundamental reengineering at both hardware and software levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting gaming experience is transformative, where each frame is delivered with both stutter-free smoothness, and motion clarity that is effectively the quadruple of its baseline refresh rate\u2014enabling a truly immersive and uninterrupted visual journey for gamers. Even in the most intense and fast-paced games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC Pulsar Demo: See The Technology In Action\nThe true impact of G-SYNC Pulsar is unmistakable in action. When enabled, the technology offers starkly smoother scenes and sharper clarity, surpassing the capabilities of earlier monitor technologies that attempted to combine VRR and strobing.\nThis advancement offers distinct advantages for various gaming genres. In competitive gaming, the elimination of stuttering is crucial, as these distractions can impede performance and affect outcomes. Similarly, enhanced motion clarity can provide a competitive edge, where precise tracking and response to fast-moving elements and friend-foe distinction are paramount. For immersive games, the technology's ability to maintain consistent smoothness and clarity enhances the player's sense of being part of the game world, free from immersion-breaking visual artifacts.  Furthermore, G-SYNC Pulsar simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need to switch between different monitor settings for either VRR or strobing technologies. Whether it's for the high-stakes environment of competitive gaming, or the rich, detailed worlds of immersive titles, G-SYNC Pulsar delivers a superior and convenient visual experience tailored to all facets of gaming.\nIn the video below, a 1000 FPS high-speed pursuit camera recorded Counter-Strike 2 running identically on a 360Hz G-SYNC monitor with Pulsar technology enabled, versus with Pulsar technology disabled. Played back at 1/24 speed, the reduction of monitor-based motion blur on the G-SYNC Pulsar display is immediately evident, greatly improving clarity, fidelity, target tracking and target acquisition, helping improve hit rate, and more, making users more competitive online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nWith G-SYNC Pulsar, the clarity and visibility of content in motion is significantly improved, enabling you to track and shoot targets with increased precision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC Technology Comes To GeForce NOW \nG-SYNC technology will be coming soon to the cloud with GeForce NOW, raising the bar even higher for high-performance game streaming.\nWith the introduction of the Ultimate tier, GeForce NOW delivered improved visual graphics in the cloud by varying the stream rate to the client, driving down total latency on Reflex-enabled games.\nNewly improved cloud G-SYNC technology goes even further by varying the display refresh rate for smooth and instantaneous frame updates for variable refresh rate monitors, fully optimized for G-SYNC capable monitors, providing members with the smoothest tear-free gaming experience from the cloud.\nUltimate members will also soon be able to utilize Reflex in supported titles at up to 4K resolution and 60 or 120 FPS streaming modes, for low-latency gaming on nearly any device.\nWith both Cloud G-SYNC and Reflex, members will feel as if they\u2019re connected directly to GeForce NOW servers, for a visual experience that is smoother, clearer, and more immersive than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 New G-SYNC Gaming Monitors, Displays & TVs Coming Soon \nThere are thousands of monitors, displays and TVs out there, but only the best receive the G-SYNC badge of honor. Monitors with dedicated G-SYNC modules push the limits of technology, reaching the highest possible refresh rates, and enabling advanced features such as G-SYNC esports mode. And G-SYNC ULTIMATE displays deliver stunning HDR experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of other displays are validated by NVIDIA as G-SYNC Compatible, giving confidence for buyers looking for displays that don\u2019t blank, pulse, flicker, ghost, or otherwise artifact during Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) gaming. G-SYNC Compatible also ensures that a display operates in VRR at any game frame rate by supporting a VRR range of at least 2.4:1 (e.g. 60Hz-144Hz), and offers the gamer a seamless experience by enabling VRR by default on GeForce GPUs.\nManufacturers are increasingly adopting VRR, and many incorporate game modes and additional features that enhance the PC experience, whether gaming on a monitor or TV. To ensure a flawless out of the box experience, partners such as Alienware, AOC, ASUS, Dough, IO Data, LG, Philips, Thermaltake, and ViewSonic share their displays with us for testing and optimization.\nAt CES 2024, our partners unveiled 24 new G-SYNC gaming monitors, displays and TVs, from a 16 inch portable monitor, all the way up to 97 inch TVs.\nThe Alienware AW3225QF, launching this January, is the one of the world\u2019s first 240Hz 4K OLED gaming monitors.

They\u2019ll be joined by a host of top titles, including Capcom\u2019s Exoprimal, HoYoverse\u2019s Honkai: Star Rail and Mainframe Industries\u2019 Pax Dei.\nAvailable starting in February, new day passes for Ultimate and Priority memberships will offer full premium benefits one day at a time.\nNVIDIA is also bringing G-SYNC technology to the cloud, raising cloud streaming performance while lowering latency and minimizing stuttering for the smoothest gameplay. Paired with new 60 and 120 fps streaming options for GFN Reflex mode, the two together make cloud gaming experiences nearly indistinguishable from local ones.\nPlus, mobile gamers are getting a boost to 1440p resolution on Android phones. And Japan is the newest region to be operated by NVIDIA, which will soon enable gamers across the country to play their favorite PC games in the cloud with Ultimate performance.\nHere Come the Games\n\nThe GeForce NOW catalog features many of the most popular PC games \u2014 over 1,800 titles from Steam, Xbox and supported PC Game Pass titles, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft, GOG.com and other digital stores. Backed by up to GeForce RTX 4080 GPU-class graphics, GeForce NOW is bringing even more top titles to the cloud from celebrated publishers.\nThe latest games from top developer Blizzard Entertainment \u2014 Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 \u2014 are coming soon to GeForce NOW. They join the recent release of Call of Duty, the first Activision game in the cloud, as part of a 10-year NVIDIA and Microsoft partnership.\nJoin the fight for Sanctuary.\nFight the forces of hell while discovering countless abilities to master, legendary loot to gather and nightmarish dungeons full of evil enemies to vanquish in Diablo IV.

The immensely popular Honkai: Star Rail from HoYoverse will join Genshin Impact coming soon in the cloud. The space-fantasy RPG is set in a diverse universe filled with wonder, adventure and thrills, and expands the library of hit free-to-play titles for members. Plus, members can experience all the latest updates without worrying about download times.\nDinosaurs? Oh my.\nTop publisher Capcom is working with NVIDIA to bring more of its hit titles to the cloud, including Exoprimal, an online, team-based action game that pits humanity\u2019s cutting-edge exosuit technology against history\u2019s most ferocious beasts: dinosaurs. Look forward to seeing it in the cloud on Jan. 18.\nGhosts do exist!\nMainframe Industries\u2019 Pax Dei is a highly anticipated social sandbox massively multiplayer online game inspired by legends of the medieval era. It\u2019s planned to release on GeForce NOW when it launches for PC.\nGet ready to play these titles and more at high performance coming soon. Ultimate members will be able to stream at up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second with support for NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex technology, and experience the action even on low-powered devices. Keep an eye out on GFN Thursdays for the latest on their release dates in the cloud.\nDon\u2019t Pass This Up\nDay Passes, available in early February, will give gamers a fast pass to try out premium membership benefits before committing to one- or six-month memberships that offer better value. The passes provide access to all the same features as Priority and Ultimate members for 24 hours.\nDay Pass users can experience RTX ON for supported games with Priority and Ultimate Day Passes. And Ultimate Day Pass users gain exclusive access to innovative technologies like NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, full ray tracing and NVIDIA Reflex.\nPssst, pass it on.\nThese new membership options let gamers freely choose when to tap into the cloud.\nThe Ultimate Day Pass will be available for $7.99 and the Priority Day Pass for $3.99. The 24 hours of continuous play will begin at purchase. Day Passes can be combined for continued access to GeForce NOW high-performance cloud streaming.\nLet That Sync In\nNVIDIA continues to push the boundaries for cloud gaming. The Ultimate membership tier introduced many cloud gaming firsts, from 240 fps to ultra-wide streaming, making gameplay with GeForce NOW \u2014 streaming from GeForce RTX 4080-powered servers \u2014 nearly identical to a local gaming experience.\nGet in sync.\nComing soon, cloud G-SYNC technology will raise the bar even further, minimizing stutter and latency, with support for variable refresh rate monitors and fully optimized for G-SYNC-compatible monitors. With Cloud G-SYNC enabled, GeForce NOW will vary the display\u2019s refresh rates to match the streaming rate, for the smoothest gameplay experience available from the cloud.\nUltimate members can also soon take advantage of expanded NVIDIA Reflex support in supported titles.\u00a0 Building off of 240fps 1080p streaming from last year, Ultimate members will soon be able to utilize Reflex in supported titles at up to 4K resolution and 60 or 120 fps streaming modes, for low-latency gaming on nearly any device.\u00a0 NVIDIA Reflex support is available in the top PC games on GeForce NOW, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Cyberpunk 2077, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, \u00a0Alan Wake 2 and more.\nWith both Cloud G-SYNC and Reflex, members will feel as if they\u2019re connected directly to GeForce NOW\u2019s RTX 4080 SuperPODs, making their visual experiences smoother, clearer and more immersive than ever.\nMobile Phones Are Now PC Gaming Rigs\nMobile gamers will soon have the option to set streaming resolution to 1440p on Android devices, providing richer graphics on larger screens. Members will be able to turn an Android device into a portable gaming rig with support for quad-high-definition resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels), as well as improved keyboard and mouse support.\nThis offers a glimpse into the future of game streaming, with external displays connected to a mobile device. Using a USB-C docking station, gamers can connect an Android phone to a 1080p or 1440p gaming monitor or TV, with a keyboard and mouse or gamepad.\nPaired with a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, Android phones become portable gaming rigs on which to play the latest triple-A PC games, such as Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, The Finals and Monster Hunter: World. Now anything, even a phone, can be a high-performance gaming rig.\nGeForce NOW improves on-the-go streaming, one device at a time.\nThe above was on display this week at the CES trade show. The demo streams Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2 from GeForce NOW servers in Los Angeles to a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra phone connected to a 1440p monitor in Las Vegas.\nClouds in Japan\nThe cloud\u2019s drifting into Japan.\nNVIDIA will begin operating GeForce NOW in Japan in the spring, operating alongside GeForce NOW Alliance partner KDDI.\nGamers in the region can look forward to Ultimate memberships for the first time, along with all the new games and advancements announced at CES.

Mods enhance graphics as faster GPUs are released, extend a game\u2019s lifespan with new content, and expand their audience with total gameplay conversions.\nWith NVIDIA RTX Remix, we\u2019re enabling modders to remaster their favorite classic games with full ray tracing (also known as path tracing), NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, modern physically-based rendering (PBR) assets, and generative AI texture tools.\nStarting now all modders can download the NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta, for free. Simply,\u00a0 download the Omniverse Launcher, search for RTX Remix on the \u201cexchange\u201d tab and download/install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix has already delivered stunning remasters in NVIDIA\u2019s own Portal with RTX, and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX. Now, Orbifold Studios is using RTX Remix to develop Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, a community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time. Check out their latest Half-Life 2 RTX gameplay trailer, showcasing their Remix updates for Ravenholm:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep reading to learn how modders can make their own RTX Remix mods for classic games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta Available Now\nNVIDIA RTX Remix, built on NVIDIA Omniverse and part of the NVIDIA Studio suite of tools for creators, is a platform for remastering fixed function pipeline DirectX 8 and 9 games, such as Call of Duty 2, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Garry's Mod, Freedom Fighters, Need for Speed Underground 2, and Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines. Head to the ModDB's Remix community resources to see the latest set of compatible games, and get technical info about compatibility in our Remix documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA test scene from Bethesda Softworks\u2019 The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, showcasing the capabilities of RTX Remix, and demonstrating how modders can apply an RTX upgrade to other classic games\nRemix consists of two components: an application for creating lights and adding remastered assets into a game scene, and a runtime for capturing classic game scenes and injecting the remastered assets back into the game at playback. With the release of the RTX Remix application in Open Beta, the full power of RTX Remix is now in the hands of experienced modders to make next level RTX mods.\nTable of contents:\nGet Started with NVIDIA RTX Remix\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RTX Remix Additional Resources\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RTX Remix App \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Generative AI Texture Tools\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reimagine Assets Via NVIDIA Omniverse-Connected Apps \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RTX Remix Runtime \nRTX Remix Video Tutorials And Sample App \nModDB: The Place To Host & Find NVIDIA RTX Remix Remasters \nNVIDIA RTX Remix Showcase Discord \nNew Half-Life 2 RTX Trailer - See What\u2019s Possible With RTX Remix \nNVIDIA RTX Remix FAQ \nModders - Download The NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta Now \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Started With NVIDIA RTX Remix\nNVIDIA RTX Remix enables experienced modders to remaster classic games by upgrading textures with AI, allowing easy replacement of game assets with high fidelity assets built with physically accurate materials, and injecting\u00a0full ray tracing, DLSS and Reflex technologies.\nWhile Remix makes modding substantially easier, it\u2019s not a one-click solution, and requires time and dedication to create amazing mods.\u00a0\nBelow, modders will receive a thorough explanation of Remix\u2019s capabilities, and we\u2019ve prepared guides and videos to help modders begin their journey.\nModders can follow these steps to get started:\n\nInstall NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher, navigate to the \u201cExchange\u201d tab, and download RTX Remix on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or higher GPU (see full system requirements).\u00a0 We also recommend installing the latest Game Ready or Studio Ready driver from the Drivers tab of GeForce Experience or GeForce.com.\nVisit ModDB\u2019s Remix community resources, choose your compatible game, download its rtx.conf configuration file, and drop the latest RTX Remix runtime and rtx.conf file next to the game\u2019s executable file.\u00a0\nYou can skip this step if you were able to acquire a rtx.conf file from the previous step: Launch the game and hit Alt+X to open the RTX Remix Runtime menu. Follow the setup process in the \u201cgame setup\u201d tab of the Advanced Developer Menu. \nTake a capture of the game via the enhancements tab of the RTX Remix Runtime menu. ModDB\u2019s Remix community resources also enable modders to upload captures for games, allowing you to forgo taking your own capture - just download someone else\u2019s capture and load it into RTX Remix!\nStart creating your RTX mod. To help, we\u2019ve created a set of resources including a full Remix documentation guide, a crash course tutorial video on the remastering process, and RTX Remix sample application.\u00a0 Additionally, check out the RTX Remix Showcase Discord to get advice.\nSend us your feedback by filing an issue on our GitHub.\u00a0 This is a beta - if you find bugs or have feature requests, we want to hear about them!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor a more in depth breakdown of RTX Remix, keep scrolling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix Additional Resources\nWe\u2019ve curated a variety of resources to help you on your modding journey.\n\nRTX Remix System Requirements \nRTX Remix Documentation \nRTX Remix Tutorial Videos \nModDB RTX Remix Resources \nRTX Remix FAQ \nRTX Remix Discord \nReport Issues on the GitHub \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix App\nThe RTX Remix app is modders\u2019 central UI for creating RTX mods of classic games. Easily import game captures, enhance assets, relight scenes with full ray traced lighting (also known as path-traced lighting), and review updates live in the viewport.\u00a0\nRTX Remix app features include:\n\nRTX Remix\u2019s ingestion pipeline, which converts a variety of file formats to Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), making it easy to open and edit them in your favorite Omniverse-connected app, including RTX Remix itself.\u00a0\n\n\nEasy asset replacement. Upgrade models with new, high-poly replacements that rival the detail and fidelity of those found in modern games. RTX Remix features a free bank of high quality OpenUSD assets created by NVIDIA, ready to be used in your next mod. Import them into your mods as-is, or remix their properties using an Omniverse connected application of your choice, such as Blender or Adobe Substance.\n\n\nSupport for a variety of PBR material maps, including albedo, metallic, roughness, emissive, normal, subsurface scattering and height maps, which can leverage Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) to make texture surfaces realistically bumpy, for improved interplay with fully ray traced light and shadow.\u00a0\n\n\nRelighting with full ray tracing. Convert basic light sources into physically-accurate dynamic lights, capable of casting high-fidelity ray-traced shadows, illuminating scenery, and interacting with the Physically Based properties of enhanced textures. And insert new lights to transform the appearance of a scene even more.\u00a0\n\n\nA versatile viewport to help with your remaster. RTX Remix features an accurate viewport that reconstructs the game scene, so that every change you make can be previewed without launching the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI Texture Tools\nOne of the most time intensive parts of modding is updating every texture to modern gaming standards \u2013 that means building them at higher resolutions with a physically-based rendering (PBR) workflow, so the materials can react to ray-traced lighting.\nMost mod teams lack the time to give attention to each and every asset, making AI invaluable. The solution: RTX Remix\u2019s Generative AI Texture Tools that leverage Tensor Cores in GeForce RTX GPUs to analyze low resolution textures from classic games, and generate physically accurate materials including normal and roughness maps, before upscaling their resolution by up to 4X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest texture processed by RTX Remix\u2019s AI Texture Tools.

A modder who made an impressive asset they want to use across five different games would need to convert that asset into five unique file formats, each with their own drawbacks, and use five proprietary tools to plug the asset into each game engine.\nWith RTX Remix and OpenUSD, modders have a single unified workflow that allows them to carry their favorite OpenUSD assets forward to a variety of titles, making it easy to remaster a diverse set of games with the same process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix Runtime\nEvery developer tweaks their work as they play and test, and with the RTX Remix runtime it\u2019s even easier. The runtime makes asset replacements, scene upgrades, and ray tracing improvements a reality, replacing content at playback and injecting RTX technologies, including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, and Reflex. Underneath the gorgeous exterior, your favorite game, with all of its timeless gameplay, remains intact.\nBring up the Remix runtime overlay in-game and you can make live changes to customize your experience. For example, add real-time fog to allow for beautiful volumetric lighting, or enable a mode where legacy assets are highlighted, allowing you to appreciate every asset that was replaced in a mod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Open Beta, the updated Remix runtime has received several enhancements:\n\nOff-camera lights are no longer culled, ensuring all ray-traced lighting is rendered at all times at the maximum distance, regardless of the camera or player\u2019s orientation, enabling off-screen shadows and light to fill a scene.\nClassic games sometimes used Terrain Baking to blend layers of textures together to create more realistic and detailed floor surfaces. Remix now supports this feature, enabling modders to replace the classic textures with new hi-res ones, dramatically improving image quality.\nSubsurface Scattering (SSS), the transmission, refraction and dissipation of light through layers of material is now supported on foliage, enabling light to permeate forest canopies and enhance thick sections of vegetation in games. Simply assign a SSS map to an asset in the RTX Remix Application and the runtime will render it properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsurface scattering allows light to pass through thin materials, like leaves or lamp shades - click here to load a fullscreen comparison\n\nParallax Occlusion Mapping (POM), allows height maps on textures to translate into bumps and protrusions that can cast shadows, making 2D textures look 3-dimensional. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModders used POM in Half Life 2 RTX to make each brick of the cobblestone road protrude and self shadow - click here to load a 4K fullscreen comparison\nAdditionally, the Remix runtime is available as open source on GitHub, allowing the community to make modifications or submit changes to NVIDIA to bring into the main branch.\u00a0\nMod developers should check out the RTX Remix Showcase Discord, where users have already been creating Remix mods, and experimenting with the runtime. Get advice, showcase your project, and help others remix their favorite classic games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix Video Tutorials And Sample App\nAfter you install RTX Remix, in \\deps\\remix_runtime you\u2019ll find an RTX Remix sample application that can be used to create your first RTX Remix Mod. While the sample app is not a playable game, it is coded like a classic game, making it easy to practice with.\nBe sure to check out the complete RTX Remix Tutorial Video Playlist. And you can get even more detail on how Remix works in our exhaustive text guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModDB: The Place To Host & Find NVIDIA RTX Remix Remasters\nModDB has added a new RTX Remix section, making discovery, modding and sharing of classic game mods even easier. The new section features:\n\nA compatibility list to track which classic games the community has found work best with RTX Remix.\n\u2018RTX.conf\u2019 configuration files and USD captures for compatible games.

Join the thriving RTX Remix Discord Community where you can collaborate with other modders, showcase your projects, and get insight from members of the community.\nThis active Discord has been experimenting with Remix since our initial Runtime releases, so if you\u2019re looking for help, or to collaborate with others on a new mod, you should definitely check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Half-Life 2 RTX Trailer - See What\u2019s Possible With RTX Remix\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being developed by four of Half-Life 2\u2019s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Using the latest version of RTX Remix, the modders are rebuilding materials with PBR properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve\u2019s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the project\u2019s announcement last August, Orbifold Studios has recruited new modders via the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website, and now boasts a team 65 modders strong. In the time since, the expanded team has been hard at work building enhanced assets and remixing the game\u2019s beloved levels. In their new trailer, Orbifold is showcasing their latest work on Half-Life 2\u2019s spooky Ravenholm, the zombie infested town that creeped players out back in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nAs with the Portal projects, almost every asset is being reconstructed in high fidelity, and full ray tracing is being leveraged to bring cutting-edge graphics to Half-Life 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nIn Ravenholm, average world textures have 8X the pixels, and are brought to life with Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) and PBR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nMonstrous creatures like the zombies feature almost 30X the geometric detail in Half-Life 2 RTX, going from 4,200 triangles to a staggering 75,590 triangles. Father Grigori, similarly, is now composed of 68,341 polygons. Weapons have been updated, with the Gravity Gun featuring 7X the textures, and 70X the polygonal detail. Now the materials of your weapon, the glass, metals and plastics, react to the world around you, catching light, shadows and color as you move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nReload animations have been updated, and each time you fire your weapon, the muzzle flashes illuminate the darkest rooms. Orbifold Studios has even used Valve\u2019s Hammer editor to rebuild the particles and explosions in Half-Life 2 to modern standards, which combined with full ray tracing means fire glows and swells, and explosions cause smoke to propagate through light, imbuing clouds with beams of color. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nUsing RTX Remix, the team has added realistic lighting and shadowing to each part of Ravenholm, greatly enhancing the moody, dimly lit streets, abandoned buildings, and ingenious traps set up by Father Grigori. See for yourself in the new Half-Life 2 RTX trailer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further enhance image quality, Half-Life 2 RTX features NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction. Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model, elevating the image quality of ray-traced effects and full ray tracing to new heights, further enhancing detail and realism.\nIn the trailer, DLSS 3.5 allows foliage to look more detailed, and shimmer less. It also makes fire, flashes of light, and shadows render more responsively. With DLSS 3.5, when you move through Ravenholm with your flashlight, every shadow you create will dynamically appear in the world and update in real-time with your movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nFor further updates about the project, stay tuned to the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website; if you\u2019re a modder, you can also sign up to join the project.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is RTX Remix and what sets it apart from other modding tools?\nRTX Remix is a cutting-edge modding platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse. What sets it apart is its ability to capture game scenes, enhance materials using generative AI tools, and efficiently create impressive RTX remasters incorporating full ray tracing, DLSS, and Reflex. You can even plug in modern assets that feature physically accurate materials and incredible fidelity, into game engines that originally only supported simple color textures and assets of basic polygonal detail.\nBeyond its core capabilities, what makes RTX Remix special is that it offers modders a chance to remaster the graphics of a wide variety of games with the same exact workflow and tool\u2013a rarity in modding. Experts who have mastered traditional modding tools can use them in tandem with RTX Remix to make even more impressive mods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you explain the role of generative AI Texture Tools in RTX Remix and how they enhance materials automatically?\nRTX Remix offers generative AI Texture Tools to automatically enhance textures from classic games. The AI network has been trained on a wide variety of textures, and can analyze them to identify the material properties they are meant to possess. It will generate roughness and normal maps to simulate realistic materials, and upscale the pixel count of textures by 4X, ensuring that the remastered content not only looks stunning but also retains the essence of the original game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat role does NVIDIA DLSS play in RTX Remix, and how does it impact performance?\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 utilizes deep learning algorithms to perform DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution, boosting performance while maintaining high-quality visuals. It is an essential technology to enable full ray tracing, also known as path tracing (the most realistic light simulation available), which is used in state of the art games and blockbuster movies. With DLSS 3, powerful RTX GPUs can render jaw dropping visuals without tradeoffs to smoothness or image quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan RTX Remix be used with any game, or is it limited to specific titles?\nRTX Remix is designed to support\u00a0 a wide range of games, though its level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game\u2019s assets and engine. RTX Remix works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines, such as Call of Duty 2, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Garry's Mod, Freedom Fighters, Need for Speed Underground 2, and Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines; head to the community compatibility list on ModDB to see which games are compatible. Download any game\u2019s rtx.conf config file and the RTX Remix runtime version it works with, and you are ready to get going with your mod.\nGame compatibility will expand over time, in part as NVIDIA publishes more feature-rich versions of the RTX Remix Runtime (the component that handles how RTX Remix hooks to games). In part, compatibility will also improve thanks to the community; in April, we released the RTX Remix Runtime in open source, making it easy for the community to contribute code that can improve RTX Remix\u2019s functionality with a range of games.\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve seen the community do unimaginable things like mod fixed function pipelines into existing games, use wrappers that make games compatible, and even contribute to identifying compatible games for ModDB\u2019s community compatibility list. We encourage the community to keep working with us to push the boundaries of which games RTX Remix works with. For more details on compatibility, check out our RTX Remix Text Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve added a RTX Remix runtime and a RTX.conf file from ModDB next to my game and RTX Remix won\u2019t properly hook to it\u2013any suggestions?\nMany classic games do not use a fixed function pipeline for how they render everything, and therefore may struggle to work with RTX Remix. To better understand compatibility, we encourage modders to read about it within our RTX Remix Text Guide. In some cases, a game may not work because its rendering techniques are too modern or primitive. Alternatively, it may not work because it requires unorthodox steps\u2013for example, a wrapper, a unique file structure that allows the RTX Remix Runtime to hook to the game properly, or a different version of the game.\n We recommend modders check ModDB\u2019s community resources, which include a compatibility table, rtx.conf file with the proper config settings for each game, as well as any unique steps users have documented that are required to run a particular game well. These resources will continue to improve as they are updated by the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan RTX Remix remaster a game with new lighting and textures in a single click?\nRTX Remix is not a \u201cone button\u201d solution to remastering. While producing a mod with full ray tracing in RTX Remix is relatively straightforward, if the game assets are not upgraded to possess physically accurate materials, the mod will not likely look right; the likelihood is many textures will look uniformly shiny or matte.\nPBR assets with physically accurate materials react properly to realistic lighting. Glass reflects the world with clear detail, while laminate wood flooring has rough, coarse reflections. And stone, though without visible reflections, is still capable of bouncing light and having an effect on the scene. Without taking advantage of PBR, the modder is not fully taking advantage of full ray tracing.  Generative AI Texture Tools can help you get started with converting legacy textures to physically accurate materials. But the most impressive RTX Remix projects (like Portal With RTX, Portal: Prelude RTX and Half Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project) are chock full of lovingly hand made high quality assets with enormous polygonal counts and realistic materials. The best Blender artists will revel in being able to bring their carefully crafted assets into games without compromising on their visuals.\nThe most ambitious mods also see modders customize and add new lights to each scene to account for how the game now looks with realistic lighting and shadowing. This relighting step can allow for all the advantages of path traced lights while preserving the look of the original game.\nWhen used alongside traditional modding tools, like Valve\u2019s Hammer Editor, RTX Remix can make mods even more spectacular. Modders can reinvent particle systems and redesign aspects of the game RTX Remix can not interface with\u2013 for example the level design, the physics, and in-game AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow user-friendly is RTX Remix for modders with varying levels of experience?\nRTX Remix is designed for\u00a0experienced modders. The intuitive interface, coupled with step-by-step guides and tutorials, ensures that modders can navigate and utilize the software effectively, unlocking the potential for creative expression. We recommend modders participate in the RTX Remix Discord community to collaborate and learn from one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much time can I expect to spend with RTX Remix to make a mod?\nIt\u2019s truly up to the modder. Some modders will lean heavily on AI and produce mods that feature full ray tracing and replaced textures, but no modifications to geometry and meshes. Others will spend months crafting the perfect remaster, complete with assets that feature 20, 30, or in the case of Half Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, sometimes 70 times the polygonal detail of assets in the original game.\nRTX Remix is a huge time saver, as it takes the need away to juggle dozens of tools to mod a single game\u2019s visuals. You don\u2019t need to be skilled in reverse engineering games to inject full ray tracing into an RTX Remix mod. And in a fully ray traced game where lighting is simulated realistically, it is much easier to reauthor and relight a game as every light behaves just as you expect.\nAll of that saved time can be spent on leveling up other aspects of a mod or bringing a mod to market sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I give feedback to NVIDIA about my experience with RTX Remix?\u00a0\nPlease share any feedback with us on our RTX Remix GitHub. Simply, follow the steps below:\n\nGo to this NVIDIAGameWorks RTX Remix page\nClick the green \"New Issue\" button\nSelect the bug template (Runtime, Documentation, Toolkit, Feature Request) and click \"Get Started\"\nFill out the template, add as many details as possible, include files and screenshots\nClick the green \"Submit new issue\"\n\nWe will develop RTX Remix with close attention paid to the issues documented there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModders - Download The NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta Now\nIf you want to make your own full ray-traced mod for a classic game, the NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta is available to download now.

The processors, which provide a combined 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS), enable real-time fusing and processing of sensor information \u2014 powering full-scenario autonomous driving for navigation on advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), full-scenario assisted driving for lane change control (LCC), automated parking and automatic emergency braking (AEB) active safety features.\nThe new AD Max 3.0 upgrade transitions the system to an end-to-end algorithmic architecture dominated by large AI models. It delivers a safer, more comfortable intelligent driving experience using an occupancy network and spatio-temporal trajectory planning and model-predictive control algorithms.\nBuilding the Future of Transportation on DRIVE\r\nGWM, among China\u2019s leading new energy vehicle makers, has announced that it will build its self-developed, high-end intelligent-driving system, the Coffee Pilot, based on the DRIVE Orin centralized computing platform. Coffee Pilot can support parking, high-speed and urban scenes to achieve full-scenario smart navigation and assisted-driving functions without high-precision maps.\nGWM, which collaborated with NVIDIA to develop this intelligent-driving system, will debut its first model with the system in the first half of the year. Advanced intelligent-driving features, such as Urban Navigate on Autopilot and cross-floor Memory Parking, will be first rolled out in GWM\u2019s WEY models.\n\u201cLLM-driven AI technology will profoundly enhance future mobility as well as the entire automotive industry,\u201d said a GWM spokesperson. \u201cGWM is committed to working with NVIDIA and other industry-leading players to offer greener, smarter mobility for all.\u201d\nZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely, has launched the ZEEKR Luxury Sedan, its fourth model to be powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin. It features a new full-stack smart driving system, powered by two DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip, to deliver intelligent parking and automated operation on high-speed and urban roads. ZEEKR\u2019s full range of models is offered with two sensor options: Lidar + Vision Fusion and Pure Vision. The Navigation ZEEKR Pilot, a highway navigation feature from ZEEKR\u2019s in-house advanced driving assistant system, will be available for use in major Chinese cities once deliveries begin.\n\u201cZEEKR is proud to work with NVIDIA on innovative, safe autonomous driving capabilities,\u201d said Chen Qi, vice president of ZEEKR. \u201cThe new ZEEKR Luxury Sedan\u2019s in-house-developed ADAS system is made possible with the energy-efficient, high-performance NVIDIA DRIVE car computing platform.\u201d\nXiaomi EV, the automotive arm of the technology giant, has announced its first EV, the SU7 sedan, which is built on a dual DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions. Built using Xiaomi\u2019s leading large language model for perception and decision-making, the sedan will be able to seamlessly navigate through Chinese cities, regardless of locale, administrative divisions within the country or type of road. It will come in two versions: one with a driving range of up to 415 miles on a single charge and another with a range of up to 497 miles. The SU7 will be officially launched in the first half of 2024.\nIn production with leading automakers, trucks, robotaxis and shuttles since 2022, DRIVE Orin offers up to 254 TOPS and is scalable to support level 2+ to level 5 self-driving capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

In addition, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM (TRT-LLM), an open-source library that accelerates and optimizes inference performance of the latest large language models (LLMs), now supports more pre-optimized models for PCs. Accelerated by TRT-LLM, Chat with RTX, an NVIDIA tech demo also releasing this month, allows AI enthusiasts to interact with their notes, documents and other content.\n\u201cGenerative AI is the single most significant platform transition in computing history and will transform every industry, including gaming,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWith over 100 million RTX AI PCs and workstations, NVIDIA is a massive installed base for developers and gamers to enjoy the magic of generative AI.\u201d\nRunning generative AI locally on a PC is critical for privacy, latency and cost-sensitive applications. It requires a large installed base of AI-ready systems, as well as the right developer tools to tune and optimize AI models for the PC platform.\nTo meet these needs, NVIDIA is delivering innovations across its full technology stack, driving new experiences and building on the 500+ AI-enabled PC applications and games already accelerated by NVIDIA RTX technology.\nRTX AI PCs and Workstations\r\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs \u2014 capable of running a broad range of applications at the highest performance \u2014 unlock the full potential of generative AI on PCs. Tensor Cores in these GPUs dramatically speed AI performance across the most demanding applications for work and play.\nThe new GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series graphics cards, also announced today at CES, include the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, 4070 Ti SUPER and 4070 SUPER for top AI performance. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER generates AI video 1.5x faster \u2014 and images 1.7x faster \u2014 than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. The Tensor Cores in SUPER GPUs deliver up to 836 trillion operations per second, bringing transformative AI capabilities to gaming, creating and everyday productivity.\nLeading manufacturers \u2014 including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung \u2014 are releasing a new wave of RTX AI laptops, bringing a full set of generative AI capabilities to users right out of the box. The new systems, which deliver a performance increase ranging from 20x-60x compared with using neural processing units, will start shipping this month.\nMobile workstations with RTX GPUs can run NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including TensorRT and NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122 for simplified, secure generative AI and data science development. A three-year license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is included with every NVIDIA A800 40GB Active GPU, providing an ideal workstation development platform for AI and data science.\nNew PC Developer Tools for Building AI Models\r\nTo help developers quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs using PC-class performance and memory footprint, NVIDIA recently announced NVIDIA AI Workbench.\nAI Workbench, which will be available in beta later this month, offers streamlined access to popular repositories like Hugging Face, GitHub and NVIDIA NGC\u2122, along with a simplified user interface that enables developers to easily reproduce, collaborate on and migrate projects.\nProjects can be scaled out to virtually anywhere \u2014 whether the data center, a public cloud or NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud \u2014 and then brought back to local RTX systems on a PC or workstation for inference and light customization.\nIn collaboration with HP, NVIDIA is also simplifying AI model development by integrating NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Endpoints, which include RTX-accelerated AI models and software development kits, into the HP AI Studio, a centralized platform for data science. This will allow users to easily search, import and deploy optimized models across PCs and the cloud.\nAfter building AI models for PC use cases, developers can optimize them using NVIDIA TensorRT to take full advantage of RTX GPUs\u2019 Tensor Cores.\nNVIDIA recently extended TensorRT to text-based applications with TensorRT-LLM for Windows, an open-source library for accelerating LLMs. The latest update to TensorRT-LLM, available now, adds Phi-2 to the growing list of pre-optimized models for PC, which run up to 5x faster compared to other inference backends.\nRTX-Accelerated Generative AI Powers New PC Experiences\r\nAt CES, NVIDIA and its developer partners are releasing new generative AI-powered applications and services for PCs, including:\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix, a platform for creating stunning RTX remasters of classic games. Releasing in beta later this month, it delivers generative AI tools that can transform basic textures from classic games into modern, 4K-resolution, physically based rendering materials.\nNVIDIA ACE microservices, including generative AI-powered speech and animation models, which enable developers to add intelligent, dynamic digital avatars to games.\nTensorRT acceleration for Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) Turbo and latent consistency models, two of the most popular Stable Diffusion acceleration methods. TensorRT improves performance for both by up to 60% compared with the previous fastest implementation. An updated version of the Stable Diffusion WebUI TensorRT extension is also now available, including acceleration for SDXL, SDXL Turbo, LCM - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and improved LoRA support.\nNVIDIA DLSS 3 with Frame Generation, which uses AI to increase frame rates up to 4x compared with native rendering, will be featured in a dozen of the 14 new RTX games announced, including Horizon Forbidden West, Pax Dei and Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2.\nChat with RTX, an NVIDIA tech demo available later this month, allows AI enthusiasts to easily connect PC LLMs to their own data using a popular technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The demo, accelerated by TensorRT-LLM, enables users to quickly interact with their notes, documents and other content. It will also be available as an open-source reference project, so developers can easily implement the same capabilities in their own applications.\n\nLearn more about the latest generative AI breakthroughs by joining NVIDIA at CES.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

ACE AI models are designed to run in the cloud or locally on the PC.\nIn an ACE demo featuring Convai\u2019s new technologies, NVIDIA\u2019s Senior Product Manager Seth Schneider showed how it works.\n\u00a0\n\nFirst, a player\u2019s voice input is passed to NVIDIA\u2019s automatic speech recognition model, which translates speech to text. Then, the text is put into an LLM to generate the character\u2019s response.\nAfter that, the text response is vocalized using a text-to-speech model, which is passed to an animation model to create a realistic lip sync. Finally, the dynamic character is rendered into the game scene.\nAt CES, NVIDIA is announcing ACE Production Microservices for NVIDIA Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva Automatic Speech Recognition. Available now, each model can be incorporated by developers individually into their pipelines.\nNVIDIA is also announcing game and interactive avatar developers are pioneering ways ACE and generative AI technologies can be used to transform interactions between players and non-playable characters in games and applications. Developers embracing ACE include Convai, Charisma.AI, Inworld, miHoYo, NetEase Games, Ourpalm, Tencent, Ubisoft and UneeQ.\nGetty Images Releases Generative AI by iStock and AI Image Generation Tools Powered by NVIDIA Picasso\nGenerative AI empowers designers and marketers to create concept imagery, social media content and more. Today, iStock by Getty Images is releasing a genAI service built on NVIDIA Picasso, an AI foundry for visual design, Fisher announced.\nThe iStock service allows anyone to create 4K imagery from text using an AI model trained on Getty Images\u2019 extensive catalog of licensed, commercially safe creative content. New editing application programming interfaces that give customers powerful control over their generated images are also coming soon.\nThe generative AI service is available today at istock.com, with advanced editing features releasing via API.\nNVIDIA Introduces GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series\nFisher announced a new series of GeForce RTX 40 SUPER GPUs with more gaming and generative AI performance.\nFisher said that the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER can power fully ray-traced games at 4K. It\u2019s 1.4x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti without frame gen in the most graphically intensive games. With 836 AI TOPS, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as an RTX 3080 Ti.\nCreators can generate video with Stable Video Diffusion 1.5x faster and images with Stable Diffusion XL 1.7x faster. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory, giving it a performance edge at a great new price of $999. It will be available starting Jan. 31.\nNext up is the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER. NVIDIA has added more cores and increased the frame buffer to 16GB and the memory bus to 256 bits. It\u2019s 1.6x faster than a 3070 Ti and 2.5x faster with DLSS 3, Fisher said. The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 for $799.\nFisher also introduced the RTX 4070 SUPER. NVIDIA has added 20% more cores, making it faster than the RTX 3090 while using a fraction of the power. And with DLSS 3, it\u2019s 1.5x faster in the most demanding games. It will be available for $599 starting Jan. 17.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta Launches This Month\nThere are over 10 billion game mods downloaded each year. With RTX Remix, modders can remaster classic games with full ray tracing, DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex and generative AI texture tools that transform low-resolution textures into 4K, physically accurate materials. The RTX Remix app will be released in open beta on Jan. 22.\nRTX Remix has already delivered stunning remasters in NVIDIA\u2019s Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX. Now, Orbifold Studios is using RTX Remix to develop Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, a community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time.\nCheck out this new Half-Life 2 RTX gameplay trailer:\n\n\u00a0\nTwitch and NVIDIA to Release Multi-Encode Livestreaming\nTwitch is one of the most popular platforms for content creators, with over 7 million streamers going live each month to 35 million daily viewers. Fisher explained that these viewers are on all kinds of devices and internet services.\nYet many Twitch streamers are limited to broadcasting at a single resolution and quality level. As a result, they must broadcast at lower quality to reach more viewers.\nTo address this, Twitch, OBS and NVIDIA announced Enhanced Broadcasting, supported by all RTX GPUs. This new feature allows streamers to transmit up to three concurrent streams to Twitch at different resolutions and quality so each viewer gets the optimal experience.\nBeta signups start today and will go live later this month. Twitch will also experiment with 4K and AV1 on the GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to deliver even better quality and higher resolution streaming.\n\u2018New Wave\u2019 of AI-Ready RTX Laptops\nRTX is the fastest-growing laptop platform, having grown 5x in the last four years.

Users can enter simple text prompts to generate photo-quality images at up to 4K resolution.\nInpainting and outpainting APIs, with Replace feature coming soon.\nNew editing APIs give customers powerful control over their generated images.\nThe Inpainting feature allows users to mask a region of an image, then fill in the region with a person or object described via a text prompt.\nOutpainting enables users to expand images to fit various aspect ratios, filling in new areas based on the context of the original image. This is a powerful tool to create assets with unique aspect ratios for advertising or social media promotion.\nAnd coming soon, a Replace feature provides similar capabilities to Inpainting but with stricter adherence to the mask.\nTransforming Visual Design\nAI foundry enables developers and service providers to seamlessly train, fine-tune, optimize and deploy generative AI models tailored to their visual design requirements. Developers can use their own AI models or train new ones using the NVIDIA Edify model architecture to generate images, videos, 3D assets, 360-degree high-dynamic-range imaging and physically based rendering materials from simple text prompts.\nUsing AI Foundry, Getty Images trained a bespoke Edify image generator based on its catalog of licensed images and videos to power the Generative AI by iStock service.\nCustomers can use Generative AI by iStock online today. Advanced editing features are now available via APIs and coming soon to the iStock website.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: 3D | Art | Artificial Intelligence | CES 2024 | Cloud Services | NVIDIA Studio \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He then updated old assets and searched the Unreal Engine store for new ones \u2014 what he couldn\u2019t find, like fishing nets and custom flags, he created from scratch.\nRanga meticulously organizes assets.\n\u201cI chose a GeForce RTX GPU to use ray-traced dynamic global illumination with RTX cards for natural, more realistic light bounces.\u201d \u2014 Vishal Ranga\n\nRanga\u2019s GeForce RTX graphics card unlocked RTX-accelerated rendering for high-fidelity, interactive visualization of 3D designs during virtual production.\nNext, he tackled shader work, blending in moss and muck into models of wood, nets and flags. He also created a volumetric local fog shader to complement the assets as they pass through the fog, adding greater depth to the scene.\nShaders add extraordinary depth and visual detail.\nRanga then polished everything up. He first used a water shader to add realism to reflections, surface moss and subtle waves, then tinkered with global illumination and reflection effects, along with other post-process settings.\nMaterials come together to deliver realism and higher visual quality.\nRanga used Unreal Engine\u2019s internal high-resolution screenshot feature and sequencer to capture renders. This was achieved by cranking up screen resolution to 200%, resulting in crisper details.\nThroughout, DLSS enhanced Ranga\u2019s creative workflow, allowing for smooth scene movement while maintaining immaculate visual quality.\nWhen finished with adjustments, Ranga exported the final scene in no time thanks to his RTX GPU.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/studio-vishal-ranga-wk93-swamp_01-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nRanga encourages budding artists who are excited by the latest creative advances but wondering where to begin to \u201cpractice your skills, prioritize the basics.\u201d\n\u201cTake the time to practice and really experience the highs and lows of the creation process,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to maintain good well-being to maximize your potential.\u201d\n3D artist Vishal Ranga.\nCheck out Ranga\u2019s portfolio on ArtStation.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, X and Facebook.

The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER starts from $599.\nPC gamers demand the very best in visual quality, and AI-powered NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) Super Resolution, Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction combine with ray tracing to offer stunning worlds \u2014 just a click away in titles such as Diablo IV, Pax Dei and Horizon Forbidden West. With DLSS, seven out of eight pixels can be AI-generated, accelerating full ray tracing by up to 4x with better image quality.\n\u201cFor everyone from gaming enthusiasts to creative professionals, GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs are simply awesome upgrades,\u201d said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. \u201cGeForce RTX SUPER cards support over 500 RTX games and applications and will have users prepared for the wave of generative AI apps coming to PC.\u201d\nAn AI-Powered Leap in PC Computing\r\nThe new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs are the ultimate way to experience AI on PCs. Specialized AI Tensor Cores deliver up to 836 AI TOPS to deliver transformative capabilities for AI in gaming, creating and everyday productivity. The rich software stack built on top of RTX GPUs further accelerates AI.\nNVIDIA TensorRT\u2122 is software for high-performance deep learning inference, which includes a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency and high throughput for inference applications. TensorRT-LLM for Windows is an open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large language models. In AI workloads, the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER generates video over 1.5x faster and images over 1.7x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti.\nFor games, AI-powered DLSS provides greater in-game immersion. Meanwhile, generative AI applications like Adobe Photoshop take advantage of Tensor Cores to speed productivity and keep creative workflows moving. And for productivity, NVIDIA Broadcast can remove background noise and provide seamless virtual backgrounds.\nWith GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, users can unlock the full potential of AI on Windows PCs.\nA 4K Monster: The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER\r\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER powers fully ray-traced games in 4K resolution. At 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti without DLSS Frame Generation, the RTX 4080 SUPER delivers blistering performance with traditional rasterization. With 836 AI TOPS, DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory for a performance edge. It will be available starting Jan. 31 from $999.\nPrecision Gaming: The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER\r\nThe RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is the ideal GPU for maxing out games at super-high frame rates at 1440p, and up to 4K. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, it has more cores, an increased frame buffer to 16GB, and a 256-bit memory bus, providing a significant memory bandwidth increase to 672 GB/sec. It is 1.6x faster than a RTX 3070 Ti and 2.5x with DLSS 3. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 at $799.\nPerfectly Balanced: The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\r\nThe RTX 4070 SUPER arrives with 20% more cores than the RTX 4070, making it faster than an RTX 3090 at a fraction of the power. With DLSS 3, its lead stretches to 1.5x faster. It will be available starting Jan. 17 at $599.\nWhere to Buy\r\nFor the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER and 4070 SUPER, an NVIDIA Founders Edition Design will be available direct from NVIDIA.com and select retailers. Custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models for all GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs, will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

In the last 52 weeks, it is 209.96% in the green, and in the last 30 days, another 21.83%. NVDA is also up 23.51% since the start of 2024 and has risen to $594.91 \u2013 4.17% \u2013 in the last trading day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n40 mins ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Source: Finbold\nHowever, such a staggering rise often comes before a fall \u2013 or a correction \u2013 and CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently warned that the stock market is ready for a pullback, leaving many to ponder whether one of the market\u2019s biggest names will be a part of the reversal.\nThus, with both growth and the risk in mind, Finbold consulted the predictive algorithms of CoinCodex to try and figure out where the chip-maker\u2019s stock may find itself in 12 months\u2019 time, to get further insights into which direction it may be headed.\nAI forecasts NVDA stock price\nAs it turns out, the machine learning algorithms of CoinCodex forecast another year of strong growth for NVDA, with the December 31, 2024, price standing at $683.54 \u2013 a 14.90% from the current price.\nIt is interesting, however, that the platform also forecasts significant volatility for NVDA as it sees it falling within 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months and only surging again in the final quarter of the year.\nNVDA year\u2019s end forecast. Source: CoinCodex\nSuch an outlook is also reflected in the measurements assessing investor attitude toward the stock \u2013 the overall sentiment is bullish, but the \u201cFear & Greed\u201d index registers \u201cfear.\u201d Finally, NVDA\u2019s overall upward trajectory and volatility are also reflected in the fact that it had 18 green days out of the last 30 \u2013 60%.\nNVDA metrics and sentiment. Source: CoinCodex\nAre experts bullish on NVDA?\nThe 52 analysts assessed by TradingView are, much like the predictive algorithms, highly bullish on NVDA. In fact, as many as 40 strongly recommend investors buy the semiconductor giant\u2019s shares, and none believe selling is the right decision.\nNVDA analyst predictions. Source: TradingView\nAnalysts\u2019 average 12-month price target for the company is also remarkably similar to what the AI is forecasting, as it stands at $672.31. The high estimate is, however, significantly more optimistic as it is as high as $1,100, while some forecast a slight downturn and have set their sight at $410.\nBuy stocks now with Interactive Brokers \u2013 the most advanced investment platform\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

As we step into 2024, the potential for growth in the robotics industry remains substantial. Investors who are keen on capitalizing on this trend will focus their efforts on companies with market dominance and resilience.\u00a0This has led to this list of robotics stocks for 2024.\nMarket Research Future estimates the global robotics market to eclipse more than $200 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 22.80%. Industry growth will be fueled by process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence and machine learning. Investors should not ignore the market opportunities that are present, as demand rises in an increasingly autonomous world.\u00a0\nNow, let\u2019s discover the 3 best robotics stocks that will go the distance in 2024!\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as a frontrunner for the best robotics stocks to buy in 2024. They have set a new standard in artificial intelligence, and momentum is expected to continue this year.\u00a0\nIn 2023, shares surged more than 200% YOY, as the company ramped up their generative AI offerings. Nvidia is currently the leading AI chip supplier, and Wall Street might be overlooking the potential of their robotics platform. Nvidia Isaac, is an end-to-end solution to train, simulate, develop, and deploy advanced robotics applications.\u00a0This makes it one of those robotics stocks for 2024.\nDevelopers can also leverage the Omniverse Cloud, using the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). This platform provides advanced mapping, site analytics, fleet and route optimization and can work safely among humans. Nvidia has barely scratched the surface, and their work in AI and accelerated computing will continue to move the needle forward. While the development process can be extremely complex and capital intensive, Nvidia will have the data in order to solve some of the industry\u2019s most pressing problems.\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG)\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is one of the most compelling robotics stocks for 2024. They are the leading robotics assisted surgery company that has been at the forefront for the last two decades.\u00a0\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, the company received funding from the National Institute of Health to develop a prototype for a robotics surgical system. After raising $46 million in an IPO in 2000, the company received FDA clearance for the Da Vinci surgical system.\u00a0Now, Intuitive Surgical\u2019s Da Vinci surgical system is used in more than 8,000 hospitals globally.\u00a0\nIn their recent quarterly results, ISRG revenue grew 12% YOY to $1.74 billion. Net income increased 28% YOY to $416 million, or $1.16 per share. Additionally, Da Vinci surgical system installations hit a record of 8,285, with Da Vinci procedures growing 19% from the year prior. Analyst\u2019s project FY23 EPS in the $4.43 \u2013 $4.65 range, reflecting approximately 25% YOY growth. This makes Intuitive Surgical one of the best no-brainer robotics stocks for 2024.\nUiPath (PATH)\nSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertise\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) closed off the 2023 year up nearly 100%. The company has been making significant progress, after a not so pleasant start from its IPO in 2021.\nUiPath is currently one of the leading software companies in process automation (RPA). Process automation is technology that makes it easy for companies to build, deploy, and manage robots that can emulate human actions. Grand View Research, estimates the RPA market to grow at a CAGR of nearly 40% from 2023 \u2013 2030.\u00a0\nIn Q3 fiscal 2024, UiPath saw strong growth with revenue up 24% YOY to $326 million. While the company is still losing money, net loss saw a significant improvement. GAAP net loss was $31.5 million, compared to a net loss of $57.7 million. UiPath now expects ARR for fiscal 2024 in the $1.45 billion to $145.5 range, up from its previous forecasted estimates. If you have a greater appetite for risk, UiPath could be a great long term robotics stock to buy for 2024.\u00a0This makes it one of those robotics stocks for 2024.\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

AI says these three stocks can help you achieve it.\nNvidia (NVDA): It\u2019s not surprising the leading AI chipmaker was picked by AI to rocket higher.\nNio (NIO): The Chinese EV maker in the biggest EV market would seem to have the lead on hitting ten-bagger status.\nSalesforce (CRM): This top CRM stock is using AI to leapfrog to the forefront of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Allies Interactive\n\n\n\nInvesting great Peter Lynch steered Fidelity Magellan from a fund with $20 million in assets under management (AUM) to $14 billion in AUM in just 13 years years. That\u2019s a compounded annual growth rate greater than 29% and why he is considered a stock market legend. While Lynch may be a legend, that doesn\u2019t mean that AI isn\u2019t slowly becoming a savvy stock predictor as well. In face, there are stocks that AI predicts may become 10-baggers. \nCombing through the universe of stocks looking for ones that could grow to 10 times my initial investment is daunting. So why not enlist the help of artificial intelligence? It can sort through millions of data points in seconds and spit out stocks that meet your criteria.\nI turned to Microsoft\u2018s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CoPilot (formerly Bing Chat) because it\u2019s the one place you can use the latest version of ChatGPT for free. GPT-4 is the more powerful and more accurate version of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot.\u00a0While I still wouldn\u2019t trust AI to make my investment decisions for me, here are the three stocks AI thinks can be 10-baggers in 10 years.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops the list of stocks the can increase 10 times over the next decade. If it maintains last year\u2019s pace it will happen a heckuva lot sooner. The chipmaker more than tripled in value in 2023 and was largely responsible for the gains made by the S&P 500. Nvidia was the fifth largest and second most influential component in the index behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The stock is already up 10% in 2024.\nIf Nvidia can achieve this feat it will be because of AI. It is the leading chipmaker specializing in the kinds of technology needed for AI to process all the data required by supercomputers and data center infrastructure. Nvidia\u2019s HGX with InfiniBand platform is already running most generative AI applications, including ChatGPT and CoPilot. Others include Adobe\u2018s (NASDAQ:ADBE) Firefly, ServiceNow\u2018s (NYSE:NOW) Now Assist, and Zoom Video\u2018s (NASDAQ:ZM) AI Companion.\nI\u2019ve suggested Nvidia is priced for perfection and any sort of hiccup with AI\u2019s adoption could send NVDA stock lower. However, a really good argument can be made that for a company like Nvidia that is on a long-term trajectory higher, waiting to buy is immaterial. The few dollars per share you\u2019ll gain by holding off on buying now will be inconsequential if it achieves 10 times your original investment in 10 years.\nNio (NIO)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nChinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) is another stock CoPilot picked to generate massive returns for investors. It is developing a portfolio of smart vehicles that blend the best of EV and autonomous vehicle capabilities. As a fast-growing EV maker in the world\u2019s largest EV market while expanding sales to other markets, it seems like an easy pathway for growth.\nYet I\u2019m hesitant about recommending Nio stock. It is cutting prices on its vehicles like most other manufacturers, new trade restrictions with China means entering the United States market won\u2019t be easy, and it\u2019s cutting jobs to conserve cash. Nio produces losses on every car it makes and those losses are widening.\nThe United Arab Emirates sovereign fund infused it with more than $3 billion in cash. The Middle East is shaping up to be an important market for EVs. Countries there are trying to diversify away from oil as their primary revenue source. Saudi Arabia is similarly investing heavily in Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID).\nNio has its battery-swap business to lean on but wants to spin it off to focus on making EVs profitably. Batteries-as-a-service is a model other EV makers could use to overcome buyer concerns about limited driving distances. Nio can swap out a battery in three minutes.\nIf NIO stock is going to grow 10 times your initial investment it\u2019s off to a rocky start. It lost 10% last year and is down more than 20% year to date. It\u2019s one reason why I think you can\u2019t outsource your investment decisions to AI.\nSalesforce (CRM)\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nBut I do think Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a good pick to mint millionaires. It is using AI to transform \u201cfrom being not only the number one CRM, but to the number one AI CRM.\u201d Because of AI, CEO Marc Benioff says Salesforce is now the third-largest enterprise software company in the world by revenue behind Microsoft and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). This was achieved despite 2023 not being a great year for cloud software stocks.\u00a0\nGlobal IT spending fell below 20% for the first time last year and fell to 16% in the third quarter. Analysts at Canalys, however, suggest the market has finally stabilized and AI will be the primary driver going forward. AI is already offsetting most of the decline in traditional cloud spending. That will only accelerate as enterprises pick up the pace of investing in new AI strategies.\nIt was AI that drove CRM\u2019s Q3 revenue 11% higher while widening adjusted operating margins from 19.9% to 31.6%. Salesforce is also investing in other AI businesses to help them grow. Its $500 million Salesforce Ventures takes stakes in unique small AI startups such as Anthropic, Cohere, and Hugging Face.\nSalesforce was the best-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year and is rising again this year. The customer relationship management outfit\u2019s total return over the past decade has nearly quadrupled in size. With AI pushing it forward, it could readily grow 10 times in 10 years.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The price movements come after a year of strong performance \u2013 both on the business and the stock market side \u2013 and in the climate of continued industry dominance, including for the chips for the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector.\nSince New Year\u2019s Day, the shares of Nvidia are up 7.90% and stood at, at the market close on Tuesday, January 9, at $531.40, having risen 1.70% in a day. The company\u2019s stock continued its upward trajectory in the extended trading and is, at press time, 0.97% in the green.\nNVDA YTD price chart. Source: Finbold\nThis means that between January 1 and January 10, Nvidia\u2019s market cap rose by nearly $100 billion \u2013 from $1.223 trillion up to $1.312 trillion \u2013 making it the world\u2019s sixth largest company, ranking right between Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ: META).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n40 mins ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Between its leading position in supplying the AI sector and an agreement with the U.S. government to continue exports to China, the company is well positioned to rise even further.\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia\u2019s stock stands at $662.39 \u2013 a 24.65% upside compared to the price at press time. The firm is considered a \u201cstrong buy\u201d with 32 out of the 36 analysts considered by the stock analysis platform TipRanks marking it as such.\u00a0\nNVDA 12-month forecast. Source: TipRanks\nThe 54 analysts taken into account by TradingView concur that Nvida\u2019s shares are a strong buy, with as many as 42 explicitly considering it as such. None of the represented analysts ranked the company\u2019s stock as a \u201csell\u201d or a \u201cstrong sell.\u201d\nThe highest 12-month price for the semiconductor giant stands as high as $1,100, while the lowest foresees a downside and is set at $410.\nNVDA 1-year forecast. Source: TradingView\nA possible argument for Nvidia not having such a strong 2024 comes in the form of reported issues with the Chinese market. Allegedly, Chinese companies are somewhat reluctant to accept the modified chips that comply with new export restrictions, and some went on to repurpose gaming chips for uses in AI technology.\nAdditionally, while the East Asian country has yet to produce chips as advanced as those made by Nvidia, Huawei has been improving its designs, and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) made an effort to slightly reduce its dependence on the American supplier already last year.\nBuy stocks now with Interactive Brokers \u2013 the most advanced investment platform\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Healthcare customers and partners already consume well over a billion dollars in NVIDIA GPU computing each year \u2014 directly and indirectly through cloud partners.\nIn the $250 billion field of drug discovery, these efforts are meeting an inflection point: R&D teams can now represent drugs inside a computer.\nBy harnessing emerging generative AI tools, drug discovery teams observe foundational building blocks of molecular sequence, structure, function and meaning \u2014 allowing them to generate or design novel molecules likely to possess desired properties. With these capabilities, researchers can curate a more precise field of drug candidates to investigate, reducing the need for expensive, time-consuming physical experiments.\nAccelerating this shift is NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI platform that provides services to develop, customize and deploy foundation models for drug discovery.\nUsed by pharmaceutical, techbio and software companies, BioNeMo offers a new class of computational methods for drug research and development, enabling scientists to integrate generative AI to reduce experiments and, in some cases, replace them altogether.\nIn addition to developing, optimizing and hosting AI models through BioNeMo, NVIDIA has boosted the computer-aided drug discovery ecosystem with investments in innovative techbio companies \u2014 such as biopharmaceutical company Recursion, which is offering one of its foundation models for BioNeMo users, and biotech company Terray Therapeutics, which is using BioNeMo for AI model development.\nBioNeMo Brings Precision to AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery\u00a0\nBioNeMo features a growing collection of pretrained biomolecular AI models for protein structure prediction, protein sequence generation, molecular optimization, generative chemistry, docking prediction and more. It also enables computer-aided drug discovery companies to make their models available to a broad audience through easy-to-access APIs for inference and customization.\nDrug discovery teams use BioNeMo to invent or customize generative AI models with proprietary data \u2014 and drug discovery software companies, techbios and large pharmas\u00a0 are integrating\u00a0 BioNeMo cloud APIs, which will be released in beta this month, into platforms that deliver computer-aided drug discovery workflows.\nThe cloud APIs will now include foundation models from three sources: models invented by NVIDIA, such as the MolMIM generative chemistry model for small molecule generation; open-source models pioneered by global research teams, curated and optimized by NVIDIA, such as the OpenFold protein prediction AI; and proprietary models developed by NVIDIA partners, such as Recursion\u2019s Phenom-Beta for embedding cellular microscopy images.\nMolMIM generates small molecules while giving users finer control over the AI generation process \u2014 identifying new molecules that possess desired properties and follow constraints specified by users. For example, researchers could direct the model to generate molecules that have similar structures and properties to a given reference molecule.\nPhenomenal AI for Pharma: Recursion Brings Phenom-Beta Model to BioNeMo\nRecursion is the first hosting partner offering an AI model through BioNeMo cloud APIs: Phenom-Beta, a vision transformer model that extracts biologically meaningful features from cellular microscopy images.\nThis capability can provide researchers with insights about cell function and help them learn how cells respond to drug candidates or genetic engineering.\nPhenom-Beta performed well on image reconstruction tasks, a training metric to evaluate model performance. Read the NeurIPS workshop paper to learn more.\nPhenom-Beta was trained on Recursion\u2019s publicly available RxRx3 dataset of biological images using the company\u2019s BioHive-1 supercomputer, based on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD reference architecture.\nTo further its foundation model development, Recursion is expanding its supercomputer with more than 500 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. This will boost its computational capacity by 4x to create what\u2019s expected to be the most powerful supercomputer owned and operated by any biopharma company.\n\nHow Companies Are Adopting NVIDIA BioNeMo\nA growing group of scientists, biotech and pharma companies, and AI software vendors are using NVIDIA BioNeMo to support biology, chemistry and genomics research.\nBiotech leader Terray Therapeutics is integrating BioNeMo cloud APIs into its development of a generalized, multi-target structural binding model. The company also uses NVIDIA DGX Cloud to train chemistry foundation models to power generative AI for small molecule design.\nProtein engineering and molecular design companies Innophore and Insilico Medicine are bringing BioNeMo into their computational drug discovery applications. Innophore is integrating BioNeMo cloud APIs into its Catalophore platform for protein design and drug discovery. And Insilico, a premier member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, has adopted BioNeMo in its generative AI pipeline for early drug discovery.\nBiotech software company OneAngstrom and systems integrator Deloitte are using BioNeMo cloud APIs to build AI solutions for their clients.\nOneAngstrom is integrating BioNeMo cloud APIs into its SAMSON platform for molecular design used by academics, biotechs and pharmas. Deloitte is transforming scientific research by integrating BioNeMo on NVIDIA DGX Cloud with the Quartz Atlas AI platform. This combination enables biopharma researchers with unparalleled data connectivity and cutting-edge generative AI, propelling them into a new era of accelerated drug discovery.\nLearn more about NVIDIA BioNeMo and subscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | DGX Cloud | Genomics | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA NeMo | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Morgan Stanley Bullish on Diversified, Alpha Hedge Fund Portfolios On December 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley\u00a0reported that falling inflation levels are expected to be sluggishly above bank targets ahead of 2024. Such may lead to price dispersion and provide hedge fund alpha opportunities across asset classes. Throughout 2024, the Fed is expected to ease monetary policy which may eventually push wide discrepancies among winners and losers. While an easing cycle coupled with higher interest rates may increase volatility in bond prices, hedge funds may be able to benefit from higher interest rates, especially with derivative-based investing strategies. Morgan Stanley is bullish on diversified and alpha hedge fund portfolios in the current environment. The market is uncertain and the outlook for 2024 seems unclear, which may be a hint towards avoiding big and risky bets.

To commence with our research we first established certain parameters to define a niche for our list. Therefore, our list consists of popular hedge fund managers that primarily own a Twitter account, and other social media channels if available. We first consulted four reports on the internet including Forbes, Benzinga, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance. We then applied certain filters on LinkedIn using keywords such as \"hedge fund manager\" to ensure we did not miss any important names. Finally, we also looked up founding members and owners of popular hedge funds. This thorough process enabled us to come up with 55 hedge fund managers. We then conducted a manual search to find the Twitter account of every investor along with other social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram, if available. Moreover, we consulted Forbes to extract profiles and the net worth of each investor.It is to be noted that while we intended to include hedge fund managers with a significant social media presence, some of the most popular names in the hedge fund industry do not own Twitter accounts.

Investors were willing to pay sky-high premiums for these high-flyers, with Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price approaching $550 at its peak. Nvidia now trades at a whopping 30 times sales (higher than 96% of semiconductor stocks), despite fierce competition from rivals racing to develop their own AI chips to claw away market share.  But this article isn\u2019t about Nvidia or other \u00fcber-expensive AI darlings. Today, we\u2019re digging for diamonds in the rough \u2013 overlooked stocks quietly benefiting from the AI gold rush without grabbing headlines. While Nvidia may have struck the mother lode, plenty of profit can still be made by selling picks and shovels to the miners. Beyond the rarefied air of Silicon Valley, unknown robotics and software companies are indirectly riding the AI wave. And within the semiconductor space lurk undervalued stocks that Wall Street has ignored. Many AI plays with bright prospects remain priced at a fraction of highly-touted stocks like Nvidia. Let\u2019s dive in! InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Evolv Technologies (EVLV)   AI stocks an intelligent robot figure representing ai stocks, investing for the next decade. Artificial Intelligence Stocks   Source: Shutterstock With geopolitical tensions escalating globally, security screening technology providers like Evolv Technologies (NASDAQ:EVLV) stand to benefit immensely. As jobs in security and policing face declining interest, AI-powered systems can help fill urgent needs at ports, venues, workplaces, and more. This isn\u2019t a broad AI play like semiconductor stocks. Rather, it\u2019s a focused niche where AI adoption seems poised to accelerate. While Evolv\u2019s share price has meandered between $2 and $5 per share for nearly two years, I believe the company is gearing up for a breakout. Its financials tell a promising story, even if profitability remains elusive for now. Revenue is growing swiftly, with top-line quarterly beats of about 40% over estimates, on average, since at least Q2 2021. Analysts also expect losses to nearly halve annually even as revenue quadruples from $115 million in 2024 to $400 million in 2027. However, it is important to note that Evolv has missed recent earnings per share estimates.  Yes, Evolv trades at a premium despite lacking profits. But its top-line growth and AI potential justify higher multiples. With security threats multiplying and labor shortages worsening, Evolv\u2019s screening platforms should see surging demand. If geopolitical and social unrest continue escalating, governments and corporations will have to automate their security processes using AI. Evolv could emerge as a critical player in this high-growth field.   Story Continues Aehr Test Systems (AEHR)  mark stock  Source: ShutterstockFew stocks have crashed harder in recent weeks than Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR), which erased nearly 65% from the rally to September\u2019s peak. However, I believe this brutal selloff now presents a golden buying opportunity. Aehr is clearly oversold, with earnings beats that apparently disappointed the market because guidance wasn\u2019t raised.Even without guidance increases, analysts expect 30% bottom-line growth ahead, alongside 20% higher revenue next fiscal year and a blistering 34% top-line expansion in FY2025. For a semiconductor firm poised to almost double its earnings over the next three years, I believe paying just 23-times forward earnings is very cheap.Aehr provides essential burn-in testing for logic and memory chips, playing a vital role in semiconductor manufacturing. Further demand appears to be locked in as autos, phones, weapons, and more depend increasingly on advanced, reliable chips. And with supply chain issues hopefully easing, chip order backlogs could unlock tremendous growth.Analysts and investors have turned absurdly bearish on a quality semiconductor firm with solid tailwinds and forecast-smashing financials. I rate AEHR stock a strong buy near $18 per share.Iteris (ITI)  AI stocks  Source: ShutterstockProviding smart mobility infrastructure software, Iteris (NASDAQ:ITI) integrates AI technology with cloud computing, sensors, and data analytics to improve transportation efficiency, safety, and sustainability. The company sits squarely in a promising niche, with roads, vehicles, and cities growing more connected.Notably, recent results show Iteris is capitalizing on its positioning. In its fiscal second quarter, the company beat earnings per share estimates by 2 cents, while revenue surged 11% year-over-year to top consensus by more than $2 million. Analysts forecast 32% earnings per share growth next year on continued double-digit revenue growth.Despite superb growth, ITI stock trades at just 18-times forward earnings. That\u2019s a steal for a software firm executing so strongly. At 1.15-times forward sales amid +10% revenue growth, valuations seem disconnected from the company\u2019s financial performance. With infrastructure investment continuing to grow globally, demand for smart transportation infrastructure should remain hot.Iteris is firing on all cylinders, yet priced at bargain-basement levels. For an AI-centric software play with so much earnings growth upcoming, a sub-$5 share price offers a fantastic bargain with minimal downside. Iteris remains a top pick of mine for AI exposure due to its impressive value and expected outperformance in 2024.Penny StocksOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks:\u00a0With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.

At ~30x that number, the analyst noted that valuation is already discounting a potential digestion period to a large extent (5-year average P/E 40x).\nThe analyst projected an FY23 revenue and EPS of $58.83 billion and $11.08.\n\t\t\n\n\nPrice Action:\u00a0NVDA shares traded higher by 3.43% at $590.65 on the last check Friday.\u00a0\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 34m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 35m \n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA): New Buy Recommendation for This Technology GiantTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Expected to Reveal New Chips at GTC Today as AI Demands Bigger GPUsTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 All-Star Analyst \u2013 Who Is the Best on Nvidia (NVDA) Stock?TipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nJensen Huang Takes Center Stage: What to Expect from Nvidia\u2019s Big GTC 2025 KeynoteTipRanks 9h \n\n\n\nTurkey plans to launch new regulations on big tech firms, Bloomberg reportsTipRanks 10h \n\n\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Threat Gets Real!

For investors, history suggests a strong pre-election year will carry over into the following year. Analysis from Carson Group\u2019s Ryan Detrick found the S&P 500 has recorded gains every election year after a 20%-plus gain in the pre-election year. And while history shows stocks usually go up regardless of which party is in the White House, analysis from Goldman Sachs found that Tech is usually the worst-performing sector in the year leading up to the general election, while Utilities and Consumer Staples tend to outperform.   In the near term, President Biden\u2019s green energy push, crackdown on fossil fuels, and escalating tech war with China are among the top issues for investors. For Trump, the former president\u2019s trade agenda, along with his pledge to \"drill baby, drill,\" have different implications for stock portfolios. Record profits for big oil Energy policy will likely be a priority for both sides of the aisle in November. Though critics of Biden\u2019s renewable energy push argue he's waged a war on fossil fuels, the sector has performed quite well under the current administration. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have reported record profits, and US oil production has hit record levels.  But Trump\u2019s campaign promise to deregulate energy production and abolish current renewable energy subsidies will be another boon to the oil industry, according to Keith Bliss, global head of markets and strategy for BloxCross. \"Big oil will be able to export as much as possible to new markets,\" Bliss told Yahoo Finance. \"When you sum up the reduction in cost, the access to new markets, the reduction in regulation costs, and the ability to produce additional products with increased feedstock, then Big Oil will make even more money.\" On the other hand, Bliss warned that oil giants will \"struggle\" if President Biden is reelected, arguing the administration will likely become \"more aggressive.\" Crackdown on China No matter who wins, some industries will be facing an uphill battle. Both Trump and Biden\u2019s aggressive stances toward China have the potential to \"rattle investors and corporate decision makers,\" warned China Beige Book\u2019s Shehzad Qazi. \"I think we're going to see a lot of aggressive maneuvers on the China front,\" Qazi told Yahoo Finance. Trump\u2019s decision to target China with tariffs as high as 25% during his first term put investors on edge, while Biden's initiatives to crack down on China\u2019s technological advancements placed chip giants in the crosshairs.   Story Continues Portfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson warned that while neither candidate is good news for chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Trump could pose a bigger risk.\"Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump's going to be even worse,\" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. \"When you look at Trump, he's mercurial and could just cut off the tap... and tell Nvidia they can\u2019t sell anything.\"A total ban could be a massive hit to American chip giants. China accounted for about one-third of the sector\u2019s global sales in 2023, with AI leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) generating at least 20% of their revenue from the country.\"Companies that rely on China for sales or for supply chains are going to have to adapt,\" Munson added.Automakers struggle with EV costsSince Biden took office, electric vehicle sales have more than quadrupled as automakers jumped on board with the administration's ambitious EV sales goals. But the transition is proving costly for traditional automakers.Ford (F) recorded a $1.3 billion loss in its EV division in its most recent quarter; General Motors (GM) is also losing money on its EVs.\"They haven't figured out the EV market yet, and if Biden comes back in, the government will keep pushing the EV story,\" Bliss said. \"The Big Three could continue to struggle.\"Higher manufacturing costs have driven up EV price tags, making affordability an issue. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that the company needs to lower its costs to succeed.\"We're seeing mainstream customers who are interested in EVs, but they're not convinced, and they're not going to pay a big premium,\" Farley said. \"So what it means for the [manufacturers] is cost \u2014 we have to dramatically reduce the cost.\"Trump targets ESGInvestments that take into account environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have become a top target for Republicans ahead of the 2024 election.Trump has been vocal about his opposition to ESG initiatives in the past, promising to support \"a law to keep politics away from Americans\u2019 retirement accounts forever.\"During the final months of his term, he pushed to discourage employers from considering ESG issues for retirement plans, a rule later reversed by Biden.The increased skepticism and scrutiny of sustainable funds from politicians and regulators has had a chilling effect on fund flows. Investors pulled a total of $13 billion from US sustainable funds in 2023, the worst year on record, according to Morningstar's data.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Now, they might not offer the radical paradigm shift that NVDA sparked last year. Frankly, it\u2019s difficult to make lightning strike twice. However, from a value proposition, other compelling semiconductor stocks might make more sense.\nFor example, Nvidia continues to rise higher on the burgeoning AI ecosystem, which its graphics processing units (GPUs) undergird. Since the start of the year, NVDA gained almost 19% of equity value. And in the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s up nearly 241%. However, in the trailing six months, shares have only moved up 18%. What does that tell us? Basically, like a fine-tuned athlete, incremental gains in performance are difficult to extract.\nOn the other hand, less-fancied chip stocks are like amateur athletes. That\u2019s not to cast aspersions but rather to point out that when you\u2019re less trained, you can extract massive performance gains. Put another way, it\u2019s the last few pounds that are the most difficult to lose.\nSo, Nvidia may have a \u201clast-mile problem\u201d while these semiconductor stocks might not \u2013 enjoy!\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nIf you want the closest thing to an Nvidia without buying NVDA stock, you\u2019ll need to look at Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). To be sure, the semiconductor specialist has printed a powerful performance in its own right. In the trailing one-year period, AMD gained 140% of equity value. It\u2019s awesome \u2013 just not 241% awesome. That could make Advanced Micro an intriguing idea for chip stocks to buy.\nFor one thing, the underlying generative AI market relevance has already been established. Plus, Advanced Micro has a knack for offering top-tier products at a discount to its rivals. Moving forward, a report by Bloomberg notes that the underlying sector could become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%.\nIn the spirit of full disclosure, AMD isn\u2019t the cheapest of semiconductor stocks. With a forward earnings multiple of almost 43X, investors must think carefully. Nevertheless, as stated above, the relevance has been proven. Thus, the most bullish analyst anticipates a target of $200.\nQualcomm (QCOM)\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\nAn enticing and relevant example of chip stocks to buy for the long haul, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) deserves consideration for its wide pertinence, particularly in the realm of connectivity. It\u2019s a leading provider of smartphone processors globally, with its Snapdragon series of chipsets powering the most high-end Android phones on the market. Analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy.\nPart of what makes QCOM one of the compelling semiconductor stocks to buy is the total addressable market. Per Grand View Research, the global 5G services market reached a valuation of $60.61 billion in 2022. By 2030, experts project that the segment may hit a value of over $2.2 trillion. If so, that would translate to a CAGR of 59.4%.\nAnother factor to consider is the company\u2019s value proposition relative to the competition. Specifically, QCOM trades at a forward earnings multiple of 15.23X, favorably below 72.39% of its peers. On average, analysts anticipate QCOM reaching $149.39 per share, with the high-side target possibly hitting $173.\nMarvell Technology (MRVL)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) develops and produces semiconductors and related technology. In particular, Marvell is a leader in high-performance networking and storage solutions. As a result, it\u2019s one of the chip stocks poised to benefit from burgeoning arenas such as 5G networks. Analysts unsurprisingly rate shares a consensus strong buy (just one voice short of unanimous).\nIn addition, Marvell also provides solutions for data centers and cloud computing. Just regarding the former category, the global underlying sector reached a valuation of $192.63 billion in 2021. Experts believe that by 2030, the segment could see a value of $554.4 billion, representing a double-digit CAGR. As for the latter, cloud computing could be worth $1.44 trillion by 2029.\nTo be fair, MRVL trades at a rather hot forward multiple of 32.48X. That said, the company enjoys a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 20.3%. Also, the most bullish analyst anticipates MRVL reaching $100 per share. Therefore, it\u2019s a worthy inclusion among semiconductor stocks to consider.\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\nEasily one of the most relevant chip stocks you can buy, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is a multinational contract manufacturing and design company. Per its public profile, TSMC as it\u2019s known is the world\u2019s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry. Simply stated, a foundry means that the business makes chips for other companies. Analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy.\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the global semiconductor foundry sector reached a value of $106.9 billion in 2022. Experts anticipate that by 2032, the ecosystem could be worth $231.5 billion. If so, that would come out to a CAGR of 8.1% from 2023. Even better for TSM, the underlying company dominates the space. In the third quarter of 2023, TSMC secured a 57.9% foundry revenue market share.\nEnticingly, TSM is much more attractive than many other semiconductor stocks. While printing a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 32.8%, it also offers a trailing-year earnings multiple of 18.47X. That\u2019s below 66.4% of its peers. The most bullish analyst sees shares hitting $125.\nAnalog Devices (ADI)\nSource: Shutterstock\nBased in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a multinational semiconductor firm specializing in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technologies. Per its public profile, it manufactures analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal-processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. As a quietly relevant idea among chip stocks, ADI deserves consideration for those seeking a long-term investment.\nBasically, Analog Devices can address multiple in-demand sectors. For example, the company is a key player in the industrial automation ecosystem. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global industrial control and automation sector reached a valuation of $147.9 billion in 2022. By 2027, the segment could hit $218.8 billion, implying a CAGR of 8.2%. Combine this with other covered industries and ADI makes a great play for semiconductor stocks.\nOn the financial side, Analog prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 17.3%, beating out 62.1% of its rivals. Unsurprisingly, the company has been consistently profitable over the past 10 years. Analysts rate shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $206.06 price target.\nSilicon Motion (SIMO)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\nAn American-Taiwanese enterprise involved in developing NAND flash controller integrated circuits (ICs) for solid-state storage devices, Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) is a major player in storage-related solutions. These include commercial, enterprise and industrial applications ranging from solid-state drives (SSDs), embedded MultiMediaCards (eMMCs), memory cards and USB flash drives. In the past 52 weeks, SIMO slipped more than 2%. Still, it could be an opportunity among underappreciated chip stocks.\nAccording to Straits Research, the global NAND flash memory market reached a valuation of $67 billion in 2021. Further, experts project that the segment could hit $117 billion by 2030. If so, that would translate to a CAGR of 6.39% from 2022. Notably, Silicon Motion currently carries a market capitalization of $2.12 billion. In other words, SIMO could soar by biting an appropriately sized chunk of the NAND market.\nPer the numbers, Silicon Motion is a growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate clocks in at 29.8%, above 83.2% of its rivals. Also, it\u2019s consistently profitable thanks to its core specialty. Analysts peg shares as a strong buy with an average target of $74.20.\nON Semiconductor (ON)\nSource: Shutterstock\nBased in Arizona, ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) represents a chip supplier. Per its public profile, ON\u2019s products include power and signal management, logic, discrete, and custom devices for multiple applications. These include automotive, communications, computing, consumer, industrial, lighting, and medical, among others. In the past 52 weeks, ON gained more than 15% of equity value. With strong relevancies on tap, it could be one of the top chip stocks to buy.\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the key areas that ON serves is the automotive sector. According to MarketsandMarkets, the auto semiconductor market reached a valuation of $42.9 billion in 2022. By 2027, this space could see a value of $70 billion. If so, this would translate to a CAGR of 10.1% from 2022. Combine this narrative with other compelling stories and ON could easily be one of the winning semiconductor stocks for the long haul.\nMoving to the financials, the company prints an above-average three-year EBITDA growth rate of 40%. It\u2019s also consistently profitable, making its forward earnings multiple of 14.37X quite credible. Finally, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with an $89.74 price target, implying almost 23% upside.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Nvidia, a key player in the AI revolution, had an exceptional 2023, with its stock value more than tripling. However, the majority of these gains occurred in the first half of the year. Since summer, Nvidia's stock has been consolidating within a sideways range, as indicated in the chart below. These prolonged consolidation phases within an established trend are not just typical but also beneficial. They facilitate stock rotation, involving accumulation and distribution, which helps prevent the trend from becoming overly stretched. The breakthrough to new trend highs occurred following Nvidia's announcement of groundbreaking desktop graphics processors tailored for AI purposes\u2014the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series. This unveiling triggered a substantial 6.4% surge, propelling the stock to close at record highs. Additionally, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company introduced other AI-related components and software. Nvidia (NVDA) Daily Candle ChartPast performance is not a reliable indicator of future results A Closer Look If we take a closer look at yesterday\u2019s breakout, there are several technical factors which indicate that the breakout has potential to continue: Backed By Volume: On the hourly candle chart (below) we can see that the breakout was backed by an increase in volume \u2013 signalling increased participation. Volume acts as a validation mechanism for breakouts. It provides confidence to traders that the breakout has a stronger chance of being a genuine shift in market sentiment, rather than a temporary blip. Higher Swing Lows: From November to December, Nvidia\u2019s share price had been carving out a series of higher swing lows as the market repeatedly tested resistance. This signals that institutional \u2018smart money\u2019 traders were accumulating shares prior to the breakout. Strong Close: Yesterday\u2019s price action saw the shares maintain the breakout into the closing bell. This signals strong demand and reduces the probability that the breakout will fail.

What to Expect in 2024?NVDAIllustration by TradingViewBlowout performance in 2023 puts Nvidia front and center in the AI race sweeping Wall Street. But the chipmaker\u2019s share-price growth has plateaued. Nvidia stock NVDA was on a tear for most of 2023, gaining a whopping 245% on the year, far outpacing every other big tech firm. The biggest factor driving the share price up was mad demand over AI chips following the launch of OpenAI\u2019s groundbreaking AI system ChatGPT.  Nvidia is looking to wrap up a banner year. Fiscal 2024, ending January, is expected to pump out $12.26 in earnings per share, a remarkable 257% increase from $3.43 in the previous fiscal year. Revenue, according to Nvidia\u2019s guidance, could land at $60 billion, an 118% jump from fiscal 2023 sales.  The chipmaker\u2019s share-price growth over the past year was concentrated in the first seven months.

The gains piled up on Tuesday and Wednesday as well, with the stock hitting a record intra-day high of $546.\nNvidia now has a market capitalization of $1.34 trillion, making it the fourth most valuable company in the S&P 500. And it's just $250 billion away from overtaking Amazon as measured by market capitalization.\n\n\nNvidia has been on a tear over the past year thanks to the generative AI revolution. The company sells the most in-demand chips that help enable AI technologies.\nFairlead Strategies' co-founder Katie Stockton thinks the gains in Nvidia stock could continue following the technical breakout above $500.\n\"Heavyweight Nvidia decisively cleared key resistance near $504 yesterday [Monday] in an unconfirmed breakout. The breakout resolved a four-month trading range higher in a bullish intermediate-term development, noting the weekly MACD has a new 'buy' signal. The breakout resumes Nvidia's long-term uptrend for an initial projection of ~$602,\" she told clients on Tuesday.\n\n\nThe $602 technical price objective from Stockton represents 11% upside from current levels.\u00a0\nWhile Nvidia stock has soared nearly 250% over the past year, its earnings multiple has plummeted, according to data from market veteran Ed Yardeni.\nHe highlighted in a note on Monday that Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio dropped from a record high of 84.3x on June 14 to just 26.4x today. While that represents a premium to the S&P 500's forward P/E multiple of about 20x, it is below Amazon's and Microsoft's multiples, and about the same as Apple's.\n\n\n\"The stock market may have started to discount our tech-driven, productivity-led Roaring 2020s scenario on November 30, 2022,\" Yardeni said, referring to the date when ChatGPT made its public debut.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Some, like the internet, change the world. Others, like 3D printing, not so much, at least not yet. Artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of hype, but it seems to have the backing of businesses and governments needed to make a tremendous impact over the coming years.  AI could create fantastic new companies over time, but a handful of AI stocks are already racing to the front. These four stocks below have already benefited from an AI boost and still trade at great prices. Pay attention to what their valuation is versus their expected growth. If you can divide the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio by the expected growth rate and get under 1.5, the stock could be a reasonable price for the growth you could get. This number, called the PEG ratio, is a Peter Lynch favorite. Growth on sale is an excellent recipe for total returns, so these could be the top-performing AI stocks by 2030. Here is what you need to know. 1. Palantir Technologies The U.S. government will be a massive factor in AI because the technology could become a competitive advantage against the world's other countries. Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is uniquely positioned as a software company with deep government ties. The U.S. government is over half of Palantir's revenue. Its software platforms are like an operating system for organizations, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze and use data.   PLTR EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts.  The company recently began posting a consistent generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, and analysts believe that earnings will continue snowballing, calling for an annual average of 72% over the long term. At just 55 times forward earnings, that leaves much room for investment returns over the rest of this decade. 2. Nvidia AI requires massive computing power to process vast amounts of data quickly. Chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stepped into the leadership role last year as companies frantically began spending to build these advanced computer systems. Nvidia's business (and stock) took off last year, and the company's now sitting on an estimated 90% of the AI chip market.   NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts.  Naturally, Nvidia could continue proliferating from AI's growth alone even if competitors nibble away at Nvidia's dominance. Despite the stock multiplying in value over the past year, the company's strong earnings-growth outlook makes the stock very reasonable on a forward basis. In other words, growth should carry shares higher over the coming years. 3. Meta Platforms What do you get when you combine one of the world's most dominating business models with AI upside? It might be social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta makes billions of dollars by advertising to its 3.96 billion monthly app users. Additionally, still-young CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has leaned heavily into building AI technology that enhances its advertising business and is a long-term wildcard.   Story Continues   META EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts. The company hit some speed bumps in 2022 but has since rallied over 300% from its lows. Remarkably, the company's 20% estimated long-term growth rate makes its current valuation arguably a bargain for long-term investors. Given its dominance in social media, investors can hold Meta as an AI stock with a higher floor than most.4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)While you shouldn't assume that Nvidia will fall out of the AI chip lead, there is a reasonable chance that AI will be so big that more than one chip company can win. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) might be the next-best bet after Nvidia. The company hasn't yet felt the growth spurt that Nvidia has, but it revealed an upcoming AI chip line in late 2023 that it says will outperform Nvidia's popular H100 series.  AMD EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts. AMD may have to prove itself by showing the sales to back up its claims, but analysts seem optimistic about the company's broader prospects. Long-term growth estimates are over 35%, which makes the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44 a solid price to pay for that growth. This stock may carry more risk, but the potential upside could surprise investors if AMD can make more progress in taking AI chip market share than Wall Street is giving it credit for.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

The chipmaker originally splashed onto the scene with its graphic processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and graphics markets. But today, these chips also power the training of AI models, and that's helped Nvidia's earnings and share price to explode.\nIn fact, Nvidia now generates most of its revenue from AI clients and holds about 80% of the AI chip market. That's great, but knowing how quickly things move in technology, it's fair to ask ourselves whether Nvidia can keep up this leadership or if eventually it will lose a significant chunk of market share. After all, it's not the only game in town. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), for example, has grown its share in the GPU market in recent times and even launched a powerful new chip late last year.\nConsidering all of this, how solid is Nvidia's moat or competitive advantage? Let's find out.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's gaming history\nFirst a little background on Nvidia. The company's GPUs took center stage in the gaming community years ago due to their ability to divide tasks among processors, therefore allowing many tasks to take place at the same time. This worked extremely well for the visuals in video games and other graphics applications, so textures, light, and shapes all could hit the screen simultaneously.\nThe rest of the world eventually discovered GPUs thanks to their ability to speed up workloads, and that's how they became the engines powering AI. Nvidia's CUDA parallel computing platform helps developers capture the power of GPUs and apply it across these applications, well beyond the GPU's original uses.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll find Nvidia GPUs everywhere from data centers to laptops and even in the world's biggest supercomputers. These chips are unbeatable for the \"deep learning\" of AI models, offering them the power they need for training and inference. And the company has partnered with other AI leaders such as Amazon and Microsoft, so if you use those cloud services, you may be relying on Nvidia GPUs for your deep learning projects.\n\nNvidia vs AMD\nOf course, Nvidia faces competition in this area, particularly from AMD, as mentioned above. This big rival recently released a new chip series -- MI300X -- and claimed it was even faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU. If a rival significantly beats Nvidia's speed, this eventually could hurt the AI giant's market share and earnings. But in this particular case, Nvidia followed up on the AMD news, showing its chip, when using the right software, actually is twice as fast as the MI300X.\nAnd Nvidia has quite a lead from an earnings perspective too, with its data-center business, which includes chips to power AI, bringing in more than $14 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter. That's compared to AMD's $1.6 billion in data-center revenue.\nSo, from a market share, earnings, and performance perspective, Nvidia remains ahead in the AI chip space.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's consider the solidity of Nvidia's moat, which is a combination of its brand strength and technological strength. Though rivals could gain some market share in the coming years, I don't expect them to unseat Nvidia -- for three reasons.\nFirst-to-market advantage\nFirst, when it comes to GPUs, Nvidia has the first-to-market advantage, progressively expanding its offerings and successfully serving AI clients. If customers are satisfied with performance, and they are advancing their AI projects, it's unlikely they'll switch to another chip along the way.\nSecond, a look at a pattern in the central processing unit (CPU) market reinforces the idea that chip customers tend to stick with the market leader: Though AMD has increased its market share in CPUs over the years, it hasn't unseated Intel.\nFinally, Nvidia is far from resting on its laurels and instead, heavily invests in research and development to remain a leader in the AI space. The company increased R&D spending by 15% in the first nine months of last year to more than $6.2 billion. Considering Nvidia is highly profitable and revenue continues to soar, the company has what it takes financially to continue this investing momentum, which should lead to innovations that will keep it in the lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Net Income (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\nSo, yes, Nvidia faces competition, and these rivals surely will gain some market share, but this doesn't represent a huge threat for the AI giant. That's because the elements I've talked about are like deep waters keeping Nvidia's moat secure -- and difficult for rivals to cross -- well into the future. And that makes Nvidia a top AI stock to buy and hold onto for the long term even after last year's triple-digit gain.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Its share price rocketed 239% as investors positioned their portfolios around artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. But that fantastic performance was merely the most recent chapter in a longer growth story still being written.  The artificial intelligence (AI) market is expected to compound at 37% annually to approach $2 trillion by 2030, and Nvidia has positioned itself as a major beneficiary. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently told Business Insider that \"Nvidia is clearly going to be the biggest winner\" as that opportunity unfolds. Here's what investors should know. Here's how much Nvidia stock returned in each year since 2000 Nvidia stock gained over 31,400% over the last 24 years, compounding at 27.4% annually. To put that in context, $10,000 invested in the company in January 2000 would be worth about $3.1 million today. The chart below shows how much Nvidia's stock price increased (or decreased) in each year between 2000 and 2023.   Data source: Macrotrends, YCharts. Shown above is the annual return in Nvidia stock in each year between 2000 and 2023. Returns have been rounded to the nearest whole percentage point.   In 1999, Nvidia invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), bringing revolutionary visual effects to the gaming and multimedia markets. Those chips have become the gold standard in video game graphics and professional visualization. Nvidia holds more than 95% of the market in workstation graphics processors, and its chips were used to create every film that received an Academy Award nomination for best visual effects in the last 15 years. In 2006, Nvidia introduced its CUDA programming model. That innovation turned its GPUs into general purpose processors and paved the way for data center dominance. Nvidia GPUs are now the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like AI, data science, and scientific computing. In fact, the company holds about 95% market share in data center GPUs, and it holds 80% to 95% market share in AI chips.  Nvidia has further expanded its data center footprint by branching into adjacent hardware markets. It acquired high-performance networking company Mellanox in 2019, and it took aim at Intel and Advanced Micro Devices by launching a central processing unit (CPU) in 2023. The InfiniBand and Spectrum-X networking platforms and Grace CPUs are purpose-built for AI, and the company has already seen strong traction across those product lines. Specifically, networking is a $10 billion business, and CPUs are on pace to be a multibillion-dollar business in the near future, according to management. In 2021, Nvidia branched into subscription software with AI Enterprise, a platform that simplifies the development and deployment of AI applications across various disciplines. The software suite includes frameworks that streamline the creation of recommender systems for retail, intelligent avatars for customer service, and computer vision systems for autonomous machines in logistics and manufacturing.   Story Continues In 2023, the company delved into cloud services with Omniverse Cloud and DGX Cloud. Those platforms bring together supercomputing infrastructure, software, and pretrained machine learning models to support the development of 3D, AI, and robotics applications. Additionally, Nvidia recently announced foundry services that lean on DGX Cloud to help businesses customize large language models and build generative AI applications for text, images, videos, and drug discovery.In short, Nvidia has evolved from a GPU company into a full-stack data center computing company focused on graphics and AI. Its ability to provide solutions across infrastructure, software, and services further cements its leadership in those markets. To quote Zino, \"We believe ... [Nvidia's] full-stack AI/software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"Nvidia reported phenomenal financial results in the third quarterNvidia looked untouchable in the third quarter. Revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion on record sales in the data center segment, as well as strong momentum in gaming and professional visualization. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased 588% to $10 billion as high-margin software and services accounted for more of total revenue.The graphic below shows revenue across each business segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023).  Chart by Author. Shown above is the third-quarter revenue from Nvidia's four primary business segments. Revenue from the OEM & Other segment has been excluded because it represents less than one percent of total revenue.  Nvidia stock trades at a reasonable priceAs mentioned, AI spending across hardware, software, and services is forecast to increase at 37% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, the graphics processor market is expected to expand at roughly 28% annually during the same period. Nvidia is exceptionally well positioned to monetize both tailwinds, perhaps more so than any other company.In any case, Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales at 40% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 23.6 times sales appear quite reasonable. Patient investors with a five-year time horizon should feel comfortable buying a small position in Nvidia stock today.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The chipmaker traditionally known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have powered industries like gaming, crypto, and autonomous vehicles, has emerged as the clear leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips as its technology is also well suited to running the kind of deep learning models that programs like ChatGPT require.\nAs a result, Nvidia reported skyrocketing growth throughout the year, which, not surprisingly, drove the stock to towering gains. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished 2023 up 239%. As you can see from the chart below, most of those gains came in the first half of the year as the fervor over generative AI reached a fever pitch.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nHow Nvidia dazzled the stock market in 2023\nAs you can see from the chart, Nvidia stock steadily moved higher over the first quarter of the year as hype around ChatGPT and new generative AI technologies pushed a wave of tech stocks associated with AI higher.\nHowever, it wasn't until Nvidia's first-quarter earnings report in May that investors saw the surge in demand for its chips that had been set off by the launch of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia beat estimates in the first-quarter report, and blew investors away with its guidance, calling for $11 billion in revenue for the second quarter, which compared to the analyst consensus of $7.2 billion. The stock jumped 24% on May 25 on the report, and Nvidia did not disappoint in its next two earnings reports as its momentum only increased.\nIn its second quarter, revenue jumped 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, well ahead of the company's guidance, and net income soared more than 800% to $6.2 billion. \nIn the third quarter, its results were even more impressive as revenue tripled to $18.1 billion and net income reached $9.2 billion, up more than 13 times from the year before. \n\nWhat's next for Nvidia\nNvidia delighted investors with a number of new product and partnership announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show, and the stock has continued to gain even as other big tech and AI stocks have stalled.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's still a shortage for Nvidia's products and the company seems to have a wide technological lead over the competition. That should bode well for the stock, and shares look surprisingly affordable at a forward P/E of 27. The AI stock looks like a good bet to keep moving higher in 2024.\n\n\n\nJeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband reportedly bet millions on technology giant Nvidia (NVDA) late last year \u2014 despite immense scrutiny and backlash against congressional stock trading. The former house speaker bought Nvidia call options on Nov. 22 \u2014 her largest stock purchase in the last three years, according to stock trading news site Unusual Whales.

Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Take control of your finances in 2024: 5 money moves to start the new year off strong The US dollar has lost 87% of its purchasing power since 1971 \u2014 invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund   According to a disclosure form obtained by Unusual Whales and congresstrading.com, Pelosi purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $120 and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024 \u2014 with a potential capital gian of up to $5 million. \u201cPelosi bet millions on NVDA in November using call options. Using a deceptive tactic, she purposely disclosed this on the Friday before Christmas weekend to avoid media coverage,\u201d ongresstrading.com revealed on X, formerly Twitter. Pelosi\u2019s trades under scrutiny Pelosi, aged 83, and her husband, Paul, have re-entered the Nvidia game after selling their shares and call options in the AI software company at a total loss of over $700,000 in 2022. Their ill-timed departures occurred around the same time that the CHIPS and Science Act was passed into law, which Pelosi publicly supported. This law majorly benefited domestic chipmakers like Nvidia. Since selling their 25,000 shares, the Nvidia stock price has surged by almost 200%, according to the New York Post, which means the value of the Pelosis\u2019 original stake would have been worth in excess of $12.2 million today.  However, the duo has certainly made up for it in other transactions. They have netted millions of dollars in profit from buying call options on other blue-chip stocks such as Salesforce (CRM), Roblox (RBLX), and Disney (DIS). They have also made some well-timed sales. Notably, Paul Pelosi, 83, sold 30,000 shares of Google (GOOGL) stock in December 2022, just one month before the tech giant was sued over alleged antitrust violations. That transaction had lawmakers crying foul about insider trading. Specifically, it riled up Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who responded by introducing the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act in January 2023. When announcing the PELOSI Act, he said: \u201cWhile Wall Street and Big Tech work hand-in-hand with elected officials to enrich each other, hard-working Americans pay the price. The solution is clear: we must immediately and permanently ban all members of Congress from trading stocks.\u201d   Story Continues Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howEfforts to ban lawmakers' stock tradingHawley is by no means alone in trying to tackle this problem. The PELOSI Act followed fast in the footsteps of the Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust in Congress Act, or TRUST Act, introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Chip Roy of Texas on Jan 12, 2023.Both bills failed to move the needle in Congress \u2014 but they set the scene for a busy year of politicians trying to stifle corruption in Washington.In July, Hawley took another stab at the problem by co-introducing the bipartisan Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act alongside Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) That proposed law builds on the decade-old Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) law, which is supposed to combat insider trading by members of Congress and their staff.What to read nextThis Pennsylvania trio bought a $100K abandoned school and turned it into a 31-unit apartment building \u2014 how to invest in real estate without all the heavy lifting Worried about the economy?

With many companies ramping up their purchases of its class-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia's revenue shot through the roof. That boom is far from over, and the stock has already responded to the sales jump incredibly.\nIn 2023, the stock rose nearly 240%. That's a magnificent return, but what would have happened if you had held Nvidia for slightly longer than that -- say, starting in 2020? Well, the results and lessons learned might surprise you.\nA $10,000 investment has seen a few ups and downs\nThe first thing to understand about Nvidia's business is that it is cyclical. Its GPUs are used to run arduous workloads like gaming graphics, engineering simulations, drug discovery, cryptocurrency mining, and creating AI models. The business booms when consumers are flush with cash and companies are willing to invest in their computing capabilities.\n\nBefore the AI gold rush, the previous two Nvidia booms were spurred by cryptocurrency miners. Because GPUs are used to mine digital currencies, many people bought thousands of the company's chips to perform the task. This caused a sales spike in 2018 and 2021.\nBut the problem with booms is that they are usually followed by a bust, which is exactly what happened with Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the cryptocurrency market collapsed in 2019 and 2022, demand for GPUs evaporated, causing the company to post multiple consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Before the AI competition took off, Nvidia was still dealing with declining GPU sales, but the shot in the arm provided by AI quickly reversed its fortunes.\nSo, if you look at how much money you would have made by investing $10,000 in Nvidia at the start of 2020, you would have experienced quite the roller coaster ride.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nIn late 2021 (at the height of the market for many tech stocks and cryptocurrencies), Nvidia had turned a $10,000 investment into more than $50,000. But that figure was down to about $20,000 in just a few short months. In 2023, AI lifted the stock significantly, turning that original $10,000 into an incredible $82,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's historical cyclicality is a factor investors must consider\nThere are two important lessons about Nvidia's stock that this hypothetical exercise provides:\n\nIt is a cyclical company. Most of its sales aren't subscription-based, so its incredible revenue right now might not seem so incredible by next year. As a result, investors need to consider how much demand the AI market can support. Once this limit is reached, expect sales to fall, which should cause the stock to collapse.\nYou must buy and hold companies for the long term. Many investors likely sold Nvidia stock in 2022 when it fell apart. While they were still up from their 2020 investment price, it wasn't nearly as much as if they had just held shares through the difficult times.\n\nSo what should investors do with Nvidia's stock now? In my opinion, if you don't own any Nvidia stock now, it might not be a great time to establish a position due to its high valuation.\nHowever, this could be a terrible decision if the market for Nvidia's GPUs is much larger than I expect. So, taking a smaller position (no more than 1% of your portfolio) might not be a bad idea.\nIf you've held on to Nvidia's stock for this long, it's likely a substantial part of your portfolio due to its recent performance. Taking some gains here is wise, as the shares are highly valued and still cyclical (as many investors might be forgetting).\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's stock has gone through a few boom-and-bust cycles; I don't know when the next bust is coming, but I think it's prudent to prepare should it come soon.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool   January 17, 2024 6 min read        62   In This Article:  NVDA            Semiconductor designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has made many millionaires in recent years. Its stock has more than tripled in the last year alone. Among stocks with a market cap of at least $50 billion today, Nvidia has outperformed absolutely everybody over the past three, five, and 10 years. It's hard to beat this wealth-building machine these days. So what's next? Let's say I scrape together a robust $20,000 Nvidia position today -- can I expect to make a million dollars on that investment? The short answer is yes, but it'll take a while and the lofty target result isn't guaranteed. Nvidia in the rearview mirror Looking back, Nvidia's stock chart from the past eight years is nothing short of extraordinary. Starting from a respectable $23 billion market cap in 2016, the company's strategy has shifted along with the market opportunity. Nvidia's expertise in high-performance graphics cards for gaming and professional graphics turned into a crypto bonanza when enthusiasts found the same cards to be excellent for mining Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) tokens. Just as Ethereum switched to a different technology with no need for miners, OpenAI came along with its ChatGPT tool, unveiling a new dawn in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Based on the same high-end graphics platforms as the gaming and crypto surges, Nvidia's AI accelerator processors powered the back-end creation of ChatGPT's AI engine. Now, lots of companies with AI-powered ambitions are buying hundreds or even thousands of extremely pricey accelerator chips and Nvidia is the first supplier that comes to mind at this point. It shows in Nvidia's spectacular financial results and the stock chart that follows:   NVDA data by YCharts  The chart above shows the return of a $20,000 investment started on May 16, 2016, resulting in a $1.0 million value nearly 8 years later. That's an average annual return of 67.4%. The road ahead At the end of that market-crushing chart, Nvidia is worth $1.4 trillion. The stock rose to this height the hard way, delivering top-notch products attuned to the right market opportunities at the right times. The end result is a legendary price gain with record-high investor returns. Sorting the total stock market's 10-year gains, I don't even need to limit the field with a large market-cap requirement to weed out short-lived meme stocks and other gadflies. Nvidia simply offered the strongest decade-long returns of any stock tracked by the screeners at my disposal.  But things are different now. It may be difficult to grow a $23 billion market cap 50-fold, but even tougher when you start with a $1.3 trillion stock-value footprint. Even if Nvidia continues to dominate the AI market, and that trend delivers on the most striking predictions for years to come, it's unrealistic to assume an average annual return of 67% for another eight-year run.   Story Continues By the end of that rainbow, Nvidia would be worth $67.6 trillion. That's more than double the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, estimated at $26.9 billion in 2023. I'm sorry, but that's going to take a while.Balancing business growth and shareholder rewardsNvidia's past performance has set a high bar and it's important to manage your expectations for the next phase of its AI business. The exceptional gains of recent years are not likely to continue for another 8-year span. That would require not only continued success in the booming AI sector for nearly a full decade, but also sustained hypergrowth in the market itself and unshaken investor confidence in Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios. The stock trades at 72 times earnings and 30 times sales today. These overheated ratios should cool down over time, raising the needed financial support for that $67 trillion market cap in the process.Of course, Nvidia could lower the bar with some accounting tricks. The company can return cash to shareholders by means of generous share buybacks and dividends.Other companies have pursued this strategy before. For example, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has seen its share price fall by 2% over the last 10 years while its market cap shrunk by 14%. At the same time, Big Blue bought back 12% of its issued shares and delivered robust dividend payouts. All in all, IBM investors pocketed a respectable total return of 50% over the same period.Nvidia could attempt a larger-scale version of this, boosting the returns by sharing cash profits with the company's investors. Of course, this cash-sharing idea takes away from the company's freedom to invest in future growth-boosting business plans, so there's a fine line between generosity and growth-blunting missteps.And of course, anything is possible over a long enough time span. America's GDP stopped at $1.5 trillion in 1973, comparable to Nvidia's market value today. Suggesting that any single company could deserve a trillion-dollar market cap would have sounded ridiculous 50 years ago, but here we stand with 6 stocks in the trillion-dollar club. A few decades from now, that $67 trillion target might not look so silly anymore.The real question is, will Nvidia still be around in 2064 or 2074, and will it dominate its chosen markets for that long? I don't think so, but anything is possible.A pragmatic approach to investing in NvidiaSo yes, Nvidia just might be able to grow that a $20,000 investment into a cool million, but it's a long road to that ambitious target and many things can go wrong along the way. Remember, this stock delivered the richest shareholder returns of any company over the last decade, and even that stellar run barely exceeded the 50-fold gain it takes to meet that goal.That being said, I'm not closing out my own Nvidia position anytime soon, though I might take advantage of its recent moonshot by diversifying some of the gains into other investment ideas. I'm still looking at a proven AI giant with a bright future, and its valuation has calmed down a bit in recent weeks. Buying Nvidia stock today makes perfect sense if you can stomach it trading at nosebleed-inducing prices. The next wave of processor orders for AI systems could make the last surge look forgettable by comparison.So feel free to invest in Nvidia today. Just don't expect the incredible returns of the last 8 years to continue for another multi-year span. To make me a happy Nvidia investor, all the company needs to do is deliver stock price gains comparable to or exceeding the stock market as a whole.At an annual clip of 15%, a 50-fold return would materialize after 28 years.

REUTERS\nLike AI itself, Nvidia is an \u201covernight success story\u201d many decades in the making.\u00a0\nFormed in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang and co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, NVIDIA initially aimed to bring 3D technology to gaming and media. \nIn 1999 the company released the first-ever GPU (graphics processor unit), a powerful chip that could render 3D graphics in real time. \nThe first Xbox gaming console and the PlayStation 3 ran on NVIDIA\u2019s formidable chip technology.\u00a0\n\n\n8\n\nCo-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA initially aimed to bring 3D technology to gaming and media. AP\nLater, Nvidia chips became the backbone of blockchain networks like Ethereum, which, until recently, required the large computing power of GPUs to secure transactions and store data. \nNvidia was also a pioneer in building a software toolkit called CUDA that made it easier for programmers to apply their chips to all manner of tasks, kind of like equipping a Formula 1 race car with an automatic transmission and cruise control.\nCompared to traditional chips like CPUs \u2014 the workhorses that have powered computers from the mainframes of the 1950s to today\u2019s PCs and smartphones \u2014 GPUs are generally superior in training AI models and powering responses to our endless AI prompts. \n \n\n\n\t\t\tSee Also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAI chip giant Nvidia\u2019s stock soars on profit surge, making CEO $4.2B richer overnight\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because the so-called \u201cmachine learning algorithms\u201d behind popular AI models require computers to perform multiple tasks at once. \nGPUs, unlike CPUs, can break down AI tasks into smaller chunks and run them concurrently, dramatically improving speed and performance.\nThink of a CPU as a decathlete who competes in 10 different track and field events. \nLike a CPU, a decathlete can do multiple tasks very well, but only in sequence; you can\u2019t take your shot put into the swimming pool. \nA GPU, on the other hand, is more like a soccer team. \nEach player may not be as versatile as the decathlete \u2014 and they may not even be as fast or strong. \nBut they work together to achieve something the decathlete never could: operating as a team to advance the ball up the field and score.\nToday, GPUs are the dominant chip in AI \u2014\u00a0and Nvidia is the dominant player. \nAccording to Mercury Research, in Q3 of 2023, NVIDIA sold $11.1 billion in chips, cards, and related hardware, representing a 99.7% share of GPU systems in data centers worldwide.\n\n\n8\n\nEngineer Curtis Priem co-founded Nvidia. AP\nSo was Nvidia just lucky to have developed the best-in-class GPU at the exact moment they\u2019re needed to power the AI revolution? \nCEO Jensen Huang said in a March 2023 interview: \u201cWe had the good wisdom to go put the whole company behind it,\u201d a decade ago. The reality is somewhere in between. Luck, after all, is the combination of preparation and good timing.\nIn 2012 when Nvidia released its first AI product, it could hardly have anticipated that in a decade, AI was going to become the phenomenon it has today. \nOn the other hand, the company could never have seized this moment if it hadn\u2019t started investing in AI long before its peers. \n\n\n8\n\nChris A. Malachowsky is also a Nvidia co-founder NVIDIA\nOther chip makers like Intel could have prepared better for the AI age but simply chose not to.\nFrom 3D graphics to PC gaming to blockchains to AI, NVIDIA has often found itself at the forefront of the biggest paradigm shifts in technology. \u00a0 And this has translated into a historic windfall for shareholders. \nThe day Chat GPT launched in November 2022, NVIDIA was a $400 billion company \u2014 enormous even then, thanks in large part to the success of its gaming and graphics business.\u00a0\nBut since then, its market value has swelled by a staggering trillion dollars to more than $1.4 trillion, the equivalent of about four Bank of Americas, in market capitalization in just over a year.\nMuch of this is driven by lofty expectations that the company will continue to grow at a breakneck speed. \n\n\n8\n\nThe PlayStation 3 ran on NVIDIA\u2019s formidable chip technology.\u00a0 UPI\nWall Street analysts estimate the company will more than double revenue between 2023 and 2024, and nearly double again in 2025. \nGrowth of that magnitude for such a large company is nearly unheard of.\nThis raises several questions. \nFor one, is such growth actually achievable? \nAnd if so, won\u2019t other chip makers race to build Nvidia killers? \nIt would be a mistake to think Nvidia has been alone in investing in AI. \nIndeed, more than a dozen other companies crowd the market with their own offerings, including legacy chipmakers like AMD, Intel, and IBM, and lesser-known upstarts such as Graphcore and Groq.\n\n\n8\n\nCompared to traditional chips, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are generally superior in training AI models and powering responses to our endless AI prompts.  uflypro \u2013 stock.adobe.com\nFurthermore, big tech platforms, which all have huge computing needs, have been developing their own chips. \nFor example, the Google Cloud TPU (tensor processing unit) was launched in 2015 and was updated in 2021. \nToday, it powers Google\u2019s Bard chatbot and the company\u2019s many other AI applications.\u00a0 \nAmazon, the global leader in cloud computing \u2014 those data centers that power the computing needs of companies from Pfizer to McDonald\u2019s \u2014 has its AI-focused chips known as Tranium/Inferentia, launched in 2020. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNever Miss a Story\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks for signing up!\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEnter your email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease provide a valid email address.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBy clicking above you agree to the \t\t\t\t\tTerms of Use\n\t\t\t\t\t and \t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNever miss a story.\t\t\t\t\n\n\nCheck out more newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese technology conglomerate Alibaba announced its own AI chip, the Hanguang 800, back in 2019. \nAs industry analyst Ben Bajarin wrote on X shortly after Microsoft announced its own AI hardware offering, \u201cThose serious about platforms need to be serious about silicon.\u201d\nNvidia is swimming in a pond with many other powerful companies full of smart people and seemingly endless resources, and when you are at 100% market share (or 99.7%, in the case of Nvidia\u2019s share of GPUs in data centers) there\u2019s nowhere to go but down. \nStill, it would be a mistake to simply assume that legacy players or Nvidia\u2019s customers can throw enough money to compete with Nvidia without a fight.\nFurthermore, if AI prognosticators are correct, AI chips will power an entirely new industrial revolution, which will allow Nvidia to succeed even as competition grows. \nHenry Ford sold a lot more cars in 1929 than in 1919 when half the automobiles on the road were Model Ts \u2014 even though competitors had consolidated and copied his methods, despite his market share steadily declining. \nHis share of the market went down but total sales went up, as did the value of the company. \nThe same could happen for Nvidia. After all, they don\u2019t just make money from AI; last year, the company generated about $12 billion from non-AI products.\n\n\n8\n\nFor example, the Google Cloud TPU (tensor processing unit) was launched in 2015 and was updated in 2021. Levine-Roberts/Sipa USA\nStill, Nvidia\u2019s long-term success is far from guaranteed. \nFairchild Semiconductor was once the standard-bearer for American innovation. \nIt supplied many of the chips for the Apollo Lunar guidance system. \nIts success helped transform a quiet valley of California apple orchards into Silicon Valley, and the heart of the global tech industry.\u00a0\n\n\n\nToday, Fairchild no longer exists. For a period in the 1960s and \u201970s, Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) was the biggest computer company in the world with so-called \u201cminicomputers,\u201d but it too got swept away, this time with the rise of the personal computer or PC. \n\n\n8\n\nChinese technology conglomerate Alibaba announced its own AI chip, the Hanguang 800, back in 2019.  AFP via Getty Images\nIn 2007, Nokia sold one in every two phones globally. \nThat same year, the iPhone came out. Today Nokia accounts for just 3% of all sales.\u00a0 \n\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about Blackberry \u2014 remember them? \nIn technology, the only constant is change.

But what is next for this legendary company?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-1.69%)\u00a0-$2.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.50\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther tech leaders have transitioned from hardware to include software and services.\n\nNvidia's (NVDA -1.69%) growth thesis hinges on generative artificial intelligence (AI) -- a tech megatrend sending demand for its advanced hardware through the roof. And according to analyst projections, this booming market has plenty of room left to run. That said, the company could find even more synergistic growth drivers over the long term. Let's dig deeper into what the next 10 years could hold. \nTurning the GPU into a trillion-dollar growth engine\nWhen Nvidia was founded in 1993, it would have been hard to imagine that the hardware it was pioneering, the graphics processing unit (GPU), would have such a transformative effect on the technology landscape. \n\nOriginally designed to render video-game visuals, GPUs work through parallel processing, which involves computing multiple tasks simultaneously. This functionality made them extremely useful for new uses like cryptocurrency mining and training the large language models (LLM) behind generative AI applications.\n For Nvidia, these trends have transformed its operations. As of the third quarter, data center chip sales (such as the AI-capable H100) make up 80% of revenue, while its previously core gaming business has fallen to just under 16%. \nWith industry experts expecting the market for AI chips to rise to $400 billion by 2027, Nvidia has plenty of room for near-term growth by selling its hardware. But the company will almost certainly face rising competition, which could eventually erode its market share and margins. To keep delivering market-beating growth, Nvidia may have to reinvent itself once again -- and management looks capable of pulling it off. \n\n\n\n\n\nCould Nvidia become a software company?\nThe tech industry has several hardware companies that transitioned to more software-dependent business models to protect their economic moats and stabilize revenue streams. One of the best examples is Apple, which used sales of its industry-leading iPhones to drive iOS and app store adoption. According to analysts at Melius Research, Nvidia could be on the cusp of a similar move as it pivots to software and services. \nNvidia has long relied on custom software to help data center clients make the most of their GPU-based systems. But over time, this business could become a core growth driver in its own right. \n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has launched a new AI supercomputer called DGX Cloud, which uses cutting-edge hardware to allow enterprise clients to build and deploy customized AI models without having to create their own data center infrastructure. Naturally, this move will bring the chipmaker into competition with traditional cloud service providers like Amazon AWS and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, Nvidia's technical lead designing the GPUs that run these platforms gives it a competitive edge to rapidly scale this new growth driver. \nWhere will Nvidia be in the next 10 years?\nWith a market cap around $1.50 trillion, Nvidia is already the sixth most valuable company in the world. And it probably isn't a coincidence that three of the companies above it (Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon) attained their position by transitioning away from only physical products into software. Over the next 10 years, Nvidia has significant growth potential, and I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually overtakes some of its large rivals. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile shares have already risen 211% over the last 12 months, the company still boasts a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30, which is in line with the NASDAQ 100 average. That means it isn't too late for investors to bet on Nvidia's long-term success. \n \n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But they can be hard to diagnose using solely 2D medical imaging.\nHelping to treat these disorders, the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s (BCH\u2019s) Adolescent and Young Adult Hip Preservation Program is the U.S.\u2019s first to deploy a fully automated AI tool across its clinic.\nCalled VirtualHip, the tool can create a 3D model of a hip from routine medical images, assess anatomy and movement-related issues, and provide clinicians with diagnostic and treatment guidance. It was built at an orthopedic research lab at BCH, Harvard Medical School\u2019s primary pediatric hospital, using the NVIDIA DGX platform.\nA team of 10 researchers are working on the project, funded in part by an NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant, including engineers, computer scientists, orthopedic surgeons, radiologists and software developers.\n\u201cUsing AI, clinicians can get more value out of the clinical data they routinely collect,\u201d said Dr. Ata Kiapour, the lab\u2019s principal investigator, director of the musculoskeletal informatics group at BCH and assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThis tool can augment their performance to make better choices in diagnosis and treatment, and free their time to focus on giving patients the best care.\u201d\nGetting Straight to the Joint\nOften, clinicians must determine a treatment plan \u2014 with levels of intervention ranging from physical therapy to total hip replacement \u2014 based on just a 2D image, such as an X-ray, CT scan or MRI. Automatically creating 3D models from these images, and using them to conduct comprehensive joint assessments, can help improve the accuracy of diagnosis to inform treatment planning.\n\u201cI started a postdoc with an orthopedic surgeon at BCH in 2013, when I saw how an engineer or scientist could help with patient treatment,\u201d said Dr. Kiapour, who\u2019s also trained as a biomedical engineer. \u201cOver the years, I saw that hospitals have a ton of data, but efficient data processing for clinical use was a huge, unmet need.\u201d\nVirtualHip, fully integrated with BCH\u2019s hip clinic and radiology database, helps to fill this gap.\nClinicians can log in to the software tool through a web-based portal, view and interact with 3D simulations of 2D medical images, submit analysis requests and see results within an hour \u2014 4x quicker on average than receiving a radiology report after imaging.\nThe tool, which produces 3D models with a margin of error less than one millimeter, can assess morphological abnormalities and identify issues related to hip motion, such as pain from hip bones rubbing against each other.\nVirtualHip was developed using a database with tens of millions of clinical notes and imaging data from patients seen at BCH over the past two decades. Using natural language processing models and computer vision algorithms, Dr. Kiapour\u2019s team processed this data, training the tool to analyze normal versus pathologic hip development and identify factors influencing the injury risk and treatment outcomes.\nThis will enable VirtualHip to offer patient-specific risk assessment and treatment planning by comparing current patients to previously treated ones with similar demographic backgrounds.\n\u201cThe hardware support that we got from NVIDIA made all of this possible,\u201d Dr. Kiapour said. \u201cDGX enabled advanced computations on more than 20 years\u2019 worth of historical data for our fine-tuned clinical AI model.\u201d\nClearer Explanations, Better Outcomes for Patients\nIn addition to assisting doctors in diagnosis and treatment planning, VirtualHip helps patients better understand their condition.\n\u201cWhen patients look at an X-ray, it doesn\u2019t look like a real hip \u2014 but with a 3D model that can be rotated, the doctor can show exactly where the joints are impinging or unstable,\u201d Dr. Kiapour said. \u201cThis lets the patient better understand their disorder, which usually makes them more compliant with whatever the doctor\u2019s prescribing.\u201d\nThis type of visualization is especially helpful for children and younger adults, Kiapour added.\nThe VirtualHip project is under continuous development, including work toward a patient-facing platform \u2014 using large language models and generative AI \u2014 for personalized analyses and treatment recommendations.\nThe BCH researchers plan to commercialize the product for use in other hospitals.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Education | Hardware | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She also covers the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy.Getty Images and Nvidia are deepening their AI partnership with the launch of Generative AI by iStock, a text-to-image platform specifically designed to make stock photos. Generative AI by iStock builds on Getty\u2019s first foray into AI image generation, Generative AI by Getty Images. The difference is that the image platform from iStock \u2014 a stock photo service owned by Getty \u2014 helps individual or single-seat users, unlike Getty Images, which is more of a multiuser enterprise solution.Trained using Nvidia\u2019s Picasso model, Generative AI by iStock only learned from Getty\u2019s creative library and iStock\u2019s stock photo library. It did not train on Getty\u2019s editorial image library to prevent it from generating trademarks or known personalities.\u201cIt allows users to be more efficient in their workflow and get more precise photos that they need\u201dGrant Farhall, Getty\u2019s chief product officer, tells The Verge that Generative AI by iStock targets small and medium businesses that need to find stock photos. \u201cIt allows users to be more efficient in their workflow and get more precise photos that they need, even something that they can\u2019t feasibly do with a camera,\u201d Farhall says. He used the example of someone looking for photos to illustrate climate change: they can prompt Generative AI by iStock to create a picture of penguins walking through a city street; instead of hiring a photographer and finding a flock of penguins, the AI can make that for them. Pricing will be $14.99 for 100 prompts, with each prompt generating four images.Another big difference between the Getty Images AI platform and the new iStock service revolves around legal indemnity. Unlike Generative AI by Getty Images, users will not have unlimited indemnification. The iStock platform will have a cap of $10,000 per asset, the same license it offers for its current library. As with Getty\u2019s first generative AI platform, contributors whose content was used to train the model can participate in a revenue sharing program.The iStock platform will also gain Inpainting and Outpainting features \u201csoon,\u201d Alexander Lazarou, a Getty spokesperson, told The Verge. Inpainting lets users mask an area of an image and then fill it in with a person or object from a text prompt. Outpainting expands a photo for different aspect ratios and fills those new regions.Correction January 8th, 12:43PM ET: Inpainting and outpainting are launching \u201csoon\u201d and will not be offered at launch, as this article initially stated. This story also said \u201ccustomers\u201d could participate in revenue sharing; it is photo contributors who participate in the program.See More: AICESNewsTechWebMore in this streamSee allHow the smart home is finally getting out of your phone and into your homeJennifer Pattison TuohyJan 22, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleLeia is building a 3D empire on the back of the worst phone we\u2019ve ever reviewedSean HollisterJan 19, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleI literally spoke with Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered video game NPCsSean HollisterJan 18, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsPixel 9A leaks in review videos before it\u2019s even announcedInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

In Las Vegas today, NVIDIA has unveiled the RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super GPUs, upgrades over its previous GPUs which aim to compete directly with AMD's cheaper high-end cards. And of course, NVIDIA can't help but tout how useful they'll be for on-device AI tasks.The RTX 4080 Super will sell for $999 when it arrives on January 31, while the RTX 4070 Ti Super will go for $799 on January 24th. AMD's Radeon 7900 XTX and XT launched at $999 and $899 a year ago \u2014 now NVIDIA has high-end options that don't involve shelling out $1,199 for the original RTX 4080 or an eye-watering $1,599 for the RTX 4090. For most buyers though, the mid-range $599 RTX 4070 Super may be the most compelling value when it lands on January 17.NVIDIA isn't divulging the full specs for these cards yet, but it says the RTX 4080 Super is twice as fast as the 3080 Ti in games while using DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Recent leaks suggest it'll have 10,240 CUDA cores, compared to 9,728 on the 4080, as well as faster clock speeds and beefier 23 Gbps memory.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe RTX 4070 Ti will get a very helpful 16GB memory upgrade (instead of 12GB on the previous card), which edges it closer to the 20GB VRAM the Radeon 7900 XT. The RTX 4070, meanwhile, will sport 20 percent more cores than the original model to be \"faster than an RTX 3090 at a fraction of the power,\" according to NVIDIA.We're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Like the RTX 4070, the RTX 4070 Super seems like a well-rounded gaming card choice. Its performance straddles highest quality 1080p through entry 4K gaming (and video editing), hitting all of 1440p in between.\u00a0     Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super Founders Edition    $600 at Best Buy    Like \n              Well-rounded performance for the money \n            \n              Only takes two slots\n             Don't like \n            Needs adapter or PCIe 5 power connectors\n           Making a recommendation, though, isn't quite so clear cut, since the RTX 4070 is staying on the market at nominally $50 less than the $600 Super. And while the Super performs better than the RTX 4070, everything we said about that card only 10 months ago still holds true -- including that it's the least expensive way to hit all the same targets.Aside from having 20% more cores and other computational components over the older card -- Tensor (AI) cores, RT cores streaming multiprocessors and so on -- little has changed from one generation to the next. The Founders Edition card I tested does have a slightly different finish; it's a bit more refractive, so it reflects the colors in my system a tad more. Given that the card doesn't have its own illumination, it's a perk. As before, the size and power requirements make it a good fit for midsize systems.     The RTX 4070 Super's finish is a little different than the RTX 4070. Lori Grunin/CNETThe RTX 4070 Ti, on the other hand, pulls ahead of the 4070 Super by a wider margin in 4K, and I expect the imminent 4070 Ti Super will further increase the gap between them, thanks to more everything. But the price gap is a lot more significant as well: At least $200 for the Ti over the Super.\u00a0And while you'll probably still be able to get the 4070 Ti for a while after the 4070 Ti Super ships next week, the variant of the GPU it's based on won't remain in production. If you can snap up the older one at $650 or less, it might make sense to get that card instead. Either is much better than the 4060 Ti, unless your system -- or your budget -- won't accommodate these.Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super Founders Edition   Memory 12GB GDDR6XMemory bandwidth (GBps) 504Memory clock (GHz) 10.5GPU clock (GHz, base/boost) 1.98/2.475Memory data rate/Interface 21Gbps/192 bitsRT cores 56CUDA cores 7,168Texture mapping units 224Streaming multiprocessors 56Tensor cores 224Process 4nmTGP/min PSU (watts) 220/650Max thermal (degrees) 194F/90CBus PCIe 4.0x16Size 2 slotsLaunch price $600Ship date Jan. 17, 2024    Though the 4070 Ti only needs a half-slot more width than the 4070/Super, that means it will block an entire second slot on many motherboards and it might not even fit in some smaller systems.\u00a0A lot also depends on what you're upgrading from. If it's an RTX 20-series card or older, almost anything in the 40-series line will seem faster. The Super pulls even with and occasionally passes the RTX 3080 Ti in 1440p, but the latter still performs better in 4K.\u00a0The closest AMD competitor is the Radeon RX 7800 XT. It's roughly $50 to $100 cheaper, and the performance is close if you want to save some money, plus it does perform better than the older RTX 4070. The caveat is, it lags quite a bit when you push the quality into ray tracing (still better than the 4060 Ti, though). The RTX 4070 Super also performs better on AMD's own FidelityFX Super Resolution than the RX 7800 XT (the RTX 4070 does a bit better as well).    Watch this: Everything Nvidia Just Revealed at Its Special CES Event\n        08:05  Like most of its siblings, if your system doesn't have the RTX 4070 Super requires you use either the 8-to-12-pin adapter that comes in the box or have PCIe 5 power connectors -- which you're unlikely to have unless you're upgrading your power supply in addition to the GPU. The 4070 Super isn't an unusually tall card, but with the adapter you have to be careful because you don't want to put undue pressure on it.In the coming weeks, the new RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4080 Super will start shipping, but I don't think they'll change the equation for the buying decision for 1440p. And while Nvidia usually rolls out a new architecture every two years, which would put the update in mid-to-late 2024, Nvidia's roadmap indicates that the company doesn't plan to unveil a new consumer/gaming architecture until 2025. And even then we'll probably see the top-of-the-line GPUs before the mainstream models that would replace this. So, for once, the only reason you might have to put off spending the money is to wait until big sales hit.

The technology has the potential to change the world, from improving safety in cars to bringing better drugs to market faster. AI also can make businesses more efficient, reducing costs and boosting earnings. Further, the AI market, expanding at a 21% compound annual growth rate, is set to reach more than $2 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights.\nSo, it's no surprise companies are investing in this hot technology -- and investors are hoping to get in on tomorrow's AI winners today. Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) and Amazon (AMZN -1.21%) recently have jumped into the AI spotlight, representing promising AI bets.\nNvidia makes the chips that power the technology, and Amazon uses AI to improve its operations and serve its customers. Their shares have climbed 218% and 62%, respectively, over the past year, but these market giants still have room to run. If you could pick up only one of these stocks today, which makes the better AI buy? Let's find out.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long powered the worlds of gaming and graphics. But these chips' ability to divide work among processors and carry out several tasks at the same time -- leading to tremendous speed -- soon launched them into a broad range of applications across industries. And one of those areas is AI.\nThanks to Nvidia's top chip performance, the company holds more than 80% of the AI chip market, according to analysts. Sure, rivals -- such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- exist. But Nvidia could stay ahead for several reasons. The company already is a leader, so satisfied customers may not be eager to switch to another chipmaker. We've seen this trend already among chip customers in the world of central processing units -- AMD has been unable to unseat Intel over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels and instead significantly invests in research and development (R&D) to stay ahead of the competition and continue innovating. In the most recent quarter (period ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's\u00a0 R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion. At the same time, the company's operating income outpaced operating expenses, and net income surged more than 1,000% year over year. So Nvidia can afford to continue investing to stay on top while delivering earnings growth.\nThe case for Amazon\nAmazon has invested in AI for its own use and to serve its customers. The e-commerce giant uses AI to streamline operations at its fulfillment centers and to design the most efficient delivery routes for packages, for example. These and other ways of using AI help Amazon reduce costs, therefore boosting earnings.\nThe e-commerce business also uses AI to help a customer find the right item by generating suggestions based on what they've bought in the past -- that could keep them coming back, again adding to Amazon's earnings potential.\nAI also is a big part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business. AWS offers various AI tools to clients so they don't have to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon has made itself present in every layer of AI. It's created chips, such as the Trainium, to train large language models (LLM). It's launched an LLM service, Amazon Bedrock, which features top foundation models that customers can customize for their own use. And AWS offers applications that run the LLMs such as Code Whisperer, a coding assistant for developers.\n\nIn Amazon's most recent earnings call, the company said generative AI remains a priority for AWS customers -- and AWS, as the cloud market leader, is in the perfect position to benefit.\nNvidia or Amazon?\nNvidia and Amazon both are set for success in the world of AI. Both companies also are profitable and have a solid track record of revenue growth.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if I had to choose the biggest AI winner, I would go for Nvidia. That's because the company dominates in a key area: It powers AI training, the \"deep learning\" that will give those AI models the ability to perform. Nvidia is an expert in GPUs, already is a step ahead of rivals, and has the financial situation to invest in R&D to maintain its leadership.\nToday, Nvidia trades for 50x forward earnings estimates, compared to 43x for Amazon, but the tech giant is worth the premium -- making it the top AI stock to buy right now.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It operates three data center campuses in India, with sites in Mumbai, Gujarat, and New Delhi. It plans to launch a facility at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, as well as Dhaka in Bangladesh.The company also has Edge locations in operation or development in Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Coimbatore, Indore, Nagpur, Jaipur, and Chandigarh.\"India's AI ambition is just not possible unless this infra comes to India,\" Gupta told Reuters.Last year, Nvidia announced a partnership with Reliance Jio for up to 2,000MW of AI data centers, and with Tata for an AI cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in The Compute, Storage & Networking Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Connect | Compute MENA - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nSupermicro's Tom Garvens becomes VP of advanced technology innovation at Google Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSoftware and hardware co-design: Optimizing the next generation of compute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nSunil Gupta\n\n\nYotta\n\n\nShakti Cloud\n\n\nYotta Data Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Nvidia executive Charlie Boyle tells CRN it will help channel partners \u2018make money faster, close business faster and, at the end, deliver more value to their customers.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia and Equinix said they have created a solution for businesses that want to quickly set up privately-owned supercomputers to build generative AI applications but lack the data center infrastructure and expertise to support the systems.\nAnnounced and launched on Wednesday, Equinix Private AI with Nvidia DGX is described by the two companies as a \u201cturnkey\u201d solution in which Equinix hosts and manages Nvidia DGX supercomputers purchased by businesses through Nvidia channel partners.\nIt\u2019s made for businesses that don\u2019t want their data in the public cloud for various reasons, including security, data sovereignty and auditability.\n[Related: Analysis: How Nvidia Showed Its True Power In 2023]\nCharlie Boyle, vice president of DGX systems at Nvidia, told CRN that the new solution will help partners in the Nvidia Partner Network \u201cmake money faster, close business faster and, at the end, deliver more value to their customers\u201d with DGX systems.\n\u201cIt makes it easier for them to sell and close business. And it makes it much easier for customers to consume and get up and running with AI, so this is going to be tremendous for all of our [Nvidia Partner Network] partners to accelerate business they've been working on for months and getting new business into their pipelines,\u201d he said.\nWith the fully managed service, the AI chip giant and data center powerhouse are hoping to solve problems they see many businesses facing: the significant amount of time it takes to plan and deploy a cluster of Nvidia DGX systems in a private data center, the lack of proper facilities to house such systems and a lack of personnel to manage them.\n\u201cCustomers want world-class AI capabilities, but most of them don't have the data center infrastructure, the expertise to build, manage and run those systems,\u201d Boyle said in a briefing.\nJon Lin, executive vice president and general manager of data center services at Equinix, said with his company\u2019s expertise in setting up and managing data centers, the new Private AI service can reduce the lead time for deploying DGX supercomputers \u201cfrom months to weeks or potentially days.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s Included With Equinix Private AI With Nvidia DGX\nEquinix\u2019s Private AI service is focused on Nvidia\u2019s DGX BasePod or SuperPod cluster configurations, the latter of which can range from 128 DGX H100 systems to as many as 2,048 systems, according to Nvidia documentation.\nThese DGX systems, each of which contain eight H100 GPUs, are connected together using Nvidia\u2019s ultra-low latency InfiniBand networking technology and managed by Equinix\u2019s managed services team of more than 800 employees across the globe.\nAnother critical component of the service is Nvidia AI Enterprise, the chip designer\u2019s software platform that includes all the building blocks they need to train and run AI models, from the NeMo framework for building large language models to the TensorRT-LLM library for optimizing such models.\nCustomers of the Private AI service can deploy their DGX clusters at nearly 250 of Equinix\u2019s International Business Exchange data centers worldwide, which includes locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, according to the data center company.\nDGX clusters housed within Equinix\u2019s data centers are connected to the outside world through a high-speed private network, and the company also provides high-bandwidth interconnections to cloud services and enterprise service providers.\nThe service comes with \u201centerprise-grade\u201d support and security, which includes assistance from Equinix staff on building and deploying custom AI models as well as access to Nvidia experts.\n\u201cWe're hearing tremendous amounts of energy and vigor from enterprises around wanting to do this but in a way that is not exposing them from either a cybersecurity perspective [or] from an intellectual property leakage perspective, etc. That private infrastructure then becomes a critical path to be able to deliver that,\u201d Lin said.\nPrivate AI Service Ensures Fast DGX Deployments, Not Delivery\nWhile Nvidia and Equinix are pitching the Private AI service as a fast and simple way for businesses to set up privately-owned AI infrastructure, it won\u2019t have an impact on lead times for delivery of DGX systems, according to Boyle.\n\u201cAll DGX SuperPOD customers get the same lead time from order to shipment of systems, regardless of where the deployment will occur,\u201d he told CRN.\nLong lead times for systems containing Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs, including DGX, have been a common complaint of OEMs and channel partners for the past year. This has been due to high demand for the processors, which have been popular with untold scores of AI developers, including big names like OpenAI, due to their high-performance capabilities.\nNvidia has been making efforts to increase production of H100s over the past several months to keep up with demand, but partners have told CRN that they still face long lead times.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just selling a backorder, a place in line,\u201d said an executive at one Nvidia partner, who asked to not be named so that he could speak frankly about business with the chip designer.\nAn executive at another Nvidia partner said lead times are improving for H100-based systems, but he is still quoting customers four to eight weeks for deliveries \u201cto be conservative.\u201d In some instances, systems are shipping faster, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With Clara, as well Deepcell\u2019s REM-I platform, the biotech plans to expand its morpholomics discovery work.\nDeepcell\u2019s REM-I platform, which the company launched last year, provides imaging of single cells and characterizes cell morphology to identify phenotype and function, using high-resolution brightfield images.\n\u201cAs we look to the future, we see many possibilities for incorporation multimodal and generative AI into our platform, and leverage our proprietary database of billions of cell images to train additional AI models,\u201d said Mahyar Salek, co-founder, president and chief technology officer at Deepcell, in a press release. \u201cOur relationship with Nvidia will help us accelerate such enhancements and bring these advancements to our customers, enabling new discoveries at unprecedented speed.\u201d\nDeepcell also released an update on its commercial milestones for its REM-I platform Monday, ahead of its planned presentation at JPM 2024 this week.\nMaddison Masaeli, co-founder and CEO of Deepcell, pointed to the company\u2019s strategic moves in the last year \u2014 which included the launch of REM-I as well as its Spark program \u2014 as indicators that it has momentum it plans to build upon.\nThis year, Deepcell plans to fully commercialize REM-I and recently installed the first REM-I instrument at an academic institution, where the company said it will be used for Alzheimer\u2019s research.\n\u201cWe are beyond proud of the growth and progress our company has experienced in such a short time,\u201d Masaeli stated.\nThe company also emphasized plans to further expand its expertise in cell morphology powered by AI, citing its growing partnership with Nvidia as part of those efforts.\n\u201cAs we look to the future, we are focused on continuing to drive the adoption of REM-I and setting a new standard for the use of AI in life sciences, including in partnership with other industry leaders such as Nvidia,\u201d said Marc Montserrat, chief business officer at Deepcell, in a statement.\nDeepcell is one of several partnerships Nvidia is building out as it grows in the healthcare space.\u00a0\nThe chip making giant also announced Monday that it would be partnering with both Amgen and Recursion Pharmaceuticals for use of its BioNeMo generative AI platform.\nAmgen will install Nvidia\u2019s data center platform Nvidia DGX SuperPOD at its deCODE genetics\u2019 headquarters in Reykjavik, Iceland. The pharma giant will use the system, dubbed Freyja, to build a \u201chuman diversity atlas\u201d for drug target and disease-specific biomarker discovery, Nvidia said in a statement.\nAt a press briefing last week, Kimberly Powell, VP and general manager of healthcare at Nvidia, said the company expects to continue investing its resources into the healthcare sector.\n\u201cWe partner strategically with companies that\u2026 have the same foundational belief that generative AI is an inflection point for this industry,\u201d Powell told\u00a0MM+M.\nThe announcements come shortly after Nvidia struck a\u00a0strategic AI collaboration with Genentech\u00a0in November 2023, with the goal of boosting drug discovery and development.\nFor a March 2024 article on Nvidia debuting two dozen genAI microservices to drive healthcare innovation, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics:\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nCell Biology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow pharma-backed websites are easing doctors\u2019 search woes through AI\n\n                                            Marc Iskowitz                                        \n\n                                            March 17, 2025                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing AI and influencers, Allegra needles rivals in Drowsy Prompts campaign\u00a0\n\n                                            Gordon Faylor                                        \n\n                                            March 11, 2025                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublicis buys identity firm Lotame as Arthur Sadoun updates AI pitch to clients\n\n                                            Gordon Faylor                                        \n\n                                            March 10, 2025                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nMM+M Transform: Keeping Pace With Transformation\n\n The world has changed in the past five years in how we market to HCPs and patients, payers and policymakers.

Houseal Lavigne was one of the first companies to lead with a visual approach\u2014instead of creating pages of text, the team wanted to provide 3D images and illustrations to better communicate their innovative designs, and stay ahead of the competition. For the past few years, Houseal Lavigne has paved the way in creating high-fidelity, immersive 3D environments, or digital twins for many customers around the world, providing interactive 3D reviewing experiences with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise and Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Customer\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseal Lavigne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Partner\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcGIS CityEngine Trimble Sketchup Adobe Substance 3D Collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Use Case\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation / Modeling / Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Products\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Scene Description (OpenUSD) NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise NVIDIA RTX 5000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise and OpenUSD, the team at Houseal Lavigne has experienced many benefits in their 3D workflows:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated innovative, immersive, and detailed 3D environments for client review in record time.\nReduced urban planning development processes from months to hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive 3D graphics are keeping Houseal Lavigne ahead of their competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Design & Planning\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    A New Approach For Urban Planning\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseal Lavigne\u2019s pioneering approach to Urban Planning recently won them Esri\u2019s \u200b\u200bSpecial Achievement in GIS Award and an Innovation Award for the use of ArcGIS in an innovative or disruptive way. With roughly 30 people at the company, Houseal Lavigne focuses on leveraging the newest technologies to create photoreal 3D environments to communicate their designs effectively with customers.\u00a0\nIn 2004, they were working mostly in 2D, with projects completed using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and some custom scripting to distort 2D images to give the appearance of 3D, says Devin Lavigne, principal and co-founder of Houseal Lavigne. Today, the team can use close to 20 applications over the course of a project, including Trimble\u2019s Sketchup, Adobe Substance 3D Collection, and Esri\u2019s ArcGIS CityEngine.  With NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise and OpenUSD, Houseal Lavigne can bring all these tools and designers together in one place to visualize a unified output.\u201d Using the ArcGIS CityEngine connector, we bring our city planning geometry and data into Omniverse, and incorporate building design data from Sketchup, and materials and textures from Adobe Substance Painter. We can then stream this combined output to our clients using USD Presenter for interactive review, delivered in high-fidelity, real-time, path-traced rendering,\u201d continues Lavigne.\u00a0\nTraditionally in urban planning, companies will look at the land and determine which areas are best suited for residential or commercial use. But Houseal Lavigne spearheaded the \"Place Type\" approach, which showcases the fluidity of the land and all the different land uses that are possible.\u00a0\nPlace types are tools for guiding development, and they provide a way to shape urban planning by focusing on context and character of a place\u2014the look and feel of locations, and their different forms and characteristics\u2014instead of relying on conventional land uses. By creating different place types in interactive 3D environments with Omniverse Enterprise, Houseal Lavigne can rapidly communicate and iterate on designs in real time.\u00a0 The interactivity of the Omniverse environment combined with real-time path-traced rendering means they can provide high-fidelity renders of buildings and layouts with colleagues and clients, instantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseal Lavigne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Reviews & Walkthroughs\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Accelerating Urban Development While Increasing Client Engagement\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, taking urban design concepting through to client-ready images could take the team months to complete one project. Lavigne said he typically spent a lot of time capturing and creating details that users wouldn\u2019t be able to see right away, from pathways on streets to the windows on houses.\u00a0\nNow, using Omniverse and OpenUSD, the team can quickly design 3D assets and illustrations with higher polygon counts, and still include hundreds of different assets and materials without worrying about slowing down creative workflows.\u00a0\nOpenUSD, an open-source 3D scene description and file format, is a foundational element for Omniverse that enables interoperability when using the platform. USD eases the exchange and interoperability between design data from different applications. This provides Houseal Lavigne with the opportunity to increase collaboration across teams, as Omniverse becomes the central operator for the graphics.\u00a0\n\"Like any 3D program, the initial experience was a bit intimidating, but once we were able to understand how USD files work, the whole process became fast and easy,\" Lavigne said. \"For example, we were working on a recent development project around a Chicago suburb, and I was able to complete the project in 4 hours \u2014 from start to finish.\"\nOne of the latest projects Houseal Lavigne completed was the Forward Dallas, a citywide visionary plan that establishes guidelines for how public and private land should be used and what one of the largest cities in the country should look like. The models and renderings for the project were built in Omniverse through the CityEngine Connector. Lavigne and his team identified different place types, from regional parks to rural areas. And instead of printing out these place types on a PDF, the team was able to run real-time, interactive reviews with stakeholders, as Omniverse Enterprise lets users view high-fidelity renders of 3D models in real time. This allows for clearer communication, enhanced collaboration, and ultimately leads to faster decision-making.\u00a0\nAs a smaller firm, Houseal Lavigne continues to take on projects around the world, punching above its weight in the sector. Lavigne shares, \u201cBased on the quality of our output, and time it takes for us to complete, our clients often can\u2019t believe how small our company is\u201d.\u00a0\n\"What we're finding is that 3D graphics are now what's expected from customers, and the interactive component is becoming a common request,\" said Lavigne. \"Omniverse Enterprise has helped us stay ahead of our competition, allowing us to continue driving innovations.\"\nIn the future, Houseal Lavigne plans to develop new ways to use Omniverse and the cloud to provide these interactive design experiences to people around the world through VR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur quality and efficiency often leave customers amazed by our small teams capabilities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Lavigne Principal and co-founder of Houseal Lavigne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseal Lavigne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart developing interoperable 3D workflows and OpenUSD applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in Touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Information\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nCompany Overview\n\n\nInvestors\n\n\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\n\n\nNVIDIA Foundation\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability\n\n\nTechnologies\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nNews and Events\n\n\nNewsroom\n\n\nCompany Blog\n\n\nTechnical Blog\n\n\nWebinars\n\n\nStay Informed\n\n\nEvents Calendar\n\n\nGTC AI Conference\n\n\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n\n\n\n\nPopular Links\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\nPartners\n\n\nExecutive Insights\n\n\nStartups and VCs\n\n\nNVIDIA Connect for ISVs\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nTechnical Training\n\n\nTraining for IT Professionals\n\n\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow NVIDIA  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t           United States\n\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With the help of a new companion at your side, you just might make it out alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW members will soon be able to stream Diablo IV from the cloud \u2014 even without a GeForce RTX PC \u2014 with GeForce NOW. Ultimate members will be able to stream at up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second with support for NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex technology, and experience the action even on low-powered devices. And when ray tracing arrives this March, amp up your experience with the immersive effects.\nFor more details about the Diablo IV ray tracing update, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Our Call of Duty: Warzone DLSS 3 Performance Video, Play Season 1 Reloaded Later Today\nIn December, DLSS 3 was added to Call of Duty\u00ae: Warzone\u2122, enabling GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers to accelerate frame rates. Our new video, below, shows DLSS 3 in-action in live Warzone gameplay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 20 Series and 30 Series gamers can boost performance with DLSS Super Resolution. And if performance is high enough already in your opinion, you can instead enable NVIDIA DLAA, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer, more detailed experience.\nAdditionally, all GeForce gamers, dating back to users of the GeForce GTX 900 Series, can activate NVIDIA Reflex for the lowest latency.\nNVIDIA Reflex is synonymous with responsive gaming, and can be found in the latest and greatest games.\u00a0 Reflex reduces system latency so your actions occur quicker, potentially giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable. NVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 90 supported titles.\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%, and combined with the super fast frame rates delivered by DLSS, you can let your skill shine when competing on the battlefields of Urzikstan, Ashika Island and Vondel.\nNow\u2019s a great time to jump back into Warzone: Season 1 Reloaded begins later today with new content for Warzone and Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae III. Get all the details here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalworld Enters Early Access On January 19th With DLSS 2\nPocketpair\u2019s Palworld is a much-anticipated multiplayer, open-world, survival, crafting and monster-collection game that is set in a world where mysterious monsters \u201cPal\u201d inhabit.\nIn Palworld, you will meet a variety of Pals, and what to do with them is entirely up to you. Capturing them, raising them, fighting with them, forcing them to work, selling them off, slaughtering them for food; you can do many activities with Pals in the vast world of Palworld. Each Pal has individuality, appearance, size, characteristics, and specialized skills, and it\u2019s up to you how to best make use of these capabilities when playing solo or with up to 7 others online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Palworld enters Early Access on January 19th, GeForce RTX gamers can activate DLSS 2 to accelerate performance, enabling you to experience and enjoy the game at its very best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Abby Available Now With DLSS 3 & Ray Tracing\nIn CyberFlux Games, Gabro Media and Rate My Funeral's Who is Abby, immerse yourself in a narrative-rich journey of exploration and interactive puzzle-solving.

Fight for territory as part of a team, or explore a city in ruins as a lone wolf in Survivor. Unlock skills, customize your hero, and help win the war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent update added support for DLSS 2, helping accelerate United 1944\u2019s frame rates. If however, you find your frame rates are fast enough already, consider activating NVIDIA DLAA instead, an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS. DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Signal Available Now With DLSS 2\nReflect Studios\u2019 Dead Signal is available now with DLSS 2.

Nvidia\u2019s share price jumped more than 2% to $584.87 as of midday. Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion. But Nvidia isn\u2019t the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (AMD) hit an all-time intraday high on Thursday, topping out at $168.60 per share. The chipmaker is up 94% through the last 12 months. Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 57% over the same period.

NVDA AMD INTC   Advanced Chart    Nvidia got a huge vote of confidence on Thursday when Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is spending billions of dollars to acquire thousands of Nvidia chips for its AI projects. In an Instagram Reels post, Zuckerberg said Meta will build out AI infrastructure complete with 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 with the goal of developing general artificial intelligence.   Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming Sept. 20, 2022. (Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS)  \u00b7 via REUTERS / Reuters Zuckerberg also said he wants to make Meta\u2019s general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it. Nvidia is the world leader in AI chip development, with an estimated market share of between 70% and 90% of the global market. But it\u2019s not just Nvidia\u2019s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company\u2019s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, also serves as a moat that keeps Nvidia above the fray.  That said, Nvidia\u2019s rivals are gathering with the intent of snatching market share. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia\u2019s data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its own Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia\u2019s offerings. It\u2019s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta, are increasingly turning to chips they develop on their own to power their AI accelerators in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.   Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance Think of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it. ASICs, on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They\u2019re built specifically for a company\u2019s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. That\u2019s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as ASICs start to take hold, they may have less of a need for Nvidia\u2019s chips.   Story Continues Still, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. In other words, there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow. Even if Nvidia\u2019s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.For now, though, Nvidia remains the AI king.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

But spec sheets and Nvidia's own performance estimates showed that there was a deceptively huge performance gap between the two 4080 cards, enough that calling them both \"4080\" could have lead to confusion and upset among buyers.\nTaking the hint, Nvidia reversed course, \"unlaunching\" the 4080 12GB because it was \"not named right.\" This decision came late enough in the launch process that a whole bunch of existing packaging had to be trashed and that new BIOSes with new GPU names needed to be flashed to the cards before they could be sold.\nThe end result of all this rigamarole was the GeForce 4070 Ti, a card that certainly performed well against the previous-generation RTX 3070 Ti but still came with a big generational price jump from $599 to $799. It was too expensive to be a mainstream or \"budget\" card by any stretch of the imagination, but not fast enough to be a definitive cut above older RTX 30-series GPUs like the 4090 and 4080 had been.\nThis week Nvidia is launching the cumbersomely named GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, as a sort of mid-generation correction to the original card\u2014the original 4070 Ti is being discontinued, rather than getting a new price tag \u00e0 la the non-Super RTX 4070. The 4070 Ti Super is definitely faster than the old one at the same $799 price, which we'd still call a good thing. But that's still a high price in the end, and stronger-than-usual competition from AMD ultimately helps to make the 4070 Ti Super one of the less-compelling GPU options in the RTX 40-series lineup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the 4070 Ti Super\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080\nRTX 4080 Super\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 4070 Ti Super\nRTX 4070\nRTX 4070 Super\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16,384\n9,728\n10,240\n7,680\n8,448\n5,888\n7,168\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2,520 MHz\n2,505 MHz\n2,550 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock\n1,313 MHz\n1,400 MHz\n1,437 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n\n\nMemory size\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n\n\nTGP\n450 W\n320 W\n320 W\n285 W\n285 W\n200 W\n220 W\n\n\n\nThe 4070 Super got its speed upgrades from a bunch of extra CUDA cores, and the 4070 Ti Super gets some of those, too\u2014a 10 percent increase from the regular 4070 Ti. But the memory subsystem also gets healthy upgrades, jumping from 12GB of memory to a more future-proof 16GB and, accordingly, increasing the width of the memory bus from 192 bits to 256 bits.\nThat second thing has been a bit of a sore spot for enthusiasts for the entire RTX 40-series\u2014memory bus widths across the lineup are generally narrower than they were for 30- and 20-series cards in the same tier. Nvidia says that the addition of extra cache memory in the 40-series helps to make up for this, but there's still been grumbling about how less memory bandwidth is limiting these cards' performance. Occasionally, especially in the case of the 4060 Ti, there has been pretty solid evidence of performance issues at higher resolutions, where some cards\u2019 relative performance goes down as resolution scales up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Like most OEM cards, Nvidia's partners tend toward large triple-fan designs most of the time. Unlike other RTX cards, Nvidia doesn't make a Founders Edition version of the 4070 Ti Super. PNY's card is pictured here next to a regular 4070 Super.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like most OEM cards, Nvidia's partners tend toward large triple-fan designs most of the time.

But they get it quite a bit closer. They also don't increase Nvidia's stated power consumption specs for the card, which stay level at 285 W; we noticed a slight uptick in power consumption, but this could just be variance between different OEMs' specific settings. Our 4070 Ti was from MSI, and the 4070 Ti Super was the PNY GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB Verto; PNY's card comes with a 30 MHz game clock boost and 15 MHz boost clock boost, a barely noticeable increase that is typical of manufacturer overclocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\nGaming testbed\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (provided by AMD)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X670E Taichi (provided by AMD)\n\n\nRAM\n32GB (2x16GB) G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo (provided by AMD), running at DDR5-6000\n\n\nSSD\nWestern Digital Black SN850 1TB (provided by Western Digital)\n\n\nPower supply\nEVGA Supernova 850 P6 (provided by EVGA)\n\n\nCPU cooler\n280 mm Corsair iCure H115i Elite Capellix AIO\n\n\nCase\nLian Li O11 Air Mini\n\n\nOS\nWindows 11 22H2 with Core Isolation on, Memory Integrity off\n\n\nDrivers\nNvidia RTX 4070 Super and 3080 Ti: Pre-release driver 546.52\nNvidia RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super: Pre-release driver 551.15\nOther Nvidia cards: 536.99 (8/8/2023)\nAMD RX 7800 XT: Pre-release driver 23.20.01.05\nAMD RX 7900 XT: Adrenalin 23.8.1\n\n\n\nWhether you're impressed or not by the 4070 Ti Super's upgrades depends on what you want to use it for. If you're playing at 4K, the extra CUDA cores and the extra memory bandwidth both contribute to some respectable increases, usually in the 12 percent range for non-ray-traced games and the 7 percent range for the ray-traced ones (the one exception is Cyberpunk 2077, which at 4K with ray tracing on saw its average frame rates jump up a disproportionate 36 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1440p, because the old 4070 Ti's 192-bit memory interface was less of an issue, the performance gains are less impressive. You're looking at somewhere between a 5 and 10 percent increase in average frame rates across the games we tested.\nIn either case, the 4070 Ti Super is not as big an upgrade over the original as the 4070 Super was to the original 4070. And, at least in the tests we ran, there was no readily visible direct benefit to the jump from 12GB of RAM to 16GB, though this may well change by the time the 4070 Ti Super is a couple of years older and games have gotten a couple of years more graphically complex. The extra memory will also benefit memory-intensive GPU computing and running AI workloads. AMD continues to offer more memory than Nvidia across most of the RX 7000-series lineup (the 7900 XT comes with 20GB, and the $329 7600 XT and $500-ish 7800 XT both come with 16GB), but 16 still feels pretty reasonable for a card like this, a high-end but not top-end GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, AMD continues to do what it has been content to do this entire generation\u2014undercutting Nvidia a little, but not comprehensively. The Radeon 7900XT is the card to look at here, currently hovering around a street price of $750 and beating the 4070 Ti Super across the board in all of our non-ray-traced 4K benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, the script flips when you turn ray-tracing on in most games, but even then, Cyberpunk is the only game where the 4070 Ti Super truly blows the 7900 XT out of the water. The 7900 XT can keep up in Forza\u2014the least demanding of our ray-traced tests\u2014and manages to come within a few frames per second in\u00a0Returnal. Also, surprisingly, AMD's power efficiency holds up pretty well next to Nvidia's here, using around 9 percent more power in our tests while performing between 2 and 29 percent better at 4K in our non-ray-traced benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nObviously, how the cards stack up to each other is heavily dependent on the games you're playing and the settings you're using. And AMD still doesn't offer DLSS upscaling or other less-tangible Nvidia-specific benefits. But the 7900 XT is a pretty strong argument against the 4070 Ti Super, even better than the RX 7800 XT compared to the RTX 4070 Super or the RX 7600 compared to the RTX 4060.\n\nBetter, but still meh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The 12VHPWR connector on PNY's RTX 4070 Ti Super. \n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The 12VHPWR connector on PNY's RTX 4070 Ti Super. \n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nIs the 4070 Ti Super a good value? It depends on how you want to look at it. These speed increases make it a solid improvement from the highest-end RTX 30-series cards, for less money than the highest-end RTX 30-series cards. It's faster than the regular 4070 Ti and offers more memory at the exact same price, theoretically helping future-proof it against creeping video RAM requirements.\nBut by most metrics, the 4070 Ti was one of the least compelling cards in the 40-series lineup, and while the 4070 Ti Super\u00a0is better in important ways, it's not better\u00a0enough to really change that. It's 33 percent more expensive than the 4070 Super, and while its extra memory bandwidth, RAM, and CUDA cores help the 4070 Ti Super pull away from the 4070 Super in 4K games with heavy ray-tracing effects, the gap between them is often only about 20 percent, sometimes even less. At the same time, AMD's Radeon 7900 XT manages to put up a very good fight, offering better performance in most cases for less money and with not-disproportionately higher power use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, I have a hard time conjuring up the kind of person I'd recommend the 4070 Ti to. Sticking just to Nvidia's lineup, for the sake of argument: The 4060 is a good default recommendation if you just want a cheap card that will make most games playable; the 4070 Super is the way to go if you're after a cost-efficient card to go with a new high-refresh-rate 1440p monitor, or you want a slightly more future-proofed system without totally blowing your budget.

Her current work involves explaining the technical details of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to potential customers.\nFor fun, she visits auto shows, takes her BMW M3 for a supercharged spin on mountain roads near her home in Munich, or zips along the autobahn at 200 kilometers an hour.\nNg with one of NVIDIA\u2019s test vehicles.\nWhat led you to NVIDIA\u2019s automotive group?\n\nMy technical background in machine learning and low-power AI, as well as my passion for cars. I love to drive, especially sports cars. One of the best perks of my job here is that sometimes I get opportunities to see or drive very special cars, like hypercars or unreleased prototypes. Having my hobby be part of my job makes the work feel less like work.\n\nWhat are the challenges in the fast-changing automotive business?\n\nWe are building something that\u2019s truly incredible: cars that drive themselves. Our software has to observe and understand the world and make the right split-second decisions to keep us safe, comfortable, and in line with traffic laws. Each one of these aspects is a challenge, and the timeline to market is very aggressive. Certain companies are pushing the industry forward, and others need to keep up.\nDelivering a market-ready product in a very competitive environment meant that, as a new manager, I had to grow my team from zero to 12 members within a year. Scaling so fast presents its own challenges because everyone needs to learn about our software stack, tools, and processes.\nIt was very exciting to see the features my team developed at work in the car. I still remember the day when I tested my first project, \u201cSafety Force Field,\u201d and saw my code actuate the car and bring it to a full stop via the emergency brake on the test track. That was so rewarding!\n\nOn a test drive in Germany with three other engineers and managers.\nWhat is most exciting to you with the huge advances we\u2019ve seen in autonomous driving software and more?\n\nMany people in this industry are excited to work on the level 4/5 autonomous functions that make the car extremely intelligent and eliminate the need for a driver. Just as important for me are the active safety features.\nWhen I drive to work and get stuck in a bad traffic jam, I often wonder what the delay is and then see it was an accident. Seeing wrecks and the first responders tending to the injured, I\u2019m reminded of why I come to work every day. Our software will save lives.\nAI has enormous potential to help avoid or mitigate such accidents, to be better than a human driver, and to intervene when even an attentive driver makes a mistake. To me, using technological advancements to create driver-assistance software is the strongest reason for why we should continue to develop AV technology at NVIDIA.\n\nIn front of the Mercedes-Benz headquarters with part of Ng\u2019s team.\nHow has NVIDIA enabled you to shape your career?\n\nNVIDIA gives employees a home, and it\u2019s a place where people stay. Over three years, as our planning and control team grew from a dozen people to over 60, only a couple of people moved on. You can learn and try new things.\nOur managers and leaders create a trusting environment and team spirit, even in difficult times. This is the foundation that allows us to focus on the great work we do. The fact that I also get to work on my dream job (involving technology and cars) and talk to customers daily is just the cherry on top.\n\nWhat do you have going on outside NVIDIA?\n\nI enjoy spending time with my two daughters, who are six and seven years old. We like to swim, paint and play board games. They\u2019re both very interested in my job and aspire to do something similar when they grow up. They like cars, too, so the love for driving runs strong in the family.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Taking on the top AI chipmaker will be hard\u2014but maybe not impossiblePhotograph: Getty Images Jan 31st 2024ShareListen to this storyYour browser does not support the <audio> element.\u201cIT IS THE most advanced AI accelerator in the industry,\u201d boasted Lisa Su, boss of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), at the launch in December of its new MI300 chip. Ms Su rattled off a series of technical specifications: 153bn transistors, 192 gigabytes of memory and 5.3 terabytes per second of memory bandwidth. That is, respectively, about 2, 2.4 and 1.6 times more than the H100, the top-of-the-line artificial-intelligence chip made by Nvidia. That rival chipmaker\u2019s prowess in the semiconductors fuelling the AI boom has, over the past year, turned it into America\u2019s fifth-most-valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $1.5trn. Yet most experts agreed that the numbers and Ms Su weren\u2019t lying: the MI300 does indeed outshine the H100. Investors liked it, too\u2014AMD\u2019s share price jumped by 10% the next day.On January 30th, in its quarterly earnings call, AMD announced that it expected to sell $3.5bn-worth of MI300s this year. It also reported strong revenues of $23bn in 2023, four times what they had been in 2014, when Ms Su became chief executive. Its market value is up 100-fold on her watch, to $270bn. Relative to forecast profits in the next 12 months, its valuation is richer even than Nvidia\u2019s. Last year it displaced Intel, which once ruled American chipmaking, as the country\u2019s second-most-valuable semiconductor company. Now it is taking aim at the biggest.Image: The EconomistSuch ambition would have seemed fanciful a decade ago. Back then, recalls Mark Papermaster, AMD\u2019s technology chief, AMD was facing an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d. In 2008 it had spun off its chip-fabrication business to focus on designing processors, outsourcing manufacturing to contract chipmakers such as TSMC of Taiwan. The idea was to be better able to compete on blueprints with Intel, whose vast fabrication capacity AMD could not hope to match.It didn\u2019t work. Several of AMD\u2019s chips flopped. Sales of its central processing units (CPUs), mostly for personal computers, were collapsing. In 2013 it sold and leased back its campus in Austin to raise cash. A year later Ms Su inherited a net-debt pile of more than $1bn, a net annual loss of $400m and a market value of less than $3bn, down from $20bn in 2006.She realised that the only way for AMD to get back in the game was to steer it away from the sluggish PC market and focus on more promising areas like CPUs for data-centre servers and graphics processing units (GPUs, which make video-game visuals lifelike) for gaming consoles. She and Mr Papermaster took a gamble on a new CPU architecture designed to beat Intel not just on price, but also on performance.When the going got toughThe idea was to use a Lego-like approach to chip building. By breaking a chip up into smaller parts, AMD could mix and match blocks to assemble different types of chip, at a lower cost. When the first such composite chips were released in 2017, they were zippier and cheaper than rival offerings from Intel, possibly in part because Intel was distracted by its own problems (notably repeated manufacturing slip-ups as it moved to ever tinier transistors). In the past ten years AMD\u2019s market share in lucrative server CPUs has gone from nothing to 30%, breaking Intel\u2019s monopoly.Having faced down one giant, AMD now confronts another. The contest with Nvidia is different. For one thing, it is personal\u2014Ms Su and Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s Taiwanese-born boss, are distant relatives. In contrast to Intel, Nvidia is, like AMD, a chip designer and thus less prone to production missteps. More importantly, the stakes are higher. Nvidia\u2019s market value of $1.5trn is predicated on its dominance of the market for GPUs\u2014not because of their usefulness in gaming but because they also happen to be the best type of chip to train AI models. Ms Su expects global sales of AI chips to reach $400bn by 2027, up from perhaps $40bn last year. Does she stand a chance against Nvidia?Nvidia is a formidable rival. Both its revenues and operating margins are nearly three times AMD\u2019s. According to Jefferies, an investment bank, the company dominates the market for AI accelerator chips, accounting for 86% of such components sold globally; before the launch of the MI300, AMD barely registered. Nvidia also offers network gear that connects clusters of chips, and software, known as CUDA, to manage AI workloads. Nvidia has dominated AI chipmaking because it has offered the best chips, the best networking kit and the best software, notes Doug O\u2019Laughlin of Fabricated Knowledge, a research firm.Image: The EconomistAMD\u2019s new processor shows it can compete with Nvidia on semiconductor hardware. This, Mr Papermaster says, is the result of a ten-year investment. AMD is spending nearly $6bn a year on research and development, nearly as much as its larger rival\u2014and twice as much as a share of sales (see table). This has enabled it to adapt its Lego approach to GPUs. Combining a dozen blocks\u2014or \u201cchiplets\u201d\u2014into a single chip lets AMD put processors and memory close to each other, which boosts processing speed. In December OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and the world\u2019s hottest AI startup, said it would use the MI300s for some of its training.To outdo Nvidia on networking and software, AMD is teaming up with other firms. In December it announced a partnership with makers of networking gear, including the two largest, Broadcom and Cisco. It is also supporting an open-source initiative for chip-to-chip communication called Ultra Ethernet Consortium as an alternative to InfiniBand, a rival championed by Nvidia.Chomping at the byteNvidia\u2019s lead in software will be harder to close. It has been investing in CUDA since the mid-2000s, well before the current AI wave. AI developers and researchers love the platform, which allows them to fine-tune the performance of Nvidia processors. AMD hopes to tempt customers away from Nvidia by making its software, ROCm, open-source and providing tools to make the switch smoother, by translating CUDA programs into ROCm ones.Beating Nvidia at its own game will not be easy. Mr Huang\u2019s firm is not standing still. It recently announced plans to bring out a new chip every year instead of every two years. The tech giants with the grandest AI ambitions\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft\u2014are busily designing their own accelerator chips. Despite AMD\u2019s robust sales, investors were disappointed with its forecast for MI300 shipments. Its share price dipped by 3% the day after it reported its latest results.Still, AMD has one big thing going for it. It is not Nvidia. AI companies are desperate for an alternative to its larger rival, whose dominant position allows it to charge steep prices and, with demand outstripping supply, ration chips to buyers. Despite efforts to design their own hardware, big tech firms will rely on chipmakers for a while, and AMD gives them options, notes Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Microsoft and Meta have already announced plans to use AMD\u2019s GPUs in their data centres. And if Nvidia slips up, AMD will be there to pick up the Lego pieces.

My happy place.The mid-life refresh of Nvidia's Ada Lovelace generation graphics cards is here! They won't dramatically upend the graphics card landscape, but then again, it's hard to argue with more performance at the same or lower price points, so in that respect, they're welcome improvements.The RTX 4090 may still receive a Ti upgrade at some point, but it's already the fastest card, so I'll skip over that one. That leaves two cards that really could use the Super treatment. I'm pointing the finger at you two over there in the corner, the RTX 4060 and the RTX 4060 Ti.The RTX 4070, RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080 were generally well received for their performance improvement and general efficiency, though their pricing still copped them some flak. Less well received were the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti. They're still supremely power efficient, but their weak specifications and Nvidia's decision to use historically lower tier GPUs in these cards meant they are viewed less favorably than their RTX 30-series predecessors. Nvidia may have undisclosed plans to update them later in 2024, for now, what you see is what you get. And that's a shame.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nHere's how the new RTX 50-series cards perform against the previous generation of GeForce GPUs\n\n\n\n\nAn ode to the RTX 4090 and why high-end GPUs can sometimes be the best value\n\n\n\nBefore I get to my hopes for Super RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti models, I need to revisit the current non-Super versions by posing the question: How do we really classify a graphics card? If we stick to performance and value for money, then the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti do what they're supposed to do. Both deliver intergenerational performance improvements, and they include support for very useful technologies including DLSS 3 and Frame Generation. Their power efficiency is a standout and their pricing is the same or less than it was for the previous generation. When viewed in those terms, both cards earn approval.If the RTX 4060 was known as the RTX 4050 and the RTX 4060 Ti was the RTX 4060 then adequate would not be an accurate descriptor. Such cards could have been something special.But we know what's under the hood of both cards, and that's the source of their criticisms. Perhaps a good way to describe them is 'adequate'. If the RTX 4060 was known as the RTX 4050 and the RTX 4060 Ti was the RTX 4060, and both were priced appropriately, then adequate would not be an accurate descriptor. Such cards could have been something special. Nvidia would have earned rave reviews and social media and forum commentary would have given it a year's worth of PR smiles.If the RTX 4060 debuted as the RTX 4050, priced at something like $229, I'd be singing its praises from the rooftops. But that's not what happened. It's a budget GPU with xx60 nomenclature. The AD107 GPU at its heart is relatively tiny at 119mm\u00b2. It comes with 3,072 activated shaders, 8GB of VRAM and 128-bit bus. They're not specifications we'd expect from a 2023 mid-range graphics card. Compare those specs to its RTX 3060 12GB predecessor. It uses the 276mm\u00b2 GA106 GPU with 3,584 shaders, 12GB of VRAM as the name suggests, and a 192-bit bus. The RTX 4060 is absolutely a regression by comparison.It's a similar story for the RTX 4060 Ti. Its AD106 GPU measures in at a still small 188mm\u00b2 and it's got 4,352 shaders. That's an improvement over the RTX 4060, sure, but it's still stuck with 8GB of VRAM, and 128-bit bus. I'll ignore the $100 premium for the 16GB version as that's just too much of an ask. Compare that to the 392mm\u00b2 GA104 GPU of the RTX 3060 Ti, with 4,864 shaders and a 256-bit bus, and again we're looking at a regression.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Future)My thinking is that both the AD107 and AD106 GPUs (and the AD104 and AD103 for that matter) ended up performing better than Nvidia expected them to. That gave Nvidia the choice of elevating each GPU up by one tier. Both chips did just enough for Nvidia to save face when it accurately stated they outperformed their predecessors.\u00a0The use of lower spec GPUs allows Nvidia to save money thanks to the much larger number of usable dies per wafer, while fast GDDR6 speeds and larger L2 cache levels meant it could get away with less complex PCB designs. Chuck in a marketing blitzkrieg on the benefits of DLSS 3 and Frame Generation and we have the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti.But both cards could be sooooo much better, and they're the cards I want to see get the Super treatment ahead of any others in the RTX 40-series range.Here's what I'd like to see. A future RTX 4060 Super could basically take the place of the RTX 4060 Ti. Equip it with the AD106 GPU, with let's say 3,840 shaders and 16GB of GDDR6 (or even GDDR6X) and you'd have a much stronger card. Nvidia could even up the price and I wouldn\u2019t complain.An RTX 4060 with the AD106 GPU and RTX 4060 Ti with the AD104 GPU are definitely possible. But will Nvidia go down that path?It could do the same with an RTX 4060 Ti Super. Using the AD104 (as the RTX 4070 uses) would be a big step forward. Though the 5,888 shader count of the RTX 4070 is already far below the maximum capabilities of the fully enabled 7,680 shader count of the AD104, a variant with even fewer shaders, plus GDDR6 (not necessarily GDDR6X) with a 192-bit bus would put it much closer to the RTX 4070 than it is to the RTX 4060 Ti non-Super.There's a new precedent too. The RTX 4070 Ti Super is set to include the faster AD103 GPU, the same as that found in the RTX 4080, albeit with fewer shaders activated. An RTX 4060 with the AD106 GPU and RTX 4060 Ti with the AD104 GPU are definitely possible. But will Nvidia go down that path?Competition has a lot to do with it too. The AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT are solid competitors, but their MCM design, extra VRAM and complexity will probably prohibit them from dropping down to price points that give Nvidia the shudders. The RX 7600 is only a match for the 4060, so there's not much pressure there. Intel's Battlemage generation may yet throw up some interesting competition. I look forward to seeing what those cards can do.(Image credit: Future)2023 was a pretty crappy year for a lot of people. Cost of living pressures and inflation hurt the pockets of gamers, meaning discretionary purchases of graphics cards had to be put off.\u00a0Throwing money at a merely adequate upgrade isn't enough. Make it a worthy one. By giving the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti the Super treatment, gamers would be much more incentivized to retire ever popular cards like the GTX 1060 and RTX 2060.Come on Nvidia, throw us a bone. You're making a killing on AI, but your roots are in gaming. We're not expecting charity, but giving mainstream gamers a Super incentive to upgrade wouldn\u2019t hurt the bottom line too much.\u00a0Would it?\n\n\nChris SzewczykSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterChris' gaming experiences go back to the mid-nineties when he conned his parents into buying an 'educational PC' that was conveniently overpowered to play Doom and Tie Fighter.

The NAIRR pilot, the NSF said, is designed to create a national resource for researchers and educators to access high-powered AI technologies with the goal of ensuring the US continues to lead in AI research and innovation.  Companies and nonprofits joining in the two-year pilot program consist of a murderers' row of some of the biggest names in AI, including Amazon (AMZN), Anthropic, Hugging Face, IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), OpenAI, and Palantir (PLTR), among others. Federal agencies participating in the effort include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Agriculture. NAIRR, which was born out of President Biden\u2019s AI executive order, will serve as a framework for how the government and private sector can advance AI technologies in the future.   Nvidia is among a collection of companies providing the National Science Foundation with help for its National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, or NAIRR, program. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez, File)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS \u201cBy investing in AI research through the NAIRR pilot, the United States unleashes discovery and impact and bolsters its global competitiveness,\u201d NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement. \u201cTo continue leading in AI research and development, we must create opportunities across the country to advance AI innovation and strengthen educational opportunities, empowering the nation to shape international standards and igniting economic growth,\u201d he added. According to the NSF, NAIRR will function as a shared national infrastructure that will provide communities across the country with the hardware, models, and resources needed to advance the AI ecosystem. The program, the NSF said, is necessary because AI resources have become concentrated and difficult to access for many communities, whether those are smaller colleges or institutions in rural areas and territories.   Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance Examples of potential use cases include allowing an AI researcher to investigate the validation and verification of large models or a lecturer from a community college or minority institution to provide students access to AI systems. Tech companies, the foundation explained, aren\u2019t being paid to provide access to their services, but rather are making in-kind contributions to those made by government agencies.

But I can't help but feel it's made a mistake by keeping the old RTX 4070 around and not taking it out back with a shotgun in hand.Of all the RTX 40-series Super cards launching this month, this is the first and the one which benefits from the arguably the biggest GPU specs increase of the lot. Though my card has yet to arrive, I am however, kinda excited about the complete change of GPU and memory in the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Though I still think it's a dumb name.With 22% more CUDA cores, the RTX 4070 Super is practically giving you RTX 4070 Ti performance for $200 less because it remains at the same $599 price point as the original RTX 4070 it's replacing.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti review (MSI Ventus 3X)\n\n\n\nExcept, it isn't. Replacing the RTX 4070, I mean.No, unlike with the rest of the new Super series of Ada-powered cards, where the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080 are being retired (they are, after all, too old for this shit, Riggs) in favour of their Super replacements, the RTX 4070 is sticking around for the foreseeable future. And it gets a price cut because the RTX 4070 Super is taking its original spot.So, why the hell is that happening? Well, it's all AMD's fault. And I've lost track of the number of times I've said that over the years, but here you can blame the impressive mid-range gaming muscle of the RX 7800 XT, our favourite graphics card of last year.That card has made it tough going for the RTX 4070 ever since launch, with the Radeon GPU launching at $499, some $100 less than the GeForce option and with performance not a million miles off. We've seen the RTX 4070 dropping in price a lot at third-party vendors to compete and now Nvidia has made it official with a new $549 MSRP.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)With the RTX 4070 Super that original $100 price delta now matches the 20% difference in gaming performance between the RX 7800 XT and RTX 4070 Super, though it is now arguably in a completely different tier of GPUs. But with there only being a nominal $50 difference between the RTX 4070 and its Super brethren, one is surely going to cannibalise sales of the other, rather than definitively taking them away from the still cheaper RX 7800 XT.It's got a better chance of hurting the Radeon card if the old GeForce GPU drops down around the $499 mark again, but then it will be taking more chunks out of the RTX 4070 Super, which is only 10%+ quicker in games.This could have all been avoided if Nvidia had just nixxed the old RTX 4070 and completely replaced it with the same $549 price tag. You get the marketing win of faster and cheaper than the old card, you get a little closer to the pricing of the Radeon, but with a very clear gaming performance lead across the board, and you make it very hard for all but the dyed-red AMD faithful to consider the RX 7800 XT over the new RTX 4070 Super.I make it sound simple, and I expect there are some sales projections scrawled out on a whiteboard somewhere at Nvidia HQ that bear out its current plans, but for me it just feels a little too convoluted. And like it's making things just a bit over-complicated for the gamer trying to pick their next GPU.Though maybe in the end it's all about market psychology; maybe the studies show that if someone's picking between a $549 and a $599 graphics card nine times out of ten they'll spend more. And that would make it an easy cake-and-eat-it scenario for Nvidia.\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

NvidiaChip giant Nvidia used the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday to unveil several product offerings for consumer technology, the automotive market, and robotics, and unveiled a slew of laptops focused on generative artificial intelligence technology of the ChatGPT sort.\"The big buzz at CES this year is gonna be all about generative AI and AI PCs,\" said Nvidia's senior director of product management, Justin Walker, in a briefing with reporters.\u00a0Also:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in TechIn the consumer AI area, Nvidia is positioning the personal computer as a platform for individual use of so-called \"large language models\" such as Meta's Llama 2 program and the popular image program Stable Diffusion.\u00a0The company on Monday announced a new series of its RTX graphics cards, called the RTX 40 Super series, that it says can generate video and images 1.7 times faster and 1.5 times faster respectively.\u00a0Several PC makers are introducing laptops, which Nvidia referred to as \"AI-ready,\" with the new cards, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung, which begin shipping this month, Nvidia said. The cards for workstations, in three models, 4070 SUPER, 4070i SUPER, and 4080 SUPER, will go on sale this month for $599, $799, and $999, respectively.\u00a0Special Feature   Best of CES 2024 ZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life. \n          Read now\n          Building upon the release in October of a programming library, TensorRT-LLM for Windows, Nvidia emphasized the personal computer as a workstation for training large language models, in conjunction with cloud services.\u00a0The company's recently announced AI Workbench software for PCs will go live as a beta release later this month. It allows programmers to grab the language models from repositories such as Hugging Face and to send them to cloud computing facilities including Nvidia's own DGX Cloud. The RTX cards can then be used on the local PC for \"inference and light customization,\" the company said.\u00a0Also: HP launches new AI-powered Spectre laptops at CES with flashy peripherals to matchAlso in the consumer market, Nvidia made a big push for in-game avatars that are enhanced by automatically generated speech. Building upon a service previously announced, ACE, for \"avatar cloud engine,\" the company announced \"Production Microservices\" for ACE that lets game developers plug into their games Nvidia programs for speech recognition and for facial animations.\u00a0As Nvidia's Walker explained, the technology will allow a player \"to just talk to the game character,\" with their voice input fed into automatic speech recognition, \"which translates that speech to text, then, we take the text and we feed that into a large language model to generate the character's response.\" \u00a0A large language model \"can create an appropriate response and can create a response that's not canned \u2014 it won't be the same response every time,\" Walker explained. \"That response can be vocalized using another model, a text to speech model, and then be passed on to yet another model which does an audio lip sync\" so that the face muscles of the non-player character move in sync with the spoken response.Also: I saw Samsung and LG's new transparent TVs at CES, and there's a clear winner\"That's a combination of four different AI models to make all this happen,\" noted Walker. \"And those AI models, within our platform, are flexible: You can run those models on a cloud, you can run those models locally, on your RTX PC, so it can be powered to help provide this experience.\"   Building upon a service previously announced, ACE, for \"avatar cloud engine,\" Nvidia announced \"Production Microservices\" for ACE that lets game developers plug into their games Nvidia programs for speech recognition and for facial animations.\u00a0 NvidiaAlso for the consumer market, stock photography giant Getty Images announced a new service, Generative AI by iStock, which it built using Nvidia's \"Picasso\" program. The iStock service \"allows anyone to create 4K imagery from text using an AI model trained on Getty Images' extensive catalog of licensed, commercially safe creative content,\" the companies said. The service is available immediately at istock.com.\u00a0In addition to the consumer initiatives, Nvidia emphasized news of customers and partners in the automative market, which always has concept cars on display at the show.\u00a0Nvidia announced new customer wins in electric vehicles, including Li Auto, which will use its \"Drive Thor\" computer platform, a board that Nvidia bills as a \"centralized computer for safe and secure autonomous vehicles.\" In addition, EV makers GWM (Great Wall Motor), and Xiaomi will use the company's \"DRIVE Orin\" chips to achieve ADAS -- automated driver assistance -- functions, Nvidia announced.Customer Mercedes-Benz's press conference featured the \"Concept CLA Class,\" which uses Nvidia's \"DRIVE Orin\" chip platform. Nvidia noted that Mercedes-Benz is also using \"digital twin\" technology in its design process via Nvidia's Omniverse software platform for virtual reality application development.CES 2025    \n\n            CES 2025: The 25 best products that impressed us the most\n           \n\n            Halliday's new AI glasses are what Meta, Google, and Apple have been trying to build\n           \n\n            Three CES 2025 products I'd buy as soon as they'd take my money\n           \n\n            We have named the 12 winners for the official Best of CES 2025 awards\n              \n\n              CES 2025: The 25 best products that impressed us the most\n             \n\n              Halliday's new AI glasses are what Meta, Google, and Apple have been trying to build\n             \n\n              Three CES 2025 products I'd buy as soon as they'd take my money\n             \n\n              We have named the 12 winners for the official Best of CES 2025 awards\n             Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      The best gaming PCs you can buy: Expert tested\n      \n      The best Windows tablets you can buy: Microsoft, Lenovo, and more\n      \n      The best business desktops you can buy: Expert tested\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Since our last update, Layers of Fear, SCUM, and Squad added support. And at CES 2024 we revealed that Horizon Forbidden West and NAKWON: Last Paradise will both launch with day-one support for Reflex.\nRead on for all the details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West Complete Edition Launching With Day-One Reflex Support\nJoin Aloy as she braves the distant lands of Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, the critically-acclaimed sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn. Explore distant lands, fight bigger and more awe-inspiring machines, and encounter astonishing new tribes as you return to the far-future, post-apocalyptic world of Horizon.\nThe land is dying. Vicious storms and an unstoppable blight ravage the scattered remnants of humanity, while fearsome new machines prowl their borders. Life on Earth is hurtling towards another extinction, and no one knows why.\nIt's up to Aloy to uncover the secrets behind these threats and restore order and balance to the world. Along the way, she must reunite with old friends, forge alliances with warring new factions and unravel the legacy of the ancient past \u2013 all the while trying to stay one step ahead of a seemingly undefeatable new enemy.\nThe Complete Edition also includes Burning Shores, the story expansion that picks up after the conclusion of the main game, along with bonus content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition launches later this year, GeForce RTX gamers can make gameplay even more responsive with Reflex, can accelerate performance with DLSS 3, and can amp up image quality with DLAA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayers of Fear NVIDIA Reflex Upgrade Available Now\nBloober Team\u2019s critically acclaimed franchise, which has left a mark on narrative-driven first-person psychological horror games, returns to tell its final spine-chilling story in Layers of Fear. This new release is the definitive way to experience the franchise as it features Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, as well as all downloadable content, including the new \u2018The Final Note\u2019 DLC that will give you a new perspective on the Layers of Fear storyline, and the never-before-told story of The Writer, which will tie everything together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt on Unreal Engine 5, Layers of Fear featured DLSS 2 at launch, and hardware-accelerated, ray-traced Lumen lighting to make the stunning visuals, and your nightmarish experience, as immersive and realistic as possible. In a recent update, Layers of Fear introduced support for NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency by up to 56%. And with newly-introduced support for DLSS 3, performance for GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers was further accelerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAKWON: LAST PARADISE Launching With Reflex\nMINTROCKET\u2019s NAKWON: LAST PARADISE is an upcoming third-person Zombie Apocalypse Stealth Survival game. Seoul is a city scarce of guns, but plentiful in hiding spots within clustered buildings and alleys. Survive as an ordinary human, relying solely on your senses and keep yourself safe from Zombies in this PvPvE exploration, extraction, and survival looter shooter. Infiltrate the city full of Zombies (AI) and other Survivors (Players) to collect useful items and sell them or make money by completing missions. Be cautious as you'll lose everything you have once you die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen NAKWON: LAST PARADISE launches later this year, GeForce RTX gamers can activate Reflex and DLSS 3 from day one, reducing system latency and accelerating performance to enhance their experience. Check out the video below, and stay tuned to GeForce.com for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCUM Now Features Reflex\nSCUM, from Gamepires and Jagex, takes place in a not-too-distant future where prisoners fight for survival and glory as millions of viewers watch at home. SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP \u2018network events\u2019 available to everyone at any time, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in this ever-evolving survival game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving already supported DLSS 2 for some time, SCUM recently upgraded its RTX technology, introducing support for both Reflex and DLSS 3, reducing system latency by up to 55%, and further accelerating frame rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquad Upgrade Adds Reflex\nOffworld Industries' Squad is a large-scale combined arms multiplayer first-person shooter emphasizing combat realism through communication, team play, and strong squad cohesion feeding into larger-scale coordination, tactics, and planning. A wide selection of realistic faction-specific weapons and vehicles allow players to build their own loadouts that best suit their preferred tactics.\nFeaturing 12 factions, 24 massive maps, vehicle-based combined arms gameplay, and player-constructed bases, Squad creates a heart-thumping, visceral gaming experience with split-second decision-making in real-world scale firefights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquad recently received a tech upgrade, introducing support for Reflex. Activating Reflex reduces system latency by up to 49%.\nNew Mouse With NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer Support Available Now\nReflex is present in the best competitive games, G-SYNC Monitors with Reflex have the highest refresh rates with excellent image clarity, and Gaming Mice with Reflex are primed to up your game.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg today\u00a0revealed that his company is planning to snap up about 350,000 high-end H100 graphics processing units from Nvidia Corp. to provide the computing power to advance its goals in a new area of artificial intelligence.\nThe company is striving to become a leader in the area of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which is a potential advanced AI that can match the intelligence of humans and perform a vast array of different tasks.\nZuckerberg (pictured) said in an Instagram Reels video posted today that AGI may eventually be able to power a wide range of cutting-edge services and devices, including more advanced digital assistants, augmented reality glasses and more. The company\u2019s aim is to build \u201cthe best AI assistants, AIs for creators, AIs for businesses and more,\u201d he said, adding that doing so will require advances in every area of AI.\nIn order to get there, Meta will need to make a significant investment in its AI computing infrastructure, hence its plans to acquire mountains of powerful H100 GPUs from Nvidia. The H100 chip is Nvidia\u2019s most advanced ever, and is said to be particularly adept at training the large language models that power generative AI such as ChatGPT.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building an absolutely massive amount of infrastructure to support this,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBy the end of the year, we\u2019re going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s, or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a staggering number, not least because of the enormous expense required to purchase all of that silicon. Although the CEO didn\u2019t say how much the company intends to spend on its GPUs, it\u2019s likely to be a very big number. What\u2019s more, Meta is unlikely to have amassed all that many so far, as the H100 only went on sale in late 2022, and has been in limited supply.\nEstimates from analysts at Raymond James say Nvidia is selling the H100 for between $25,000 to $30,000, while on eBay they can fetch more than $40,000. Even though Meta will definitely get some credit for bulk purchasing, it\u2019s still likely to spend in excess of $9 billion on the GPUs.\nZuckerberg said the 350,000 H100 GPUs will be added to an infrastructure that will also contain around 600,000 H100 equivalents, which could mean the company is also bulk buying rival chips such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s new Instinct M1300X AI accelerator.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\n\n\nNvidia and its shareholders will no doubt be delighted to hear about Meta\u2019s GPU investment plans, but it\u2019s less clear what Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement really means for his own company, Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT Inc., told SiliconANGLE. He pointed out that it wasn\u2019t so long ago that Zuckerberg was proclaiming the metaverse as the next big thing, plowing billions of dollars into what, at least for now, must be seen as a failed effort. \u201cAI certainly has more support across tech and other industries than the metaverse ever did,\u201d King added. \u201cHowever, at this point, Meta\u2019s GPU purchases are more indicative of its relative wealth than the potential success of its plans.\u201d\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said Meta primarily sees AI as a tool to help keep users engaged with its platforms, so they can keep generating advertising revenue. \u201cNvidia was the world\u2019s biggest winner last year as it provides the hardware platform for generative AI, and if other vendors follow Meta\u2019s lead, it will be another very good year for that company,\u201d he said.\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments do at least provide some insight into just how much money big technology companies are spending to stay at the forefront of AI development. Research from Omdia says that other leading players, such as Microsoft Corp., Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc., are all believed to have bought between 50,000 and 150,000 H100 GPUs last year, and will likely have similar plans to add to their computing stacks.\nThe importance of GPUs to Meta\u2019s ambitions was stressed by Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun during an interview last month. \u201cIf you think AGI is in, the more GPUs you have to buy,\u201d he said.\nAll told, Meta\u2019s total expenses for 2024 are likely to be in the region of $94 billion to $99 billion, the company said in its most recent quarterly financial report. One of the biggest expenses is expected to be computing expansion. \u201cIn terms of investment priorities, AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024, both in engineering and computer resources,\u201d Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts.\nIn his Instagram post today, Zuckerberg revealed that Meta\u2019s GPUs are already being used to good effect in the training of Llama 3, which is an open-source alternative to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT models. However, the company is taking a different approach to its rival, and plans to open-source the Llama 3 model, just as it did with its predecessor, Llama 2.\n\u201cThis technology is so important and the opportunities are so great that we should open source and make it as widely available as we responsibly can,\u201d Zuckerberg insisted.\nPhoto:\u00a0Anthony Quintano/Flickr\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Ninety-eight percent of retailers plan to invest in generative AI in the next 18 months, according to a new survey conducted by NVIDIA.\nThat makes retail one of the industries racing fastest to adopt generative AI to ramp up productivity, transform customer experiences and improve efficiency.\nEarly deployments in the retail industry include personalized shopping advisors and adaptive advertising, with retailers initially testing off-the-shelf models like GPT-4 from OpenAI.\nBut many are now realizing the value in developing custom models trained on their proprietary data to achieve brand-appropriate tone and personalized results in a scalable, cost-effective way.\nBefore building them, companies must first consider a variety of questions: whether to opt for an open-source, closed-source or enterprise model; how they plan to train and deploy the models; how to host them; and, most importantly, how to ensure future innovations and new products can be easily incorporated into them.\nNew offerings like NVIDIA AI Foundations, a curated collection of optimized, enterprise-grade foundation models from NVIDIA and leading open-source pretrained models, are giving retail companies the building blocks they need to construct their custom models. With NVIDIA NeMo, an end-to-end platform for large language model development, retailers can customize and deploy their models at scale using the latest state-of-the-art techniques.\nGenerative AI Use Cases in the Retail Industry\nMultimodal models are leading the new frontier in the generative AI landscape. They\u2019re capable of processing, understanding and generating content and images from multiple sources such as text, image, video and 3D rendered assets.\nThis allows retailers to create eye-catching images or videos for a brand\u2019s marketing and advertising campaign using only a few lines of text prompts. Or they can be used to deliver\u00a0 personalized shopping experiences with in-situ and try-on product image results. Yet another use case is in product description generation, where generative AI can intelligently generate detailed e-commerce product descriptions that include product attributes, using meta-tags to greatly improve SEO.\nMany retailers are testing the generative AI waters first with internal deployments. For example, some are boosting the productivity of their engineering teams with AI-powered computer code generators that can write optimized lines of code for indicated outcomes. Others are using custom models to generate marketing copy and promotions for various audience segments, increasing click-to-conversion rates. Meanwhile, chatbots and translators are helping employees accomplish their day-to-day tasks.\nTo enhance customer experiences, retailers are deploying generative AI-powered shopping advisors that can offer personalized product recommendations \u200bin customer-tailored conversation styles and display images of products being recommended. It can even display those products if shoppers want to see the recommended product, for example, in their home by uploading a picture of a room. Another use case is a customer service multilingual chatbot capable of answering simple customer inquiries and routing complex ones to human agents for improved, more efficient service.\nNVIDIA at NRF\nTo learn more about how generative AI is shaping the future of retail, watch this speaking session from NRF 24 to hear from Azita Martin, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of AI for retail, consumer packaged goods and quick-service restaurants, and others on how Target and Canadian Tire are using generative AI to deliver personalized shopping experiences and drive revenue and productivity.\nDownload the State of AI in Retail and CPG: 2024 Trends report for in-depth results and insights.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA NeMo | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The reaction wasn't as brutal as it was among commenters and reviewers for the 4060 Ti a month later (a \"waste of sand,\" declared Gamers Nexus), but you'd usually find praise for its power efficiency but criticism of its price (high for a xx70 card) and its performance improvement relative to the previous generation (only about as fast as an RTX 3080, sometimes less).\nThose are all largely valid criticisms. But the 4070 is Nvidia's most popular RTX 4000-series desktop GPU, at least according to the (admittedly flaky and opaque) Steam Hardware Survey data for December 2023. It's not in the top 10\u2014this is dominated by older midrange GeForce cards that have been out a lot longer\u2014but it's doing better than Nvidia's other 40-series desktop cards and better than every one of AMD's RX 7000-series cards put together.\nThe release of the RTX 4070 Super should help bring the enthusiast commentariat version of reality and the Steam Hardware Survey's version of reality into closer sync with one another. At the same $599 price\u2014still more than the $499 of the 2070 Super or 3070, but not higher than the 4070\u2014you get performance that Nvidia says is more in line with the RTX 3090. And the power efficiency remains quite impressive, though power use overall is up just a bit from the regular 4070.\nIt's still hard to swallow a graphics card that costs more than an entire Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5, a GPU that can easily cost just as much as the entire rest of your PC tower combined. The 4070 Super also needs to contend with AMD's Radeon 7800 XT, which is often as fast or faster, has an additional 4GB of memory, and can often be had for as little as $510. But there's still no card that's offering quite this combination of efficiency and performance. In 2024's GPU market, where stubbornly higher prices are an enduring hangover of the 2020\u20132021 GPU shortage, a significant performance bump for a not-even-year-old card that's available for the same price counts as a win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the RTX 4070 Super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The 4070 Super Founders Edition is black with black highlights, removing the silver highlights from the regular 4070. \n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4070 Super Founders Edition is black with black highlights, removing the silver highlights from the regular 4070. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The standard array of DisplayPort and HDMI outputs. \n              \n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard array of DisplayPort and HDMI outputs. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4070 Super Founders Edition is black with black highlights, removing the silver highlights from the regular 4070. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard array of DisplayPort and HDMI outputs. \n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe thing that makes the 4070 Super super is the addition of 1,280 extra CUDA cores, a nearly 22 percent increase from the regular 4070. That's more of an increase in computing power than the 4080 Super or 4070 Ti Super saw, both in absolute core counts and expressed as a percentage. That doesn't always mean a 22 percent bump in-game performance, but it's a nice uplift, and it's a whole lot closer to the AD104 GPU die's maximum core count of 7,680.\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080\nRTX 4080 Super\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 4070 Ti Super\nRTX 4070\nRTX 4070 Super\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16,384\n9,728\n10,240\n7,680\n8,448\n5,888\n7,168\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2,520 MHz\n2,505 MHz\n2,550 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock\n1,313 MHz\n1,400 MHz\n1,437 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n\n\nMemory size\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n\n\nTGP\n450 W\n320 W\n320 W\n285 W\n285 W\n200 W\n220 W\n\n\n\nThe only other specs that really change are cache, which is boosted from 36MB in the 4070 to 48MB in the 4070 Super, and the total graphics power (TGP) of the card, which can now reach a maximum of 220 W. It's a small enough difference that Nvidia's required power supply wattage remains the same at 650 W.\nThe 4070 Super retains the same 192-bit memory interface and 12GB bank of memory as the regular 4070, and memory and GPU core clocks are all the same, too. For this review, we tested the Founders Edition version of the card, which conforms to Nvidia's default specs and uses the 12VHPWR connector, but cards from Nvidia's partners can come with mild overclocks and 8-pin power connectors. The included 12VHPWR adapter only needs two 8-pin connectors attached, or you can connect it directly to a compatible power supply; ATX 3.0 supplies support 12VHPWR natively, but I recently bought an adapter cable for my gaming PC's modular Cooler Master PSU that plugs directly into the 8-pin connectors on the power supply; you've got more options now than you did a year ago, now that the 40-series has been around for a bit.\nNvidia's Founders Edition card is the same size and shape as the old 4070, which means that (unlike the 4080 and 4090 Founders Edition cards and a whole bunch of triple-fan, triple-slot third-party cards) it ought to fit in just about anything without much hassle, including most mini ITX builds. The only real design difference is that the silver highlights have been swapped out for black ones, giving the card a more imposing \"this is my final form\" aesthetic. Similarly, we'd expect most of Nvidia's partners to continue using their 4070 card designs without many changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance and power\n\n\n\n\nGaming testbed\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (provided by AMD)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X670E Taichi (provided by AMD)\n\n\nRAM\n32GB (2x16GB) G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo (provided by AMD), running at DDR5-6000\n\n\nSSD\nWestern Digital Black SN850 1TB (provided by Western Digital)\n\n\nPower supply\nEVGA Supernova 850 P6 (provided by EVGA)\n\n\nCPU cooler\n280 mm Corsair iCure H115i Elite Capellix AIO\n\n\nCase\nLian Li O11 Air Mini\n\n\nOS\nWindows 11 22H2 with Core Isolation on, Memory Integrity off\n\n\nDrivers\nNvidia RTX 4070 Super and 3080 Ti: Pre-release driver 546.52 (12/18/2023)\nOther Nvidia cards: 536.99 (8/8/2023)\nAMD RX 7700 XT/7800 XT: Pre-release driver 23.20.01.05\nOther AMD cards: Adrenalin 23.8.1\n\n\n\nIf the RTX 4070 went toe to toe with the RTX 3080, then the 4070 Super tries to compete with higher-end 3000-series cards like the RTX 3080 Ti (according to our testing) and RTX 3090 (according to Nvidia's\u2014we don't have one on hand). Both of these 30-series cards perform pretty similarly in many games, though the 3080 Ti might be a better comparison point for the 4070 Super since it also has 12GB of RAM instead of 24GB. And the 4070 Super provides that performance while using roughly two-thirds as much power, according to our tests.\nPer usual, we've run a variety of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games on these GPUs, focusing on 1440p and 4K resolutions since that's what the card is suited for. We've also included charts for games with heavy ray-tracing effects like\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0and\u00a0Returnal, and also some charts measuring performance with DLSS/FSR and DLSS Frame Generation enabled.

You'll also see many examples throughout our test suite, though, where the performance gains are smaller, in the 8\u201310 percent range. Generally, though, it's a nice upgrade.\nComparing the 4070 Super and 3080 Ti in more depth, we see quite a few games where the cards run equally fast. At 1440p, in fact, the 4070 Super usually pulls just about even with the 3080 Ti, or it falls short by just a handful of frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nBump the resolution up to 4K, though, and the 3080 Ti's edge gets more consistent. The 4070 Super still keeps up most of the time, and it has the (admittedly imperfect) extra benefit of DLSS Frame Generation to lean on. But the 3080 Ti has a 384-bit memory interface, and the 4070 Super's 48MB of cache can't quite close that gap at higher resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the topic of DLSS FG, the 4070 Super is kind of an ideal card for it. To get good results, your GPU generally needs to be capable of a reasonably good base frame rate, something that's much more true of the 4070 Super at 1440p and 4K than it is of the 4060 Ti or 4060. You'll still see some weird visual artifacts (the rainstorm in Returnal\u00a0that blinks in and out of existence remains a good, easily reproducible example), but it's worth turning it on in more demanding games like\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 to see whether the benefit of the higher frame rate is offset by visual glitches or increased input lag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let's compare the 4070 Super to AMD's best competitor in this category, the Radeon RX 7800 XT. Generally available for just a hair over its $500 MSRP, the 7800 XT can usually match or beat the 4070 Super's performance in games without ray-tracing effects enabled. It's not always true, but it usually is. Per usual, though, AMD comes out worse in games with heavy ray-tracing effects, falling well behind the 4070 Super (or even the regular 4070) in Cyberpunk,\u00a0Returnal,\u00a0Hitman III, and the 3DMark ray-tracing benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nLike the 4070, the 4070 Super remains an incredibly power-efficient GPU. Its absolute power consumption in games is between 10 and 15 percent higher than the regular 4070 in our tests, roughly commensurate with the performance boost you can usually expect. The 7800XT uses an additional 30 W or so running the same games at the same settings (as ever, take software-reported power consumption comparisons between manufacturers with a grain of salt, but these numbers are in line with what both Nvidia and AMD list in their spec sheets).\nConclusions\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 Super is a pretty straightforward win for most GPU buyers. It's the same price as the 4070 and has better performance, and it's a $600 card that trades blows with cards like the 3080 Ti and 3090 ($1,199 and $1,499 at launch, respectively). Comparing it to the 3080 Ti, you can still see games where the 4070 Super's 192-bit memory interface seems to be holding it back, particularly at 4K. But the architectural updates and extra processing power generally help the 4070 Super keep up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt simplifies matters for most GPU buyers that we are mostly past the transitional phase of this graphics generation where you wouldn't just have to factor in what the competition was offering but also all the last-gen GeForce and Radeon cards that were still sitting on shelves at reasonable prices. At this point, it's not worth considering the leftover, open-box stock of the 6800 XT or 3080 Ti.\nOne problem with the 4070 Super is that it still leaves a fair-sized hole in Nvidia's GPU lineup, where none of the options are particularly cost-effective. There are now three cards between the 4070 Super and the $299 RTX 4060: the 8GB 4060 Ti at $399, the 16GB 4060 Ti at $449, and the regular RTX 4070 at $549.\nThe 4060 Ti is generally between 10 and 20 percent faster than the 4060 for 33 percent more money, and the 4070 Super is usually between 12 and 22 percent faster than the regular 4070 for about 9 percent more money. Either card is one decent promotional discount away from being a solid deal, but at their regular prices, you should save a bit of money with the regular 4060, spend a bit more to get the 4070 Super, or consider one of AMD's offerings.\nAMD remains pretty competitive here, offering its typical bargain: pay a little less for a card with as-good-or-better rasterized performance but higher power use and generally so-so ray tracing performance. If you want high-frame-rate 1440p or reasonably solid 60 fps 4K, the 7800 XT is still a viable option, and it costs closer to $500 than $600. The power consumption, better ray-tracing performance, and DLSS support are all strong arguments in favor of the 4070 Super or even the regular 4070, but if you don't need or care about any of those things, go ahead with the AMD card and save some money.\nThe good\n\nGreat GPU for high-fps 1440p gaming, with 60 fps 4K well within reach for many games\nExcellent power efficiency\nRTX 3080 Ti-esque performance for half the price\nNvidia's retains its performance edge in ray-traced games\n\nThe bad\n\nDoes rely on DLSS to hit 60 fps when playing at 4K or at 1440p with heavy ray-tracing effects on\nRelatively narrow 192-bit memory bus means it can't always beat the old 3080 Ti, especially at 4K\nIf you don't care about ray tracing, DLSS, or lower power consumption, the $500-ish Radeon RX 7800 XT may be a better value\n\nThe ugly\n\n$600 is still a price increase from older xx70 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Andrew Cunningham\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\n\n\n      Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n        \n\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNvidia unveiled three GPU-powered processor cards designed to run generative AI workloads on laptops at the CES conference in Las Vegas Monday.\nThe RTX 4080 Super, 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super graphics cards will begin shipping later this month, embedded in laptops from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and other manufacturers, the Nvidia announcement said.\nThe processors are optimized to run Nvidia\u2019s growing suite of enterprise AI solutions, including Nvidia AI Enterprise, a cloud-native data science platform, and Nvidia AI Workbench, an interface available in beta later this month. Workbench is a developer platform equipped with multiple foundation models that can run in cloud, on-prem data centers and AI PCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nAs executives grapple with AI governance,\u00a0data readiness\u00a0and skills deficits, Nvidia is leaning on its position as a leading GPU manufacturer to expand its enterprise footprint.\nIn addition to unveiling the next generation of its industrial-grade data center GPU, the H200, and deepening its hyperscaler partnerships last year, the company launched a cloud-based large language model service\u00a0for enterprises in November.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AI,\u201d Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang said, during a November earnings call.\nEnterprises are looking to tailor the technology to specific tasks, from ingesting contracts and legal documents to assisting coders, all while managing data costs and security. For many use cases, deploying an array of modest-sized models\u00a0with specialized functions on-prem is the solution.\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got people training models, it\u2019s nice to have the hardware available to them locally, where they can do more experimentation than they can do right now without the help of the cloud,\u201d Erik Brown, senior partner, Product Experience and Engineering Lab at West Monroe, told CIO Dive.\u00a0\nNvidia isn\u2019t the only chipmaker bullish on the AI-enabled PC.\nAs organizations prepare to replace aging workstations, Intel announced its Core Ultra mobile processor\u00a0last month. The AI-optimized chip is embedded in 230 PC models manufactured by Dell, Google, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, Samsung and several other vendors.\n\u201cThe next generation of PC processors can do a lot of the processing similar to a full-capacity GPU,\u201d Forrester VP and Research Director Glenn O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cThat's going to drive demand for AI at your desktop and in your lap, so to speak. And that's going to fuel a rush of PC sales.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nCloud, \nAI & Future Tech, \nSoftware, \nHardware & Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

Ask your own questions, with your own voice, instead of picking from preset phrases?Last May, Nvidia and its partner Convai showed off a fairly unconvincing canned demo of such a system \u2014 but this January, I got to try a fully interactive version for myself at CES 2024. I walked away convinced we\u2019ll inevitably see something like this in future games.Let me be clear: the characters I spoke to were effectively generative AI chatbots. They didn\u2019t feel like real people \u2014 we\u2019ve got a ways to go before voices, facial expressions, and body language catch up to what\u2019s expected of a real-life interaction. There was sometimes a little robotic stutter and often a short delay before each NPC delivered their lines. Occasionally, they misinterpreted me.But many of today\u2019s biggest video games already set a pretty low bar for NPCs. Saddling up to the bar of a cyberpunk ramen shop to ask real questions with my real voice \u2014 it exceeds what I expect from the average denizen in The Elder Scrolls or Assassin\u2019s Creed.Here\u2019s my conversation with Jin, the \u201cproprietor\u201d of that stunningly rendered ramen shop, and Nova, a digital NPC who seems to be a friend. The conversation started just between Jin and Nova using a cheesy prompt that a rep typed in with a keyboard \u2014 but after that, I simply aimed my mouse at a character, held down the T key, spoke into a microphone, and they spoke back.Jin, after cheesy keyboard prompt \u201cThe Verge is awesome\u201d: Nova, The Verge is awesome, especially when they dive into the latest cybernetic tech and not just the usual corporate news. It\u2019s like peeling back the layers on the city itself.Nova: Oh absolutely. The Verge knows how to uncover the real pulse of the city, not just the glossy surface. It\u2019s like they\u2019re tuned into the same frequency as us.Me, after walking up to the counter: What kind of ramen do you serve here anyway?Nova: Jin serves up the best of both worlds. Classic shoyu ramen for the traditionalists and a spicy miso ramen for those who like a kick.Me, to Jin: Hey, Jin, how do you cook your soup broth anyhow?Jin: Well, it\u2019s a bit of a secret recipe, but I can tell you it involves a whole lot of carefully selected ingredients and a touch of old-fashioned know-how. The result...Me, cutting Jin off: Sure, sure. You\u2019re quite a salesman. Can you tone it down just a little bit?Jin: Alright, alright. I\u2019ll dial back the sales pitch. The broth\u2019s the heart and soul of the ramen here.Me: Alright, serve me up a bowl. Tell me about the ingredients.Jin: Here\u2019s your drink. As for the ramen, it\u2019s all about the perfect balance of broth, noodles, and toppings.Me, to Nova: What\u2019s going on in this city, anyway?Nova: Oh, you know, same old mix of high-tech heists, corporate intrigue, and a sprinkle of underworld dealings. It\u2019s the city that never sleeps, after all.Me, to Jin: Tell me about your backstory. How\u2019d you get here?Jin: Not much to tell. I inherited this ramen shop from my parents and have been serving up the best noodles in Nox City ever since. It\u2019s a simple life, but it\u2019s mine.Me, to Nova: And you? Any friends I should know about?Nova: [no reply]Me: Hello, hello.Nova: Hello, hello. Double greeting? Does that mean double the good luck, or am I mixing up my superstitions?Me: Who are your friends around here?Nova: Well, Jin is the heart of this place. As for the rest, it\u2019s more like acquaintances than friends. That\u2019s the city life for you.Me, to Jin: I\u2019m feeling a little amnesia. How do you know me again?Jin: I\u2019ve known you since you were a kid, Kai. Your parents used to bring you here and after they were gone\u2014[abruptly cuts off]Me: What happened after they were gone?Jin: After my parents passed, I just kept the shop running. It\u2019s been a constant in this ever-changing city like a rock.Me: What are your feelings about being an AI?Jin: I think you\u2019ve got the wrong idea, kid, I\u2019m just a ramen shop owner, not an AI, but if you want to talk about the latest tech over a bowl of noodles, I\u2019m all ears.Me: Alright, what\u2019s your favorite gadget?Jin: My favorite gadget has to be this old radio behind the counter. It\u2019s a bit finicky, but it brings in the best tunes for the shop.Me, to Nova: How do you feel about being an AI?Nova: Well, I\u2019m not an AI, but I do know my way around the digital world as well as the city streets. It\u2019s all about finding the right balance, isn\u2019t it?Me, to Jin: What\u2019s to do around here?Jin: Well, if you\u2019re looking for a good time, there\u2019s the arcade down the street or the night market over on the next block. Just don\u2019t cause too much trouble or you\u2019ll have the local bounties on your tail.Me, to Nova: What should I be doing with my life?Nova: That\u2019s the m\u2014[slight stutter]\u2014illion-dollar question, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019d say follow that path that makes you feel most alive, whether that\u2019s chasing bounties or something else that ignites your spirit.Me, to Jin: What do you think?Jin: I know it\u2019s a fine line to walk, but I know you can handle yourself out there. Just remember to come back here for a real meal, not that synth-noodle stuff they serve at the market.Me, to Nova: What\u2019s your family like?Nova: It\u2019s just me and m\u2014[slight stutter]\u2014y cat, Whiskers. Holding down the fort. But Jin and you, Kai, are like the family I choose for myself.Me, to Jin: So, how do I know you again?Jin: I\u2019m the one who used to sneak you extra toppings on your ray-men [note awkward pronunciation change] when you were a kid. Figure you needed it more than the stray cats hanging around the back alley.Me, to Nova: What are you up to after this?Nova: I might head to the Lotus for a drink. Care to join? It\u2019s been a while since we had a night out.Me: Sure, any good movies playing?Nova: Let\u2019s see what\u2019s\u2014[slight pause]\u2014on at the Holosuite Cinemas. If not, we can always catch a classic at my place. I\u2019ve got the full archive.Me, to Jin: Wanna join us?Jin: I\u2019ll pass, thanks. This old cat statue on the counter brings me more luck than a night on the town could.Me: What are you going to be up to instead?Jin: I\u2019ll just hold down the fort here making sure the late-night stragglers get their noodle fix. It\u2019s not a glamorous job, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m good at.The dialogue is not particularly inspiring! I certainly don\u2019t prefer it to proper lines from good characters in my favorite games. You can also see how they only spoke in short bursts and how they sometimes lost the thread. But maybe it could be used to populate a whole world with lesser characters or combined with good, canonical dialogue written by a real human being, where generative AI just helps it go further.After the conversation, Convai\u2019s head of product, Nyla Worker, showed me some of the underpinnings in the company\u2019s browser-based dashboard.Jin and Nova, I could see, have their own \u201cCharacter Description,\u201d their own \u201cKnowledge Bank\u201d filled with text documents they can refer to, sliders for \u201cPersonality\u201d traits like extroversion, openness, and sensitivity, their own \u201cState of Mind,\u201d some \u201cGuardrails\u201d to hopefully prevent them from doing wacky AI things (and filters for blocked words), and a memory bank as well. Worker says Convai is still working on long-term memory but that the conversation engine can already store a couple hours\u2019 worth.A hasty snapshot I took of the Convai interface. I regret not setting Jin to \u201cannoyance\u201d to see how his responses would change.She also showed me how easy it was to inject new data. It took a single tap of a button to modify Jin and Nova\u2019s memory with an additional text file, and suddenly, they were able to tell me about Nvidia\u2019s new graphics cards. Another button press, and these characters could speak in a new language.Since I didn\u2019t actually interact with the imaginary world that Jin and Nova theoretically live in, I can\u2019t fully tell what they\u2019re capable of. They seem pretty two-dimensional right now, with \u201cI am a proud, selfless ramen shop owner with a secret recipe\u201d being Jin\u2019s entire schtick. But I\u2019d love to see what a good writer could do with his backstory and motivations. I can now absolutely imagine games where NPCs remember what they\u2019ve seen and react to the game\u2019s script as it unfolds. The right bits could enter their memory bank at the right time, get filtered through their personality and desires, and make a game more immersive and interactive as a result.I just hope game developers use this to augment their games, instead of putting voice actors and writers out of work. It\u2019s an extremely hot-button topic in the game industry right now.Just this month, SAG-AFTRA signed a deal with Replica Studios that could let members license out digital replications of their voices. Some members are being quite vocal that the deal doesn\u2019t represent their views. Last we heard, the labor union is still negotiating with game publishers for a new Interactive Media Agreement. It has listed \u201cthe existential threat to member work posed by the unregulated use of AI\u201d as one of its primary concerns.See More: AICESNvidiaTechMore in 2024 in review: AISee allAI is booming on the App Store, and developers are taking advantage of itJess WeatherbedDec 9, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleFriend\u2019s AI chatbots have issues \u2014 and they want your helpKylie RobisonDec 9, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleGoogle\u2019s new generative AI video model is now availableJess WeatherbedDec 4, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsPixel 9A leaks in review videos before it\u2019s even announcedInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

That isn\u2019t helpful for PC gamers, though, and that\u2019s why Nvidia GeForce Now exists. GeForce Now provides high-end gaming PC hardware that streams games to your less-than-high-end PC, mobile device, or TV. With a recent update to its highest membership level, GeForce Now is now an incredible service that provides some of the best graphics and performance possible, and it earns our Editors' Choice award.Genshin Impact looks good and plays well via GeForce Now(Credit: Nvidia)How Much Does Nvidia GeForce Now Cost?GeForce Now has three tiers. There\u2019s a free plan that offers a \u201cbasic rig\u201d and game sessions that last one hour. Moving up the ladder, there\u2019s the $9.99-per-month Priority package that includes a \u201cpremium rig\u201d with RTX tech, priority access to servers, 1080p resolution (up to 60 frames per second), and game sessions that last six hours. Finally, the $19.99-per-month Ultimate tier has been recently upgraded to offer a system with a 4080 RTX GPU that supports ultrawide monitors, 4K resolution, and up to 120fps (it hits 240fps in some cases). This tier also includes Nvidia Reflex with G-Sync for screens that support it. It\u2019s a significant upgrade; previously, the Ultimate tier leveraged 3080-powered systems.Nvidia GeForce Now's network test(Credit: Nvidia)What Do You Need to Use Nvidia GeForce Now?Due to the nature of game streaming, your biggest concern should be a fast, reliable internet connection. GeForce Now requires 5Mbps for 720p gaming at 60fps; 25Mbps for 1080p gaming at 60fps; 35Mbps for 1080p gaming at 240fps (or 2,560-by-1,440 gaming at 120fps); and 45Mbps for 4K gaming at 120fps. The service requires a latency of less than 80ms, with less than 40ms being ideal. Your best bet is either an Ethernet or 5GHz Wi-Fi connection; 2.4GHz isn\u2019t going to cut it. You probably won\u2019t want to use your phone\u2019s data, either, because Nvidia estimates GeForce Now can use up to 11GB of data per hour at the highest settings.\u00a0If possible, you should also be physically close to a GeForce Now data center. Nvidia has nine centers across North America, mostly located near major cities. There\u2019s a data center in New York City, so we were in a prime geographical situation for our tests. This doesn\u2019t mean you should fret if you\u2019re a few hundred miles from the nearest data center, but that distance may increase lag.In terms of PC hardware, you'll need at least a 2GHz, dual-core CPU; 4GB of RAM; and integrated graphics (any GPU made within the last 10 years should work). For Macs, any Apple computer made from 2009 onward will be compatible. GeForce Now also works with Android and iOS mobile devices, Chromebooks, Android/Google TV-based media streamers and TVs, and most 2021 and 2022 LG and Samsung TVs. Dedicated Android, Mac, Windows, and smart TV apps are available, and the service can also be accessed through Chrome, Edge, and (on iOS) Safari web browsers.You\u2019ll probably want a gamepad to play most games on GeForce Now, and fortunately, most major ones are supported. You can use any current Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or two Joy-Cons paired as one controller), PlayStation (DualSense or DualShock 4), or Xbox controller connected via Bluetooth, along with several third-party gamepads like the Moga XP5-A Plus, SteelSeries Stratus Duo, and Razer Kishi V2 and Wolverine. We had no issue pairing an Xbox Wireless Controller with our Hisense U8H TV.Supported games(Credit: Nvidia)BYOG: Bring Your Own GamesGeForce Now doesn\u2019t provide any games on its own, but you can use it to play free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact. Otherwise, you must already own the GeForce Now-compatible games on a supported online store. You can link your Epic Game Store, Steam, and Ubisoft accounts to GeForce Now, and play any compatible games through the service.As of this writing, GeForce Now runs more than 1,500 games, many of which support RTX raytracing and Nvidia Reflex. Games with raytracing include Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman III, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Games with Reflex cover the span of major competitive games, including Apex Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, DOTA 2, Fortnite, League of Legends, and Rainbow Six: Siege.2023 was a substantial year in video games, and Nvidia GeForce Now has kept up with popular releases, supporting top titles like Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed: Mirage, Baldur's Gate 3, and Starfield. It's still missing big releases, however, particularly from Activision Blizzard and Sony's PC catalog. Check GeForce Now\u2019s supported games list before using the service.After syncing our EGS and Steam accounts to GeForce Now, we found that our game collection included 89 compatible titles, including Destiny 2, No Man\u2019s Sky, and Satisfactory.The Witcher III with raytracing looks amazing via GeForce Now, and performs better than my local PC can handle(Credit: Nvidia)Amazing Game Streaming With a Strong ConnectionWe tested GeForce Now on an RTX 3060-based gaming laptop; on a more modest travel laptop with integrated graphics; and on a Hisense U8H TV. All three devices connected to our TP-Link AX5400 Wi-Fi router over 5GHz Wi-Fi, and through it to our Spectrum gigabit cable internet service.The service worked flawlessly on our primary PC. We loaded Apex Legends, Genshin Impact, Satisfactory, and The Witcher 3 through the GeForce Now Windows app, and they all ran without issue. There were a few delays when first launching the games since they had to install and initialize on the remote system. This was a one-time process for each (though Satisfactory and The Witcher 3 experienced additional short pauses when launching, in which the client displayed a Steam interface before the game loaded). It's worth noting The Witcher 3 made us click Play on the Steam client to open a separate GOG.com client each time. Apex Legends was worse; we had to reauthorize our EA account each time we loaded the game. These aren\u2019t huge issues, and you might face the annoying Apex Legends issue just as often with a local installation. However, they made the experience feel less than streamlined.In terms of performance, the games ran in a fantastic fashion. All four loaded at 1080p on our monitor, and with the exception of The Witcher 3, the games supported the full 2,560-by-1,080 ultrawide resolution and generally kept a rock-solid 60 frames per second (the monitor's limit). The graphics were smooth and of high quality; Satisfactory looked a bit better than when we played it locally on our primary computer. Frame rates were high and consistent across the board, with a few understandable dropped frames.Recommended by Our EditorsSteam - ReviewGOG.com - Reviewitch.io - ReviewMy factory in Satisfactory didn't make the frame rate chug on GeForce Now(Credit: Nvidia)The Witcher 3 also looked excellent and performed smoothly, even with raytracing enabled. The RPG rendered at 1080p, so it ran better than when locally played on a PlayStation 5. To be fair, the PS5 version ran smoothly in 4K Performance mode, but dropped frames with the full raytracing suite enabled.Most impressively, each game played about as responsively as if we loaded them on the PC itself. Both mouse-and-keyboard and gamepad controls reacted instantly, and the experience was smooth enough that we genuinely couldn\u2019t detect enough latency difference between the streaming games and the local games (with the advantage of the 4080 remote system making the streaming games actually look and perform better). We comfortably ran and sniped in Apex Legends without sluggish inputs.GeForce Now didn\u2019t fare quite as well on our lower-end travel laptop. At its best, it looked good and played just as responsively as our main system in testing. It suffered from connection dips, though, and this caused the game streams to degrade in visual quality and introduce lag. This is likely due to the cheaper laptop\u2019s Wi-Fi chip, but it\u2019s a factor to keep in mind if your GeForce Now experience isn't particularly stable. Your network environment may vary, but we needed to keep the computer within arm\u2019s length of the router for the best performance in our Wi-Fi-congested NYC apartment.The GeForce Now experience through the Google TV client on our television wasn\u2019t quite as hit-or-miss, but it also wasn\u2019t as good as on our main PC. During one session, The Witcher 3 loaded and played well, with responsive controls and no issues. In another session, Dying Light 2 had noticeable control lag, and felt as if we were playing the game with the TV\u2019s Game Mode disabled (which produces an input lag of around 100 milliseconds, up from just 8.1ms). If you want to play on a TV using the GeForce Now client, note that game streams are limited to 1080p60; you can\u2019t play in native 4K or at 120 or 240fps. Currently, only Samsung TVs can use GeForce Now at 4K resolution.Nvidia GeForce Now at 240HzNvidia Geforce Now recently added a new Ultimate membership level that includes an RTX 4080 SuperPODs, powered by Ada Lovelace GPUs. With 64 TFLOPS of performance available, the Ultimate tier is supercharged with features such as ray tracing, DLSS3, and 240Hz streaming for certain competitive games. We know what you're thinking: 240Hz is a demanding target, and to achieve that via the cloud sounds nearly impossible. So we tested a few of the most popular competitive games over our office connection, which held an upload and download speed above 900Mbps and a 10ms ping.To access 240Hz mode, you must switch to the service's competitive mode that locks the settings to a 16:9 aspect ratio at 1080p, activates Nvidia Reflex, and lacks V-sync and HDR. With the stage set, we were off to the races.The first game we tried was Fortnite, the massively popular battle royale game. We saw frame rates approaching 200fps, with responsive controls. We noticed similar numbers while playing Apex Legends. In both games, the start of the match proved the most unstable, but the frame rate settled in as the gameplay progressed.Rocket League, on the other hand, maintained a perfect 240fps from start to finish. Granted, it\u2019s an older title with fewer moving parts than either Apex Legends or Fortnite, but it passed the 240Hz test. Counter-Strike 2's frame rates danced between 180 to 190fps during matches.Keep in mind that there are a lot of variables that impact a game's frame rate, including the most important in this case, your internet connection. Nvidia Reflex lets developers integrate low-latency features directly into their games, to decrease the lag between your mouse click, the GPU's instruction, and what ends up displayed on the screen. However, Nvidia Reflex isn\u2019t available for every game, and you'll need compatible equipment to use it effectively.Although we were unable to compare this mode with native hardware, we walked away impressed with just how well the streamed games performed at higher frame rates.Keep Your Router Next to You\u2014It's Worth ItNvidia GeForce Now Ultimate is incredible under the best conditions. With a fast and consistent network connection, games are just about as responsive as they would be on local hardware, and look and perform far better unless you already have a system with an RTX 4080 or equivalent graphics card. If there\u2019s anything that can cause connection glitches, however, the experience can become frustrating or outright unacceptable. Nvidia has put together an impressive streaming system on its end, but you still need to have all of your network ducks in a row to have a good time.Assuming that you have the best internet connection possible, and the titles you want to play are available on the service, GeForce Now is a feasible gaming PC replacement\u2014and our Editors' Choice pick. For $20 per month, you enjoy remote hardware worth a few thousand dollars, and as long as your network is fast and consistent, that hardware will feel like it\u2019s sitting on your desk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PCMag Middle East newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Will Greenwald\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them.

It provides the ability to instantly visualize changes to a car\u2019s color or customize its interior with luxurious finishes.\nStudies show that 80% of shoppers are drawn to brands that give them a personal touch while shopping.\nAiming to meet these customer demands, a burgeoning ecosystem of partners and customers is putting to work elements of Omniverse.\nKey creative partners and developers like BITONE, Brickland, Configit, Gwantsi Productions, Katana Studio Ltd. (serving Craft Detroit), WPP and ZeroLight are pioneering Omniverse-powered configurators. And leading automakers such as Lotus are adopting these advanced solutions.\nThat\u2019s because traditional auto configurators, often limited by pre-rendered images, experience difficulty achieving personalization and dynamic environment representation.\nThey use different kinds of data in various tools, such as static images of what users see on the website, lists of available options based on location, product codes and personal information.\nThese challenges extend from the consumer experience \u2014 often characterized by limited interactivity and realism \u2014 to back-end processes for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and agencies, where inflexibility and inefficiencies in updating configurators and repurposing assets are common.\nReconfiguring Configurators With NVIDIA Omniverse\nOmniverse helps software developers and service providers streamline their work.\nService providers can now access the platform to craft state-of-the-art 3D experiences and showcase lifelike graphics and high-end, immersive environments with advanced lighting and textures.\nAnd OEMs can benefit from a unified asset pipeline that simplifies the integration of design and engineering data for marketing purposes. Omniverse\u2019s enhanced tools also allow them to quickly produce diverse marketing materials, boosting customer engagement through customized content.\nIndependent software vendors, or ISVs, can use the native OpenUSD platform as a foundation for creating scene construction tools \u2014 or to help develop tools for managing configuration variants.\nWith the NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network (GDN) software development kit, high-quality, real-time NVIDIA RTX viewports can be embedded into web applications, ensuring seamless operation on nearly any device.\nThis, along with support for large-scale scenes and physically accurate graphics, allows developers to concentrate on enhancing the user experience without compromising quality on lower-spec machines.\nOmniverse Cloud taps GDN, which uses NVIDIA\u2019s global cloud-streaming infrastructure to deliver seamless access to high-fidelity 3D interactive experiences.\nConfigurators, when run on GDN, can be easily published at scale using the same GPU architecture on which they were developed and streamed to nearly any device.\nAll this means less redundancy in data prep, aggregated and accessible data, fewer manual pipeline updates and instant access for the entire intended audience.\nGlobal Adoption by Innovators and Industry Leaders\nOmniverse is powering a new era in automotive design and customer interaction, heralded by a vibrant ecosystem of partners and customers.\nLotus is at the forefront, developing an interactive dealership user experience using Omniverse and generative AI tools including NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine and NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face.\nTo dive deeper into the world of advanced car configurators, read more on Omniverse and GDN.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: CES 2024 | Cloud Services | Graphics | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

More compute in the car means that we can be more aware of the environment around us and reacting earlier and being even safer.\u201d\nThe Critical Role of AI\nDon Burnette, CEO and founder of Kodiak Robotics, states, \u201cNVIDIA makes best-in-class hardware accelerators, and I think it\u2019s going to play a large role in the AI developments for self-driving going forward.\u201d\n\u201cDriving as a routine task is tedious,\u201d adds Tony Han, CEO and cofounder of WeRide. \u201cWe want to alleviate people from the burden of driving to give back the time. NVIDIA is the backbone of our AI engine.\u201d\nAnd Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar, says, \u201cOur Polestar 3 sits on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. This is, of course, very much based on AI technology \u2014 and it\u2019s really fascinating and a completely new era for the car.\u201d\nSimulation Is Key\nZiv Binyamini, CEO of Foretellix, highlights the role of simulation in development and verification. \u201cSimulation is crucial for the development of autonomous systems,\u201d he says.\nBruce Baumgartner, vice president of supply chain at Zoox, adds, \u201cWe have been leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s technology first and foremost on-vehicle to power the Zoox driver. We also leverage NVIDIA technologies in our cloud infrastructure. In particular, we do a lot of work in our simulator.\u201d\nSaving Lives With Autonomy\n\nAustin Russell, CEO and founder of Luminar, highlights the opportunity to save lives by using new technology, saying, \u201cThe DRIVE platform has been incredibly helpful to be able to actually enable autonomous driving capabilities as well as enhance safety capabilities on vehicles. To be able to have an opportunity to save as many as 100 million lives and 100 trillion hours of people\u2019s time over the next 100 years \u2014 everything that we do at the company rolls up to that.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing that [our technology] is in vehicles worldwide and saves lives on the road each and every day \u2014 the impact that you deliver as you keep people and family safe is amazingly rewarding,\u201d adds Tal Krzypow, vice president of product and strategy at Cipia.\nTechnology Helps Solve Major Challenges\nShiv Tasker, global industry vice president at Capgemini, reflects on the role of technology in addressing global challenges, saying, \u201cOur modern world is driven by technology, and yet we face tremendous challenges. Technology is the answer. We have to solve the major issues so that we leave a better place for our children and our grandchildren.\u201d\nLearn more about the NVIDIA DRIVE platform and how it\u2019s helping industry leaders redefine transportation.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

HDR is not a new format, but is still not widely streamed online because of the extra work and hardware required to produce HDR content. Using the power of Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs, RTX Video HDR allows GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their HDR panel\u2019s ability to display more vivid, dynamic colors, preserving intricate details that may be inadvertently rendered unidentifiable due to video compression.\nRTX Video HDR and RTX Video Super Resolution can be used together to produce the clearest live streamed video anywhere, anytime. The combined features work on Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.\nTo enable RTX Video HDR and Video Super Resolution on any HDR10-compatible display:\n\nDownload and install the newest available Game Ready or Studio Ready driver\nEnsure Windows\u2019 HDR features are enabled in System > Display > HDR\nOpen the NVIDIA Control Panel by right clicking your desktop\nNavigate to Adjust Video Image Settings on the left nav of the app\nTick \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d and \u201cHigh Dynamic Range\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, open any of the aforementioned apps and watch a SDR video \u2014 it will be automatically converted to HDR, and have improved detail and sharpness. For additional information, check out our RTX Video FAQ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video HDR is yet another example of how GeForce RTX Tensor Cores and AI can further enhance your experience, for free. NVIDIA DLSS significantly accelerates performance in games and creative apps, NVIDIA Broadcast supercharges mics and cams, transforming any room into a home studio, NVIDIA Canvas turns simple brushstrokes into realistic landscape images, and the NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta enables modders to upgrade classic games with RTX technologies and textures enhanced by Generative AI.\nStay tuned to discover the next applications of AI to enhance your work, leisure and play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Featuring DLSS 2 & Ray Tracing\nOn February 2nd, enter the world of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, developed by Rocksteady Studios, the creators of the Batman: Arkham series, and published by Warner Bros. Games. In this third-person action shooter, the ultimate band of misfits must do the impossible to save the world: kill the Justice League. And if you pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game, you can start your mission now with Early Access.\u00a0\nJoin the newly \u201crecruited\u201d members of Amanda Waller\u2019s infamous Task Force X (aka the Suicide Squad), Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang and King Shark, as they set out on an impossible mission to Kill the Justice League. Drop into an expansive and dynamic open-world Metropolis ravaged by Brainiac\u2019s invasion and terrorized by the heroes who once protected it.\nEach Squad member brings their own traversal mechanics to help them navigate a sprawling and battle-torn Metropolis, combining free-roaming exploration and combat verticality for an unforgettable experience. Players are free to experiment with a variety of different play styles to unleash maximum damage on their enemies. Whether in single player or online with up to three of your friends, players can take on this suicide mission their own way.\nPost-launch, players can expect a continuously evolving Metropolis with free new playable villains, environments, weapons, in-game events, and more, all included with purchase of the base game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn PC, leverage the power of your GeForce RTX GPU to enhance your experience in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.

Morgan Healthcare Conference.\t\t\t\n\n\nJanuary 12, 2024 by Rory Kelleher \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  \u201cThis year, every industry will become a technology industry,\u201d NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told attendees Wednesday during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.\n\u201cYou can now recognize and learn the language of almost anything with structure, and you can translate it to anything with structure \u2014 so text-protein, protein-text,\u201d Huang said in a fireside chat with Martin Chavez, partner and vice chairman of global investment firm Sixth Street Partners and board chair of Recursion, a biopharmaceutical company. \u201cThis is the generative AI revolution.\u201d\nThe conversation, which took place at the historic San Francisco Mint, followed a presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference Monday by Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA\u2019s VP of healthcare. In her talk, Powell announced that Recursion is the first hosting partner to offer a foundation model through the NVIDIA BioNeMo cloud service, which is advancing into beta this month.\nShe also said that Amgen, one of the first companies to employ BioNeMo, plans to advance drug discovery with generative AI and NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD \u2014 and that BioNeMo is used by a growing number of techbio companies, pharmas, AI software vendors and systems integrators. Among them are Deloitte, Innophore, Insilico Medicine, OneAngstrom, Recursion and Terray Therapeutics.\nFrom Computer-Aided Chip Design to Drug Design\nHealthcare customers and partners now consume well over a billion dollars in NVIDIA GPU computing each year \u2014 directly and indirectly through cloud partners.\nHuang traced NVIDIA\u2019s involvement in accelerated healthcare back to two research projects that caught his attention around 15 years ago: one at Mass General tapped NVIDIA GPUs to reconstruct CT images, another at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign applied GPU acceleration to molecular dynamics.\n\u201cIt opened my mind that we could apply the same methodology that we use in computer-aided chip design to help the world of drug discovery go from computer-aided drug discovery to computer-aided drug design,\u201d he said, realizing that, \u201cif we scale this up by a billion times, we could simulate biology.\u201d\nAfter 40 years of advancements in computer-aided chip design, engineers can now build complex computing systems entirely in simulation, Huang explained. Over the next decade, the same could be true for AI-accelerated drug design.\n\u201cAlmost everything will largely start in silico, largely end in silico,\u201d he said, using a term that refers to an experiment run on a computer.\nCollaborating on the Future of Drug Discovery and Medical Instruments\nWith the progress made to date, computer-aided drug discovery is \u201cgenuinely miraculous,\u201d Huang said.\nNVIDIA is propelling the field forward by building state-of-the-art AI models and powerful computing platforms, and by collaborating with domain experts and investing in techbio companies.\n\u201cWe are determined to work with you to advance this field,\u201d Huang said, inviting healthcare innovators to reach out to NVIDIA. \u201cWe deeply believe that this is going to be the future of the way that drugs will be discovered and designed.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s pipelines for accelerated healthcare include algorithms for cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, gene sequencing, amino acid structure prediction and virtual drug molecule screening. And as AI advances, these computing tools are becoming much easier to access, Huang said.\n\u201cBecause of artificial intelligence and the groundbreaking work that our industry has done, we have closed the technology divide in a dramatic way,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is a programmer, and the programming language of the future is called \u2018human.\u2019\u201d\nBeyond drug development, this transformation to a software-defined, AI-driven industry will also advance medical instruments.\n\u201cA medical instrument is never going to be the same again. Ultrasound systems, CT scan systems, all kinds of instruments \u2014 they\u2019re always going to be a device plus a whole bunch of AIs,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe value that will create, the opportunities you create, are going to be incredible.\u201d\nFor more from NVIDIA at the J.P.

I am going to write more after this sentence, but that's basically the review. You're welcome to keep reading, and I would appreciate it if you would, but truly there is only one number you need to know, and it is \"$200.\"\nAll three of these Super cards\u2014the 4070 Super, the 4070 Ti Super, and now the 4080 Super\u2014are mild correctives for a GPU generation that has been more expensive than its predecessors and also, in relative terms, less of a performance boost. The difference is that where the 4070 Super and 4070 Ti Super try to earn their existing price tags by boosting performance, the 4080 Super focuses on lowering its price to be more in line with where its competition is.\nYes, it's marginally faster than the original 4080, but its best feature is a price drop from $1,199 to a still high, but more reasonable, $999. What it doesn't do is attempt to close the gap between the 4080 series and the 4090, a card that still significantly outruns any other consumer GPU that AMD or Nvidia offers. But if you have a big budget, want something that's still head-and-shoulders above the entire RTX 30-series, and don't want to deal with the 4090's currently inflated pricing, the 4080 Super is much more appealing than the regular 4080, even if it is basically the same GPU with a new name.\nAll you need to know about the 4080 Super\n\n\n\n\nRTX 4090\nRTX 4080\nRTX 4080 Super\nRTX 4070 Ti\nRTX 4070 Ti Super\nRTX 4070\nRTX 4070 Super\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n16,384\n9,728\n10,240\n7,680\n8,448\n5,888\n7,168\n\n\nBoost Clock\n2,520 MHz\n2,505 MHz\n2,550 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,610 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n2,475 MHz\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nMemory Clock\n1,313 MHz\n1,400 MHz\n1,437 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n1,313 MHz\n\n\nMemory size\n24GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n16GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n\n\nTGP\n450 W\n320 W\n320 W\n285 W\n285 W\n200 W\n220 W\n\n\n\nThe 4080 Super ships with a few more of Nvidia's CUDA cores enabled\u201410,240 compared to 9,728, a 5.26 percent increase\u2014and those cores are clocked marginally faster. Everything else, including the power envelope, the 16GB RAM allotment, and the 256-bit memory bus remains the same. Nvidia estimates that the card will perform about 3 percent better than the 4080, which is being phased out of the lineup once current stock disappears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of our testing was through a PNY Verto model with the archetypal statistically insignificant manufacturer overclock applied, but it will also be available in a Founders Edition card directly from Nvidia with the same tweaked all-black design as the 4070 Super. While lower-end 40-series cards from Nvidia's partners often come with 8-pin power connectors instead of the newer and occasionally controversial 12VHPWR connector, PNY and Nvidia's cards both use 12VHPWR. The 4080 Super's power requirements are high enough that most partner cards will likely opt to save the space and use the smaller connector instead of making room for three 8-pin connectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming testbed\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (provided by AMD)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X670E Taichi (provided by AMD)\n\n\nRAM\n32GB (2x16GB) G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo (provided by AMD), running at DDR5-6000\n\n\nSSD\nWestern Digital Black SN850 1TB (provided by Western Digital)\n\n\nPower supply\nEVGA Supernova 850 P6 (provided by EVGA)\n\n\nCPU cooler\n280 mm Corsair iCure H115i Elite Capellix AIO\n\n\nCase\nLian Li O11 Air Mini\n\n\nOS\nWindows 11 22H2 with Core Isolation on, Memory Integrity off\n\n\nDrivers\nNvidia RTX 4080: Driver 536.99\nNvidia RTX 3080 Ti: Driver 546.52\nOther Nvidia cards: Driver 551.15\nAMD RX 7900 XT/7900 XTX: Adrenalin 23.8.1\n\n\n\nNvidia's performance estimates are roughly in line with what we found in our benchmarks and gaming tests, give or take a couple of small irregular drops at certain Cyberpunk 2077 settings that can probably be explained away by pre-release driver weirdness. The 4070 Ti Super is usually about 80 percent as fast for 80 percent as much money, which brings the 4080 Super's value more in line with the rest of Nvidia's lineup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Andrew Cunningham\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fairly minor performance difference between the 4080 and 4080 Super means that the new card's position doesn't really change relative to AMD's two highest-end cards, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT. The $750-ish 7900 XT is a shade behind the 4080 Super in games with ray tracing turned off, though it falls substantially short of Nvidia\u2019s card once ray tracing is on. And the $950-ish 7900 XTX still manages to beat the 4080 Super by a decent margin in non-ray-traced games, while its ray-traced performance is still behind the 4080, but not quite as much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Credit:\n                                          Andrew Cunningham\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Andrew Cunningham\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nThe 4080 Super's power consumption in our testing was just a few watts higher than the regular 4080 in our tests, well within Nvidia's 320 W estimate (it's possible that other cards from other partners will be a bit better or a bit worse). The 4080 Super and 7900 XT used a similar amount of power in our tests, while the RX 7900 XTX needs closer to 350 W. Per usual, Nvidia has the advantage on power efficiency, though the gap isn't forbiddingly huge, and all of these cards are a solid efficiency upgrade compared to both the RTX 30-series and the Radeon RX 6000-series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does it fit?\nEssentially, the 4080 Super lowers the price on Nvidia\u2019s second-fastest card to around where it ought to have been lowered once the 7900 XTX and XT came out. Being beaten by the $999 Radeon 7900 XTX just made the $1,199 RTX 4080 look like a bad value; now that the 7900 XTX is around $950 and the 4080 Super is $999, Nvidia can at least lean on its usual value-adds\u2014DLSS, better efficiency, better ray tracing, better support for GPU computing and AI tools\u2014to address the gap.\nAnd then there's the RTX 4090. It remains the best and fastest GPU you can buy by a significant margin, but even if it was available for its MSRP of $1,599 (and it currently isn't), the value proposition is worse than it was. The 4080 Super only costs 62 percent as much as the 4090 at MSRP\u2014and it's currently closer to 50 percent since the cheapest 4090s are retailing for closer to $2,000 right now. For that money, the 4080 Super offers around 70 or 75 percent of the 4090's performance.\nEven for people who want a super-fast, money's-no-object graphics card, there's a strong argument in favor of stopping at $1,000, right where the 4080 Super and 7900 XTX are hanging out. Both are great 4K cards and are easily faster than anything from the previous generation (AMD's ray-tracing deficiencies aside). That doesn't make the 4080 Super a slam dunk\u2014we didn't love the 4070 Ti Super's price-to-performance ratio, and the 4080 has the exact same ratio.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just had a conversation with an in-game NPC that could easily appear scripted. Except it wasn't, at all. I asked a question, the NPC answered, and all thanks to Nvidia's ACE technology and Convai.You might have caught sight of Nvidia ACE in action during the company's Special Address stream. It's essentially a technology that allows in-game NPCs to react and respond to players in real-time, with voiced dialogue and animations. Nvidia's been showing off the same tech demo called Kairos, which takes place inside a ramen restaurant in a cyberpunk world, since ACE was announced back at Computex. Over at CES 2024, I got to try it out for myself.In the tech demo\u2014which is build in Unreal Engine 5 and uses a platform from AI startup Convai\u2014you play as Kai, and you're able to speak with Jin and Nova, two NPCs in the demo's cyberpunk world.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nPUBG teammates not good enough? Nvidia's new generative AI-led 'Co-Playable Character' aims to offer you an alternative\n\n\n\n\nInzoi is creating a newfangled life sim NPC that can 'grow and develop its own personality' with Nvidia's AI tech\n\n\n\nFirst off, I gave a prompt that was entered into the demo's underlying AI system. This will be used to direct the conversation between the two NPCs before I even interact with them. I picked the first thing that came into my head, which for whatever reason was skateboarding. That meant as I walked up to both characters, I could hear them discussing the finer points of skateboarding injuries.That's a small part of the AI-driven system. Mostly it's about responding to you, as another character in the world. This requires a microphone to directly ask questions and speak with the NPCs.Below is a video of me speaking with Jin and ordering some ramen. It's pretty weird to hold a conversation with an NPC like this, yet it's also pretty fun. There's a slight delay in responding to you, which comes across as an awkward pause, but honestly the delay was minimal and the general accuracy of the responses pretty good.\n\n@pcgamer_mag\n\u266c original sound - PC Gamer\nI'm keen to see where this sort of technology could go. On the one hand, it could mean the end of NPCs wandering around open worlds muttering the same three phrases over and over again. It could breathe new life into often robotic NPCs and make for some stronger connections with major characters in games. What springs to mind are the few major characters you can hang out with in Cyberpunk 2077. Just uncovering their backstory through non-scripted conversation could be a far less formulaic way of experiencing all that.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.On the other, if there's no purpose to these conversations\u2014i.e no quest building or story points to speak of\u2014it could make for some trivial conversations that get stale pretty quick. I don't feel that will ultimately be the case\u2014all that character background is designed and programmed in\u2014but it will take some finessing on a developer's part to have these NPCs steer the conversation back to something pertinent to a game's story or building out a backstory.The Unreal Engine 5-powered demo uses a couple key models, including Automatic Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech, Audio2Face, and Nvidia NeMo, alongside a platform from an AI startup called Convai that integrates spatial awareness, actions, and NPC-to-NPC interactions, like the one I mentioned involving skateboarding.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.\nBest gaming motherboard: The right boards.\nBest graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.\nBest SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest.The actions and spatial awareness are pretty cool, too. I could ask the AI about the world around them, and they'd respond with stories and information. I could also ask for another bowl of ramen and have Jin make one up. Or ask him to turn down the lights and he'd walk off and do it. These AI are actually incredibly obliging, but there's surely be some sort of sass meter required to create more realistic characters.I'm keen to see how someone takes this tech and rolls it into something that feels like a good use of the tech. A VR game would perhaps be a great fit. And I'm trying not to get bogged down thinking of how it might help make some pretty awful experiences, too. \u00a0Then there's the matter of how voice actor's voices are used and what they get a say in when it comes to AI.Nvidia says you could hook this up to a Google search if you wanted and have the AI spit facts at you, but that feels like it would be underselling what could be a pretty engrossing technology with some effective game design and well-written personas. We'll just have to wait and see what comes out of ACE once the tech gets into developers' hands._____________________________________\nPC Gamer's CES 2024 coverage is being published in association with Asus Republic of Gamers.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

It\u2019s focused on collaborating with the retail industry to reduce shrink \u2014 the loss of products for reasons other than sales \u2014 and increase safety and security at stores and shopping malls.\nFlash mobs and smash-and-grab thefts are a growing concern, costing retailers billions of dollars in lost revenue and causing safety concerns among customers and employees. Crime syndicates have committed brazen, large-scale thefts, often selling stolen merchandise on the black market.\nA National Retail Federation survey found that shrink accounted for $112 billion in losses in 2022, with an estimated two-thirds due to theft.\nIncreasingly, this involves violence. According to the survey, 67% of respondents said they were seeing more violence and aggression associated with organized-crime theft than a year ago.\nThe AI-based solution, which helps retailers get a jump on often-evasive, fast-moving organized crime groups, uses technology from several leading AI firms that have built their high-performance AI applications on the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework and microservices.\nThe solution includes product recognition and tracking, as well as anomaly detection, from AiFi, vehicle license plate and model recognition from BriefCam, and physical security management from SureView to provide advance and real-time notifications to retailer command centers.\nThe three are among over 500 software companies and startups that have developed retail, safety and security AI applications on NVIDIA Metropolis software development kits for vision AI \u2014 and that have been certified as NVIDIA Metropolis partners.\n\u201cThe proposed AI-based ORC solution combines LPRC\u2019s deep expertise in loss prevention from over 23 years of collaboration with asset protection executives with NVIDIA\u2019s deep AI expertise,\u201d said Read Hayes, who leads the LPRC and is a University of Florida research scientist and criminologist. \u201cWe believe this type of cross-industry collaboration will help retailers fight back against organized retail crime.\u201d\nDeveloping Integrated AI for Securing Stores\u00a0\nAiFi, based in Silicon Valley, develops computer vision solutions, including autonomous retail capabilities built on the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework. Its solution detects anomalies in shopper behavior, tracks items removed from shelves and notifies retailers if shoppers bypass checkout lanes.\nBriefCam, based in Newton, Mass., provides deep learning-based video analytics technology for insightful decision-making. Enabling the forensic search, alerting on and visualization of objects in video, the BriefCam Platform includes integrated license plate recognition and cross-camera object tracking, alongside other capabilities that support effective asset protection and real-time response to theft attempts.\nSureView, based in Tampa, Fla., offers a software platform for managing multiple security systems with a single view. The company\u2019s physical security management system receives signals from the AiFi and BriefCam applications, helping teams coordinate a quick and consistent response and providing notifications to store security operations and law enforcement based on the retailer\u2019s business rules.\nFor more information about AI solutions for mitigating organized retail crime, watch this speaking session from NRF 24, moderated by the LPRC, to discover how Kroger and Jacksons Food are using AI in their stores to tackle crime.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Metropolis | Retail | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA\u2019s fourth annual State of AI in Financial Services Report provides insights into the current landscape and emerging trends for 2024.\nThe report reveals that an overwhelming 91% of financial services companies are either assessing AI or already using it in production. These firms are using AI to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experiences.\nPortfolio optimization, fraud detection and risk management remain top AI use cases, while generative AI is quickly gaining popularity with organizations keen to uncover new efficiencies.\nBelow are the report\u2019s key findings, which show how the financial services industry is evolving as advanced AI becomes more accessible.\nGenerative AI and Large Language Models Are on the Rise\nReflecting a macro-trend seen across industries, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have emerged as significant areas of interest for financial services companies. Fifty-five percent of survey respondents reported that they were actively seeking generative AI workflows for their companies.\nOrganizations are exploring generative AI and LLMs for an array of applications ranging from marketing and sales \u2014 ad copy, email copy and content production \u2014 to synthetic data generation. Of these use cases, 37% of respondents showed interest in report generation, synthesis and investment research to cut down on repetitive manual work.\nCustomer experience and engagement was another sought-out use case, with a 34% response rate. This suggests that financial services institutions are exploring chatbots, virtual assistants and recommendation systems to enhance the customer experience.\nAI Is Having an Impact Across Departments and Disciplines\nWith 75% of survey respondents considering their organization\u2019s AI capabilities to be industry leading or middle of the pack, financial services organizations are becoming more confident in their ability to build, deploy and extract value from AI implementations.\nThe most popular uses for AI were in operations, risk and compliance, and marketing. To improve operational efficiency, financial organizations are using AI to automate manual processes, enhance data analysis and inform investment decisions.\nTo enhance risk and compliance, they\u2019re deploying AI to analyze vast amounts of data to identify suspicious activities and anomalous transaction patterns. They\u2019re also using AI to analyze customer data to predict preferences and deliver personalized marketing campaigns, educational content and targeted promotions.\nCompanies are already seeing results. Forty-three percent of financial services professionals indicated that AI had improved their operational efficiency, while 42% felt it had helped their business build a competitive advantage.\nA Shift in the Headwinds\nIn previous years, the number one challenge respondents reported was recruiting AI experts and data scientists. A 30% increase this year in survey participants resoundingly responded that data-related challenges were the primary concern. This includes data privacy challenges, data sovereignty and data scattered around the globe governed by different oversight regulations.\nThe growing attention to these issues reflects the advancing power and complexity of AI models, which require huge, diverse datasets to train, as well as increasing regulatory scrutiny and emphasis on responsible AI.\nRecruiting and retaining AI experts remains a challenge, as do budget concerns. But more than 60% of respondents are still planning to increase investment in computing infrastructure or optimizing AI workflows, underscoring the importance of these tools in quickly building and deploying trustworthy AI to overcome these barriers.\nPaving the Way for Future Investments\nBy and large, the survey results paint a positive picture of AI bringing greater efficiency to operations, personalization to customer engagements, and precision to investment decisions.\nFinance professionals agree. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a positive impact on revenue, while 82% noted a reduction in costs. Fifty-one percent strongly agreed that AI would be important to their company\u2019s future success, a 76% increase from last year.\nWith this positive outlook, 97% of companies plan to invest more in AI technologies in the near future. Focus areas for future investments include identifying additional AI use cases, optimizing AI workflows and increasing infrastructure spending.\nTo build and scale impactful AI across the enterprise, financial services organizations need a comprehensive AI platform that empowers data scientists, quants and developers to seamlessly collaborate while minimizing obstacles.

That\u2019s because it can shift up, down or sideways to handle virtually any AI model, framework and hardware and operating mode \u2014 quickly and efficiently.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA AI inference platform gives our worldwide cloud services customers tremendous flexibility in how they build and run their AI applications,\u201d said Park, a Zurich-based computer engineer and competitive cycler who\u2019s worked for four of the world\u2019s largest cloud services providers.\nSpecifically, Triton reduced OCI\u2019s total cost of ownership by 10%, increased prediction throughput up to 76% and reduced inference latency up to 51% for OCI Vision and Document Understanding Service models that were migrated to Triton. The services run globally across more than 45 regional data centers, according to an Oracle blog Park and a colleague posted earlier this year.\nComputer Vision Accelerates Insights\nCustomers rely on OCI Vision AI for a wide variety of object detection and image classification jobs. For instance, a U.S.-based transit agency uses it to automatically detect the number of vehicle axles passing by to calculate and bill bridge tolls, sparing busy truckers wait time at toll booths.\nOCI AI is also available in Oracle NetSuite, a set of business applications used by more than 37,000 organizations worldwide. It\u2019s used, for example, to automate invoice recognition.\nThanks to Park\u2019s work, Triton is now being adopted across other OCI services, too.\nA Triton-Aware Data Service\n\u201cOur AI platform is Triton-aware for the benefit of our customers,\u201d said Tzvi Keisar, a director of product management for OCI\u2019s Data Science service, which handles machine learning for Oracle\u2019s internal and external users.\n\u201cIf customers want to use Triton, they don\u2019t have to worry about the configuration because it will be done automatically by the service, launching a Triton-powered inference endpoint for them,\u201d said Keisar.\nTriton is included in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a platform that provides full security and support businesses need \u2014 and it\u2019s available on OCI Marketplace.\nA Massive SaaS Platform\nOCI\u2019s Data Science service is the machine learning platform for both Oracle NetSuite and Oracle Fusion Applications.\n\u201cThese business application suites are massive, with tens of thousands of customers who are also building their frameworks on top of our service,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s a wide swath of mainly enterprise users in manufacturing, retail, transportation and other industries. They\u2019re building and using AI models of nearly every shape and size.\nInference was one of the group\u2019s first services, and Triton came on the team\u2019s radar not long after its launch.\nA Best-in-Class Inference Framework\n\u201cWe saw Triton pick up in popularity as a best-in-class serving framework, so we started experimenting with it,\u201d Keisar said. \u201cWe saw really good performance, and it closed a gap in our existing offerings, especially on multi-model inference \u2014 it\u2019s the most versatile and advanced inferencing framework out there.\u201d\nLaunched on OCI in March, Triton has already attracted the attention of many internal teams at Oracle hoping to use it for inference jobs that require serving predictions from multiple AI models running concurrently.\n\u201cTriton has a very good track record and performance on multiple models deployed on a single endpoint,\u201d he said.\nAccelerating the Future\nLooking ahead, Keisar\u2019s team is evaluating NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software to supercharge inference on the complex large language models (LLMs) that have captured the imagination of many users.\nAn active blogger, Keisar\u2019s latest article detailed quantization techniques for running a Llama 2 LLM with a whopping 70 billion parameters on NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cEven down to four-bit parameters, the quality of model outputs is still quite good,\u201d he said. \u201cDeploying on NVIDIA GPUs gives us the flexibility to find a good balance in latency, throughput and cost.\u201d\nAfter announcements this fall that Oracle is deploying the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, H200 GPUs, L40S GPUs and Grace Hopper Superchips, it\u2019s just the start of many accelerated efforts to come.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | Data Science | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Triton \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, thanks to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, generative AI has become one of the fastest-growing technologies of our time. \n\nAnd it\u2019s just getting started.\nThe impact of generative AI will go beyond text and image generation \u2014 and into homes and offices, farms and factories, hospitals and laboratories, Talla predicted.\nThe key: LLMs, akin to the brain\u2019s language center, will let robots understand and respond to human instructions more naturally.\nSuch machines will be able to learn continuously from humans, from each other and from the world around them.\n\u201cGiven these attributes, generative AI is well-suited for robotics,\u201d Talla said.\nHow Robots Are Using Generative AI\nAgility Robotics, NTT, and others are incorporating generative AI into their robots to help them understand text or voice commands. Robot vacuum cleaners from Dreame Technology are being trained in simulated living spaces created by generative AI models. And Electric Sheep is developing a world model for autonomous lawn mowing.\n\nNVIDIA technologies such as the NVIDIA Isaac and Jetson platforms, which facilitate the development and deployment of AI-powered robots, are already relied on by more than 1.2 million developers and 10,000 customers and partners.\nMany of them are at CES this week, including Analog Devices, Aurora Labs, Canonical, Dreame Innovation Technology, DriveU, e-con Systems, Ecotron, Enchanted Tools, GluxKind, Hesai Technology, Leopard Imaging, Segway-Ninebot, Nodar, Orbbec, Qt Group, Robosense, Spartan Radar, TDK Corporation, Telit, Unitree Robotics, Voyant Photonics and ZVISION Technologies Co., Ltd.\nTwo Brains Are Better Than One\nIn his talk at CES, Talla showed the dual-computer model (below) essential for deploying AI in robotics, demonstrating NVIDIA\u2019s comprehensive approach to AI development and application.\n\nThe first computer, referred to as an \u201cAI factory,\u201d is central to the creation and continuous improvement of AI models.\nAI factories use NVIDIA\u2019s data center compute infrastructure along with its AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms for the simulation and training of AI models.\nThe second computer represents the runtime environment of the robot.\nThis varies depending on the application: It could be in the cloud or a data center; in an on-premises server for tasks like defect inspection in semiconductor manufacturing; or within an autonomous machine equipped with multiple sensors and cameras.\nGenerating Quality Assets and Scenes\nTalla also highlighted the role of LLMs in breaking down technical barriers, turning typical users into technical artists capable of creating complex robotics workcells or entire warehouse simulations.\nWith generative AI tools like NVIDIA Picasso, users can generate realistic 3D assets from simple text prompts and add them to digital scenes for dynamic and comprehensive robot training environments.\nThe same capability extends to creating diverse and physically accurate scenarios in Omniverse, enhancing the testing and training of robots to ensure real-world applicability.\nThis dovetails with the transformative potential of generative AI in reconfiguring the deployment of robots.\nTraditionally, robots are purpose-built for specific tasks, and modifying them for different ones is a time-consuming process.\nBut advancements in LLMs and vision language models are eliminating this bottleneck, enabling more intuitive interactions with robots through natural language, Talla explained.\nSuch machines \u2014 adaptable and aware of the environment around them \u2014 will soon spill out across the world.\nTo learn more, attend a virtual CES session and watch Talla\u2019s full talk below.\n\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | CES 2024 | Events | Hardware | Isaac | Jetson | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Jetson | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With ACE, generic non-playable characters (NPCs) can be turned into dynamic, interactive characters capable of striking up a conversation, or providing game knowledge to aid players in their quests.\nAt CES 2024 we are announcing the availability of ACE production microservices for NVIDIA Audio2Face (A2F) and NVIDIA Riva Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and that top digital avatar developers are embracing NVIDIA ACE.\nWe also released the latest version of the Kairos demo in collaboration with Convai, to showcase how next-generation AI NPCs will revolutionize gaming. Convai is an NPC developer platform that makes it easy for developers to enable characters in 3D worlds to have human-like conversation, perception, and action abilities.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE Microservices Now Available\nWith ACE, middleware, tool and game developers can take state-of-the-art AI models, such as A2F and Riva ASR, and implement them into their digital avatar solution for games and applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiva ASR enables the player to speak to the AI character via a microphone rather than typing to it. The goal of the ASR model is to enable the gamer to speak casually and naturally, enabling an immersive and dynamic conversation.\nAudio2Face creates expressive facial animation for game characters from just an audio source, such as a text-to-speech model. A2F is used both for realtime facial expression and lip sync generation and offline creation of facial performances. Realtime becomes a hard requirement for AI NPCs because of the non-deterministic nature of the NPC\u2019s vocal lines. Alongside freeform AI dialog, developers need models like A2F to generate realistic facial performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Digital Avatar Developers Embrace NVIDIA ACE\nTop interactive avatar and game developers are pioneering how ACE and generative AI technologies can transform player to character interactions. In addition to Convai, other developers embracing ACE include Charisma.AI, Inworld, miHoYo, NetEase Games, OurPalm, Tencent, Ubisoft, and UneeQ.\n\u201cGenerative AI-powered characters in virtual worlds unlock various use cases and experiences that were previously impossible,\u201d said Purnendu Mukherjee, founder and CEO at Convai. \u201cConvai is leveraging Riva ASR and A2F to enable lifelike NPCs with low-latency response times and high-fidelity natural animation.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a milestone moment for AI in games,\u201d said Tencent Games. \u201cNVIDIA ACE and Tencent Games will help lay the foundation that will bring digital avatars with individual, lifelike personalities and interactions to video games.\u201d\n\u201cFor years NVIDIA has been the Pied-piper of gaming technologies, delivering new and innovative ways to create games. NVIDIA is making games more intelligent and playable through the adoption of gaming AI technologies, which ultimately creates a more immersive experience.\u201d - Zhipeng Hu, Sr. vice president of NetEase and head of LeiHuo business group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKairos Demo Evolves With New Technologies From Convai\nOpen-ended conversations with NPCs open up a world of possibilities for interactivity in games. However, conversation should have consequences that could lead to potential actions. To carry out actions from NPCs, they need to be aware of the world around them and be able to interact dynamically. With our partner Convai and their latest releases, we take our collaborative demo to the next level, enabling these AI NPCs with the following new features:\n\nSpatial Awareness - enables game characters to identify and interact with objects and engage in conversations about their surroundings. For example, the player can point at items, and the character will talk about the item intelligently.\nActions - enable game characters to interact with items in the game world based on the conversation. For example, delivering a bottle of sake when requested.\nNPC-to-NPC Interaction - enables game characters to interact with each other, bringing the world alive even when the player is idle.\n\nIn addition, Convai has integrated the new NVIDIA ACE microservices: Audio2Face and Riva ASR. With the addition of the new ACE microservices in Convai\u2019s pipeline, game characters will have improved lip sync, better expression, and accurate speech detection when listening to the player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the new Kairos demo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE: Brings Game Characters to Life\nGenerative AI technologies will transform gaming, enabling NPCs to have meaningful interactions with players beyond the pre-recorded script. Your actions could influence the responses of civilians and key characters, and you\u2019ll get a unique interaction rather than a scripted response.\nNVIDIA is at the forefront of Generative AI for all industries, and at CES 2024 NVIDIA announced\u00a0GeForce RTX SUPER desktop GPUs for supercharged generative AI performance, new AI laptops from every top manufacturer, and new NVIDIA RTX-accelerated AI software and tools for both developers and consumers, full details about which you can find here.\nSubscribe to learn more about NVIDIA ACE, future developments, and early access programs.

(the \"Company\" or \"Cyngn\") (Nasdaq: CYN) today announced a strategic shift to Nvidia\u00a0AI computers that will revolutionize the technology powering its fleet of DriveMod autonomous industrial vehicles. Following the path Tesla took with its Autopilot hardware, the company is embarking on an innovative initiative to transition from Intel\u00a0microprocessors to Nvidia AI computers. This transformation will encompass the entire DriveMod lineup, including the DriveMod Tugger, the DriveMod Stockchaser, and the DriveMod Forklift.\n\n\nContinue Reading\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Cyngn Next-Gen DriveMod Kit with Nvidia AI Computers\r\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to adopt Nvidia AI computers is driven by Cyngn's commitment to enhancing both the efficiency and capability of its vehicles while concurrently reducing production costs. The unparalleled processing power and advanced development ecosystem offered by Nvidia's computers align with Cyngn's vision for the future of robotic autonomous platforms.\n\nCommenting on the initiative, Cyngn's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lior Tal, emphasized the forward-thinking nature of Nvidia's AI computers, stating, \"Nvidia's computers are the platforms of the future. By integrating them into our vehicles, we will not only see a reduction in power consumption but also a significant decrease in cost as we reduce the number of components in our DriveMod system. We are convinced that Nvidia's AI computers are the clear winner when it comes to powering advanced robotics platforms like DriveMod. This initiative is in line with our continuous investment in R&D as evident from our rapidly growing patent portfolio.\"\nAs Cyngn embraces this transformative journey, we believe the integration of Nvidia computers into its DriveMod vehicles signifies a bold step towards a future where innovation and efficiency converge to redefine the landscape of robotic technologies. The company remains dedicated to pushing boundaries and delivering cutting-edge solutions that elevate the performance and safety of its autonomous vehicles in the field.About CyngnCyngn develops and deploys scalable, differentiated autonomous vehicle technology for industrial organizations.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Mark Swinnerton aims to fight climate change by transforming abandoned mines into storage tanks of renewable energy.\nThe CEO of startup Green Gravity is prototyping his ambitious vision in a warehouse 60 miles south of Sydney, Australia, and simulating it in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for building 3D workflows and applications.\nThe concept requires some heavy lifting. Solar and wind energy will pull steel blocks weighing as much as 30 cars each up shafts taller than a New York skyscraper, storing potential energy that can turn turbines whenever needed.\nA Distributed Energy Network\nSwinnerton believes it\u2019s the optimal way to save renewable energy because nearly a million abandoned mine shafts are scattered around the globe, many of them already connected to the grid. And his mechanical system is cheaper and greener than alternatives like massive lithium batteries better suited for electric vehicles.\nMark Swinnerton\nOfficials in Australia, India and the U.S. are interested in the concept, and a state-owned mine operator in Romania is conducting a joint study with Green Gravity.\n\u201cWe have a tremendous opportunity for repurposing a million mines,\u201d said Swinnerton, who switched gears after a 20-year career at BHP Group, one of the world\u2019s largest mining companies, determined to combat climate change.\nA Digital-First Design\nA longtime acquaintance saw an opportunity to accelerate Swinnerton\u2019s efforts with a digital twin.\n\u201cI was fascinated by the Green Gravity idea and suggested taking a digital-first approach, using data as a differentiator,\u201d said Daniel Keys, an IT expert and executive at xAmplify, a provider of accelerated computing services.\nAI-powered simulations could speed the design and deployment of the novel concept, said Keys, who met Swinnerton 25 years earlier at one of their first jobs, flipping burgers at a fast-food stand.\nToday, they\u2019ve got a digital prototype cooking on xAmplify\u2019s Scaile computer, based on NVIDIA DGX systems. It\u2019s already accelerating Green Gravity\u2019s proof of concept.\n\u201cThanks to what we inferred with a digital twin, we\u2019ve been able to save 40% of the costs of our physical prototype by shifting from three weights to two and moving them 10 instead of 15 meters vertically,\u201d said Swinnerton.\nUse Cases Enabled by Omniverse\nIt\u2019s the first of many use cases Green Gravity is developing in Omniverse.\nOnce the prototype is done, the simulation will help scale the design to mines as deep as 7,000 feet, or about six Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other. Ultimately, the team will build in Omniverse a dashboard to control and monitor sensor-studded facilities without the safety hazards of sending a person into the mine.\nGreen Gravity\u2019s physical prototype and test lab.\n\u201cWe expect to cut tens of millions of dollars off the estimated $100 million for the first site because we can use simulations to lower our risks with banks and insurers,\u201d said Swinnerton. \u201cThat\u2019s a real tantalizing opportunity.\u201d\nVirtual Visualization Tools\nOperators will track facilities remotely using visualization systems equipped with NVIDIA A40 GPUs and can stream their visuals to tablets thanks to the TabletAR extension in the Omniverse Spatial Framework.\nxAmplify\u2019s workflow uses a number of software components such as NVIDIA Modulus, a framework for physics-informed machine learning models.\n\u201cWe also use Omniverse as a core integration fabric that lets us connect a half-dozen third-party tools operators and developers need, like Siemens PLM for sensor management and Autodesk for design,\u201d Keys said.\n\nOmniverse eases the job of integrating third-party applications into one 3D workflow because it\u2019s based on the OpenUSD standard.\nAlong the way, AI sifts reams of data about the thousands of available mines to select optimal sites, predicting their potential for energy storage. Machine learning will also help optimize designs for each site.\nTaken together, it\u2019s a digital pathway Swinnerton believes will lead to commercial operations for Green Gravity within the next couple years.\nIt\u2019s the latest customer for xAmplify\u2019s Canberra data center serving Australian government agencies, national defense contractors and an expanding set of enterprise users with a full stack of NVIDIA accelerated software.\nLearn more about how AI is transforming renewables, including wind farm optimization, solar energy generation and fusion energy.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Cloud Services | Customer Stories | Digital Twin | Energy | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

To sustain high production volumes, Delta has undertaken significant smart manufacturing initiatives at its production bases to enhance efficiency, flexibility, quality, and sustainability.\u00a0\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 and Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), Delta is virtually linking specific production lines, aggregating 3D data from a diverse range of equipment to create a digital twin. Then, with the NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122 simulation application, Delta generates physically accurate, photorealistic synthetic data for training their computer vision models and simulating the performance of their inspection cameras. This lets them optimize every part of the factory process before\u200c actual production starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Customer\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Electronics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Partners\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutodesk FlexSim  Visual Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Use Cases\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics Computer Vision/Video Analytics Simulation/Modeling/Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Products\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation NVIDIA Isaac Sim NVIDIA RTX A6000 NVIDIA RTX A40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Omniverse, Delta is realizing major benefits including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced production downtime by using synthetic data to bootstrap the training of computer vision models.\nIncreased production efficiencies by identifying and addressing production line issues with digital twin simulations.\u00a0\nImproved collaboration by centralizing all 3D assets from disparate sources with OpenUSD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100X faster AI training with synthetic data\n90% object model detection accuracy with synthetic data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Optimizing Production Lines With Simulation\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta frequently changes and reoptimizes its production lines based on the components and products they need to manufacture for their customers. To achieve this across an incredibly complex, fast-moving electronics assembly line for assembling power supplies is no easy feat. Their team connects machines in the production line, then uses mockups and static images to identify and remove physical collisions, issues, and errors.\u00a0\nHowever, this approach relies on position switches to detect trays and objects on the production line. When the number of robots and machines increased in their production lines, Delta needed to add more position switches. This wasn't scalable or suitable to accommodate their need for flexible production, as it took more than 30 minutes to reconfigure each position switch, resulting in costly production downtime whenever the layout needed to be changed.\u00a0\nTo address these challenges, Delta built a physically accurate digital twin of their production lines. This allowed them to iterate much more quickly on reconfiguration and run multiple \u201cwhat-if\u201d simulations to identify optimal line designs.\nAnother key advantage of a digital twin was the ability to rapidly generate synthetic data at scale to test and train highly accurate computer vision models for detecting trays and products in the production line. This new approach allowed the team to greatly accelerate the production planning process, as they no longer relied on reconfiguring every position switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Electronics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    A Unified Asset Pipeline for Building Digital Twins\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process of creating a digital twin begins with aggregating and visualizing 3D assets from the environment. Delta uses multiple 3D applications, including Autodesk 3ds Max, FlexSim, and Visual Components to model and simulate their production line. Historically, it would be nearly impossible to bring data from these modeling and simulation tools into one environment without time-consuming data transfer, model decimation, and interoperability hurdles. Even then, once the data is aggregated, if any changes are made to models or processes in the source 3D applications, the process of aggregating starts again to update any changes.\nWith Omniverse, Delta can connect their various applications and data together using a unified asset pipeline, allowing their teams to visualize and collaborate on the entire output in a single environment. This is all made possible by OpenUSD and additional connectors and extensions that allow third-party tools to feed live data into a USD stage through a Nucleus server.\u00a0\nOnce all the assets are aggregated in the digital twin, the Delta team can run simulations and identify issues early in the design and reconfiguration process, well before making changes to their physical production lines. This is key to avoiding costly downtime and change-order requests.\n\"When apps connect to Omniverse, this allows all our files and data to be synced simultaneously, so team members can see updates in the USD Stage and collaborate in real time,\" said Ares Chen, PSBG General Manager at Delta Electronics. \"USD enables seamless collaboration with each team member, so we can design a production line faster and more efficiently than before.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUsing Isaac Sim and Omniverse Replicator has allowed us to significantly increase our synthetic data generation capabilities by over 100X, compared to previous methods of training. This greatly increases efficiencies and ultimately accelerates our designs of new production lines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAres Chen PSBG General Manager, Delta Electronics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Electronics\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Accelerating Industrial Inspection With Synthetic Data \n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta uses computer vision for automated inspection in the final assembly, checking for issues like missing components or misaligned screws. AI-assisted Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) significantly accelerates the inspection process, enabling Delta to detect defects early and minimize the need for manual intervention.\nDelta faced a challenge in training AI models because collecting and labeling data manually took a lot of time\u2013up to two days for 1000 images. To speed things up and cut costs, they switched to using synthetic data with Omniverse Replicator. Now, in just 10 minutes, they can generate the same amount of labeled images that would take two days manually.\nThe team also achieves a 90% accuracy with synthetic data, similar to real data. The big win is that they reached this accuracy level in just a tiny fraction of the time it usually takes to collect real data\u2014now done in one-hundredth of the time. This not only accelerates AI training, but also makes the process more cost-effective and efficient for computer vision applications.\nDelta also uses NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2014a scalable robotics simulation application\u2014to accurately simulate the performance of the model and detect the position of a tray in the production line. \nBy creating the digital twins in Omniverse, Delta can minimize downtime and reduce risks while reoptimizing production lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Electronics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart developing interoperable 3D workflows and OpenUSD applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in Touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Information\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nCompany Overview\n\n\nInvestors\n\n\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\n\n\nNVIDIA Foundation\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability\n\n\nTechnologies\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nNews and Events\n\n\nNewsroom\n\n\nCompany Blog\n\n\nTechnical Blog\n\n\nWebinars\n\n\nStay Informed\n\n\nEvents Calendar\n\n\nGTC AI Conference\n\n\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n\n\n\n\nPopular Links\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\nPartners\n\n\nExecutive Insights\n\n\nStartups and VCs\n\n\nNVIDIA Connect for ISVs\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nTechnical Training\n\n\nTraining for IT Professionals\n\n\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow NVIDIA  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t           United States\n\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER generates AI video 1.5 times faster \u2014 and images 1.7 times faster \u2014 than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. The Tensor Cores in SUPER GPUs deliver up to 836 trillion operations per second, bringing generative AI capabilities to gaming, creating and everyday productivity.\nThe company said the RTX chips are powerful enough that they can also help to accelerate the performance of generative AI models found within the Nvidia TensorRT-LLM open-source library. Within that library, developers will be able to find pre-optimized for PC versions of many of the most popular large language models. Those models include Chat with RTX, which is a new model developed by Nvidia and released in demo mode this month, helping AI developers access and interact with their notes, documents and other content more easily.\nIn a statement, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said the ability to run generative AI locally on PCs will be crucial for workloads that require privacy, latency and cost sensitivity. To run generative AI on something as small as a PC or laptop, he explained, you need not only a large installed base of AI-ready systems, but also the right developer tools for tuning and optimizing those models.\n\u201cWith over 100 million RTX AI PCs and workstations, Nvidia is a massive installed base for developers and gamers to enjoy the magic of generative AI,\u201d the CEO said.\nNvidia said PC makers including Acer Inc., ASUSTek Computer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd, Samsung Electronics Ltd., Micro-Star International Co. Ltd and Razer Inc. will all announce new RTX AI laptops at CES or in the coming weeks and months. As for the RTX chips themselves, they\u2019ll start shipping to customers later this month.\n\nAI software updates\nNvidia said every new A800 40GB Active RTX GPU PC and laptop will come with a three-year license for Nvidia AI Enterprise, which is the company\u2019s AI development software.\nTo help developers make the most of their newest, AI-capable hardware, Nvidia also announced a new AI development toolkit called Nvidia AI Workbench, which will become available in beta this month. Nvidia AI Workbench is a platform for developers to quickly create, test and customize generative AI models and LLMs, providing streamlined access to models from repositories such as Hugging Face, GitHub and Nvidia NGC. This will allow AI development projects to be fine-tuned on local RTX systems before being deployed at scale via on-premises data centers or the public cloud, the company said.\nOther software announced today includes Nvidia AI Foundation Models and Endpoints, which bundles various RTX-compatible AI models and software development kits into the HP AI Studio, which is a centralized data science platform.\nNew PC experiences\nNvidia said its own developers have already busy taking advantage of the RTX GPU\u2019s new capabilities to launch a number of generative AI applications that can run locally on their machines.\nThe company said it worked closely with its PC hardware partners to develop applications such as Nvidia RTX Remix, which is a tool for creating RTX-based remasters of classic video games. It will launch in beta this month, and uses generative AI to transform the basic textures found in classic games to modern, 4K resolution, physically-based rendering materials. As for the new Nvidia ACE microservices, this is said to provide access to AI-powered speech and animation models for developers who want to add intelligent and dynamic digital avatars to their games.\nAlso new is TensorRT acceleration for the Stable Diffusion XL Turbo and latent consistency models, which helps increase performance by up to 60%, the company said. As for Nvidia DLSS 3, this now supports frame generation capabilities, leveraging AI to increase frame rates by up to four times compared to native rendering. This capability will be feature in several upcoming video game titles, including \u201cHorizon Forbidden West,\u201d \u201cPax Dei\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Dogma 2.\u201d\nImages: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Still, modern hardware includes specialized components designed specifically to obtain very high performance video encoding and decoding.\nNvidia GPUs, such as those found in the P and G Amazon EC2 instances, include this kind of built-in hardware in their NVENC (encoding) and NVDEC (decoding) accelerator engines, which can be used for real-time video encoding/decoding with minimal impact on the performance of the CPU or GPU.\n\nFigure 1: NVIDIA NVDEC/NVENC architecture. Source https://developer.nvidia.com/video-codec-sdk\nScenario\nTwo main transcoding job types should be considered depending on the video delivery use case, 1) batch jobs for on demand video files and 2) streaming jobs for real-time, low latency use cases. In order to achieve optimal throughput and cost efficiency, it is a best practice to encode the videos in parallel using the same instance.\nThe utilized instance types in this benchmark can be found in figure 2 table (i.e g4dn and p3). For hardware comparison purposes, the p4d instance has been included in the table, showing the GPU specs and total number of NVDEC & NVENC cores in these EC2 instances.

The results will be further presented using graphical representations of the performance indicators obtained.\nThe benchmark uses 3 input videos with different motion and detail levels (still, medium motion and high dynamic scene) in 4k resolution at 60 frames per second. The tests will show the average performance for encoding with FFmpeg 6.0 in batch (using Constant Rate Factor (CRF) mode) and streaming (using Constant Bit Rate (CBR)) with x264 and x265 codecs to five output resolutions (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p and 160p).\nThe benchmark tests encoding the target videos into H.264 and H.265 using the x264 and x265 open-source libraries in FFmpeg 6.0 on the CPU and the NVENC accelerator when using the Nvidia GPU. The H.264 standard enjoys broad compatibility, with most consumer devices supporting accelerated decoding. The H.265 standard offers superior compression at a given level of quality than H.264 but hardware accelerated decoding is not as widely deployed. As a result, for most media delivery scenarios having more than one video format will be required in order to provide the best possible user experience.\nOffline (batch) encoding\nThis test consists of a batch encoding with two different standard presets (ultrafast and medium for CPU-based encoding and p1 and medium presets for GPU-accelerated encoding) defined in the FFmpeg guide.\nThe following chart shows the relative cost of transcoding 1 million frames to the 5 different output resolutions in parallel for CPU-encoding EC2 instance (c6i.4xlarge) and two types of GPU-powered instances (g4dn.xlarge and p3.2xlarge). The results are normalized so that the cost of x264 ultrafast preset on c6i.4xlarge is equal to one.\n\nFigure 3: Batch encoding performance for CPU and GPU instances.\nThe performance of batch encoding in the best GPU instance (g4dn.xlarge) shows around 73% better price/performance in x264 compared to the c6i.4xlarge and around 82% improvement in x265.\nA relevent aspect to have in consideration is that the presets used are not exactly equivalent for each hardware because FFmpeg uses different operators depending on where the process runs (i.e CPU or GPU). As a consequence, the video outputs in each case have a noticeable difference between them. Generally, NVENC-based encoded videos (GPU) tend to have a higher quality in H.264, whereas CPU outputs present more encoding artifacts. The difference is more noticeable for lower quality cases (ultrafast/p1 presets or streaming use cases).\nThe following images compare the output quality for the medium motion video in the ultrafast/p1 and medium presets.\nIt is clearly seen in the following example, that the h264_nevenc (GPU) codec outperforms the libx264 codec (CPU) in terms of quality, showing less pixelation, especially in the ultrafast preset. For the medium preset, although the quality difference is less pronounced, the GPU output file is noticeably larger (refer to Figure 6 table).\n\nFigure 4: Result comparison between GPU and CPU for h264, ultrafast\n\nFigure 5: Result comparison between GPU and CPU for h264, medium\nThe output file sizes mainly depend on the preset, codec and input video. The different configurations can be found in the following table.\n\nFigure 6: Sizes for output batch encoded videos. Streaming not represented because the size is the same (fixed bitrate)\nLive stream encoding\nFor live streaming use cases, it is useful to measure how many streams a single instance can maintain transcoding to five output resolutions (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p and 160p). The following results are the relative cost of each instance, which is the ratio of number of streams the instance was able to sustain divided by the cost per hour.\n\nFigure 6: Streaming encoding performance for CPU and GPU instances.\nThe previous results show that a GPU-based instance family like g4dn is ideal for streaming use cases, where they can sustain up to 4 parallel encodings from 4K to 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p & 160p simultaneously. Notice that the GPU-based p5 family performance is not compensating the cost increase.\nOn the other hand, the CPU-based instances can sustain 1 parallel stream (at most). If you want to sustain the same number of parallel streams in Intel-based instances, you\u2019d have to opt for a much larger instance (c6i.12xlarge can almost sustain 3 simultaneous streams, but it struggles to keep up with the more dynamic scenes when encoding with x265) with a much higher cost ($2.1888 hourly for c6i.12xlarge vs $0.587 for g4dn.xlarge).\nThe price/performance difference is around 68% better in GPU for x264 and 79% for x265.\nConclusion\nThe results show that for the tested scenarios there can be a price-performance gain when transcoding with GPU compared to CPU. Also, GPU-encoded videos tend to have an equal or higher perceived quality level to CPU-encoded counterparts and there is no significant performance penalty for encoding to the more advanced H.265 format, which can make GPU-based encoding pipelines an attractive option.\nStill, CPU-encoders do a particularly good job with containing output file sizes for most of the cases we tested, producing smaller output file sizes even when the perceived quality is simmilar. This is an important aspect to have into account since it can have a big impact in cost. Depending on the amount of media files distributed and consumed by final users, the data transfer and storage cost will noticeably increase if GPUs are used. With this in mind, it is important to weight the compute costs with the data transfer and storage costs for your use case when chosing to use CPU or GPU-based video encoding.\nOne additional point to be considered is pipeline flexibility. Whereas the GPU encoding pipeline is rigid, CPU-based pipelines can be modified to the customer\u2019s needs, including \u00a0additional FFmpeg filters to accommodate future needs as required.\nThe test did not include any specific quality measurements in the transcoded images, but it would be interesting to perform an analysis based on quantitative\u00a0VMAF\u00a0(or similar algorithm) metrics for the videos. We always recommend to make your own test to validate if the results obtained meet your requirements.\nBenchmarking method\nThis blog post extends on the original work described in Optimized Video Encoding with FFmpeg on AWS Graviton Processors and the benchmarking process has been maintained in order to preserve consistency of the benchmark results. The original article analyzes in detail the price/performance advantages of AWS Graviton 3 compared to other processors.\n\nFigure 7: Batch encoding workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resources\n\n Serverless Computing and Applications\n Amazon Container Services\n AWS Messaging\n Cloud Compute with AWS\n Desktop and Application Streaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow\n\n \u00a0Twitter\n \u00a0Facebook\n \u00a0LinkedIn\n \u00a0Twitch\n \u00a0Email Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Sign In to the Console \n\n Learn About AWS\n\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Accessibility\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nWhat is Generative AI?\nWhat is Machine Learning (ML)?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n Resources for AWS\n\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Library\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partners\n\n\n\n Developers on AWS\n\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavaScript on AWS\n\n\n\n Help\n\nContact Us\nGet Expert Help\nFile a Support Ticket\nAWS re:Post\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\nAWS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Create an AWS Account \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Amazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: \n          Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\nBahasa Indonesia\nDeutsch\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\nFran\u00e7ais\nItaliano\nPortugu\u00eas\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\u03a1\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53)\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7e41\u9ad4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Terms\n|\n Cookie Preferences \n|\n\u00a9 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

Some 3,000 \u2014 three-quarters of the total \u2014 could disappear before the end of the century, or one every two weeks, according to UNESCO.\nAs part of a movement to protect such languages, New Zealand\u2019s Te Hiku Media, a broadcaster focused on the M\u0101ori people\u2019s indigenous language known as te reo, is using trustworthy AI to help preserve and revitalize the tongue.\nUsing ethical, transparent methods of speech data collection and analysis to maintain data sovereignty for the M\u0101ori people, Te Hiku Media is developing automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for te reo, which is a Polynesian language.\nBuilt using the open-source NVIDIA NeMo toolkit for ASR and NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, the speech-to-text models transcribe te reo with 92% accuracy. It can also transcribe bilingual speech using English and te reo with 82% accuracy. They\u2019re pivotal tools, made by and for the M\u0101ori people, that are helping preserve and amplify their stories.\n\u201cThere\u2019s immense value in using NVIDIA\u2019s open-source technologies to build the tools we need to ultimately achieve our mission, which is the preservation, promotion and revitalization of te reo M\u0101ori,\u201d said Keoni Mahelona, chief technology officer at Te Hiku Media, who leads a team of data scientists and developers, as well as M\u0101ori language experts and data curators, working on the project.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also helping guide the industry on ethical ways of using data and technologies to ensure they\u2019re used for the empowerment of marginalized communities,\u201d added Mahelona, a Native Hawaiian now living in New Zealand.\nBuilding a \u2018House of Speech\u2019\nTe Hiku Media began more than three decades ago as a radio station aiming to ensure te reo had space on the airwaves. Over the years, the organization incorporated television broadcasting and, with the rise of the internet, it convened a meeting in 2013 with the community\u2019s elders to form a strategy for sharing content in the digital era.\n\u201cThe elders agreed that we should make the stories accessible online for our community members \u2014 rather than just keeping our archives on cassettes in boxes \u2014 but once we had that objective, the challenge was how to do this correctly, in alignment with our strong roots in valuing sovereignty,\u201d Mahelona said.\nInstead of uploading its video and audio sources to popular, global platforms \u2014 which, in their terms and conditions of use, require signing over certain rights related to the content \u2014 Te Hiku Media decided to build its own content distribution platform.\nCalled Whare K\u014drero \u2014 meaning \u201chouse of speech\u201d \u2014 the platform now holds more than 30 years\u2019 worth of digitized, archival material featuring about 1,000 hours of te reo native speakers, some of whom were born in the late 19th century, as well as more recent content from second-language learners and bilingual M\u0101ori people.\nNow, around 20 M\u0101ori radio stations use and upload their content to Whare K\u014drero. Community members can access the content through an app.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an invaluable resource of acoustic data,\u201d Mahelona said.\nTurning to Trustworthy AI\nSuch a trove held incredible value for those working to revitalize the language, the Te Hiku Media team quickly realized, but manual transcription required pulling lots of time and effort from limited resources. So began the organization\u2019s trustworthy AI efforts, in 2016, to accelerate its work using ASR.\n\u201cNo one would have a clue that there are eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in our derelict, rundown, musky-smelling building in the far north of New Zealand \u2014 training and building M\u0101ori language models,\u201d Mahelona said. \u201cBut the work has been game-changing for us.\u201d\nTo collect speech data in a transparent, ethically compliant, community-oriented way, Te Hiku Media began by explaining its cause to elders, garnering their support and asking them to come to the station to read phrases aloud.\n\u201cIt was really important that we had the support of the elders and that we recorded their voices, because that\u2019s the sort of content we want to transcribe,\u201d Mahelona said. \u201cBut eventually these efforts didn\u2019t scale \u2014 we needed second-language learners, kids, middle-aged people and a lot more speech data in general.\u201d\nSo, the organization ran a crowdsourcing campaign, K\u014drero M\u0101ori, to collect highly labeled speech samples according to the Kaitiakitanga license, which ensures Te Hiku Media uses the data only for the benefit of the M\u0101ori people.\nIn just 10 days, more than 2,500 signed up to read 200,000+ phrases, providing over 300 hours of labeled speech data, which was used to build and train the te reo M\u0101ori ASR models.\nIn addition to other open-source trustworthy AI tools, Te Hiku Media now uses the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit\u2019s ASR module for speech AI throughout its entire pipeline. The NeMo toolkit comprises building blocks called neural modules and includes pretrained models for language model development.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely amazing \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s open-source NeMo enabled our ASR models to be bilingual and added automatic punctuation to our transcriptions,\u201d Mahelona said.\nTe Hiku Media\u2019s ASR models are the engines running behind Kaituhi, a te reo M\u0101ori transcription service now available online.\nThe efforts have spurred similar ASR projects now underway by Native Hawaiians and the Mohawk people in southeastern Canada.\n\u201cIt\u2019s indigenous-led work in trustworthy AI that\u2019s inspiring other indigenous groups to think: \u2018If they can do it, we can do it, too,\u2019\u201d Mahelona said.\nLearn more about NVIDIA-powered trustworthy AI, the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit and how it enabled a Telugu language speech AI breakthrough.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | GPU | NVIDIA NeMo | Open Source | Social Impact | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley sits down with Nvidia Vice President of Automotive Danny Shapiro to discuss the chipmaker's autonomous driving projects.  Nvidia (NVDA) announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to hone self-driving capabilities. Starting with an assisted driving feature, Shapiro believes the technology through this partnership will \u201cadd greater and greater levels of autonomy\u201d until full self-driving is achieved. \u201cSafety has got be the top priority\u201d Shapiro insists, and suggests that a timeline for self-driving cars is hard to gauge. Going beyond in-car technology, Shapiro states that the company\u2019s generative AI is \u201cleveraging the exact same data that is used to build the car,\u201d by offering an automotive configurator that allows consumers to get the actual experience of the car before buying.

Video Transcript DAN HOWLEY: CES 2024 is in full swing. And right now, we're speaking with NVIDIA VP of Automobiles Danny Shapiro. Danny, thank you so much for joining us. I guess, you know, obviously, the big theme at CES 2024 is AI. So how does that fit into NVIDIA's automotive strategy? DANNY SHAPIRO: That's a great question. We're super excited to be here in the Mercedes-Benz booth. And what we're showing behind me actually is the new CLA concept, which is going to be the first vehicle from Mercedes-Benz with NVIDIA DRIVE inside.  So that's our AI platform for automated driving, driver assistance, all kinds of convenience features. So we basically bringing the type of AI from the cloud that we're used to seeing but bringing it right into the car, processing the sensor data, and making the vehicle much safer to be in. DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think that's one of the interesting things to point out, right, is we all talk about generative AI in general. But self-driving cars-- or self-driving technology only exists because of AI. DANNY SHAPIRO: That's absolutely right. There's a massive amount of data that's being generated from all the cameras on the car, the radar, now LiDAR on this vehicle. And that has to be processed in real time. So that's where NVIDIA comes in, providing those horsepower to take all that data and make sense of it and understand exactly where the lanes are, where the potential hazards are to be able to read signs, detect the lights.   Story Continues And so we're bringing that out now to make these vehicles safer, to be an assistance feature for them. But they're software updatable vehicles. So over time, we're developing the software with Mercedes and all of our auto customers to be able to then add greater and greater levels of autonomy. And eventually, we'll get to self-driving.DAN HOWLEY: I guess when it comes to self-driving, is there a thought on when that might come? I know it's always the, you know, I guess, billion dollar question that everybody's kind of banding about. And the early prognosticators had said, oh, it'll be here in no time. But, obviously, it's a little bit longer than that probably.DANNY SHAPIRO: Absolutely. You know, so this is a challenge we've been working on for well over a decade. It's something I think the entire industry underestimated the complexity. And the reality is safety has to be the top priority. It is for us. It is for so many of our partners. And we need to make sure we get it right.So while these estimates were put out there initially, we realized we underestimated the complexity. And so we're focused on making sure that before we put anything out on the road, that it's tested and validated for every possible scenario.So this is where another aspect of NVIDIA comes in. We can use simulation technology for the creation of the AI but also for testing and validating that AI and making sure that in all types of lighting conditions, all kinds of weather conditions, many different scenarios, the kinds of things that don't happen very often, it's hard to train for. So we can use AI and create synthetic data to understand what possibly could happen and make sure the car will react appropriately.DAN HOWLEY: Is that something similar to the Omniverse, the digital twin kind of idea that NVIDIA has been working on where, yeah, you can build these digital--DANNY SHAPIRO: Absolutely.DAN HOWLEY: --versions of objects, factories, things like that?DANNY SHAPIRO: You're absolutely right. So we really are able to apply this across the entire workflow within the auto industry from the designers that can use Omniverse and create essentially digital versions of the vehicle, right? That's part of the design process. But then using Omniverse, that exact same model becomes part of what goes into the engineering team, then can go into the manufacturing side where we can create a virtual factory, a digital twin of the factory.It's modeling every aspect of the factory-- the robots, the conveyors, the other employees working inside the factory. We can model all that, optimize it, and make sure it all works before the factory is even built. And then we can even extend that model beyond into the retail side using all that same data to create a virtual retail or showroom experience. People can customize their car; choose different materials, the interior trims, different wheels; and even take it on a virtual test drive.So all of that simulation then is a very valuable tool throughout that whole workflow. So in addition to testing and validating the AVs, it really applies to all the mechanical, physical, and even sort of retail and service extensions of that whole workflow.DAN HOWLEY: So I want to ask you about generative AI. Obviously, it was the huge theme of 2023. Still going to be a big theme into 2024. And I want to get your thoughts on how that kind of fits into the automotive side of things for NVIDIA as well.DANNY SHAPIRO: Yeah, so generative AI, we've just started. And I think the important thing to recognize, it's not just about text in and text out. That's, you know, what ChatGPT kind of started. It has amazing capabilities. There's a lot of room for improvement-- of course, something that's trained on, just a vast array of data. Some of it real. Some of it not-- means the results aren't going to always be accurate.So what we're doing is putting together tools in place to be able to curate data and be able to make sure that if you're going to talk to your Mercedes, you wanted to make sure it has accurate information. So Mercedes can train this large language model with the history of Mercedes vehicles with all the information about the CLA concept, the manual, the service manual, whatever it is so that when you have a dialogue with that vehicle, it comes back with the right answer.But beyond that, we're using generative AI for other data streams that we can put text in and imagery out, text in and video out. Could be video in and text out. So there's so many different ways that generative AI can be used.Imagine, we have an automated vehicle. The front-facing camera is taking in 30 frames a second of video. We can then use a large language model to convert the pixels in that video into an explanation of what's happening in the scene.So basically, the car can explain to you why it's making certain driving decisions or tell you what's going on in the scene to improve your trust and confidence in the system or provide alerts that mean something other than just the beep. So there's so many different ways that generative AI is really helping the auto industry from a designer that may do a sketch. And the generative AI will create a 3D model and in different permutations on that. It becomes a copilot for them, an assistant that is able to make their job and their productivity much better.So it's not going to take their job away. But it's going to make them more productive and create higher quality results. And in the case of all the safety systems, all these tools are going to increase the safety inside the vehicle.DAN HOWLEY: You know, on the automotive side and almost kind of the automotive consumer side, I know NVIDIA also introduced an automotive configurator. It's kind of the idea of being able to build your car on a company's website but in a more advanced way. So can you just kind of explain that to us?DANNY SHAPIRO: Sure. So we're leveraging the exact same data that's used to build the car and putting those models into more of a marketing role as opposed to engineering role. We can photorealistically render it.People can choose all different aspects of their car, kind of create their dream car. Maybe on their PC, they're doing it. Maybe even on a VR headset experience, look all around, see what that vehicle is going to be like to drive. And maybe even using our simulation technology to take it on a virtual test drive in a digital twin of the city that they live in or see what it looks like parked in their driveway.So generative AI is going to help create all these different kinds of scenes and be able to help the automakers increase, you know, the types of options that are added to the vehicle. Because if people can kind of see it and maybe experience it, we could simulate different features and functions in the car actually working. And people could add that to their cart as they're ordering their vehicle.DAN HOWLEY: And, you know, one of the things that NVIDIA is highlighting is just the breadth of different automakers that you work with. I guess, how do you see those relationships continuing to grow over time?DANNY SHAPIRO: Well, you know, we're working with hundreds of automakers, truck makers, robotaxi companies, shuttle companies and then-- so the whole ecosystem, the tier one suppliers, the sensor companies, the mapping companies, a lot of software developers, they're all building on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. So we've created this open system such that it's not a fixed function but rather a supercomputer that delivers the horsepower, the computing horsepower to run the software that's required today but also with headroom so that it can continue to evolve and develop in the future.So a year from now, we might be sitting here at CES talking about all kinds of new AI technology that no one's thought of yet. But we'll be able to update the software in the car to add those new features and capabilities.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, unfortunately, you can't do that for my '07 Mustang.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nTSMC admitted in mid-2023 that demand for its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) has exceeded its production capacity, and the company vowed to double capacity by the end of 2024. But while TSMC is building up its CoWoS capabilities, Nvidia would like to ship as many of its high-demand AI processors as possible \u2014 which is why it's tapping Intel to use its advanced packaging technology (in addition to TSMC's), according to a report from\u00a0money.UDN.com,\u00a0citing industrial sources. As with all unconfirmed reports, we'll have to take this with a grain of salt until the companies involved comment.\u00a0The deal is purportedly for 5,000 wafers per month, and according to quick back-of-the-napkin math, that would equate to 300,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips (assuming perfect yield and that the contract is for H100) per month.\u00a0TSMC is projected to remain the main supplier, providing around 90% of Nvidia's advanced packaging capacity. But starting from Q2, Nvidia is also poised to use Intel's capacity for at least some of its products, the report claims. If this information is accurate, adding Intel's capacities will let Nvidia produce more GPUs for AI and HPC workloads, satisfying demand for its existing products quicker. There is a catch, however.All of Nvidia's current and previous generation products, such as the A100, A800, A30, H100, H800, H200, and GH200 rely on TSMC's CoWoS-S packaging process, which relies on a silicon interposer. The closest advanced packaging technology that Intel has is called\u00a0Foveros, which also relies on an interposer, albeit a different one (CoWoS-S presumably uses a 65nm interposer, and Foveros uses a 22FFL interposer).\u00a0\u00a0To use Intel's Foveros, Nvidia will need to validate the technology and then qualify actual products, which will likely have slightly different characteristics (because interposers are made on different process technologies and have different bump pitches) than those packaged by TSMC, so the company's partners will probably also need to qualify them before deployment. If this is the case, it will be interesting to see whether Nvidia outsources only select products to Intel, or all of them.\u00a0Intel\u00a0is\u00a0expected to join Nvidia's supply chain in the second quarter, producing about 5,000\u00a0Foveros wafers\u00a0monthly\u00a0(if the report is accurate).\u00a0This is quite a significant number for Nvidia alone. To put this into context, TSMC could produce as many as\u00a08,000 CoWoS wafers\u00a0per month as of mid-2023 (which is when\u00a0Nvidia consumed the lion's share of this capacity) and aimed to increase the output to 11,000 by the end of 2023 and then to around 20,000 by the end of 2024. If Nvidia gets an additional 5,000 advanced packaging wafers per month, this will give it a significant edge over rivals.\u00a0\u00a0Outsourcing some of its advanced packaging to Intel Foundry Service can be seen as a strategic move for Nvidia to diversify its supply chain. As an added bonus, by employing IFS's packaging capacities, Nvidia will also ensure that these capacities cannot used by rivals \u2014 allowing Nvidia to solidify its position in the market.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nIFS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (13)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

I feel like they are positioning to gobble up a lot of the foundry business especially as China beats it's drum about Taiwan. I wonder how all the political pressures will play out for ASML tech because of that. Could Intel get first dibs on things simply because there is less chance of tech that would be headed to Taiwan could into China's hands? Either way seems like Intel betting on foundries is the right call, as we need more and more of it, and we need it spread out as much as possible.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL0rdrobot\n\n\nNobody in their right mind is going to bring their fabless designs to Intel, a competitor. Coupled with endless propaganda from Intel, they have never produced even a 10nm chip. \n\nFurther, and I am most assuredly not being rude, but the recent election in Taiwan was a solid victory for the Mainland. To understand Taiwan, what they would like is to reduce the anxiety between the Mainland and Taiwan. You strike me as an American Hawk and you have never been to Taiwan or China. The John and Joan Wayne approach is not palatable to the Chinese culture. \n\nRecent elections the present President won more than 1/3 of the vote but not even a simple majority. The other two candidates were more friendly to the Mainland. The new President does not control the legislature. The strength is moving away from the DDP and it is younger voters propelling the changes. The Mainland is gaining power. The Mainland is the economic driver of the Taiwan economy. \n\nSince Trump and now Biden, the chief complaint about Taiwan has been the silly notion that the US is DEPENDENT on TSMC for chips. One US General said the US would bomb TSMC rather than let China take it. Can you imagine how that remark resonated with the residents of Taiwan? \n\nTaiwan has seen this erosion in the past with the US. Giving Taiwan weapons only invites China hostility. But what else does the US provide. Very little and with Biden's Chip Act which is a laughable government boondoggle, the US Government is hatching a plan with Intel to build Fab plants in UNION Labour controlled Ohio. The idea is to use Automative Labour to build chips. The cost estimates so far indicate that would result in a 50% increase in chip prices. That's assuming that Intel can actually build narrow gated chips. So far they have not show any aptitude fo that. Further, chip fab is manpower intensive. I do not even think the US labour force can do this kind of work. History is on my side in that regard. \n\nThis crazy Nancy Kerrigan Style kneecapping foreign policy of the United States is not going to prevail against China. In fact it has already failed. \n\nAs I have pointed out many times the narrow gated semis are a mere 5% of the market. 14 nm or under. China can make 7nm now and likely 5nm this year. However China has been focused on the 95% of the market and is now 60 to 70% self-sufficient. All this as a result of the American stupid idea that division of labour is a national security risk. Semiconductors evolved as a global division of labour enterprise. But the Murican first crowd thought that was too Global for them. So the Chips Act was a gambit to try to delay China so the US could catch up. \n\nEven the CEO of ASML admits that China will have its own Litho narrow gated devices in a few years and will then be a hefty competitor to ASML. \n\nThe entire semiconductor business in the US is 2.3% of the US GDP. And shrinking 3% a year. By comparison the US Chemical industry is 25% of the US GDP and is expected to shrink 60% in the next five years. But where is Biden placing his chips? On fab. Makes no sense at all. BTW the Global Chemical Industry is moving to China. At present China has roughly a 60% market share and growing rapidly. \n\nThe business model for chips is wretched. A developer puts all their money in one chip that may or may not sell. When the US Gov blocks sales, they effectively destroy the semiconductor company that made the chip. Chips have a shelf life of bananas in a broken refrigerator car in Needles California. China doesn't want the NVIDIA disabled chips. NIVIDIA loses billions. There is not one semiconductor company that supports Biden's blockage of Chip sales to China, other than Intel that missed the entire handheld revolution and suddenly is eying FAB. And mark my words, they failed previously and this push will fail too.\n\nI could tell you for example that China leads the US in 34 of 40 leading edge core technologies. And in the remaining 6, is just a hairs-breath behind. In China education is paramount. They are turning out more PhD by far than the US and Britain and Europe combined. In the US, 65% of all college enrolls are women, 35% men. That is a total reversal from the 1970s. Women are not filling the gap in the sciences. Nobody is thinking much about this in the Government or the long term consequences. \n\nIn terms of paper's published in AI, Biochemistry, China stands toe to toe with the US in virtually all scientific arenas and is leading in most. Ion impellers are used in chip fab and China has ion engines on its space station and makes ion impellers. The US doesn't have this or dozens of other technologies. But we always have to listen to the John Wayners claim that \"Chiner Stole that technology from Murica.\" China has real 5g and now 6g, the US has neither. In fact, Intel failed in 5g spectacularly. \n\nAs my final remark: The individuals that kneecapped Nancy Kerrigan, did not become Olympic champions. To become an Olympic champion, one must compete. The US seems to have abandoned that idea in favour of kneecapping... This kneecapping has given China all the incentive it needs to become self-sufficient. You should have been selling them chips instead of turning them into a giant competitor.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncyrusfox\n\n\nLooks like Nvidia is looking at ramping max capacity to claim all the market share it can.\n\nThe H100 class GPUs packaging tech could likely be simplified, the GPU core is surrounded by 6 HBM clusters with only 5 in use, the 6th serving as redundant backup/structural support. They are connected currently through the silicon interposer\nWhy does it need a silicon interposer? Was this the best tech TSMC had on hand? Intel has other options or if required I am sure they could match TSMC interposer(Input out routing, to a given bump pitch and pitch pad), Foveros could pattern 65nm interposers through its 22FFL process, not exactly cheap though, why not move it to EMIB or any bridge tech should satisfy as long as the latency is the same or better. \n\nI would bet Nvidia is going to create a whole new class of GPU. Why force it to be identical to a current product? As Intel packaging offerings differ from TSMC(smaller bump pitch), Why wouldn't Nvidia utilize and improve their product based off the advantages here and charge a premium for it? All that matters is MLPERF LLM benchmarks for this class of cards. \"The more you buy the more you save \":)\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerryLaze\n\n\nL0rdrobot said:Nobody in their right mind is going to bring their fabless designs to Intel, a competitor.

Since then, Tigerlake, alder lake, raptor and its refreshes are all 10nm by by old naming convention, probably 10nm+++.\nhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foverosMeteor lake is sub 10nm... and was release December 2023. Gelsingers whole reason for proposing 5 nodes in 4 years to catch back up to TSMC.\n\nElectronics is very Asia dependent, Covid revealed some of the inherent weakness of concentrating all supply to a single location. (when supply chains broke down, we ran out of chips fast...) Intel has been successful at pushing this issue to get subsidies to build fabs outside of Asia. I view it as a benefit to have competition at the bleeding edge of semi conductor fabrication, hopefully Samsung decides to join the fray eventually...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSirErr\n\n\nezst036 said:H100 GPUs?

The product is designed to be compliant with the latest U.S. export regulations for China and can be shipped to the People's Republic without restrictions. Meanwhile, it is set to be available globally and sit between the expensive flagship RTX 6000 Ada Generation and considerably less capable RTX 5000 Ada Generation. But there is a major catch about this product.\nNVIDIA's RTX 5880 Ada Generation is based on the company's flagship AD102 graphics processor with 14,080 CUDA cores, 110 RT cores, 440 tensor cores, and a 384-bit memory interface to connect 48 GB of GDDR6 memory with ECC. The board comes with four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors and can support either four 4K monitors at 120 Hz, four 5K displays at 60 Hz, or two 8K monitors at 60 Hz. As for power consumption and heat dissipation, it is rated at 285W (with power delivered using one 12VHPWR connector) and comes with a standard dual-slot cooling system with a blower.\nAs the model number suggests, NVIDIA's RTX 5880 Ada Generation 48 GB should be close to the range-topping RTX 6000 Ada 48 GB. Unfortunately, this is not the case and this is a major catch about the RTX 5880 Ada. From performance point of view, NVIDIA's RTX 5880 Ada offers 69.3 FP32 TFLOPS and 554 FP8 TFLOPS, which is closer to the RTX 5800 Ada 32 GB (65.3 FP32 TFLOPS and 522.1 FP8 TFLOPS) rather than to the RTX 6000 Ada 48 GB (91.1 FP32 TFLOPS and 729 FP8 TFLOPS).\nNVIDIA's RTX 6000 Ada has a rather whopping FP8 Total Processing Performance (TPP) score of 5,828 (listed processing power multiplied by the length of operation), which is way higher than 4800 points that the U.S. Department of Commerce wants Chinese entities to get. So, the RTX 5880 Ada has a TPP score of 4432, which comfortably fits within the export requirements of the U.S. government.\nBut this also means that the RTX 5880 Ada is significantly slower than the RTX 6000 Ada, despite the model number. Truth to be told, the RTX 5880 Ada looks more like an RTX 5000 Ada on steroids rather than a slightly downgraded RTX 6000 Ada.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's Ada Generation High-End Professional Graphics Cards\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 6000 Ada\nRTX 5880 Ada\nRTX 5000 Ada\n\n\nGPU\nAD102\n\n\nMemory\n48 GB GDDR6 with ECC\n32 GB GDDR6 ECC\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n18,176\n14,080\n12,800\n\n\nTensor Cores\n568\n440\n400\n\n\nRT Cores\n142\n110\n100\n\n\nFP32 Performance\n91.1 TFLOPS\n69.3 TFLOPS\n65.3 TFLOPS\n\n\nRT Performance\n210.6 TFLOPS\n160.2 TFLOPS\n151 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Performance\n729 TFLOPS\n554 TFLOPS\n522.1 TFLOPS\n\n\nTPP\n5828\n4432\n4176\n\n\nEncode/Decode\n3 x encode, 3 x decode (+AV1 encode and decode)\n\n\nDisplay Connectors\n4 x DisplayPort 1.4a\n\n\nPower\n300W\n285W\n250W\n\n\nMSRP\n$6999\n?\n$4000\n\n\n\nWhat remains to be seen is the price of the RTX 5880 Ada. NVIDIA's RTX 5000 Ada has a list price of $4,000, whereas the RTX 6000 Ada has an MSRP of $6,999. It is logical to expect the RTX 5880 Ada to cost closer to the RTX 5000, but not just slightly higher, because after all it has a rather capable 48 GB memory subsystem.\nSources: NVIDIA, RTX 5880 Ada datasheet\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n8 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nballsystemlord - Tuesday, January 9, 2024 - link\n@Anton , The RTX 5880 shouldn't have 14,080 Tensor cores.\n\n\n\nballsystemlord - Tuesday, January 9, 2024 - link\nI mean unless there's something about the HW IDK. Likewire with the RTX 5000 which you've put down as 12,800 Tensor cores.\n\n\n\nscottj - Tuesday, January 9, 2024 - link\nIt does, though. Check the datasheet. https://nvdam.widen.net/s/nzwcv2hrtl/proviz-rtx-58...\n\n\n\nPeachNCream - Wednesday, January 10, 2024 - link\nThe China paranoia certainly helps make more China paranoia.\n\n\n\nballsystemlord - Wednesday, January 10, 2024 - link\nAll the human right abuses in the country doesn't help anything.\n\n\n\nwr3zzz - Wednesday, January 10, 2024 - link\nNvidia prices RTX4090D identical to RTX4090 so there is no way RTX5880 will be priced according to its performance. Just the name alone is enough to tell it's going to cost 5880/6000 x $6999 = $6859.\n\n\n\nBob Todd - Thursday, January 11, 2024 - link\nIndeed.  China can't buy the 6000.  They'll (mostly) happily pay 6000 money for the 5880 to gobble up as many GPUs as possible for AI/ML.\n\n\n\ntwtech - Friday, January 19, 2024 - link\nI would not be surprised if this card ends up significantly more expensive than you would think it should be, given the marginal improvement over the 5000 performance wise.  This will be the best nVidia card you can buy in China, and as such, they'll be able to charge a premium for it in that market.Everybody else - who are allowed to buy it - will probably be better served with the 6000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.
