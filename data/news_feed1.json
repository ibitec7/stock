AAPL supplier Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Technology, has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tariff policy, warning it's creating chaos for tech giants like Apple and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nWhat Happened: During an earnings call on Friday, Foxconn CEO Liu said the U.S. government\u2019s tariff strategy is causing major disruptions across the global tech supply chain.\n\"The issue of tariffs is something that is giving the CEOs of our customers a big headache now,\" Liu told investors. \"Judging by the attitude and the approach we see the U.S. government taking towards tariffs, it is very, very hard to predict how things will develop over the next year.\"\nLiu said that companies, including Apple and Amazon, are actively exploring U.S.-based manufacturing options with Foxconn. While he declined to disclose details, Liu stated that the company expects \"more and more\" production to move stateside.\nSee Also:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s New Superchip Delivers 8,470 Times The Computing Performance Of Supercomputer That Jensen Huang Donated To OpenAI\nThe news was first reported by the Financial Times.\nWhy It's Important: Foxconn's manufacturing operations are heavily concentrated in China, India, and Vietnam \u2014 all of which have been impacted or are at risk of being hit by additional tariffs.\nThe company is also building a major Nvidia Corporation NVDA server plant in Mexico.\nSubscribe to the\u00a0Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter\u00a0to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nOn Friday, Foxconn announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In the October-December quarter, Foxconn\u2019s revenue surged 15% year-over-year to NT$2.13 trillion, while gross profit climbed 15.7% to NT$131 billion. For the full year, net profit totaled NT$152.7 billion, pushing earnings per share to NT$11.01\u2014the highest in 17 years.\nThe concerns raised by Liu echo broader criticisms of the U.S. tariff policy. Previously, in an interview, Warren Buffett described tariffs as \u201can act of war\u201d and likened them to a consumer tax.\nSimilarly, Anthony Scaramucci criticized the tariffs, stating that the market disapproves of Trump\u2019s trade policies.\nImage via Shutterstock\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.\nRead Next:\n\nMark Cuban Was Asked How He\u2019d Invest $100K \u2014 His Answer?

Is It Time to Buy the Dip on the AI Leader?\n\n\n  \n      By Howard Smith\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 6:44PM\n    \n  \n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA market correction has helped drive Nvidia shares down to start 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns over economic growth and trade wars have hit the stock hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's valuation is looking downright cheap compared to the Nasdaq-100's long-term average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(5.27%)\u00a0$6.09\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.67\n\n\nPrice as of March 14, 2025, 4:00 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a rough start to the year for Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) shareholders. As of this writing, shares are down about 12% year to date and 20% below its January highs. The news from the company must be bad, right?\nWell, not exactly. Late last month, Nvidia reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for its fiscal 2025 period, which ended Jan. 26. The news was good, not bad. Nvidia impressed analysts and investors once again by exceeding both top- and bottom-line estimates. Guidance called for another jump in revenue in the current quarter to a record $43 billion. So, let's look at what has the stock plunging in 2025.\nMarket correction = opportunity\nSome of the same things that have driven the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory have caused fear and uncertainty around Nvidia stock. The Trump administration has announced -- and changed -- several applications of import tariffs that could affect Nvidia's business. On top of that, national security concerns have raised the prospects for more export restrictions on Nvidia's powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nThe tariffs themselves could have both direct and indirect implications for Nvidia. There are concerns that tariffs could hinder economic growth and create an inflationary environment. Either of those situations could negatively impact semiconductor chip sales. After all, if a company building out data center capacity believes returns on investments will be impacted, it may very well reduce or delay those investments.\nNvidia's share price skyrocketed over the last 18 months as investors forecast impressive revenue growth to continue. It's been nothing short of amazing. Sales began to soar in 2023. Revenue jumped 126% in fiscal 2024, ending Jan. 28, 2024. It didn't slow down in fiscal 2025, either. Growth of another 114% for that period ended this January, and the stock continued to run higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, until recently.\nNvidia investors shouldn't worry\nThe 22% drop from its January high mark might just be a great opportunity for those who feared they missed out on owning Nvidia stock. As of this writing, it was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just about 25 based on calendar year 2025 earnings. That's pretty attractive compared to the 10-year average P/E of 32 for the Nasdaq-100 index.\nThat's its lowest level since earnings estimates skyrocketed early last year. The stock itself has more than doubled since the start of 2024.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia still has plenty of opportunities for growth. Barring any major development of a trade war or recession, revenue should increase about 50% this year. That's mostly driven by the Blackwell AI architecture, which is now in full production. There are many business development possibilities beyond that.\nNvidia touches most everything\nThe Rubin platform will succeed Blackwell with an even more powerful AI suite of offerings. But AI is more than just data center computing power, too. Companies developing autonomous vehicle (AV) technology are also loading up on Nvidia's products for training purposes. The company says all 30 of the existing top AV data centers are powered by it.\nRevenue in its gaming segment grew to over $11 billion last year. More than 200 million gamers and creators use Nvidia GeForce GPUs (graphics processing units). Millions of developers have downloaded its Monai open-source framework for healthcare imaging AI. Perhaps most potential will come from robotics as businesses utilize that evolving technology to improve efficiency. Nvidia says over 1.3 million developers already use the Nvidia Jetson high-performance computer platform for tasks including robotics, computer vision, and generative AI.\nNvidia has many irons in the fire. While revenue growth will slow to about 50% this year, its lineup of AI chips and software stacks is unmatched and constantly improving. Add in the possible catalysts from other segments, and its very reasonable recent valuation, and it looks like a compelling time to buy the dip in Nvidia stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward Smith has positions in Nvidia.

That tailwind has been the perfect recipe for the creation of numerous trillion-dollar companies. These businesses are in an elite category.\nInvestors are certainly familiar with a smaller innovative, industry-leading enterprise that currently has a market cap of $384 billion (as of March 13). It has quickly climbed up the ranks. And I believe it deserves to be mentioned as a potential new entrant to the trillion-dollar club at some point in the future. \nCan this one unstoppable stock join Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in the $1 trillion club by 2035?\nA category leader\nIf it's not already, Netflix (NFLX 3.13%) should be on investors' radars. Its shares have catapulted 66,600% higher in the past 20 years, undoubtedly making it one of the best performers during that time. \nThat monumental rise only happened because Netflix completely disrupted the traditional media market. The company deserves credit for having created the streaming industry as we know it today.\n\n\n\n\n\n It focused intensely on innovation to find a way to offer customers a better experience compared to cable TV. As a result, Netflix surely should be talked about in the same breath as those other tech titans.\nThe company's growth has been unbelievable. Five years ago, it counted 167 million customers. Today, that figure has ballooned to 302 million, with a presence in 190 countries. Revenue has soared as well, going from $20 billion in 2019 to $39 billion last year. \nEven at its current size, the business is trying new things to keep the growth going. Netflix has cracked down on password-sharing households. It has introduced a cheaper ad-based tier to target a price-sensitive customer. And it's starting to get more involved in live events and sports. \nNetflix's profitability is noteworthy. The company's huge scale, which comes from its first-mover advantage, puts it well ahead of its rivals in the industry. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, executives are targeting a 29% operating margin, with free cash flow expected to total $8 billion. These numbers would represent an improvement from the prior year.\nNetflix has also proved that it has pricing power. The leadership team strives to keep adding more value for subscribers, providing the confidence needed to occasionally raise prices.\n\nGetting to $1 trillion\nThe market cap only needs to rise 160% to reach $1 trillion in 10 years. In the past decade, Netflix's market cap has climbed 1,320%. Expecting a slowdown is reasonable, in my opinion.\nValuation matters, too. The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 45.3. Let's assume the multiple contracts to 25 by 2035, which is not out of the question given the mature phase Netflix will be in then. Earnings per share (EPS) will need to grow by 16.7% per year to get to a $1 trillion market cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, EPS has risen at a much faster clip in the past decade. So, it's not crazy to believe that based on its trajectory, the company will enter the $1 trillion club in 10 years.\nDon't buy the stock\nNetflix might be on a clear path to the trillion-dollar mark. However, investors shouldn't take that as a sign that the stock is an automatic buy. The valuation, at that P/E of 45.3, looks too steep. This is true even with the shares trading 15% off their all-time high from February. \nNo one is going to argue with the fact that its business is doing extremely well. But this reality is fully reflected in the valuation, which I think gives investors zero margin of safety. Netflix must exceed the already lofty expectations embedded in the stock price for investors to end up with a satisfactory result. Consequently, the best course of action is to wait for a much better valuation before buying.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The Nasdaq Composite recently entered correction territory, and the index is down 8.1% year to date.\nAmong the Magnificent Seven stocks -- Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Alphabet (GOOG 1.75%) (GOOGL 1.68%) -- only Meta is still in the green so far this year.\n\nData by YCharts.\nHowever, it's not time to sound the alarm just yet. If anything, now is the time to think about bargain shopping.\nOne beaten-down Magnificent Seven stock that's looking increasingly appealing is Alphabet. It's down about 20% from February's all-time high, but its business has a ton of momentum behind it. If you're hunting for bargains in this sell-off, here are three reasons to consider Alphabet.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Alphabet continues to be a cash cow\nAlphabet has an impressive portfolio of companies: Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and Calico, among others.\nWhile some of these businesses fall into Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" segment because they're more experimental and focused on long-term innovation, companies like Google and YouTube have turned Alphabet into a premier cash cow.\nIn 2024, Alphabet generated over $350 billion in revenue, up 14% and almost $100 billion more than what it reported three years ago. Only 10 other public companies have generated more revenue in their past four quarters.\nAlphabet's impressive revenue and operating income (over $112 billion in 2024) explain how the company has managed to accumulate $96 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a large cash reserve gives Alphabet a lot of flexibility to make the appropriate investments for growth, putting it in a position to weather most economic storms that come its way. That's key to long-term stability.\n\n2. Google Cloud will be Alphabet's next major money-maker\nGoogle Cloud is Alphabet's fastest-growing segment. In the fourth quarter, its revenue increased 30% year over year to $12 billion, or 12.4% of total revenue. In the same quarter two years ago, its share of the top line was 9.6%. And five years ago, it was just 5.7%.\nIt has a ways to go to catch up to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in terms of market share, but it's very much trending in the right direction. As of Q4, AWS and Azure had a 30% and 21% market share, respectively, while Google Cloud sat at 12%.\nWith the cloud computing market projected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 16% through 2032, Google Cloud doesn't need to overtake AWS or Azure to be a lucrative business. Its existing trajectory means it will claim more market share for Alphabet while significantly increasing revenue and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe profitability part is especially true for this platform. Cloud services have a lot of fixed costs (data centers, server infrastructure, research and development, etc.), so economies of scale play a big role in boosting margins. Google Cloud is already seeing a major improvement on this front as its Q4 operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5% on a year-over-year basis. Two years ago, the segment was still reporting a loss.\n3. It's becoming too hard to ignore Alphabet's valuation\nValuation isn't everything when investing in a great long-term business, but an attractive entry point certainly helps. Alphabet is trading at less than 21 times trailing-12-month earnings, far below its average for the past five and 10 years.\nIt's also noticeably cheaper than any of the other Magnificent Seven stocks as you can see below.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet faces some risks, such as a drop in short-term ad spending if macroeconomic conditions further deteriorate and regulatory hurdles.\nHowever, the business is positioned to flourish in the long term. If the current volatility has you worried, consider dollar-cost averaging as a way to gradually build up your stake.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

MPWR between February 8, 2024 and November 8, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important April 7, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Monolithic Power Systems common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Monolithic Power Systems class action, go to\u00a0https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34600 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 7, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Monolithic Power Systems' voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and air quality issues; (2) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (3) Monolithic Power Systems had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions that it supplied to Nvidia; (4) Monolithic Power Systems' relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems' failure to adequately address such issues; and (5) as a result of the above, Monolithic Power Systems was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Monolithic Power Systems class action, go to\u00a0\u00a0 https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34600 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

But now is actually an excellent time to buy stocks because many of yesterday's highfliers are today's dirt cheap deals. So, a time of market decline represents the perfect moment to get in on a quality company at a discount, with the next step being to hang on for the long term to benefit.\nAnd today, one billionaire investor in particular may be taking advantage of this market moment. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has a long track record of success, delivering an average annual return of 30% over 30 years at Duquesne Capital Management without any money-losing years. He now manages $3.7 billion as head of the Duquesne family office.\nBut last fall, Druckenmiller said he was disappointed with one of his latest investing moves. He sold an artificial intelligence (AI) stock that's soared more than 1,900% over the past five years -- and he expressed interest in getting back in on the growth story at the right valuation. Druckenmiller has likely noticed the significant drop in this player's price in recent weeks. In my opinion, he might be buying this stock for a bargain during the Nasdaq correction.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDruckenmiller's \"big mistake\"\nDruckenmiller holds a number of tech stocks in his portfolio and has spoken favorably of AI, saying he's a long-term believer in the technology.\u00a0So, he clearly aims to be involved in this high-growth story. Yet, last year, Druckenmiller reduced his holding of AI giant Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) and finally closed out the position in the third quarter. The investor originally bought his Nvidia stake in the fourth quarter of 2022, and it rose about 700% during its time in his portfolio. The reason for Druckenmiller's actions? He thought its valuation had gotten too rich.\n\nLast year, Nvidia traded for as much as 50 times forward earnings estimates. But even with Nvidia trading at that level, Druckenmiller still considered his move \"a big mistake,\" as he said in a Bloomberg interview, adding that he would consider buying the stock again at the right valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Nvidia stock has fallen 10% in a month, leaving the shares trading at 26 times forward earnings estimates, I believe that moment may be now. I wouldn't be surprised if Druckenmiller took this opportunity to return to Nvidia, aiming to benefit from the next wave of growth ahead.\nA $1 trillion opportunity\nIt's important to remember that even though Nvidia's revenue has soared in the double and triple digits quarter after quarter, the company is still in the early chapters of the AI story. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang has said that $1 trillion of outdated computers need to be updated to accommodate accelerated computing, leaving a lot of room for growth ahead.\nThis buildout is still unfolding, with OpenAI even announcing a project to invest $500 billion over the coming four years to continue adding to AI infrastructure in the U.S. -- and Nvidia's been named a key partner. The AI market is also moving into the next phase: the application of AI to real-world situations through tools such as AI agents. This is software that can reason through problems and apply solutions.\nWhy Nvidia may excel over time\nWith its dominance in the AI chip market, full portfolio of AI products and services, and focus on innovation, Nvidia is well positioned to benefit through these stages of AI growth. The company's ability to generate high profits on sales -- with gross margin consistently surpassing 70% -- shows it can deliver both growth and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's economic and political headwinds may weigh on Nvidia in the near term, but the good news is that they don't change the company's long-term prospects. Certain savvy investors may recognize this, and one of them may be Druckenmiller.\nOf course, we can't be certain that the billionaire is buying Nvidia shares right now. Even though he clearly likes the company, any shifts in the economy or the AI landscape could have changed the investor's mind. And we don't know exactly what level he considers reasonable for Nvidia right now.\nBut considering the billionaire's comments last year, an Nvidia purchase at the moment is a reasonable possibility. Whether Druckenmiller has made the move or not, at today's levels, Nvidia still looks like a bargain for investors aiming to get in on a current and future AI winner.\n\n\n\nAdria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It's also a group of tech stocks that led the Nasdaq (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) to double-digit gains over the past two years. I'm talking about Alphabet (GOOG 1.75%) (GOOGL 1.68%), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (META 2.96%), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These tech players have all demonstrated their ability to deliver growth. In recent times, they've shown their strengths in the high-potential area of artificial intelligence (AI), a market expected to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\nSo it's no surprise that these players caught investors' fancy and soared as the AI boom progressed. But in recent times, the Magnificent Seven haven't been leading gains. Instead, they've led declines. As investors worry about the effect U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs may have on the economy, companies depending on growth have seen their shares tumble. That's left the Nasdaq in correction territory, and Magnificent Seven players at much lower valuations than a few weeks ago.\nBut here's some reassuring news: Though economic troubles may weigh on these and other companies in the near term, the long-term AI story remains hearty, with companies investing billions of dollars annually in their platforms. So now is a great time to invest in AI players with solid long-term potential. Let's check out these two bargain Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\nMeta is the leader in social media, via owning Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. More than 3.3 billion people use at least one of these platforms daily. So it's no surprise that advertisers rush to Meta to reach people where they know they can find them. This brings in billions of dollars in revenue annually for the tech giant.\nBut Meta isn't only about social media. The company has big AI ambitions and is investing accordingly. Meta is already on version four of its large language model, Llama. This is a key tool to power its AI systems, such as the AI assistant found on its social media platforms. The efforts may be in their early stages. A few weeks ago, Meta said that capital spending may reach as much as $65 billion this year as the company pursues AI growth. This includes the construction of a data center that will be so big it could cover a good part of Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will Meta eventually monetize this? Meta aims to create AI assistants for all of its users, something that could keep people on the apps longer -- and spur advertisers to spend more there. The investment may also lead to new products and services from Meta down the road.\nToday, this ambitious and profitable tech giant only trades for 23x forward earnings estimates. That's down from more than 29x just a few weeks ago, making it an excellent bargain buy.\n2. Alphabet\nYou may know Alphabet best for something many of us use daily: Google Search. The company owns this, the most popular search engine with about 90% market share, and generates revenue as advertisers connect with us there. But Alphabet has another significant source of revenue -- one that's been growing in the double digits. I'm talking about Google Cloud, the company's cloud computing unit.\nIn the recent quarter, this business delivered a 30% increase in revenue to $12 billion. This growth was led by its presence in AI. Alphabet operates a global network of data centers and builds the products and services customers need when they're developing and operating an AI platform. So, by being present across the \"full stack,\" Alphabet can gain in efficiency and keep customers coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has delivered solid results. Alphabet says its customers now use more than eight times the compute capacity that they used just eighteen months ago. This is for the key AI tasks of training and inferencing models. So, Alphabet is immediately generating revenue growth as it sells its AI products and services to customers. On top of that, the company's using its AI tools to make its own products -- such as Google Search -- better and better.\nRight now, Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, trading for 18x forward earnings estimates. That makes it a fantastic -- and bargain -- way to ride the AI investing wave.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Here are three reliable alternatives with world-class management and terrific long-term growth prospects.\n\nServer systems builder Super Micro Computer (SMCI 7.91%) was a market darling a year ago. Is it time to turn away from this disgraced industry titan and seek more reliable investment avenues in the artificial intelligence (AI) market?\nWhy I'm not jumping on the Super Micro Computer bandwagon in 2025\nSupermicro's stock had gained 2,760% in the two years leading up to March 13, 2024. Many hyperscale data centers were loading up on the company's hardware to drive their AI operations.\nBut that turned out to be the peak of Supermicro's AI surge. Several financial filings were delayed, raising questions about the company's financial reporting quality. A\u00a0few months later, the company's auditors resigned, citing unreliable data from Supermicro's management and audit committee.\u00a0The stock fell as much as 84.8% from its March highs.\nSupermicro stock is up more than 125% from November's low point, and the company has addressed many of its alleged shortcomings. The belated reports have been filed, and a new auditor was hired in a hurry. But the current auditing firm is a slight step down from global superstars Ernst & Young, and the delayed filings might still need adjustments. For long-term investors who care about reliable management teams and dependable financial reports, the company lost a lot of credibility last year. It will take time to rebuild it.\nLuckily, there are many other ways to tap into the AI opportunity -- with world-class management teams and trustworthy reports. Read on to see why I prefer investing in Alphabet (GOOG 1.75%) (GOOGL 1.68%), IBM (IBM 1.04%), and Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) right now. Before I start, let me just note that all four rely on one of the Big 4 auditor giants -- Ernst & Young for Alphabet and Pricewaterhousecoopers for IBM\u00a0and Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia isn't too expensive anymore\nI argued that Nvidia's stock price was too high for most of 2024. I even sold some of my shares in January, locking in a sweet 775% gain in less than three years.\nWell, the stock price is down 14% from that lofty perch, and it's starting to look affordable again. The rising tide of rival processor designers hasn't undermined Nvidia's leadership in the lucrative market for AI accelerators, and maybe they never will.\nMeanwhile, the company scores high in every review of its leadership quality.\u00a0Soaring stock prices surely play a part in reviews based on employee feedback, but Nvidia's top scores have a long history. For example, Glassdoor called it the best place to work in 2022, citing data collected before OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nAlphabet's recipe for lasting success\nAlphabet's Google division is another perennial name on Glassdoor's \"best places to work\" lists. Employees love the generous compensation and innovative company culture. And, of course, Alphabet is a leading provider of AI computing platforms and services.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Alphabet position started at a split-adjusted $15.03 per share in 2010. Apart from converting my vote-less Class C shares to vote-enabled Class A stubs in 2014, I haven't sold a share and am not likely to do it anytime soon. My original position has gained 992% so far, and the stock looks poised to continue growing in the long run.\nAlphabet is quite literally designed for long-term resiliency, bolstering the core operations of online search and advertising with a plethora of loosely related products and services. The next generation might know Alphabet for its self-driving Waymo taxis or maybe as the biggest name in quantum computing. Either way, Alphabet will roll with the punches and lead the technology sector into whatever era is coming up next.\nAnd don't forget that the stock looks very cheap today. Alphabet shares are changing hands at 20.5 times trailing earnings, a valuation ratio that would look modest for a mature, low-growth consumer goods business. Alphabet's sales have increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3% over the last five years, so it surely deserves a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nIBM's business-first approach to AI is paying dividends\nLast but not least, IBM tailors its AI product to business-class clients. Its data analytics and large language models (LLMs) come with data safety guarantees and auditable tracking features not found in other solutions. It took a while to clear IBM's WatsonX platform for mission-critical workloads, but Big Blue is making loyal long-term customers with every winning contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, IBM's stock has doubled in the last year, as the investor population is starting to catch on to its unheralded AI expertise. As for management quality, IBM is a textbook example of long-term planning and customer focus.\nIBM used to be my favorite low-price investment in the AI sector. Alphabet is a bit more affordable after Big Blue's recent gains, but the stock is still a great long-term investment.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia's GPUs are useful not only for AI workloads, but also across academia and industry for running simulations and doing other computing-intensive tasks.\nCUDA, Nvidia's proprietary software toolkit that allows developers to harness the power of the company's GPUs, has been around for nearly two decades. The vast ecosystem around CUDA was an enormous advantage for Nvidia when the AI boom started. With tech giants and start-ups moving fast to pull ahead in the AI race, Nvidia's GPUs were the path of least resistance.\n\nThe tide is starting to turn\nWhen the market for data center GPUs was much smaller, it made no sense for Nvidia's customers to spend the engineering resources necessary to free themselves from their dependence on CUDA. The return on investment just wasn't there.\nWith the AI boom causing an explosion in demand for data center GPUs, the math is starting to change. Nvidia's data center segment generated more than $35 billion in revenue during the latest quarter alone, and the company's profit margins are through the roof. Customers like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI are spending billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars each year on Nvidia's GPUs as they race to meet demand for AI computing capacity.\nThe stakes are now much higher. A company like Meta could save billions by cutting out Nvidia and designing its own AI chip and software stack from the ground up. This push to bring AI accelerators in-house appears to be picking up steam across the tech industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome companies, including Amazon and Alphabet, have already created multiple generations of custom AI chips. Other companies are now following suit. Meta is reportedly testing a custom AI chip aimed at AI training workloads, which are much more computationally intensive than AI inference workloads. OpenAI isn't far behind, reportedly working on finalizing its first custom AI chip design.\nCompanies that design their own AI chips and reduce dependence on Nvidia's pricey AI accelerators could have a major cost advantage over competitors that don't follow the same path. This could compel even more companies to bring AI chips in-house.\nEroding Nvidia's dominance\nWhile Nvidia does have some competition from AMD in the AI accelerator market, its own customers represent a far larger threat. The numbers are now big enough to prompt tech giants and AI companies to rethink their AI hardware and software stacks. Beyond reducing demand for Nvidia's chips, this trend could put pressure on Nvidia's pricing and margins.\nIt's only because the market for data center GPUs became so large that the CUDA stranglehold over accelerated computing is under attack. Nvidia is still selling a lot of AI chips, and it will continue to do so as long as the AI boom keeps going. Once demand for AI computing capacity cools down -- trees don't grow to the sky, after all -- growth will be tough for Nvidia as its market share erodes due to competition from homegrown AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock has already slumped from its all-time high as concerns about the resiliency of AI demand have collided with worries about tariffs and the state of the global economy. As custom AI chips make up a growing portion of the AI accelerator market, the stock could come under additional pressure.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Should You Buy The Stock?\n\n\n  \n      By Brett Schafer\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 10:30AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoreWeave is an AI cloud hyperscaler that has filed to start trading publicly soon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue is growing rapidly, but free cash flow is sharply negative. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost IPO stocks should be avoided by investors right off the bat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(5.27%)\u00a0$6.09\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.67\n\n\nPrice as of March 14, 2025, 4:00 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast growth doesn't necessarily mean good stock market returns.\n\nThe initial public offering (IPO) market has been ice-cold since 2021. In 2020 and 2021, we saw a deluge of companies entering the public markets, especially via a boom in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Many of these ended up being poorly run businesses, and some were even frauds. Ever since then, there has been a mere trickle of new stock listings, as start-ups decided to remain private.\nCould artificial intelligence (AI) be waking the IPO market up? Last week, AI cloud start-up CoreWeave filed its official financial statements in preparation for an IPO and stock listing. This is perhaps the first generative AI stock to hit the public markets. The company is backed by Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) and will be followed closely.\nLet's take a deeper look at the CoreWeave business and see whether investors should buy shares of this IPO.\nRapid growth thanks to AI\nOriginally, CoreWeave was a cryptocurrency mining operation. Crypto mining requires a lot of computing power, which led the company to acquire a ton of graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. This led to a fortuitous business model pivot. In late 2022, the cryptocurrency markets were plunging. At the same time, generative AI products were gaining traction due to the rising popularity of Chat GPT, which inspired CoreWeave to flip from being a cryptocurrency miner to being an AI cloud provider utilizing its Nvidia GPUs. In 2023, Nvidia invested $100 million in the company. \nGenerative AI tools -- at least how they are currently constructed -- require tons of computing power to train, operate, and scale. This is why big technology companies are planning to spend hundreds of billions on capital expenditures in 2025. There is a seemingly insatiable demand for cloud computing resources, which has customers lining up at the door urgently looking to spend money with these hyperscalers that provide it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoreWeave has now positioned itself as an AI-focused cloud hyperscaler, trying to compete with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. So far, this focused cloud strategy seems to be working out well. In 2022, CoreWeave generated just $15.8 million in revenue. In 2024, revenue soared to $1.9 billion, making it one of the fastest-growing businesses in the world. It is also already profitable, generating $324 million in operating income last year, just a few years after making its product pivot. \nDemand needs to show up\nCoreWeave is likely to raise billions of dollars from this IPO, in which it will sell shares to the public. It has applied to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market with the symbol CRWV.\nIt needs the money from its IPO because scaling a cloud computing business is highly capital-intensive. In 2024, CoreWeave spent $8.7 billion on capital expenditures and ended with negative $6 billion in free cash flow. In order to finance this upfront spending, the company has taken on $7.9 billion in total debt. \nIn its S-1 filing -- a document every company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before going public -- management highlights $15.1 billion in remaining performance obligations from existing customers that will be paid over the next few years. This looks great and should lead to revenue growth over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it doesn't guarantee that revenue is going to show up. CoreWeave's revenue is highly concentrated, with 62% coming just from Microsoft in 2024. Microsoft runs its own competing cloud computing business and could easily take some of its spending in-house if growth in demand slows down. We also could see a broad slowdown in AI spending at any point. With all the capital CoreWeave has laid out in preparation for AI spending to show up, a slowdown could lead things to turn south for CoreWeave, and quickly. \n\nQQQ data by YCharts\nShould you buy the CoreWeave IPO?\nUnless the current market downturn -- the Nasdaq Composite has notched a correction with its drop of more than 10% from a recent high -- continues for many months, it is likely that CoreWeave stock will come out with a premium valuation.  There will be a lot of excitement around this IPO, given that it is the first generative-AI-focused stock to go public, and it wouldn't shock me if the stock rocketed higher on its first trading day.\nThis doesn't mean you should buy the IPO. CoreWeave will likely come to market with a premium valuation while saddled with debt and burning $6 billion in free cash flow a year. That's not a great situation. The company gets over half of its revenue from one customer (Microsoft), who also happens to be a competitor. This is an immature business with a lot of risks that could materialize and bring this stock to the downside over the next few years. Savvy investors will watch how things go instead of jumping into the hype.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, it is smart to avoid IPO stocks, and this one is no exception. Most IPOs underperform the market in their first year after going public due to restrictive lockup periods and insider selling that can occur after an IPO. The same may end up happening for CoreWeave. Even if you like the CoreWeave business, keep it on your watch list for now.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

(\"Monolithic\") MPWR on behalf of those who purchased or otherwise acquired Monolithic common stock between February 8, 2024, and November 8, 2024, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The lead plaintiff deadline is April 7, 2025. CONTACT KESSLER TOPAZ MELTZER & CHECK, LLP: If you suffered Monolithic losses, you may CLICK HERE or copy and paste the following link into your browser: https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/monolithic-power-systems-inc?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=mpwr&mktm=r You can also contact attorney Jonathan Naji, Esq. by calling (484) 270-1453 or by email at info@ktmc.com.  DEFENDANTS' ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Monolithic's voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and quality control issues; (2) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (3) Monolithic had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions Monolithic supplied to Nvidia; (4) Monolithic's relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic's failure to adequately address such issues; and (5) as a result of the above, Monolithic was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:Monolithic investors may, no later than April 7, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.\u00a0 The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP encourages Monolithic investors who have suffered significant losses to contact the firm directly to acquire more information.

It can be a great idea to buy stocks on weakness if you're investing for the long term, but that doesn't mean that every struggling stock is going to recover.\nThree stocks that are down big this year but that investors should think twice about buying right now are SoundHound AI (SOUN 16.05%), Maravai LifeSciences (MRVI 1.24%), and Victoria's Secret (VSCO 5.21%). Here's why these stocks are struggling this year, and why they may not be worth buying despite their discounted valuations.\n\nSoundHound AI\nVoice artificial intelligence (AI) company SoundHound went from being a hot stock in 2024 to now being in a freefall. Investors loaded up on the stock last year when they learned that chipmaker Nvidia had invested in the business. But now, with Nvidia selling its stake, investors are once again following in the tech giant's path and also unloading their shares of SoundHound.\nSoundHound's stock is now down more than 55% since the start of the year. Arguably, some sort of a correction is warranted, given that it spiked a mammoth 836% last year. And there are still big question marks around its operations, such as whether SoundHound will be able to provide a competitive product amid a growing number of AI companies offering similar solutions.\nThe company is undeniably generating strong growth. Last year, its revenue soared 85% to $84.7 million. But that was also with the aid of acquisitions, and it posted an adjusted net loss of $69.1 million -- 19% higher than a year ago. SoundHound faces an uncertain path ahead, and while it is growing, whether it can do so organically is debatable. Investors shouldn't overlook its losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaravai LifeSciences\nAnother struggling stock is Maravai LifeSciences, which is also down around 55% this year. The healthcare company experienced a boom amid the pandemic as demand for its nucleic acid products soared, helping in the development of mRNA vaccines. But now, sales have been slowing down.\nThe company has postponed the release of its year-end earnings to next week, but the results have been far from impressive of late. Over the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, 2024, its revenue totaled $202.8 million and was down 6% year over year. Meanwhile, the company incurred an operating loss totaling $197.5 million -- including $154.2 million in goodwill impairment charges. \nWith an uncertain path forward and future profitability a big question mark, investors shouldn't assume the stock has reached a bottom. Things could get worse for Maravai as the year goes on.\n\nVictoria's Secret & Co.\nDown 59% so far in 2025, Victoria's Secret is the worst-performing stock on this list. It has taken a beating after releasing disappointing earnings numbers and offering a discouraging outlook ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe retailer is seeing some weakness in the market and projects that for the current fiscal year (which goes up until the end of January 2026), sales will be within a range of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. That suggests minimal to no growth compared to its most recent fiscal year, where it posted $6.2 billion in sales -- which were up less than 1% from the previous year.\nInvestors, however, should note that management says this forecast \"assumes that the environment will gradually get better as we move through the year.\" That's a considerable assumption to make at a time when there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy. If economic conditions don't improve, investors shouldn't be surprised to see even lower sales numbers from Victoria's Secret, as the company still appears to be factoring a bit of optimism into its guidance.\nRetail is a tough place to invest in these days. It's easier than ever for people to shift spending to other stores, including online marketplaces, in order to save money. Victoria's Secret stock is likely to continue to have a tough road ahead. Investors should tread carefully with it.\n\n\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Here's the Biggest Reason Why There's Still Time.\n\n\n  \n      By Jennifer Saibil\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 8:15AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia reported phenomenal results in its most recent quarterly earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market for generative artificial intelligence is rapidly expanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is an essential supplier of AI products and will benefit greatly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(5.27%)\u00a0$6.09\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.67\n\n\nPrice as of March 14, 2025, 4:00 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could be forgiven if you thought that Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) was a young company. It's rare for the stock of a mature business to suddenly take off after it's been on the market for a few years. But Nvidia actually went public in 1999. It had been a solid gainer for many years before generative artificial intelligence (AI) set it off higher, but it was hardly a household name.\nOver the past two years, though, it's gained 374% as generative AI becomes part of regular parlance. Armchair analysts have been dissecting Nvidia's continued potential. Is the ride over? Is it still worth buying today? No, and yes, in that order. Here's why.\nInestimable potential\nThere are varied estimates for how big the AI opportunity is going to be, but they have one thing in common: It's going to be BIG. McKinsey estimates the long-term opportunity at $4.4 trillion. According to a Harvard Business Review study in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), 81% of respondents say Generative AI is going to transform their industry, and 83% feel that if they don't use it, they're going to fall behind.\nNvidia makes the hardware that powers generative AI. There are competitors, but Nvidia is the clear leader, and partners like Amazon and Alphabet rely on it for their competitive AI programs.\n\nThe market was in suspense about Nvidia's latest earnings report, concerned that with new competition and already high sales, growth might decelerate. The company put any idea of a slowdown to rest with a blowout earnings report demonstrating a 78% year-over-year increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings per share (EPS).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the DeepSeek news sent Nvidia stock tumbling a few months ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang smartly observed that progress in the space was a win for all of the players. As generative AI takes a foothold in almost every industry, Nvidia's products become even more important, and its market becomes that much larger.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

A correction is marked by an index declining 10% from its all-time high, which isn't quite as severe as a bear market. Additionally, stocks aren't necessarily a blanket buy or sell right now. Instead, I think there are certain ones that look like great bargains and others that still seem overvalued.\nTwo stocks that I'm still not buying even after the sell-off are Apple (AAPL 1.82%) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR 8.31%). These are both incredibly popular stocks in the market, but I would need a further sell-off from them to consider buying, as they still have a very expensive price tag even after the drop.\nApple\nApple is one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world and built a strong ecosystem around its iPhones. However, Apple has struggled to launch a game-changing product over the past few years, and its sales have been flat since 2022.\n\nAAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\nAlthough Apple's revenue is trending in the right direction, it's only projected to grow revenue by a mere 4.6% in fiscal year 2025 (ending around September 30). That's not quick growth by Apple and barely edges out the effect of inflation. In fact, Apple's $378 billion in revenue in January 2022 has the same buying power as $424 billion in December 2024 (when its last quarter ended), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This means that Apple's growth over the past three years has fallen behind the rate of inflation, which isn't a good sign.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this, Apple still has a massive premium over its peers and the stock market.\n\nAAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\nWith the stock trading for nearly 30 times forward earnings, it's still far more expensive than it has been for the better part of two years. It's also valued at nearly 50% higher than the S&P 500, which trades at 21.2 times forward earnings. While brand value deserves some recognition, Apple's growth is projected to be far below the average growth rate of the S&P 500 (10%), which is a big red flag for me.\n\nFurthermore, other members of the Magnificent Seven are valued at much lower price tags (like Alphabet priced at 18.6 times forward earnings, Meta Platforms at 24.4 times forward earnings, and Nvidia at 25.7 times forward earnings), despite growing at a much faster rate. Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia grew revenue at an 11.8%, 20.3%, and 77.9% pace, respectively, in their most recent quarters. So it doesn't make a ton of sense to be buying Apple stock right now, as it's still highly priced. As a result, I'd rather look at some of Apple's peers than Apple itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalantir\nPalantir is nearly the exact opposite of Apple in terms of growth. It makes AI-driven data analytics software used by both government and commercial entities. Its growth has been accelerating as the demand for its AI software ramps up, making Palantir one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.\n\nPLTR Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\nThat growth is expected to persist, with management guiding for $860 million in revenue in the first quarter, indicating a 36% growth rate. Palantir's management has a track record of under-guiding and over-delivering, so don't be surprised if this growth rate reaches nearly 40% when it reports Q1 results.\nDespite this strength, Palantir's stock has fallen over 30% from its all-time high, but I don't think that decline is steep enough. The problem is that Palantir's stock is so highly valued that even 40% growth over the next four years doesn't justify the stock price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Palantir could grow its revenue at a 40% pace over the next four years (Wall Street analysts expect 32% and 26% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively), it would have revenue of $11 billion. While that's a large increase from the $2.87 billion in revenue it's generating right now, it still isn't enough from a profit standpoint.\nPalantir's current profit margin is about 16%, but let's say it can increase that to 30%, which would place it among the best software companies in terms of profit margin. It would generate $3.3 billion in profits if it can do that. Still, even after monster growth that nobody is projecting and industry-leading margins, Palantir's stock would still trade for 59 times forward earnings.\nThat's a massive premium to pay for a stock, especially when you consider that the stock price can't budge from today's levels over the next four years to fulfill that projection.\nWith so much growth already baked into Palantir's stock, it would have to fall a lot further before I'd consider taking a position in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But Is It a Buy?\n\n\n  \n      By James Brumley\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 6:10AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has been the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext-generation AI will need solutions beyond Nvidia\u2019s high-powered GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne well-proven consumer-facing company stands ready to meet the demand for practical AI solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$3.0T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(5.27%)\u00a0$6.09\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$121.67\n\n\nPrice as of March 14, 2025, 4:00 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI business is evolving as it matures, creating opportunities for new leaders.\n\nThere's no two ways about it. Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) has been the proverbial talk of the town since 2023, shortly after OpenAI launched ChatGPT to start what would turn into a heated race for dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nWhile Nvidia had been using its graphics processing technology for AI purposes well before that, this was a clear growth catalyst. Now more than 80% of Nvidia's revenue is in its AI data center business, making that division nearly 10 times as big as it was just three years ago.\nThe stock has responded accordingly, of course. Not only has it earned a spot as one of the\u00a0 \"Magnificent Seven\" tickers, but it's outperformed all six other stocks in each of the past two years to become the planet's second-biggest company, as highlighted by The Motley Fool's own research arm.\nBut as the old adage goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Is Nvidia ready to repeat the feat, and then repeat it again and again for the foreseeable future? Keep reading.\nThe AI market that Nvidia dominates is changing quickly\nThere's little doubt that the artificial intelligence revolution is still in its early stages. Mordor Intelligence predicts that the AI hardware market alone is set to grow at an average annualized pace of 26% through 2030. Given Nvidia's dominance of the AI accelerator industry, this rising tide bodes well for the company as well as its shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd all things considered, Nvidia stock's forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 26 isn't an unreasonable premium to pay for an equity of this sort. This year's top line is expected to soar more than 50%, after all, pulling per-share profits up the same amount with it.\nBut, there's some thing else to consider.\nIt's not always easy to see, but most veteran investors can -- and will -- attest to the fact that things change in ways that only become obvious after the fact. The problem is, by then it doesn't matter.\nThe brewing change that should concern anyone interested in stepping into a stake in Nvidia at this time is the way the artificial intelligence hardware industry is evolving. While Nvidia is still the king of the industry, changes are surfacing. For instance, other compute-processing architecture designed by chip-design company Arm Holdings (ARM 5.26%) is not only proving more efficient for power-hungry applications like AI, but is proving more functional in terms of how artificial intelligence platforms increasingly operate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, while Nvidia's core technology can successfully power both inference-based and training-based AI, as artificial intelligence tech becomes better developed and more specialized, Arm's inference-processing tech is emerging as a favored approach. Many industry experts consider inference to be the future of AI.\n\nEven to the extent Nvidia can hold its own as inference-based models propagate, Nvidia is also now showing the world that it can't keep competitors at bay forever. Although it's modest progress, a growing number of AI service providers like TensorWave, Cirrascale, Vultr, and even Oracle and Microsoft  are now buying Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD 2.92%) newest artificial intelligence processors -- business that at one point in time would have almost certainly been Nvidia's to lose. Now it is. And AMD is arguably positioned to keep chipping away on this front.\u00a0\nIt's a worry for Nvidia's fans and investors simply because they've never actually seen the company face credible competition like this within the AI arena. Finally seeing it could cast bearish doubts, crimping the premium valuation that most people didn't mind supporting through this point.\nAnd never even mind the looming advent of quantum computing, which has enormous implications for the artificial intelligence industry with its whole new kind of computing potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is, there's an alternative Magnificent Seven stock that is a compelling AI buy at this time.\nA better artificial intelligence prospect\nDon't panic if you already own Nvidia. You're hardly doomed. You'll likely be fine, in fact. A lackluster Nvidia is still a better bet than plenty of other companies on their best days.\nIf you're looking for a company with more artificial intelligence growth opportunity ahead of it than behind it, though, that company is Apple (AAPL 1.82%).\nNot everyone sees it. Interest in the company's generative AI solution (called Apple Intelligence) released in October of last year has been ho-hum. It did not spur a great deal of demand for the iPhone 16 introduced in September, even though that device is capable of directly running the Apple Intelligence app rather than punting AI work to the cloud. iPhone revenue for the quarter ending in December fell a bit year over year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. Apple's AI product itself is far from finalized, and perhaps more than that, consumers aren't quite ready to embrace the relatively new and unfamiliar technology. They will be, though. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts that Apple's artificial intelligence effort will \"spark a multiyear upgrade cycle that will result in a supercycle and ultimately drive iPhone growth.\"\nThen there's Apple's work on the artificial intelligence chip design and manufacturing front.\nWhile it's still not exactly clear how it intends to monetize them, reporting from last year indicates the company is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom on Arm-based AI processors specifically meant for data centers. Most plausibly Apple will use them to serve iPhone owners and iOS users who choose to use Apple's existing and future artificial intelligence tools, keeping its customers in Apple's typical walled-off silo.\nNever say never, though. Apple has taken a somewhat surprising step by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, giving iPhone owners a seamless means of using the third-party AI platform. It may be a hint that the technology giant is willing to entertain other growth-minded partnerships in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about the rise of quantum computing that poses a threat to Nvidia? Apple's artificial intelligence efforts have always been consumer-focused rather than on institutional needs. Quantum's high-level nature is mostly a non-factor for Apple.\nRegardless of what's in store for Apple, Nvidia isn't likely to remain the rockstar stock it's been until now. You could certainly do worse than Nvidia, but you could very plausibly do better, too. The artificial intelligence hardware is simply changing a bit too much now to not disrupt this vulnerably valued stock's story.\n\n\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

And that type of ambiguity is making markets nervous.\n\nThere has been a significant reevaluation of risk and a sentiment shift to the downside for markets, said Jim Baird, the chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. He services clients with net worths beginning at $500,000, which he calls the \"millionaire-next-door\" type. In other words, they aren't yet in the ultrawealthy range where they can sit a downturn out or resort to private investments.This group of investors has enough exposure to public markets that it could seriously impact their wealth. It's a predicament that has put money managers at the forefront of rethinking their clients' exposures relative to their needs amid a rapidly shifting economic environment.\n\nBaird isn't expecting a near-term recession but is concerned about the risk of stagflation, when inflation and unemployment both remain high. For that, he's assessing whether clients have enough cash to cover their monthly needs and any big payments they may have coming up. This helps them avoid selling equities when the market is down. It's typically known as the emergency fund. But clients who are retired or nearing retirement should aim to have six to 12 months of their needs in cash. As for those who still have a wage and aren't worried about losing it, carrying too much cash doesn't make sense, he added.He is also coaching clients on strategic asset allocation while reviewing their portfolio positioning. When the stock market is volatile, it could be an opportunity to move some positions around, he noted. But those decisions would be made based on an individual client's needs. For example, if they don't have enough exposure in large caps, this could be a time to top that position while offloading other areas that could be used for tax-loss-harvesting purposes.\"Coming off of the last few years, equity investors, in particular, have done pretty well,\" Baird said. And so they may be in a decent position to reduce portfolio risk without risking their ability to meet their long-term goals and objectives.\"\n\nFor those who don't want to take too much risk on stocks or are already dependent on their investment portfolio, he advises them to lean into high-quality bonds that still provide a good enough yield. But he doesn't suggest longer-duration bonds in case there's an uptick in inflation.Ken Mahoney, the CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, advises those with net wealth between $1 million to $ 10 million in assets. He has been helping clients trim some of their positions since late last year and into 2025. But not because of the trade wars, per se: He was concerned that the stock market hadn't seen a correction in some time and expected a 10% pullback at some point.While things look gloomy right now, he's also prepared for a large change in the president's tone and policy that could bring markets flying back. His strategy with clients has been to remain tactical while watching for positive signs of change.\n\nFor those who feel like they missed the curve and the market has already turned for the worst, Mahoney says it's not too late. Investors can still make some tactical moves. Just see this as a time when the good stuff is on sale and go shopping for high-quality stocks.He expects a rally back into Big Tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia when the market begins to recover\u2014 although he can't guarantee when that will happen. But since these names are the most liquid stocks, institutions will add them back into their portfolios as fast as they offloaded them, he said. These companies are also supported by strong fundamentals, big balance sheets, and hefty cash, and they remain key to long-term technological innovations.However, there's still risk in the market, which means sectors like small caps may not be the place to go looking for sales. Mahoney is only sticking to the Mag 7 and potentially other stocks with relative balance sheet strength.\n\n\"We are growth managers, so that is where we will stay focused in looking to nibble at tech, and the key word there is nibble as this is not a place to get aggressive at all,\" Mahoney said. \"We like to buy high and sell higher and buy confirmed strength more in the markets we had in 2023 and 2024.\"Once the indexes start making higher lows, Mahoney would consider becoming slightly more aggressive because it's an early sign that the selling pressure is subsiding. Another sign he'll be looking for is the cooling off of the CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of the S&P 500's expected volatility.In the meantime, for investors looking for broader exposure, he suggests dollar-cost averaging \u2014 buying fixed amounts at regular intervals \u2014 into the indexes if they have time to stay in the market. That's because once we correct, you can gain an extra 10% from the reversal, Mahoney noted. And if we remain in freefall, that means more shares at a lower price, he added.\n\nThat said, you'll want some cash or what Wall Street calls \"dry powder\" to set aside so you can buy. He recommends keeping that cash in money markets that can be liquidated at the par value of $1 at any point, making them a more flexible option over bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\nInvesting\n\n\nEconomy\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nRecession\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

IDC anticipates spending on AI, including infrastructure and business services, to reach $632 billion by 2028. \nAI promises to bring greater efficiency to business operations and labor productivity, but it will require substantial investment in advanced chips to make AI smarter. The following stocks of leading chip companies could offer upside of 39% to 48% based on the average analyst price target.\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD 2.92%) has played runner-up to Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for many years. But these are the main suppliers of general-purpose GPUs, which have left AMD with a profitable market to fill out on its own. The average price target on Wall Street is currently $148.34, implying upside of 51% over the recent $98 share price.\n\nAMD's revenue grew 14% year over year in 2024, while non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share grew 25%. The company has enjoyed strong demand for its Ryzen central processing units (CPUs), in addition to GPUs for data centers. AMD's data center business made up half of its $25.7 billion in total revenue last year. \nStill, Wall Street was disappointed that AMD did not provide specific revenue guidance for its data center GPUs in its fourth-quarter earnings report. After offering guidance throughout 2024, analysts took this as a weak signal for near-term sales momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, AMD's chips made for gaming and other markets are still experiencing weak demand, with revenue down in these segments. It's also not yet clear what impact tariffs might have on the chip industry, but AMD's conservative valuation may already be pricing this risk in.\nConcerns over AMD's sales momentum may be overblown, as management cited strong customer interest for its upcoming Instinct MI350 GPUs launching later this year. The stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21, which is modest for a growing chip company and could justify the shares climbing back toward Wall Street's price target over the next year or so.\n2. Arm Holdings\nArm Holdings (ARM 5.26%) designs chips that are used in virtually every smartphone, cloud computing, and several other markets. After falling 40% off its recent highs, Wall Street analysts are still bullish on the stock's return prospects with an average price target of $158.43, implying 41% upside over the recent $112 share price.\n\nArm-based processors are in high demand for their low cost and high energy efficiency. With the escalating costs of investing in AI infrastructure, in addition to the increasing power needs of large data centers, Arm is in a strong competitive position.\n\n\n\n\n\nArm's revenue grew 19% year over year to $983 million in the most recent quarter. It earns revenue from royalties and licensing fees, which allows the company to convert more than half of its revenue into free cash flow. \nMore products and devices will become more technologically advanced, especially with AI. This could spell significant growth for Arm, which already has a strong presence in edge computing markets including the Internet of Things, smart home devices, and self-driving car systems. \nThe only thing that may keep Arm stock from reaching the consensus price target in 2025 is valuation. The stock trades at an ultra-expensive 191 times free cash flow and 148 times earnings. Even using 2026 earnings estimates, the stock still looks fully valued at 55 times forward estimates. \nA high valuation is why the stock has remained volatile over the last year despite strong demand for Arm-based processors. Investors could remain flat in 2025 until the company's growth catches up to its high earnings multiple.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has positions in Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

Here's the 1 Worth Buying Right Now.\n\n\n  \n      By Adam Levy\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Mar 16, 2025 at 4:15AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nasdaq saw a rapid decline as fears of tariffs on Taiwanese imports hit chipmakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company were some of the worst-hit stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors should focus on how tariffs will impact each business long term to find real value today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYSE: TSM\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$903B\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(1.46%)\u00a0$2.50\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$174.09\n\n\nPrice as of March 14, 2025, 4:00 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fears driving the market lower won't have as big of a long-term impact on this chipmaker.\n\nIt's been a long time since investors have had to face the reality that stock prices can, indeed, decline. You have to go back all the way to Oct. 2023 to find the last time one of the major stock indexes fell more than 10% from its all-time high, marking what's known as a correction.\nSometimes those corrections are slow and gradual, as in 2023, and other times the losses come much more swiftly -- as they did recently. From Feb. 19 through Mar. 10, the Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 13%.\nThe sell-off was fueled by President Donald Trump's trade policies and fears that he would enact additional tariffs on Taiwan, a key supplier of chips used in AI data centers. As a result, some of the biggest movers were the artificial intelligence stocks that pushed the Nasdaq to new all-time highs in February.\nNvidia (NVDA 5.27%), Broadcom (AVGO 2.18%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 1.46%) all saw huge drops in their stock prices. Combined, they lost $1.16 trillion in market cap during that period.\nWhile it might be tempting to pick up shares of all three companies at these lower prices, one of them stands out as an incredible value with a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe big fear driving AI stocks lower\nThere are numerous factors that have led to the drop in AI stocks over the last few weeks. Greater economic uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence as U.S. trade policies increase geopolitical tensions. If there's one thing markets hate, it's uncertainty.\nPerhaps the biggest uncertainty hitting chipmakers, though, is the potential for the Trump administration to enact new tariffs on Taiwan, home of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Nearly all of the biggest chipmakers, including Nvidia and Broadcom, rely on TSMC to produce and package their chips. The foundry, as chip manufacturers are called, attracts nearly two-thirds of all spending on chip fabrication.\nA tariff on Taiwan would substantially increase costs for Nvidia and Broadcom (and practically every other chipmaker). As a result, they'd have to increase their prices or take a hit to their profit margins (probably both).\n\nHigher prices also means they could see lower demand for their chips. While the big tech companies buying Nvidia and Broadcom chips have massive budgets, they don't have infinite money. And with increasing pressure on those companies to show meaningful returns on their investments, there's probably not much room in the budget to increase spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lower demand works its way back to TSMC, which faces the challenge of substantial fixed costs. Lower utilization rates of its facilities means it could see a big drag on profitability if tariffs go into effect or demand declines for any other reason.\nTSMC has tried to take matters into its own hands to appeal to the Trump administration. It committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the U.S. on top of its plans to expand its facilities in Arizona over the next two years. If the current administration wants more chip manufacturing to take place in the U.S., TSMC is signalling its willingness to make that happen.\nThinking long term\nAmid the current sell-off, it's important for investors to think about the long-term potential of any investment.\nNvidia's position looks most precarious in the long run. Higher costs for its chips could accelerate a shift from its biggest customers to more cost-efficient alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta Platforms is already working on a custom AI accelerator chip for training its Llama foundational models. It's reportedly aiming to use those chips for training by 2026. It currently uses its own chips for machine learning and expanding its use to AI inference this year. The other three hyperscalers have expressed similar aspirations and have seen good results with their custom silicon.\nIt's worth noting Meta and Alphabet both rely on Broadcom's technology to create custom chips. So, rising costs could end up benefiting Broadcom's custom AI accelerator business. Management said it expects that business combined with its network solutions to reach a serviceable addressable market between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. However, its networking chips remain a substantial portion of that business, so the effect could be muted.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, might not be as impacted long term as some might think. It's hard to overstate how big its technology lead is. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called TSMC \"the world's best by an incredible margin.\"\nSwitching from TSMC to another foundry isn't a viable option for Nvidia, Broadcom, or most of its other most core customers. First of all, there aren't many options that have the manufacturing scale they need. Increasing production capacity takes a long time. Second of all, these chips are designed with TSMC's processes. In some cases, they're designed with custom TSMC processes, such as Nvidia's Blackwell platform. It would take months of redesign and validation to switch to a competitor. Lastly, the resulting product would likely decline in quality as other foundries can't match TSMC's capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in the AI stock with staying power and great value\nTSMC likely has the most sustainable long-term competitive advantage, and that's a self-reinforcing phenomenon. As TSMC attracts more revenue for high-end chip designs than any other foundry, it's able to invest more in research and development, new equipment, and capacity expansion, thus positioning it to win even more contracts in the future.\n\nWhile the foundry could see a downward blip in demand, it doesn't face a significant competitive threat. What's more, demand should remain relatively stable as hyperscalers switch to lower-cost alternative GPUs or their own custom silicon. TSMC has contracts with all of them, including Meta for its new custom AI chip.\nMost importantly, the stock trades for an absolute bargain. After the sell-off in recent weeks, investors can buy it for less than 20 times forward earnings estimates as of this writing. Even if it does see some margin contraction and slower demand growth in the short term, that's a price that can easily absorb the hit for a company with otherwise incredible growth prospects and strong competitive advantages.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This is an alarming turn of events for a Wall Street darling that has benefited from two big hype cycles: generative AI and the election of Donald Trump. \nLet's dig deeper to find out if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal to stay far away from an increasingly volatile tech stock.\n\nWhat has changed for Palantir?\nSince hitting public markets through an initial public offering (IPO) in October 2020, Palantir has always enjoyed a bit of a cult following. For years, the CIA-funded start-up made a name for itself by helping government and military clients with big data analytics -- playing a crucial role in the War on Terror when the company helped the U.S. track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011.\nBut even at the start of its public trading, Palantir was more hype than substance. After the IPO boom, shares languished for around four years until the generative artificial intelligence (AI) hype cycle reignited interest in the company. The expectation is that generative AI will allow Palantir to improve its data analytics capabilities -- even offering real-time insights during fast-paced scenarios like battlefields or law enforcement operations.\nThe synergy is undeniable. Large language models (LLMs) need large amounts of data, which Palantir already handles for its clients. General AI will be yet another tool in its tool kit as it helps organizations optimize their operations, detect fraud, and accomplish critical missions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA story of hype over fundamentals \nWhile Palantir has clear synergies with generative AI, that isn't actually translating to booming growth. In full-year 2020 (two years before ChatGPT introduced the world to generative AI), Palantir's revenue grew by 47%. However, by the full year 2024, the growth rate fell to 29%, which indicates that the new tech isn't exactly a game changer.\nFor comparison, an AI winner like Nvidia saw its top-line growth increase from 53% to 114% over the same time frame.\nDespite not being a major AI winner, Palantir's stock price climbed a whopping 722% over the last five years, slightly outpacing Nvidia's 704%. This dynamic shows how much hype is built into Palantir's valuation.\n\nPLTR data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nPalantir's bottom-line situation is also disappointing. While the company reports adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $379.5 million, this adds back a whopping $281.8 in stock-based compensation, which is company equity given to employees. While this allows Palantir to save cash, it can increase the number of shares outstanding and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.\nDoes Palantir have a Trump card?\nTrump's election victory has been another source of hype for Palantir (shares rose more than 60% since Nov. 5.). But just like with AI, this presents few fundamental advantages for the company. Trump has been working to reduce U.S. federal spending. Under new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon plans to slash its budget by 8% (around $50 billion annually) every year for the next five years.\nU.S. government clients made up around 42% of Palantir's revenue in 2024. With Uncle Sam set to tighten his belt over the coming years, Palantir could be in hot water. \nFurther challenges come from overseas government clients like the armed forces of Ukraine, which uses Palantir's software for targeting in its war with Russia. Trump is working to wind down this conflict, potentially cutting more of the company's vital revenue stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir stock is a screaming sell \nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E)\u00a0multiple of 135, Palantir's stock price doesn't account for the company's many challenges. Top-line growth is decent but not spectacular, while extreme stock-based compensation expense eats into its bottom line. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is shaping up to be a challenge, not an opportunity. \nPalantir shares have already fallen 37% from their all-time high, and unfortunately, even more downside looks inevitable.\n\n\n\nWill Ebiefung has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

He also purchased 1.4 million shares of Vistra (VST 5.47%), more than doubling his stake. Vistra is a power-generation company that could benefit if artificial intelligence boosts data center electricity demand.\nImportantly, shares of Amazon and Vistra have declined about 10% since the fourth quarter ended, but Wall Street expects both stocks to rebound sharply in the coming months, as detailed below:\n\nAmazon has a median target price of $270 per share, which implies 36% upside from its current share price of $198.\nVistra's median target price is $192 per share, implying 55% upside from its current share price of $124.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Amazon\nAmazon has three important growth engines: e-commerce, digital advertising, and public cloud services. And it's using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve revenue and operating efficiency across all three segments. In particular, Amazon is an underappreciated AI leader in retail and cloud computing, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in the world outside of China, and it supports its merchants with a vast logistics network. To reinforce its strong market presence, the company uses machine learning models to recommend products, optimize inventory allocation, and plan delivery routes. Those efforts have already led to an uptick in margins.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud in terms of sales and the most popular cloud among developers. That alone positions the company as a winner in the AI boom. But the company is also innovating quickly. CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"In the last 18 months,\u00a0AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and generative AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined.\"\nAmazon looked strong in the fourth quarter, despite missing sales estimates in the adtech segment. Revenue increased 10% to $187 billion,\u00a0operating margin expanded more than 3 percentage points, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings rose 86% to $1.00 per diluted share. Management also said cloud revenue could have grown faster had AWS not been capacity-constrained.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to grow at 21% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look quite reasonable. So, why did Tepper sell Amazon in the fourth quarter? I suspect he was rebalancing his portfolio, but I doubt he has lost conviction in the stock. Amazon was still his second-largest holding when the quarter ended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Vistra\nVistra is an integrated power-generation and retail electricity company. Its portfolio of coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy facilities collectively offers 41,000 megawatts of generation capacity, making Vistra the largest competitive power producer in the United States. It also owns the second-largest nuclear fleet in the country.\nVistra primarily operates in the ERCOT (Texas) and PJM (13 eastern states) markets, which positions it to benefit from increased manufacturing activity, electrification of the Permian Basin, and increased electricity consumption from AI data centers. Demand through 2030 in those regions is forecast to grow nearly three times faster than it did in the past decade.\nVistra reported solid fourth-quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), which excludes the unrealized gains and losses on contracts used to hedge against energy price volatility, rose 107% to $1.9 billion.\u00a0But the stock fell sharply following the report because investors were disappointed that Vistra has yet to sign deals to supply power to big tech data centers.\nOn that point, investors have reason to question how much AI data centers will boost electricity demand. In recent technical papers, Chinese start-up DeepSeek claimed to have trained AI models comparable to those from U.S. companies like OpenAI, but DeepSeek did so with fewer and less powerful Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, some of the anticipated electricity demand may not materialize, and I doubt that possibility has been fully priced into the stock. Vistra currently trades at 17.5 times free cash flow, a substantial premium to the two-year average of 11.8 times free cash flow. That makes the stock somewhat risky.\nAdmittedly, Vistra shares could soar if the company signs data center power deals with big tech companies. But right now, I would rather own an index fund that tracks the utilities sector as opposed to this specific stock because the latter strategy involves more concentration risk.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia is banned by Washington from selling its advanced H100 and H800 chips from the Hopper series to China-based clients.Advertisement"

United States Steel became the first $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later in 2018, Apple became the first enterprise to achieve a valuation of $1 trillion. \nApple remains the world's largest company with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. But since 2018, several other American organizations have joined it in the trillion-dollar club, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla and Broadcom were also members until they recently suffered sharp declines in their stock prices.\nI think one more company has the potential to cross the $1 trillion milestone in the coming years. Oracle (ORCL 1.09%) operates some of the best data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) development, and management's guidance suggests this part of its business could grow tenfold over the long term.\nOracle is valued at $403 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could earn a whopping 148% gain if it does join the $1 trillion club.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDemand for AI data centers is through the roof\nThere are two key phases involved in developing an AI model: The training phase is when a developer feeds the model mountains of data for it to learn from, and the inference phase is when the model accepts inputs from users and generates responses (like when you interact with a chatbot). Both require a substantial amount of computing power, and most developers source it from companies like Oracle.\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle operates some of the best AI data centers in the world. They are fitted with state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) from leading suppliers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which are chips specifically designed to handle AI workloads. In fact, Oracle is currently building a cluster of 64,000 Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs -- not only is that the most powerful chip in the industry right now, but this will also be one of the largest clusters on offer by any data center operator. \nWhen developers have access to more chips, they can process more data, more quickly, and thus deploy much \"smarter\" AI models. But scale isn't Oracle's only advantage, because its proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology allows data to move from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, this can result in significant cost savings.\nOracle opened its 101st data center cloud region during its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended on Feb. 28), but demand continued to significantly outstrip supply. In fact, chairman Larry Ellison said GPU usage for AI training purposes alone has soared by a staggering 244% over the last 12 months, and the company is also seeing \"enormous\" demand for inference workloads. \nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks next-generation AI reasoning models, which spend more time \"thinking\" before rendering responses, will consume 100 times more computing power than their predecessors. As a result, demand for data center capacity for inference workloads is only just heating up, so it's no surprise Oracle wants to grow its footprint to between 1,000 and 2,000 cloud regions over the long term. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Oracle could eventually have over 10 times more data centers in operation than it does today.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue is soaring\nOracle generated $14.1 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 third quarter, but the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment (which is where the company accounts for its AI data centers) represented just $2.7 billion of that figure. \nHowever, while Oracle's total revenue increased by just 6% year over year, OCI revenue soared by 49%, making it the fastest-growing part of the entire organization by a wide margin. The OCI business would be growing even faster if it had enough data centers to meet demand, which is why the company expects revenue growth to significantly accelerate as more capacity comes online. \nOracle CEO Safra Catz expects OCI revenue to increase by more than 50% for the fiscal 2025 full year (ending May 31), with an even faster growth rate in the cards for fiscal 2026. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo put a fine point on Oracle's future potential, the company's remaining performance obligations (RPOs) soared by 63% to a record high of $130 billion (across all business segments) during the third quarter. RPOs are like an order backlog that is expected to convert into revenue in the future, and Larry Ellison said demand for capacity for AI training and inference workloads were big drivers of the Q3 surge. \nOracle's path to the $1 trillion club\nOracle generated $4.26 in earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.8. That is roughly on par with the valuations of other AI cloud companies like Microsoft and Amazon, so the stock isn't necessarily cheap, nor is it expensive:\n\nPE Ratio data by YCharts\nHowever, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo!) suggests Oracle could deliver $6.78 in EPS during fiscal 2026 (which begins in June 2025). That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 21.1, implying it would have to rise by 59% over the next year or so just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 33.8.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that scenario plays out, it would lift Oracle's valuation to $640 billion. From there, the company could reach the $1 trillion club within five years if it grows its EPS by just 9.3% annually. I think that is very achievable for two reasons: First, the company's estimated EPS for fiscal 2026 represents growth of 13%, and second, management is forecasting accelerating revenue growth, led by the OCI business.\nOracle's data centers rely heavily on automation, which reduces labor and other operating costs. As a result, the company anticipates rising profit margins as the OCI business continues to scale up, which will boost its EPS overall. Remember, Oracle plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold from here, which could drive explosive earnings growth over the long term.\nTherefore, I think Oracle has a clear path to joining the $1 trillion club in the coming years, and its stock could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

However, that momentum seems lost now, considering the tech-heavy index has declined about 10% in 2025. The U.S. market is now concerned about a potential U.S. recession and the impact of new trade policies -- fears that the Trump administration has failed to calm.\nIn the face of heightened market volatility and low investor confidence, some prominent analysts expect the Nasdaq to see even more selling in the coming days. While this pullback is worrisome, it can also prove to be a smart time to buy stakes in some fundamentally strong Nasdaq stocks that have seen a significant correction.\nHere's why Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) and Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) fit the bill. Let's assess why these stocks could prove compelling picks now.\nNvidia\nNvidia released a strong fiscal 2025 performance (ended Jan. 31, 2025) on Feb. 26, with revenue growing 114% year over year to $130.5 billion and operating income rising 147% to $81.5 billion. While the company faces gross margin pressures due to the ongoing ramp of Blackwell architecture chips, it expects gross margins to revert to mid-70s levels in fiscal 2026.\n\nBlackwell architecture chips are undoubtedly a major growth catalyst for Nvidia and contributed $11 billion in sales in the fourth quarter. These chips have been designed mainly for inference (deploying and running AI models) and reasoning workloads, with 25 times higher token output and 20 times lower cost than previous H100 chips. Reasoning is a special use case in inference workloads, involving more computation per task for resolving complicated and multistep problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides inference, Blackwell architecture has been optimized for all other AI workloads, including pre-training and post-training deployed across cloud, on-premise, and enterprise. Unsurprisingly, major cloud service providers, such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet, are using Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) to process their AI workloads.\nNvidia accounted for almost a 92% share of the data center GPU market (AI hardware market) in 2024. The company has also created a strong moat for its hardware business with its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack (a comprehensive parallel programming development environment optimized for running AI and high-performance computing workloads on Nvidia chips).\nSince CUDA is already well-adopted by developers and AI researchers globally, switching to competitors' chips can involve significant costs for client organizations. Subsequently, Nvidia's hardware-software offerings are finding applications in new use cases in areas such as agentic AI, robotics, sovereign AI, and autonomous vehicles.\nDespite the many pros, investors are disappointed with Nvidia's decelerating data center growth and margin pressures amid a difficult macroeconomic environment marked by export controls, tariff wars, and surging geopolitical pressures. Subsequently, Nvidia's shares have tanked by nearly 28% from their 52-week high ($149.43 as of Jan. 6).\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is trading at just under 20 times sales, significantly lower than its historical five-year average of 26.2, and at 36.4 times trailing-12-month earnings, lower than its historical five-year average of 71.6. More impressively, Nvidia's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is just 0.25, which is modest for a company with exceptional growth prospects. Considering Nvidia's AI market leadership, robust hardware-software ecosystem, and corrected valuation, the stock may be a smart buy now.\nMicrosoft\nShares of Microsoft are down by about 10% in 2025. While the fall is not as steep as seen in Nvidia stock, the dip has created an attractive entry point for astute investors.\nMicrosoft came out with a healthy financial performance in the second-quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024), with revenue rising 12% year over year to $69.6 billion and net income increasing 10% to $24.1 billion. Despite this, the stock performed negatively due to investor concerns about weak third-quarter guidance and a slowdown in the Azure cloud services business due to capacity constraints.\nHowever, Microsoft is well-positioned to benefit from a phenomenon termed as Jevons Paradox. Accordingly, increased price performance gains for AI hardware and software in inference workloads will lead to exponentially greater access and demand for AI hardware and software services. The company's strategic partnership with OpenAI has also been a major pillar of its AI strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter, commercial bookings were up by 67% year over year, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. With OpenAI's cutting-edge AI models, Microsoft has revamped its entire product ecosystem. Furthermore, since OpenAI's application programming interfaces (APIs) currently run primarily on Azure, it helps Microsoft further attract clients to its cloud platform.\nThe tech giant is also at the forefront of the ongoing agentic AI revolution with its CoPilot offerings. Microsoft 365 CoPilot is seeing strong adoption across enterprises of all sizes. Coupled with CoPilot Chat and CoPilot Studio, Microsoft is aggressively pushing forth the usage of AI agents in organizational workflows.\nMicrosoft's shares trade at just over 30 times trailing-12-month earnings, which seems rich for a company with moderate growth numbers. However, that valuation is cheaper than its historical five-year average of 33.2. The company also returned a hefty $9.7 billion to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter.\nThe company's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPOs, indicative of future revenue that can be earned from existing contracts) were $298 billion at the end of the second quarter. Thanks to high long-term revenue visibility, Microsoft enjoys a premium valuation. Hence, it makes sense to pick at least a small stake in this stock now.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

If that is the only source for products, then consumers or businesses may hold out on purchasing them to wait out tariffs in the hope that they will be reduced.\nFurthermore, if products become more expensive in general due to tariffs, it could reduce consumer confidence and cause spending to drop across the board.\nMany investors are worried about this, which is why the stock market has sold off so heavily over the past week. However, I think three companies can weather the storm caused by President Trump's tariff policies, and each looks like a strong buy following the sell-off.\nNvidia and Broadcom are important hardware providers\nMany companies could (and likely will) emerge on the other side of these tariffs just fine, but I'm focusing on AI hardware suppliers, as these are the companies most affected by tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 1.46%), and Broadcom (AVGO 2.18%) are all crucial suppliers for AI hyperscalers, and I think they will be just fine amid the tariffs.\nThe reason? The big AI companies can't live without the hardware suppliers' products. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that are deployed in vast quantities to train AI models and then operate them once deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts GPUs and the infrastructure that supports them are the best in the game and have little competition. If you include other competitors, they also source parts from outside the U.S., so they are subject to the same fears as Nvidia. With how vital GPUs are to the AI race, the company will be just fine.\n\nBroadcom is in a similar business: It makes connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators (which it calls XPUs), among many other things, but these two product lines in particular are expected to provide massive growth over the next few years.\nCurrently, only three companies use Broadcom's XPUs, and by 2027, this division will be pursuing a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity. However, four more customers are getting their XPUs up and running, which will add to this opportunity. Considering that revenue over the past 12 months totaled $54 billion, this would be huge growth. \nWhile there are some fears centered around tariffs for these two, the push for AI supremacy is much greater. As a result, investors need to look past the short term and realize that there is still a ton of long-term potential with Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor looks like it avoided tariffs with its latest announcement\nTaiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC for short) is a major supplier for both of these companies. Neither of them can actually manufacture chips, so they have to get them from somewhere, and TSMC is the best option available for high-end chips.\nPresident Trump threatened to levy a tariff on Taiwan, but that threat seems to have faded away after TSMC announced another $100 billion investment in U.S. semiconductor production facilities.\nTaiwan's president and the CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor denied that President Trump forced this expansion, but the end result is the same: Trump got what he wanted by having TSMC move more of its production to the U.S. \n\nSo, one of the most crucial suppliers that might have driven up prices for Nvidia and Broadcom products doesn't need to worry about tariffs right now -- and these three are free of the burden of tariffs, at least right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil the market is convinced that the threat of tariffs is gone, these three will likely continue to sell off, which gives investors a huge opportunity to buy shares for a fantastic price.\nAll three stocks haven't been this cheap in over a year\nFollowing the sell-off, these three find themselves at price points rarely seen over the past year.\n\nAVGO PE Ratio (forward) data by YCharts.\nFirst, Taiwan Semiconductor looks ridiculously cheap at 18.8 times forward earnings. It's one of the world's most important companies, yet it trades at a lower multiple than the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%), which has a 19.8 forward earnings multiple. This pricing mismatch doesn't make much sense, and investors should pounce on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is also quite inexpensive considering how vital its GPUs are, and the decline from where it spent most of 2024 is another golden opportunity to buy shares on the cheap.\nLastly, Broadcom is the most expensive, but if the XPU market takes off as predicted, this could be a bargain price for the stock.\nAll three stocks look like fantastic buys, but investors must have a long-term mindset. The companies will likely be successful investments over a three- to five-year time frame. But there could be some more short-term pain since it's impossible to call a market bottom in the middle of a sell-off.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has positions in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

Sometimes the market goes overboard, pushing a particular stock into bargain territory. At other times, a big decline is just the beginning as the story that underpins a stock begins to unravel.\nBoth Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) and Tesla (TSLA 3.86%) are getting slammed as investors hit the sell button amid growing unease about the economy, tariffs, and inflation. Here's why neither stock looks like a buy.\nCracks in the AI boom\nShares of Nvidia, the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators, have slumped around 20% from their 52-week high. The company's results remain impressive, and demand for its AI accelerators is still booming. Nvidia's data center segment generated more than $35 billion in its latest quarter, and profit margins remain sky-high.\n\nDespite these results, market optimism appears to be fading. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up that managed to train a top-tier AI model far more efficiently than equivalents from U.S. companies, upended the notion that more powerful models will require ever-increasing computing horsepower. There are also indications that AI companies are hitting a ceiling on capabilities. Case in point: OpenAI's latest GPT-4.5 model, which is wildly expensive and represents a minor improvement at best over previous models.\nHere's the fundamental question: Are there enough use cases for AI to justify many hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on AI infrastructure, including Nvidia's AI chips and everything else that goes into a data center, annually? Increasingly, companies seem to be running into roadblocks actually implementing AI in useful ways. Apple, for example, delayed its revamped Siri assistant because the company is reportedly struggling to deliver on its promised features. OpenAI's Operator, which uses AI agents to perform tasks for users, was called \"brittle and occasionally erratic\" in a review by The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of legitimate use cases for AI technology, but there appears to be a good chance that the industry is greatly overselling the potential of this technology. Ultimately, large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI simply predict the next token, like a piece of text or a pixel in an image, in a stream of tokens. That's all they do. There's no real reasoning or thinking, and it's a far cry from how human intelligence works.\nNvidia's growth story depends on AI becoming increasingly more capable over time. If that's not happening, the massive build-out of AI computing capacity going on right now could be a one-time event that leads to oversupply. In that scenario, demand for Nvidia's AI chips would fall off a cliff, and the stock would likely follow suit.\nA tarnished reputation\nInvesting in Tesla stock has always required a certain amount of mental gymnastics and an incredible amount of faith in CEO Elon Musk. Musk has recently predicted that Tesla's profits would rise tenfold over the next five years, driven by the electric vehicle (EV) business, humanoid robots, AI, and robotaxis. Investors should always take these types of forecasts with a grain of salt. As early as 2015, Musk said that Tesla's vehicles would be fully autonomous within about two years. That prediction was dead wrong, and full autonomy is still an unsolved problem today.\n\nThis faith in Musk appears to be unwinding quickly as the billionaire risks dragging Tesla's reputation into the swamp with his own. Musk's involvement in global politics, which among other things is causing his attention to be spread even more thinly, is likely losing him some fans. Tesla sales in various European countries are reportedly crashing, and prices on used Tesla's are tumbling. Increased competition is part of the equation, but not all of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarren Buffett once said that it takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. The big risk for Tesla investors is that Musk may be in the \"5 minutes\" period right now. Even before the current drama, Tesla's sales were under pressure. Automotive revenue declined in 2024, as did the number of vehicles Tesla produced. Tesla's reputation is so deeply intertwined with Musk's that there's likely no way to separate them. Even if Musk were to step down as CEO, it won't undo the damage to the brand.\nTesla stock has crashed nearly 50% from its 52-week high, but the company is still valued at around $800 billion. For comparison, both General Motors and Ford are worth less than $50 billion each. Much of Tesla's valuation is built on a foundation of bold promises by Musk about autonomy, humanoid robots, and other future sources of revenue. If the belief among investors in that foundation continues to crumble, it will be a long way down for Tesla stock.\n\n\n\nTimothy Green has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

But are the pure-play specialists really your best investment option? The answer might surprise you.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is still a hot topic with market-moving powers, but the rising star of the moment is quantum computing. Experts in this field have seen their stock prices multiply in the last six months. As of March 13, shares of niche veteran IonQ (IONQ 16.99%) doubled in half a year, while smaller player Rigetti Computing (RGTI 28.23%) posted a 1,093% gain.\nBut I wouldn't buy either one of these skyrocketing market darlings today. They might be the superstars in the long run, but many things have to go right to reach that status. So far, they are deeply unprofitable business operations with minimal revenue streams, running on funds from stock sales or loans. And what happens if the next quantum computing research project turns up a lump of coal instead of a gold mine?\nIf and when that happens, I don't want to own Rigetti or IonQ stock. Mind you, I won't bet against them, either. Short-selling has unlimited downside risk if the target stock overcomes every hurdle and continues to deliver strong stock price gains.\nBut there are better ways to approach the quantum computing market with far lower risks. You may have noticed that the sector's massive market moves in recent months were based on news from Alphabet (GOOG 1.75%) (GOOGL 1.68%), Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%), and Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%). Any one of these tech titans would strike me as a better play on the quantum computing idea.\n\nThe one that started this boom\nThe sector surge started when Google Quantum AI (a subsidiary of Alphabet) developed a new quantum computing chip called Willow. I have covered the details of this technical achievement in depth, and it was indeed a big step forward. Pure-play quantum experts like IonQ and Rigetti started their price jumps with this event. This new computing method suddenly looked ready to take the world by storm.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Google team's original announcement\u00a0made it clear that there's a lot of work left to do. Willow's sophisticated error correction merely \"paves the way\" to commercial-grade quantum computers. The headline-inspiring performance was a test of high difficulty but low commercial relevance.\nThe Willow chip fit the description of the second milestone in Google Quantum AI's six-step roadmap.\u00a0It took five years to move from the first milestone to the second, and quantum computers won't offer game-changing performance until researchers crack the sixth milestone. I'm talking about millions of qubit processing units, up from about 100 in the Willow solution.\nSo, this overnight revolution will take time. As you can see, Alphabet is leading the way to these goals of commercial value and has ample resources to make a significant difference. Investing in this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock today will not only give you exposure to the AI boom and Google's online search and advertising prowess but also connect your portfolio to decades of quantum computing leadership.\n\nThe one with the authority to slow things down\nThat brings me to Nvidia, another Magnificent Seven member with a large finger in the quantum computing pie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's research\u00a0focuses on connecting quantum computing devices to traditional computers, creating methods for controlling and reading the quantum machines in a mostly digital world. It's kind of like making user interfaces that connect people to traditional computers -- making effective connections between two entirely different models of data and knowledge.\nSo, when the semiconductor designer speaks up about the long-term prospects of quantum computing, people are listening. This is an established expert in the field with substantial business prospects in quantum computing.\u00a0That's why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a huge impact on the quantum boom in January when he suggested that the road to useful machines could be long.\n\"If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that'd probably be on the early side,\" he said at an industry conference. \"If you said 30, it's probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.\"\nThis perfectly reasonable statement slammed the brakes on soaring quantum stocks. IonQ shares fell 39% that day, and Rigetti's stock took a 45% price cut. As the Google Quantum AI team said in their full statement (which few people seemed to read), it'll be years before quantum computers become commercially useful and significantly better than old-school systems at useful tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Nvidia's quantum interface work will continue. Few companies nowadays have deeper pockets than this AI giant, so most upstarts will find it difficult to keep up with Nvidia's research and development efforts.\nAnd it doesn't hurt that Nvidia's stock price is down 22% from January's all-time highs. The stock is still expensive but substantially more affordable than it was around New Year's. For that price, you get a leading name in a specific quantum computing field and the leading provider of AI accelerator chips.\n\nThe one that put quantum computing back in the limelight\nMore recently, quantum stocks like Rigetti and IonQ perked up, thanks to big news from Microsoft.\nYes, that's another Magnificent Seven company with successful quantum computing research projects under its belt.\u00a0In recent weeks, Microsoft presented a quantum computing chip called Majorana 1, featuring a brand-new hardware architecture. Without diving too deeply into technical jargon, Microsoft claims to have invented a new state of matter. This \"topological state\" can form stable and effective qubits, giving systems builders \"a path to a million qubits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the million-qubit milestone I mentioned in the Google Quantum AI discussion? Microsoft says the new state of matter (not gas, liquid, or solid, but \"topological\") could produce such chips in a few years rather than decades.\nTime will tell how accurate Microsoft's revised timeline is. This could simply be a normal step forward, dressed up in headline-writing neon lights, much like the benchmark test results of Alphabet's Willow chip. A long, gradual development process can look like a series of dramatic jumps and setbacks while it's happening.\nStill, it's pretty clear that Microsoft also has a deep interest in quantum computing development, along with another ultra-rich bank account. This stock is also down more than 15% from recent highs. And just like Alphabet or Nvidia, Microsoft combines its quantum expertise with several established world-class business operations.\nAnd that's not even close to a complete list of the massive tech titans exploring quantum computing in 2025. I find it hard to get excited about Rigetti's and IonQ's big gains when there are so many household-name alternatives in the same market.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

One stock that looks particularly attractive is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 1.46%), or TSMC for short. The stock is down more than 20% from its recent peak as of this writing.\nLet's look at three reasons why TSMC is must-buy for long-term investors.\n\nA vital part of the semiconductor value chain\nAs the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, TSMC is an integral part of the industry's value chain. Today, most semiconductor companies don't manufacture their own chips; instead they outsource the manufacturing to third parties like TSMC. There are a few reasons for this.\nOne is that building fabs (chip manufacturing facilities) is a capital-intensive business -- it costs a lot of money and time to do so. Second, for fabs to be run profitability, they generally must operate at a high-capacity utilization rate. And finally, there is a lot of complex technology that goes into making advanced chips, and foundries (fab owners) are constantly pushing the envelope to make chips smaller.\nIt is this final reason why TSMC has become so important to the semiconductor industry. Today, it is the leader in chip manufacturing technology, having taken a large market share for advanced chips, such as those used in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and high-performance computing (HPC). Last quarter, 88% of the chips it manufactured were for HPC or smartphones, while 74% of its revenue was derived from its more advanced technology using nodes below 7 nanometers. A node is the specific generation of chipmaking technology and generally corresponds to a chip's size. Smaller nodes lead to more transistors fitting on a chip, which leads to more processing power and increased energy efficiency. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs TSMC has pushed its technological lead, its main foundry rivals, Intel and Samsung, have struggled. This has led to TSMC not only becoming the go-to chip manufacturer for advanced chips, but it has also given the company significant pricing power. TSMC will once again raise its prices this year, further expanding its gross margin, which allows more of its revenue to turn into profits. \n\nImage source: Getty Image.\n\nA big beneficiary of AI infrastructure spending\nAs the leader in advanced chip manufacturing, TSMC is nicely benefiting from the rampant spending on AI infrastructure and the increasing number of chips going into data center servers. It counts top chip designers such as Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple among its customers.\nAs such, the company prospers whether hyperscalers (organizations that operate large data centers) use Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) or turn more toward using custom AI chips developed with the help of Broadcom. Either way, it wins.\nMeanwhile, AI infrastructure spending continues to rise. The big three cloud computing companies all plan to spend big on AI infrastructure this year, led by $100 billion in AI-focused capital expenditures (capex) by Amazon, $80 billion from Microsoft, and $75 billion from Alphabet. AI start-ups and other tech companies are also getting in on the act. Meta Platforms plans to spend up to $65 billion in AI-related capex, while OpenAI will head a group that is looking to spend $500 billion over the next few years building data centers in the U.S. as part of Project Stargate. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, TSMC is continuing to build out new plants around the world to increase its capacity to help meet demand. The company recently pledged to spend an additional $100 billion over the next four years building new fabs and packaging facilities in the U.S, as well as a new development center, bringing its total U.S. investment to $165 billion. \nAttractive valuation\nTSMC has been growing quickly, with revenue growth of 37% in U.S. dollars and 39% in its local currency last quarter. The strong growth has continued in the first quarter thus far with TSMC seeing 36% revenue growth in January and 43% in February (both in local currency). Meanwhile, its net income rose 57% in local currency in Q4.\nDespite the strong growth and outlook, TSMC still boasts an attractive valuation. The stock currently trades at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.5 times based on analysts' 2025 estimates. Even its forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.7 falls below the 1.0 threshold often used to identify undervalued stocks.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an attractive valuation and bright outlook, TSMC is a solid stock for long-term investors to scoop up during this market sell-off.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

And who wouldn't want to tap into the incredible wealth-building potential of the stock market? Every investor dreams of nailing the next big investment -- one that skyrockets in value like the success stories of Nvidia, Netflix, and Amazon over the past few decades.\nRivian (RIVN 1.32%) is an electric vehicle manufacturer that has made significant progress over the past few years. The company closed out 2024 with a record year and has more vehicles in development as it grows and expands its business.\u00a0\nWith the global electric vehicle market projected to grow by 32% annually through 2030, is Rivian a millionaire-maker stock?\n\nRivian is making solid progress\nLast year was a record for the EV maker, as it produced 49,476 vehicles and delivered 51,579 to customers. The company celebrated a notable achievement in the fourth quarter, reporting a gross profit of $170 million, its first ever, bolstered by cost improvements. Rivian is optimistic, projecting a \"modest gross profit\" in 2025 as it continues to carve out its niche in the competitive electric vehicle market.\nThat said, the outlook for 2025 it delivered in February was softer than expected, and some worry about increasing risks in the EV space and slower demand for EVs. The automaker guided for deliveries of 46,000 to 51,000 in 2025, below analysts' consensus estimate of around 55,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIVN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nRivian is facing headwinds to its business, including an uncertain macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Reports have emerged that President Donald Trump could eliminate the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases. This and a rollback of other EV incentives could affect adoption rates for Rivian and other automakers.\nWhat's next for the EV maker\nLooking forward, Rivian is preparing to launch its R2, an electric midsize SUV designed to be a compact and affordable alternative to its R1S with a starting price of $45,000. CEO R.J. Scaringe says the \"combination of capabilities and cost efficiencies along with the amazing level of excitement from customers will make R2 a truly transformational product for Rivian.\" R2 production is scheduled to start in 2026.\n\nA Rivian R2 SUV. Image source: Rivian.\n\nA recent loan from the U.S. Department of Energy should help Rivian ramp up production. In January, Rivian closed on a loan agreement for up to $6.6 billion, which will be used to construct its next manufacturing facility in Georgia. Construction is set to begin in 2026, and vehicle production at that facility will not start until 2028. \"This additional capacity for our mass-market products is key to U.S. leadership in the electric vehicle industry,\" said Scaringe. \n\n\n\n\n\nIs Rivian a millionaire-maker stock?\nBut can this stock make you a millionaire? The first thing to consider is how much capital you are willing and able to put into a single position and how long you can leave it invested. A $10,000 investment for one investor could be huge, while for another it may be only a small portion of their portfolio. One person might need to start taking money out of the market when they retire in 10 years; another might have decades before they'll need the money.\nIf you did invest $10,000 in Rivian today, you would need to see the stock price appreciate by 58% annually over the next 10 years to get to $1 million. If your holding period is 20 years, the stock would have to increase 26% annually. To achieve this, Rivian would need to grow and expand significantly, and do so profitably.\nThe growing EV market over time could benefit Rivian, and investors bullish on this industry could include a small position of the promising EV stock in their portfolio. Depending on an investor's starting point and how well the company can achieve profitable growth over the long haul, Rivian could have millionaire-maker potential. However, the stock is prone to volatility as it navigates a tricky environment and expands its manufacturing capacity.\n One thing is certain: A long-term, diversified approach to investing can make you millions, and Rivian could be a (small) piece of the puzzle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America is an advertising partner of Motley Fool Money.

That tech stock is Strategy (MSTR 13.00%), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. It might be the only tech stock with more potential than any cryptocurrency.\nStrategy's stock market performance\nStrategy has outperformed every other company in the S&P 500\u00a0since August 2020. As seen in the chart, even tech superstar Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%), up a staggering 855%, has been unable to keep up with Strategy.\n\nBitcoin / U.S. dollar chart by TradingView\nStrategy's impressive gains, of course, have coincided with its decision to embark on a massive Bitcoin buying binge that started in August 2020. The company has now accumulated nearly 500,000 Bitcoins, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's no mean feat -- it's equivalent to more than 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. And it means Strategy holds significantly more Bitcoin than the U.S. government, which holds approximately 200,000 Bitcoins.\nThe rise of the Bitcoin Treasury Company\nUntil 2020, Strategy was an enterprise software company. But it has now become a Bitcoin Treasury Company (BTC). According to Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of Strategy, BTC refers to a company that is entirely Bitcoin-centric. It exists, quite simply, to buy as much Bitcoin as it can.\nThe company even changed its name in February to reflect that fact. The company's brand identity now includes the iconic Bitcoin symbol, and the change from \"MicroStrategy\" to \"Strategy\" is meant to highlight how the company now only has one macro (not micro) strategy: Bitcoin.\n\nThe company has gone so all-in on Bitcoin that it announced a plan at the end of 2024 to buy $42 billion worth of new Bitcoin over the next three years. It will finance half of that with equity, and the other half with debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to take on debt to buy new Bitcoin has raised more than a few eyebrows. It would be much like your next-door neighbors announcing plans to max out their credit cards, all to buy as much Bitcoin as they can. Saylor told audience members during his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Prague last summer that they should essentially do exactly that. A true Bitcoin maximalist, he says, should be willing to take any step possible to own as much Bitcoin as humanly possible.\nRisk factors\nSo what could go wrong? Well, you guessed it: The price of Bitcoin could fall, as it is doing right now. That helps to explain why the price of Strategy stock is down nearly 20% year to date. It is so highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin that it responds to any price movement of Bitcoin in the crypto market.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSome analysts and academics are now calling into question the current valuation of Strategy itself. The company is valued at significantly more than the value of its Bitcoin holdings. At a current price of $239, Strategy is currently worth $60 billion. Meanwhile, its Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $40 billion.\nKeep in mind: Strategy's enterprise software unit is a money-losing business and no longer a core focus. As a result, the value of Strategy is almost entirely dependent on the value of its Bitcoin hoard. So it's not entirely out of the question to suggest that Strategy's valuation could fall further if Bitcoin continues to decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, plenty of analysts think the value of Strategy will rise over time. Those same analysts, of course, think the price of Bitcoin will also rise over time. As long as Strategy can \"out-Bitcoin\" Bitcoin, it might just be possible.\nThe creation of a new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government might just be the key to unlocking even more value at Strategy, since it would likely encourage new Bitcoin buying around the world. Not surprisingly, Saylor is now urging the U.S. government to buy 25% of all Bitcoin in circulation by the year 2035. That type of aggressive buying would surely push Strategy higher over the next decade as it rides the wave of Bitcoin price appreciation.\nShould you buy Strategy or Bitcoin?\nStrategy has enormous upside potential. And you can't argue with its stock market performance over the past five years. It has been a total beast.\nAt the end of the day, though, I'm sticking with Bitcoin. From my perspective, Strategy is too highly exposed to wild volatility swings in the crypto market. Over the long haul, I'm not convinced that any tech stock -- not even Strategy -- can outperform Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin.

The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider.\"In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month,\" Tam said.A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date.\n\n\"Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech,\" Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now.Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\n\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \n\n\n\nHanging on to the Magnificent SevenThe AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%).\n\nEven though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock.\"We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development,\" Tam said.As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker.\n\n\"We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot,\" Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm.AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla \u2014 the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick.The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. \"Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla\n\n\nBig Tech\n\n\nStock Market\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nMeta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

[You may also click here for additional information]  NEW YORK, March  15, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (\"Monolithic Power Systems\" or the \"Company\") MPWR and reminds investors of the April 7, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (i) Monolithic Power Systems' voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and quality control issues; (ii) these defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (iii) Monolithic Power Systems had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions Monolithic Power Systems supplied to Nvidia; (iv) Monolithic Power Systems' relationship with Nvidia had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems' failure to adequately address such issues; and (v) as a result of the above, Monolithic Power Systems was acutely exposed to material undisclosed risks of significant business, financial, and reputational harm. On October 30, 2024, Monolithic Power Systems announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, revealing a sudden and surprising slowdown in Monolithic Power Systems' critical Enterprise Data segment. Specifically, Monolithic Power Systems reported that quarterly revenue within Monolithic Power Systems' Enterprise Data business declined sequentially to $184 million, down from $187 million in the prior quarter, missing consensus estimates of $211 million by nearly 13%. On this news, the price of Monolithic Power Systems common stock fell more than 17%. Then, on November 11, 2024, Edgewater Research analysts published a report revealing that Nvidia had cancelled half of its outstanding Monolithic Power Systems orders and intended to eliminate Monolithic Power Systems' allocation to most variants of its next-generation Blackwell chips due to \"[p]erformance issues\" with Monolithic Power Systems' products. The report further disclosed that Nvidia engineers had \"lost confidence\" in Monolithic Power Systems' products and decided to turn to Monolithic Power Systems' competitors as Nvidia's \"primary suppliers.\" On this news, the price of Monolithic Power Systems common stock fell nearly 15%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\u00a0\u00a0 Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Monolithic Power Systems' conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MPWR or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

While it still could take some time for the IPO market to thaw and the floodgates open, especially after recent turbulence in the market, more private companies are starting to emerge.\nOne recent company that announced plans to go public is the artificial intelligence infrastructure firm Coreweave (CRWV). Coreweave is reportedly seeking to raise $4 billion, which would value the company at $35 billion, making it one of the larger IPOs in recent years. Given how successful AI stocks have been, the company is likely to draw a lot of interest and is definitely one of the most eagerly anticipated IPOs in 2025. Here are three things you should know.\n1. Data centers built for AI\nInterestingly, Coreweave started as an infrastructure play targeting crypto miners. The company previously used data centers in New Jersey to mine Ethereum when the world's second-largest cryptocurrency used the energy-intensive proof-of-work mining system that required lots of computing power to mint new blocks of Ethereum and collect the associated rewards. However, when crypto crashed in 2018, Coreweave pivoted and now provides data centers made for supporting generative AI workloads.\nCoreweave's data centers provide Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPU), liquid cooling capabilities, storage optimized for AI, and robust security. The company essentially provides infrastructure-as-a-service for companies looking to develop and roll out AI solutions and capabilities. Without Coreweave, many companies would be faced with building their own infrastructure, which is a significant undertaking and capital investment. At the end of 2024, Coreweave ran 32 data centers operating more than 250,000 GPUs.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Financials are impressive\nWhen popular tech and AI companies go public, you'll often notice that most are losing money and really don't have the best-looking set of financials, other than the promise of massive growth that will eventually turn into profits down the line. Coreweave is still not profitable and reported a loss of over $863 million in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the company had roughly $863 million of depreciation and amortization during the year, which makes the financials look much better on an operating basis. Coreweave reported operating income of over $324 million in 2024, a tremendous improvement from a $14.5 million operating loss in 2023. Meanwhile, revenue exploded roughly 740% in 2024.\nThis shows its capital investments are productive and generate significant revenue opportunities. Coreweave was able to scale significantly in 2024 due to increased customer demand. More than 95% of the new revenue was from existing customers. The company also estimates a long \"estimated economic life of our infrastructure\" that, coupled with multiyear contracts, has created attractive unit economics.\n3. Microsoft made up 62% of revenue in 2024\nIn its registration statement, Coreweave said that it has initially gone after a small core group of customers, including Nvidia and Microsoft. This strategy has paid off so far. Microsoft made up 35% of total revenue in 2023 and then 62% of revenue in 2024. There are pros and cons to this approach. The pros are that one of the most influential tech companies in the world that will likely be a crucial player in AI in the future sees immense value in Coreweave's offerings. The downside, of course, is that if Microsoft decides to end the relationship, the company would find itself in a bind.\nHowever, having such a large relationship with Microsoft is likely to attract other large tech companies wading into the world of AI and gives the company a certain amount of credibility when it pursues new customers. In fact, Reuters recently reported that Coreweave has inked a five-year, $11.9 billion deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. As part of the deal, OpenAI will also acquire a stake in the company.\n\n\n\nBram Berkowitz has positions in Ethereum. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Ethereum, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

The rising uncertainty and fear about the outlook explains why major AI companies have witnessed stock pullbacks of late even as they've been posting solid quarterly results.\nHowever, the long-term economic potential of AI means that the proliferation of this technology is likely to continue. Market research firm IDC predicts that AI could add nearly $20 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This is the reason why it may be a good idea to buy shares of some top AI players benefiting from the technology's growing adoption right now.\nThese two beaten-down AI powerhouses have been growing at a healthy pace and have the potential to sustain their impressive growth in the long run.\nAI chip demand continues to drive Nvidia's remarkable growth\nShares of AI poster child Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) are down 17% in the last month, even as the company reported solid quarterly results in late February. That has left Nvidia trading at attractive valuations. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 38, which isn't all that expensive considering the terrific pace at which its bottom line is growing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's forward P/E ratio of 25 is even more attractive, and is almost in line with the forward earnings multiple of the Nasdaq-100 (a tech-heavy index that can serve as a useful proxy for the broader tech sector). In that light, Nvidia looks like a bargain buy at these levels. The company's earnings shot up by a remarkable 130% to $2.99 per share in its recently concluded fiscal 2025, while revenue more than doubled to $130.5 billion.\nMoreover, Nvidia expects to keep growing at a remarkable pace despite its massive scale. The company's fiscal 2026 Q1 revenue guidance of $43 billion would translate into a year-over-year increase of 65%. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to clock 50% earnings growth in the current fiscal year.\nHowever, Nvidia has the ability to outpace those expectations as the demand for its latest generation of Blackwell data center graphics processing units (GPUs) remains robust. The company sold $11 billion worth of Blackwell processors in its fiscal fourth quarter, which was higher than anticipated. Blackwell GPUs accounted for nearly a third of Nvidia's data center revenue last quarter, and they are set to move the needle in a bigger way for the company thanks to their versatility.\nNvidia points out that the Blackwell GPUs are far more capable than its previous-generation Hopper processors at AI inferencing -- the process of putting AI models to work once they are trained. As the demand for AI inferencing increases with the debuts of large language models such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, so too is the demand for Blackwell processors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia points out that its customers have been able to significantly lower their operating costs and boost performance simultaneously by deploying Blackwell GPUs. With all this in mind, it won't be surprising if Nvidia maintains its stranglehold over the AI chip space, where it reportedly commands an impressive 85% market share.\nIn the end, it can be concluded that Nvidia remains a top AI stock as its days of outstanding growth are here to stay. Investors would be well advised to buy it while its price is beaten down.\nAI-powered advertising is a key catalyst for Meta Platforms\nMeta Platforms (META 2.96%) stock has retreated 16% in the past month, making it a no-brainer buy. After all, it is now trading at 26 times trailing earnings even as fast-growing demand for its AI-based advertising tools is helping it corner a bigger share of a huge end-market opportunity.\nThe digital advertising market grew by an estimated 12% last year. Meta, however, recorded much stronger growth of 22% in 2024 and generated $164 billion in revenue. Its earnings, meanwhile, grew by 60% to $23.86 per share, driven by a combination of higher spending by customers and its own cost-control initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is playing a key role in helping Meta win a bigger share of its customers' marketing budgets. This is evident from the 14% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad that Meta charged last quarter. A big reason why advertisers are willing to spend more money on Meta's advertising tools is because they are getting stronger returns on that spending thanks to AI.\nMeta management asserted in January 2024 that its AI tools were driving a 32% increase in return on spending for advertisers. The social media giant has rolled out several AI-based features since then to help advertisers automate the creation, deployment, and optimization of ad campaigns. More importantly, it is continuing to add new AI features. So, it is not surprising to see why there has been a sharp jump in the adoption of Meta's AI ad tools of late.\nManagement remarked on the company's January 2025 earnings conference call that \"more than 4 million advertisers are now using at least one of our generative AI ad creative tools.\" That's a 4x jump in a period of just six months. This is resulting in financial gains for Meta as well. According to CFO Susan Li:\n\nAnother way we're delivering value for advertisers is through increased automation of their ad campaigns with Advantage+. Adoption of Advantage+ shopping campaigns continues to scale with revenues surpassing a $20 billion annual run rate and growing 70% year over year in Q4.\n\nSo, Meta seems on track to win a bigger share of the digital ad market in the long run. Grand View Research projects that the digital ad market could clock 15% annualized growth through the end of the decade to more than $1.1 trillion in annual revenue. Meta, therefore, has room to keep growing at a healthy pace, making it an ideal bet for investors looking to buy a cheaply valued AI stock that could fly higher in the long run.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia\nNvidia (NVDA 5.27%) is the leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, where its graphic processing units (GPUs) help provide the processing power needed to train AI models and run inference. The company's growth has been spectacular, with its revenue more than doubling in both its fiscal years 2024 and 2025 (ended in January). \nAs long as AI infrastructure spending continues to grow, Nvidia is set to continue to be the biggest beneficiary. Currently, the best way to advance AI models is through more processing power. So, as the AI race continues, companies are committing more and more money to build out AI data centers.\nNvidia, meanwhile, has created a wide moat in the GPU space through its CUDA software platform, helping it take about a 90% market share. The company got about a 10-year jump on the software side against its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and the CUDA moat is alive and well today, making Nvidia a great growth stock to buy. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock is trading down nearly 22% from all-time highs reached in early January, but it still has plenty of growth potential, and that makes its price even more of a bargain.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Broadcom\nWhile Nvidia owns the mass-merchant GPU market, Broadcom (AVGO 2.18%) is carving out a nice niche with custom AI chips. Given Nvidia's high prices, more companies are turning toward Broadcom to help develop customer AI chips that can be used in conjunction with GPUs. These custom chips take time to develop but tend to perform better and be more cost-effective when used for a very narrow set of tasks.\n\nBroadcom currently has three main AI chip customers, which it says combined have a serviceable addressable market of between $60 billion to $90 billion for its fiscal 2027. In addition, it has recently added four more newer customers, including Apple. While Broadcom won't capture all of this spending, with some inevitably going to Nvidia, it still is a big opportunity for the company. \nThe recent sell-off (the stock is down about 23% from all-time highs set in December 2024) lets investors get into the stock at a nice price.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Alphabet\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.68%) (GOOG 1.75%) is the market leader in digital advertising through its Google search and YouTube streaming platforms. The company also operates the third-largest cloud computing business and is also a leader in the emerging fields of quantum computing and autonomous driving (Waymo).\nWhile some investors worry about the impact of AI on its search business, there has been no meaningful effect on its growth thus far. Meanwhile, the company's huge user base, long history of search data, and an extensive client list of advertisers give it a nice advantage. AI should become a good opportunity for the company, as it should be able to create new ad formats that can help monetize the AI Overviews it now generates. Traditionally, Google has only served ads on about 20% of its search results, so this could be a big new untapped market. \nIn addition, the company is seeing great growth with its cloud computing unit, which saw revenue climb 30% last quarter and segment income soar 142%. The company was the first to develop a custom chip with the help of Broadcom, giving it a nice cost advantage moving forward as it builds out its data center infrastructure to help meet soaring demand. The recent sell-off (the stock is down about 21% from highs set early last month) is a great time to get into the stock for the long term. \n4. Salesforce\nAs AI continues to develop, Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) is looking to become the leader in agentic AI, in which AI agents will perform tasks at a user's behest without the need for much supervision from humans. This has a lot of real-world applications for businesses because these agents could handle customer service issues or analyze market data to help optimize marketing campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalesforce leads the way in agentic AI with the launch of Agentforce, which includes several out-of-box AI agent solutions. Customers can also customize agents through the use of no-code and low-code tools built into the platform while placing guardrails on what the agents can and cannot do. Meanwhile, the company recently launched its AgentExchange marketplace with over 200 partners to expand its use cases. \nAgentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per interaction, so the opportunity for Salesforce is huge. Thus far, customers have been flocking to try the product, with the company gaining 5,000 Agentforce customers, including 3,000 paying, since its introduction in October. The recent drop in the stock's price (down nearly 26% since December 2024) opens up a nice opportunity to jump into the name. \n5. GitLab\nTrading off about 31% from early February highs, GitLab (GTLB 4.20%) is a fast-growing DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) platform that helps customers develop software while integrating cybersecurity throughout the process. This is a high-margin subscription business that is benefiting from AI.\n\nGrowth is being driven by customers upgrading to its higher-tier Ultimate platform, which now represents about half of its annual recurring revenue (ARR). Meanwhile, its Dedicated solution, which is only offered on the Ultimate platform, has also been gaining strong traction. Dedicated offers customers data isolation and regional data residency. In addition, its AI-powered GitLab Duo add-on offering, which helps programmers complete their assignments by offering coding suggestions and automation, has also been helping drive revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is helping GitLab both boost its number of new customers and grow within its existing customer base. Last quarter, it saw its number of enterprise customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more climb 29%, while its dollar-based net retention was a robust 123%. Numbers over 100% indicate that existing customers spent more with the company than the year before (including the impact of any churn). Overall, its revenue rose 29% last quarter, marking its sixth straight quarter of between 29% to 33% revenue growth. \nThe sell-off is a great opportunity to pick up this high-growth stock.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

This could be the biggest growth market in history, especially when it comes to business adoption.\nAccording to a recent survey by global consultancy McKinsey & Co., around 40% of businesses reported that they would increase investments in AI due to advancements in generative AI alone. That should be huge news because, according to new research from The Motley Fool, fewer than 10% of businesses nationwide currently use AI. So, in the coming years, we could see AI adoption by businesses rise nearly fivefold.\nIf you want to profit from the AI revolution, there's one stock in particular you should add to your portfolio.\n\nThis is my favorite AI stock\nMost investors following the AI craze are already familiar with Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%). Even after a recent correction, Nvidia remains one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion dollars. Investors who have followed the company are likely aware of a few things.\nFirst, Nvidia's main business line is producing graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs make much of our modern technology possible. But the most exciting use case right now is with machine learning. Machine learning is a critical process for training and running AI models. Without it, the current AI revolution wouldn't be taking place. And which company makes the best GPUs right now for machine learning? You guessed it: Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy most estimates, Nvidia currently controls between 70% and 95% of the market for GPUs related to AI applications. If previous chip wars are any indication, this market share will fluctuate over time, perhaps even shrinking due to mounting competition. But for now, Nvidia's chips are arguably the best for AI applications. The company's leading gross margins (in the mid-seventies percentage-wise) are a strong testament to this, given that customers are willing to pay considerably more for Nvidia's products versus the competition.\nBut this brings us to the secret weapon Nvidia possesses that many investors are unaware of: the CUDA advantage.\nCUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. It's essentially a developer suite that allows end users to customize chip performance for particular applications. In use since 2006, CUDA has created a high level of vendor lock-in over time. Today, CUDA is widely viewed as the standard for GPU acceleration.\nThis means that much of today's AI ecosystem is built in parallel with CUDA, creating a level of \"stickiness\" that other GPU makers don't have. In a nutshell, Nvidia now controls both the hardware and the software end of the spectrum, giving it a huge competitive advantage beyond how well its raw chips perform.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia currently has the lead in terms of GPU performance. But the CUDA advantage could help sustain this lead for far longer than previous chip cycles. But does all of this make the stock a buy right now?\nShould you add Nvidia to your portfolio right now?\nHigh-growth stocks typically have a lot of volatility because so much of their value is tied to the multiple the market assigns them. Small shifts in sentiment can send these multiples sharply higher or lower, creating an outsize effect on the stock price.\nNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nAfter the recent pullback, Nvidia shares are cheaper than they have been in months. Still, on paper, shares remain pricey at 22.4 times sales. That's a hefty premium versus slower-growing peers like Advanced Micro Devices.\nBut the AI revolution should continue to mature over the next several decades. And Nvidia's CUDA advantage means it will be at the center of this growth for some time. With enough patience, the company's rapid underlying growth rates could eventually make shares look like a bargain at 22.4 times sales. This requires a multi-decade holding period for the biggest gains, but that's something both millennial investors and younger generations can afford to commit to.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is an incredible stock, but it's expensive. However, that shouldn't be a problem for younger investors who have the luxury of long investment periods ahead of them. But if you're looking for an investment with more near-term visibility, you might want to look elsewhere, given how volatile Nvidia shares can be.\n\n\n\nRyan Vanzo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Fortunately, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG 2.58%), Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG 1.44%), and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 2.56%) all represent great opportunities that will appeal to a variety of interests.\n\nA market-beating ETF that provides growth investors with AI exposure... and more\nEven if you follow the market superficially, you know that artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been all the rage. It's unsurprising, therefore, that the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF has outpaced the S&P 500's 13.9% gain over the past year, climbing 17.2%. The ETF is composed of growth stocks in the S&P 500, and the top seven holdings are all \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- all of which provide AI exposure in their own ways. Semiconductor stalwart Nvidia\u00a0represents the largest position with an 11.1% weighting, while Apple\u00a0and Microsoft\u00a0round out the top three positions with weightings of 6.2% and 6%, respectively.\nWith 209 holdings, there are also many stocks not focused on AI, so if AI enthusiasm tapers off, there are plenty of other stocks that can pick up the reins and drive the ETF higher. Financials stocks, for example, figure prominently in the fund with a 12.4% weighting. Visa, MasterCard, and JPMorgan Chase are among the top 13 positions.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF has a 0.07% expense ratio and it makes distributions on a quarterly basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut more passive income in your portfolio with the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\nLooking to ramp up your dividend income? The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is a great option. Because the fund has a low expense ratio -- only 0.05% -- investors don't lose a large amount of the passive income that the fund generates to management fees. Currently, the ETF provides a 1.66% 30-day SEC yield, higher than the S&P 500 yield of 1.27%.\nWith 337 holdings, the ETF balances a conservative approach to income investing with the upside of companies dedicated to growing their dividends. Focusing on large-cap stocks, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF prioritizes companies that have raised their dividends for the past 10 consecutive years. Semiconductor specialist Broadcom is the largest position in the ETF, while Apple, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, and Visa round out the top five positions.\nIt's no small feat for a business to consistently raise dividends for a decade, so investors are largely gaining access to well-run companies. Those content to maintain their positions in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF for the long haul have the potential to see their investments grow considerably thanks to businesses committed to rewarding shareholders.\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap ETF has been a mega success since its inception\nDon't let the poor performance of the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF fool you. While the fund has dropped 5.7% since the start of the year -- plunging further than the S&P 500's 1.7% decline -- over the long term it has performed brilliantly. Since its inception in December 2007, the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF has soared 675% higher, far outpacing the 445% gain in the S&P 500 during the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterizing itself as \"a convenient way to get diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market,\" the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF is focused on big stocks with big growth potential. The median market cap of the 69 stocks in the ETF, for example, is $1.7 trillion. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks make up the lion's share of the holdings, about 59.8%. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the top three positions in the ETF, with a combined weighting of 34.8%.\nThere's no guarantee that the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF will continue to skyrocket ahead of the S&P 500 at the same pace as it has for the past 18 years, but it certainly wouldn't be surprising if it did. While the fund's distributions are low (the 30-day SEC yield is 0.39%), they more than cover the 0.07% expense ratio.\nWhich Vanguard ETF is right for you?\nWith low expense ratios, these three ETFs are great options for budget-conscious investors who are looking to buy and hold for the long term. For those interested in a more measured approach to growth stocks, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF will be appealing, yet those on the prowl for higher growth potential will want to dig deeper into the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF. OF course, if generating passive income is a priority, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF will be a more enticing option.\n\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of Motley Fool Money.

The Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs, sticky inflation, and elevated interest rates have been rattling the markets over the past month or so. The S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%), despite entering correction territory on Thursday, also still looks undeniably expensive at 28.8 times trailing earnings.\nBut if investors look beyond the market's hottest growth stocks, they can still spot a few bargains that look undervalued relative to their growth potential. If investors exploring this wobbly market have $3,000 in available cash that isn't needed for monthly bills, to pay down short-term debt, or to bolster an emergency fund, they might want to consider putting a portion (or all) of it toward buying shares of these three stocks: Uber Technologies (UBER 2.94%), Rivian Automotive (RIVN 1.32%), and Oracle (ORCL 1.09%). Here's why.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Uber Technologies\nUber, one of the world's largest ride-hailing and food delivery services, has grown rapidly since its pandemic-induced slowdown in 2020. From 2020 to 2024, the trips logged by users over a year more than doubled from 5.03 billion to 11.27 billion, its monthly active platform customers (MAPCs) grew from 93 million to 171 million, and its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%.\n\nOn the bottom line, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2022 and rose at a CAGR of 95% over the following two years. It also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2023, and its net income rose more than fivefold in 2024.\nUber's growth was largely driven by its market share gains; the expansion of its ecosystem with new enterprise, healthcare, and teen-oriented services; and its Uber One subscriptions -- which grew 60% to 30 million subscribers in 2024. Its profits rose as it divested its noncore businesses, downsized its freight and recruitment divisions, and executed several rounds of layoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Uber's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 14% and 27%, respectively. Its business is maturing, but its enterprise value of $145 billion still looks like a bargain at 13 times next year's adjusted EBITDA.\n2. Rivian Automotive\nRivian Automotive is an electric vehicle (EV) maker that sells three types of vehicles: the R1T pickup truck, the R1S SUV, and custom delivery vans for top investor Amazon (and recently other companies as well).\nRivian's deliveries more than doubled from 20,332 vehicles in 2022 to 50,122 vehicles in 2023, but that figure only rose 3% to 51,579 vehicles in 2024 as it temporarily shut down its main plant in Illinois for upgrades, grappled with supply chain challenges, faced tougher competition, and struggled to sell more vehicles as rising interest rates cooled the broader EV market.\n\nFor 2025, Rivian only expects to deliver 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles as it shuts down its Illinois plant again for additional upgrades; deals with its lost orders from the L.A. fires; and navigates a challenging demand environment and potential changes to federal incentives, regulations, and tariffs for EV makers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, it still expects to achieve a \"modest\" gross profit for the year as its material costs improve, it sells more of its regulatory credits to other automakers, and it expands its higher-margin software and services division. It also expects its deliveries to accelerate in 2026 after it launches its next vehicle, the R2 SUV.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 34% as it gradually narrows its net losses. With an enterprise value of $12.4 billion, it looks undervalued compared to other EV makers at just 2 times next year's sales.\n3. Oracle\nOracle, one of the world's top database software companies, was once a slow-growth tech stock. But over the past decade, it transformed its on-premises software into cloud-based services and expanded with bold acquisitions. Its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform also continued to grow in the shadow of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nFor fiscal 2025 (which ends this May), Oracle expects to generate up to $27 billion in cloud revenue. That would represent nearly half of its projected revenue for the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Oracle's revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 12% and 20%, respectively. A lot of that growth should be driven by OCI, which is rolling out more tools for developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications and connecting its existing databases to large language models (LLMs).\nIts AI customers already include Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI, and that list should keep growing as the cloud and AI markets expand. It also plans to keep returning most of its free cash flow (FCF) to its investors through buybacks and dividends.\nOracle still looks reasonably valued at 21 times its forward adjusted earnings, it pays a forward yield of 1.4%, and it has lots of irons in the fire. It might not be as exciting as Uber or Rivian, but it's a solid play on the growing cloud and AI markets.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

In fact, Nvidia's chips are known as the best around, and that's why the world's tech giants -- from Amazon to Microsoft -- flock to the company for its latest releases.\nAll of this has resulted in double- and triple-digit revenue growth in recent years, and over the past five years, the stock has soared quadruple digits. In recent weeks, though, this high-flying stock has slipped along with the rest of the market. Investors worry President Trump's trade war with major U.S. trade partners could hurt the economy and corporate earnings.\nBut it's important to remember that, even if Nvidia faces headwinds in the near term, its long-term prospects and the general AI growth story remain intact. And Nvidia isn't finished when it comes to making impressive moves. In fact, my prediction is one particular thing will be Nvidia's net big move -- and it will start on March 18.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFrom video games to the AI boom\nFirst, though, let's take a quick look at Nvidia's path so far. As mentioned, Nvidia's GPUs initially focused on the video gaming market, but when it became clear that their ability to process multiple tasks at once could serve many other areas, growth took off. And the AI boom became a key catalyst, helping Nvidia's annual revenue climb from $26 billion in the 2022 fiscal year to $130 billion in the recently completed 2025 fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia hasn't stuck with only GPUs, instead building out an entire platform of AI products and services, from enterprise software to networking tools and more. This tech giant has the portfolio necessary to help both commercial customers and governments along every step of their AI path.\nAs mentioned, technology companies -- pouring billions of dollars annually into their AI programs -- are major Nvidia customers. This is positive because these players are committed to their AI strategies and have the financial resources to carry out their plans.\nNow, let's move along to my prediction. Nvidia will hold its annual GTC AI conference this coming week, and CEO Jensen Huang will keynote the event on March 18. As Huang speaks about significant happenings at Nvidia, he'll likely offer us some clues about the future. And I predict Nvidia's next key move will be to focus more heavily than ever on innovation -- a make-it-or-break-it element for AI chip designers.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nClues about Nvidia's innovation strengths\nNvidia already has offered us clues of its strengths when it comes to innovation: It launched its latest Blackwell architecture in its fastest-ever production ramp. And the company generated $11 billion in Blackwell revenue in the first quarter of commercialization -- all while maintaining gross margin above 70%. This highlights Nvidia's ability to release a complex product fast, without major glitches, and ensure high profitability on sales. The fact that demand has surpassed supply is another good sign, showing customers are eager to get in on Nvidia's products.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I think Nvidia now is kicking up innovation a notch? In the past, Nvidia has talked about updating GPUs annually. But after this enormous Blackwell launch, which happened over the past few months, the company already aims to release Blackwell Ultra at some point in the second half of this year -- so it's possible this new update may even come a bit before the original Blackwell's one-year anniversary.\n\nNvidia says the Vera Rubin architecture will launch next. And reports have suggested Rubin development is ahead of schedule so it could release as early as later this year or early next year.\nConsidering Nvidia's recent emphasis on the importance of reasoning inference moving forward, I would expect Blackwell Ultra to be particularly strong in this area -- and that's something that could supercharge Nvidia's already solid revenue growth. This potential speed in innovation and a focus on a key growth area is crucial for Nvidia because it's the one thing that could keep it ahead of rivals -- and result in high-level growth over time.\nSo, my prediction is Nvidia's next big move will be this focus on innovation, with the next chip updates potentially coming even sooner than expected and being keenly adapted to the next AI growth area. And that could be fantastic news for Nvidia shareholders.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

While there was no obvious catalyst behind the move, the stock market rebounded today after another difficult week and Nvidia also seems to be benefiting after a positive update from one of its suppliers.\nAI demand still on solid footing\nTaiwan-based Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.41 billion, which missed analyst estimates and also declined 13% year over year. However, management on an earnings call said it expects demand from its AI server business to more than double in the first quarter of 2024, according to Reuters.\nChairman Young Liu said on the call:\nWe have not seen CSP [cloud service providers] demand slowing down. There are [market] rumors that CSP demand will peak this year, and then it will go down next year. But we are not seeing that ... at least for Foxconn.\n\n\nLiu added that AI server revenue should make up over half of Foxconn's total server revenue in 2025 and that it is increasing production for Nvidia. Late last year, Foxconn announced that it would build a large plant in Mexico in order to keep up with the intense demand for Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing units.\n\"Some tariff factors may affect demand ... But we have planned in different regions over the past years and have made our supply chain resilience better than it was eight years ago during President Trump's first term,\" Liu said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty still high\nWhile Friday marked a quieter day on the tariff front, at least as of this writing, I don't think the trade war is done yet. Nvidia will also likely continue to deal with uncertainties from export controls and potential weakness in the economy.\nWhile I'm not personally a buyer of Nvidia right now, the stock trades at just under 27 times forward earnings, which is a much more attractive valuation than in the past when it could trade upward of 50 times forward earnings, especially if AI demand stays hot.\n\n\n\nBram Berkowitz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

At the time of this writing, the technology sector is down over 10% year to date. Major tech stocks like Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) and Apple are down 10% and 12%, respectively. Nvidia has tumbled 19% year to date.\nHere's why Microsoft is a particularly compelling growth stock to buy now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFair companies at wonderful prices aren't always worth buying\nBuying stocks during a major sell-off is never easy, especially when the sell-off happens fairly quickly. The Nasdaq is down 12% in the last month, which indicates how rapid the sell-off has been.\nDuring times of intense volatility, it can be tempting to scoop up shares of companies that have sold off big-time. However, a better way to navigate a sell-off is to buy stocks that you believe in long-term. So much so, that you're OK with them falling even more.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery investor wants a great deal. So, buying shares in an excellent company at a low price is preferred. However, assuming you can buy the dip at the best time possible is foolish. Being roughly right is more than good enough. In fact, history shows that buying shares in great companies at bad times is better than investing in bad or mediocre companies at phenomenal prices. Or as Warren Buffett famously said, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"\nNot every stock that is selling off is a wonderful company. Some stocks saw their valuations stretched thin and probably ran too far ahead of fundamentals. But other stocks, like Microsoft, are wonderful companies. And Microsoft is already at a fair price, making it an especially compelling stock to buy now.\nA wonderful company at a fair price\nMicrosoft sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30, which is below its 10-year median P/E of 32.5. So right off the bat, it's clear the market is pricing Microsoft at less than its historical average valuation, even though the business has changed drastically over the last decade.\nMicrosoft is arguably the most balanced tech stock on the market. It is involved in hardware, personal computer products, software through its legacy Microsoft 365 suite, Teams, platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub, and cloud infrastructure through Microsoft Intelligent Cloud and Azure. The company is heavily investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to drive efficiency across existing platforms and build advanced data center and AI services for its cloud clients. Microsoft can afford these investments due to its high free cash flow and strong balance sheet, which has more cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments than long-term debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, buying Microsoft stock is a catch-all way to invest in AI, cloud computing, software, and hardware through a company with the financial muscle to invest through the cycle.\nMicrosoft isn't the kind of company that will overextend its spending and get strapped for cash. So it is well suited to endure a prolonged slowdown in some of its end markets.\nMicrosoft is far from a one-trick pony\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Microsoft's business is its combination of revenue growth across all segments and overall margin expansion. Microsoft's most recent earnings report was for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Here's a look at how that quarter stacks up against the first half (1H) of the last two fiscal years.\n\n\n\n\nSegment Metric\n\n\n1H Fiscal 2023\n\n\n1H Fiscal 2024\n\n\n1H Fiscal 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductivity and business processes revenue (billions)\n\n\n$44.68\n\n\n$51.08\n\n\n$57.75\n\n\n\n\nProductivity and business processes operating margin\n\n\n52.4%\n\n\n56.4%\n\n\n57.8%\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent cloud revenue (billions)\n\n\n$34.81\n\n\n$41.54\n\n\n$49.64\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent cloud operating margin\n\n\n38.7%\n\n\n44.4%\n\n\n43%\n\n\n\n\nMore personal computing revenue (billions)\n\n\n$23.38\n\n\n$25.92\n\n\n$27.83\n\n\n\n\nMore personal computing operating margin\n\n\n21.5%\n\n\n25.7%\n\n\n26.8%\n\n\n\n\nData source: Microsoft.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI efforts have improved margins in each business segment. It's especially impressive to see how large Microsoft's cloud business has become. The segment is now nearly as big as productivity and business processes (which includes Microsoft 365, Windows, Teams, commercial software products, LinkedIn, and more).\nMicrosoft could face a near-term slowdown\nMarket sell-offs are the perfect time to review the reason why you own a stock, revisit the investment thesis, and address potential risks. Microsoft is a phenomenal business with a solid growth rate, diversified business model, rock-solid balance sheet, reasonable valuation, a growing dividend, and ample free cash flow left over to repurchase stock. So, regarding moats, Microsoft's is about as wide and deep as it gets.\nStill, the company isn't immune from risks. The biggest risk at this time is probably the impact of its AI investments. Microsoft's bold plans to spend $80 billion on AI data centers and cloud-based applications in fiscal 2025 is no small feat -- even for Microsoft. Already, we've seen the company pull back on stock repurchases to fund its AI efforts.\nBuying Microsoft now is a bet that these investments are worth the steep price. A pullback in spending from Microsoft's clients could make it harder to sell AI services. However, it's difficult to see a scenario where there would be a permanent pullback on demand for AI tools for consumer software products and cloud solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is worth holding through periods of volatility\nMicrosoft is a fairly safe stock to buy now, even if the Nasdaq correction evolves into a full-fledged bear market. Microsoft's earnings growth could slow down for a few years, and the stock would still be a decent value. Microsoft isn't priced for perfection despite the company's excellent results.\nIt's not much, but it's worth mentioning that the company does sport a 0.9% dividend yield with 15 consecutive years of boosting its payout. So, Microsoft has a bit of passive income opportunity.\nThe longer the stock price languishes, the higher Microsoft's yield will become -- especially considering the company will likely continue increasing its dividend every year going forward. Other megacap growth stocks like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet yield just 0.5% or less and Amazon and Tesla don't even pay dividends.\nAdd it all up, and Microsoft is a stock you can count on long-term, making it the perfect candidate to buy during a correction.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The Nasdaq is in a correction -- down over 13% from its all-time high at the time of this writing. Semiconductor stocks like Nvidia\u00a0and Broadcom\u00a0are down even further.\nASML (ASML 2.79%), which makes the world's most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, is getting dragged down with the broader sell-off even though the company's long-term future is brighter than ever.\nHere's why ASML is one of the most straightforward ways to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) and why the dividend stock is a high-conviction buy during the broader market sell-off.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPowering semiconductor innovation\nASML's latest EUV machines cost hundreds of millions of dollars and weigh more than most commercial airplanes. These giant machines are integral in chip manufacturing. Without them, semiconductor fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0and Intel\u00a0would have a difficult time making cutting-edge chips designed by companies like Nvidia.\nUnlike other aspects of global manufacturing, which is often commoditized and highly competitive, ASML is in a league of its own. It is so far ahead of the competition that it effectively has a monopoly.\n\n\n\n\n\nASML has steadily grown sales and earnings thanks to increasing global chip demand. Its business model gives it immense pricing power. Despite its numerous advantages, ASML isn't immune from challenges.\n\nRisks worth noting\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which can have ripple effects on ASML's business. If ASML's customers receive fewer orders, they could pull back and delay spending.\nHowever, many of today's top chip designers generate plenty of cash flow to invest through the cycle. Nvidia and Broadcom, for example, are seeing explosive demand for their AI chips from hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, and Meta Platforms. Even if there's a pullback in capital expenditures from hyperscalers, it's not very likely a company like Nvidia will pause innovation. Rather, it would make more sense to use industry weakness as an opportunity to increase its lead over the competition.\nSimilarly, there are few reasons why ASML should pause its research and development. Rather, it would make more sense to continue pushing the bounds of technology advancement so that when the next cyclical growth period occurs, ASML is ready to capitalize.\n\n\n\n\n\nTariffs and geopolitical tensions are another threat to ASML's business. Tariffs could lead to higher input and manufacturing costs. But again, ASML is well-positioned to pass along those costs to its customers.\nThe biggest risk to ASML is trade restrictions. The Dutch company's exports are subject to trade terms, which can change dramatically in today's economic climate. China buys a ton of chips but faces strict restrictions. China may develop alternatives to EUV technology to be less reliant on imports, which would impact ASML.\nIn its fourth-quarter 2024\u00a0results from January, ASML forecasted China orders to return to a more normalized percentage of sales after spiking in 2023 and 2024.\nAll told, ASML's near-term growth is vulnerable to trade tensions and a cyclical slowdown. Even so, its guidance for first quarter fiscal 2025 net sales is 7.5 billion euros to 8 billion euros with a gross margin between 52% and 53% compared to 5.3 billion euros in net sales and a 51% gross margin for first-quarter fiscal 2024. So at least for now, ASML's backlog is strong enough to maintain solid growth. But full-year results could swing wildly based on demand and trade tensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-quality company at a fair price\nASML, and semiconductor stocks in general, can be difficult to value because of the industry's cyclical nature. If growth keeps up, ASML can look dirt cheap in the near term. But if there's a multiyear slowdown, investors may be less willing to pay a premium price for a chip stock.\nASML's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 33.4 and its forward P/E is 27.9. These are bargain levels for ASML given its 10-year median P/E is 35.1. However, investors should be cautious when looking at a chip stock's forward valuation metrics, especially now.\nSuppose trade tensions lead ASML's business to stagnate this year, and the company doesn't grow its earnings at all. In that case, the stock would look more expensive because its forward P/E would come down. Even with that glass-half-empty mindset, ASML is still a good value because AI presents such a compelling long-term growth opportunity.\nASML should sport a valuation higher than its historical average, not lower, even if sales languish in the near term. Long-term investors would surely trade a year or two of little to no growth for a decade of strong results. But the reason ASML's valuation is so cheap is because the stock began selling off in the summer of 2024. In fact, it is down 30% in the past year. So while many chip stocks were hovering around all-time highs toward the end of last year, ASML was already beaten down.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the inexpensive valuation, ASML pays a dividend, which adds an incentive to hold the stock through periods of volatility. The dividend payment can vary because ASML bases the payout on the performance of the business (and because the dividend is subject to foreign exchange conversions). But still, the dividend is a core aspect of ASML's capital return program, which separates ASML from other tech stocks that don't pay dividends. As for now, ASML's dividend yield based on its trailing payout is 1.1%  -- which is respectable, given the S&P 500\u00a0yields just 1.3%. \nASML is built to last\nASML is a no-brainer buy because of its wide moat and ability to endure a downturn. The company is well-positioned to play an integral role in supporting AI chip advancements, regardless of changes to hyperscaler market share.\nThe stock's reasonable valuation and dividend make it a good buy for investors looking to avoid high-flying alternatives.\nAdd it all up, and ASML stock stands out as a compelling buy-and-hold candidate for investors who are focused on where their portfolio will be three to five years from now than the day-to-day market noise.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

MRCY Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: A securities fraud class action complaint against Mercury Systems, Inc. MRCY has survived defendants' attempts to dismiss the complaint.  Grabar Law Office is now investigating claims on behalf of long-term Mercury Systems shareholders. The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors of Mercury Systems have breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. Current Mercury Systems MRCY shareholders who have held shares since prior to February 3, 2021, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds spent defending litigation back to the company, and a court approved incentive award, at no cost to them whatsoever. To learn more or join click here: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/mercury-systems-shareholder-investigation/. WHY: A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint has now partially survived defendants' attempts to dismiss that complaint. The underlying complaint alleges that Mercury Systems, through certain of its officers and directors, used acquisitions and improper revenue recognition practices to mask its inability to grow organically. The complaint further alleges that Defendants repeatedly misled investors to believe that their growth was organic by misrepresenting several elements of Mercury's business, including by hiding that Mercury had switched from \"point-in-time\" to \"long-term contracts\" in order to improperly boost reported revenues and that several of Mercury's projects were in significant distress, including projects related to Mercury's acquisition of Physical Optics Corporation. Finally, the Complaint alleges Mercury also lied to investors about its strategic growth initiative, 1MPACT, which was designed to improve profit margins but unbeknownst to investors was used to disguise regular expenses as restructuring costs, enabling Mercury to claim that recurring expenses were one-time costs. On February 20, 2025, a Federal Court determined that certain key allegations in the plaintiff's underlying securities fraud class action complaint were adequately pleaded to survive defendants attempts to dismiss the complaint.

(\"Monolithic\" or the \"Company\") MPWR common stock between February 8, 2024 and November 8, 2024, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MONOLITHIC INVESTMENTS, CLICK\u00a0HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On October 30, 2024, Monolithic released its third quarter 2024 financial results, disclosing that its Enterprise Data revenue had declined sequentially during the quarter to $184 million, missing consensus estimates by nearly 13%. The Company further revealed that customer order patterns had fallen materially below recent historical trends, which was expected to continue. On this news, Monolithic's stock price fell $160.51, or 17.5%, to close at $759.30 per share on October 31, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on November 11, 2024, Edgewater Research published a report revealing that Nvidia had canceled half of its outstanding Monolithic orders and would be eliminating Monolithic as a supplier due to persistent \"[p]erformance issues\" with the Company's power modules. On this news, Monolithic's stock price fell $113.99, or 14.97%, to close at $647.31 per share on November 11, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Monolithic's voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits were suffering from significant performance and quality control issues; (2) that the defects had, in turn, negatively impacted the performance of certain products offered by Nvidia in which such products were used; (3) that Monolithic had failed to adequately address and resolve known issues affecting the performance of the power management solutions the Company supplied to Nvidia; (4) that Monolithic's relationship with Nvidia \u2013 the Company's most important customer \u2013 had been irreparably damaged due to the significant performance and quality control problems affecting the products it supplied to Nvidia and the Company's failure to adequately address such issues; and (5) as a result, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Monolithic common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than\u00a0April 7, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.
