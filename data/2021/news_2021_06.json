The Equinix infrastructure deploys in minutes, allowing enterprises to access an entire spectrum of NVIDIA resources that support virtually every aspect of AI, from data center training and inference to full-scale deployment at the edge.\nWith AI LaunchPad, Equinix customers can develop advanced AI on NVIDIA DGX\u2122 SuperPODs managed by NVIDIA Base Command\u2122 Platform, an AI development hub. Enterprises will also be able to use Base Command Platform on NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 from leading manufacturers including Dell Technologies and Lenovo. Built on the NVIDIA EGX\u2122 platform, these industry-standard servers are ideal for running the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite on VMware vSphere to deploy an AI-ready enterprise platform that scales AI on hybrid clouds.\nAdditionally, customers can securely deploy and manage AI applications across distributed edge infrastructure at Equinix with the NVIDIA Fleet Command\u2122 managed cloud service \u2014 which entered general availability today \u2014 connected to NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\n\u201cToday\u2019s enterprises are looking for a simple, comprehensive solution that provides instant access to the resources they need to build and deploy AI with ease,\u201d said Manuvir Das, head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA AI LaunchPad puts AI at the fingertips of enterprises everywhere with fully automated, hybrid-cloud infrastructure and software for every stage of the AI lifecycle.\u201d\n\nGlobal Ecosystem for AI in Hybrid Clouds\r\nIncreasingly, in order to build accurate AI models, applications need to access multiple external data sources that are spread across public clouds and private enterprise data centers. By using AI LaunchPad at an interconnected hub like Equinix, enterprises can have secure, high-speed access via Equinix Fabric\u2122 to an ecosystem of companies that operate their digital infrastructures at Equinix. The global reach of Platform Equinix, which includes more than 220 data centers strategically located in more than 60 metros spanning across five continents, also helps to satisfy real-time performance requirements for digital businesses.\n\u201cMany industries use private clouds to keep costs down by having computing resources close to the data, for performance, data privacy, ownership and sovereignty reasons,\u201d said Steve Steinhilber, vice president of Business Development at Equinix. \u201cWith NVIDIA AI LaunchPad globally available at Equinix, enterprises will have immediate access to NVIDIA software and NVIDIA-Certified infrastructure in a comprehensive hybrid-cloud solution.\u201d\nTurnkey Hybrid Cloud for Industries\r\nAmong the key industries served by Equinix is the automotive sector. Continental, one of the world\u2019s largest automotive technology companies, uses NVIDIA DGX\u2122 systems hosted at Equinix data centers to develop autonomous vehicle technologies for manufacturers.\n\u201cDeveloping advanced AI technologies requires substantial accelerated computing infrastructure, and having NVIDIA systems available globally in Equinix data centers ensures that our teams always have access to the resources they need,\u201d said Ismail Dagli, senior vice president of Research and Development in the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems business unit at Continental. \u201cAdding NVIDIA-powered AI inference and edge options to Equinix data centers is significant, as it enables AI to move from development into production.\u201d\nAccelerated AI on Mainstream Servers\r\nKey to AI LaunchPad is NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which is\u202fan end-to-end, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software that is optimized, supported and exclusively certified by NVIDIA to run on VMware vSphere\u202fwith NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\u202f\nWith AI Enterprise and VMware vSphere running on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, enterprises can easily deploy AI in Equinix data centers with near bare-metal performance across multiple nodes to power large, complex training and machine learning workloads.\n\u201cEnterprises are seeking solutions that enable them to easily integrate AI into their existing infrastructure,\u201d said Krish Prasad, senior vice president and general manager of the Cloud Platform business unit at VMware. \u201cVMware vSphere is critical to mainstreaming AI in the enterprise, and now, NVIDIA AI LaunchPad will deliver our AI-ready enterprise platform as a turnkey solution to\u202frapidly deploy, manage and scale AI workloads.\u201d\u202f\nEnterprise Security and Speed with NVIDIA GPUs and DPUs\r\nAI LaunchPad will leverage systems powered by NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs and NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae DPUs. This combination provides enterprises the ability to accelerate AI workloads and also take advantage of the security, isolation and performance enhancements provided by DPUs.\nAvailability \r\nThe first AI LaunchPad offerings at Equinix are expected this summer. Additional details are available on the NVIDIA website.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

Shares rose 2.3% to close at $713.01 on June 11. Nvidia designs and manufactures computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software for the gaming and professional markets. (See Nvidia stock analysis on TipRanks)  The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the third quarter of FY2021. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. DeepMap\u2019s technology will strengthen the mapping and localization abilities of NVIDIA DRIVE, the company\u2019s autonomous vehicles development platform. The technology will enhance the precision required by an AV to navigate itself safely. Ali Kani, the company\u2019s vice president and general manager of Automotive said, \u201cDeepMap is expected to extend our mapping products, help us scale worldwide map operations and expand our full self-driving expertise.\u201d Recently, after meeting with the company\u2019s management, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and said, \u201cNVDA remains one of our favorite ideas based on our view the company remains in the early stages of several secular growth drivers \u2013 independent of broader cyclical trends in semis.\u201d Caso added, \u201cIn Gaming, the company has secured enough supply to drive sequential growth through the balance of the year\u2026 In Datacenter, we believe NVDA has more shots on goal than any other semi supplier, led by an established leadership position in accelerated computing.\u201d Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 26 Buys and 1 Hold. The NVDA average analyst price target stands at $730.50 and implies upside potential of 2.5% to current levels. Shares have gained 94.3% over the past year.

On their face, they have no effect whatsoever on a company's value -- they simply change the number of outstanding shares a company has. Yet most investors take stock splits as highly encouraging. Witness the recent hype over NVIDIA's (NVDA -3.24%) decision to split its stock, and you'll get a sense of how much attention companies get when they make these moves.\nNVIDIA's move came years after its previous stock split, and there are plenty of stocks that have gone a long time without taking such action. In fact, many companies have never split their stock, and I won't speculate here about whether some of those high-flying leaders will change their minds now. But among stocks that have a history of past splits, a few in particular stand out as being ready to make a move soon.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT -1.54%) just hit a major milestone, rising above the $2 trillion mark in market capitalization. It became just the second U.S. stock to reach that level.\nMicrosoft used to split its stock regularly, but its share price got stuck in the doldrums for a long time following the tech bust in the early 2000s. It took Microsoft roughly 15 years to return to all-time highs after the decline, and it wasn't until early 2019 that the share price climbed above the $100 mark for good. Now, the stock fetches about $270 per share.\nHistorically, Microsoft has tended to do stock splits when its share price moved to between $150 and $200 per share. While many companies have moved away from frequent splits over the past 20 years, it's not surprising to see Microsoft having chosen to wait this time around. However, Microsoft is a Dow component, and its stock price determines its influence in the price-weighted index. With Microsoft having about double the influence of the larger Apple (AAPL -0.65%), there's definitely some appeal to a 2-for-1 split that would put the two tech giants on more of an even keel within the Dow.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Intuitive Surgical\nIn 2017, robotic surgery company Intuitive Surgical (ISRG -1.53%) did something that had fallen out of favor when it made its own 3-for-1 stock split. The split didn't entirely lead to a huge run of similar moves from other companies, but it did mark somewhat of a turning point as far as company perception of stock splits was concerned.\nIntuitive Surgical came up with a novel reason for its stock split four years ago. In addition to the usual comments about making share prices more affordable for retail investors, the company added that it was useful to be more precise in awarding stock-based compensation to employees. As prices rose, it was harder to dole out stock or options awards effectively. The same might well be happening now, as Intuitive has recovered strongly from weak industry conditions and rewarded long-term investors handsomely.\nThe last split from Intuitive Surgical came as the stock was approaching the $1,000 mark. With shares now fetching more than $900 per share, the same reasons for splitting appear to apply today.\n3. Netflix\nFinally, Netflix (NFLX -2.03%) rounds out this list of potential stock split candidates. With a price at around $530 per share, the stock isn't quite at levels that have led to past splits. However, it wouldn't be unreasonable for the streaming video giant to move forward with a split at current prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix's most recent stock split came in 2015. The 7-for-1 split came as Netflix had rocketed past the $700 per share mark, and it proved to be one of multiple 7-for-1 splits that seemed to come into vogue in the mid-2010s.\nFundamentally, Netflix's business is strong enough to support another split. Subscriptions soared in 2020, and the company could well be in position to boost its monthly subscription prices once again in the near future. Even with competition getting fierce in streaming video, Netflix has held its own with its wide selection of original and third-party content and its first-mover advantage.\nIt might take another leg up to motivate Netflix to do a stock split. However, that upward movement could come sooner than many think.\nDon't fret about splits\nInvestors like the short-term bump that often comes when a company announces a stock split. Just remember that split announcements don't have any true effect on a stock's value, and it'll leave you thinking about stock splits more as a sign of business optimism than as anything particularly meaningful about a stock.\n\n\n\nTeresa Kersten, an employee of LinkedIn, a Microsoft subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJun 09, 2021, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Today Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is finally allowing us to reveal performance numbers for its latest graphics card - the RTX 3070 Ti and below you can see gaming performance comparisons against a range of other Nvidia and AMD graphics cards in my full review. Unlike the RTX 3080 Ti that launched recently, the RTX 3070 Ti lands in the middle of Nvidia's product stack so is a prime contender for anyone upgrading from older mid-range models and is perhaps a little more interesting as a result of its far more reasonable price tag.\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 3070 TiAntony Leather\nIt has an MSRP of $599 compared to $499 for the RTX 3070, but obviously those prices aren't likely to be seen on etailer's shelves right now due to the microchip shortage and cryptocurrency mining seeing prices several times higher than where they should be. For now, though, I'm assuming there's a $100 difference between the two graphics cards.\n\n\nThe RTX 3070 Ti isn't a significant upgrade over the RTX 3070 on paper, with just a couple of hundred extra CUDA cores, two more RT cores, the same 256-bit memory interface and same amount of memory too. The RTX 3080 Ti towers over the RTX 3080 by comparison. There are some key takeaways, though, compared to the RTX 3070.\n\nThe Palit Geforce RTX 3070 Ti Gaming ProAntony Leather\n\nFirstly, the memory used is now GDDR6X and not slower, lower bandwidth GDDR6 used in the RTX 3070. The new card also has a sizeable increase in board power from 220W to 290W and as a result, now has a cooler that's an inch longer (for the Founders Edition version I tested) and also requires two 8-pin connectors via a splitter cable, while the RTX 3070 could make do with just one.\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nTest system and benchmarksMy graphics card test systemAntony Leather\nI've used the latest drivers from Nvidia and AMD as well as a fully up-to-date version of Windows 10 as of 31st May 2021. As we're dealing with mid-range cards in this review, I've added 1920 x 1080 tests for other mid-range cards for comparison at this resolution, but not the likes of the RTX 3090, which is why there are fewer results in the 1080p graphs. I've tested games with DLSS and ray tracing enabled, but also disabled on occasions - I'm very much in favor of using these features where they're available, but can appreciate not all will want to.\nMy hardware includes a water-cooled\u00a0BarrowCH Rhopilema\u00a0water-cooled test bench,\u00a016GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3,466MHz memory,\u00a0Intel Core i9-11900K, an Intel 760p M.2 SSD, Corsair RM850i PSU and\u00a0MSI MEG Z590 Ace motherboard. I've carried out all tests with resizable BAR/Smart Access Memory support enabled.\nAbove, Flight Simulator is a tough game to play smoothly at ultra settings, even at 1080p, but the RTX 3070 Ti leapfrogs both AMD cards to come out on top, sitting just ahead of the RX 6800 XT and offering a decent boost over the RTX 3070, albeit not one you'd want to upgrade from that card for.\nSwitching up to 1440p and the RTX 3070 Ti slips back a bit, matching the RX 6800, but with the RX 6800 XT a few frames ahead this time, with AMD doing quite well in this game at this resolution.\nAbove at 4K in Flight Simulator, the RTX 3070 Ti still can't match the RX 6800 XT but leaps ahead of the RX 6800 while the RTX 3070 can only match it. Overall we're looking at around 5-10 percent boost in performance in Flight Simulator over the RTX 3070.\nThe new enhanced edition of Metro Exodus is a little easier to run and at 1080p with ray tracing on but DLSS disabled, the RTX 3070 Ti offers around 5 percent more grunt over the RTX 3070 and actually matching the RX 6800 XT's average frame rate, although the latter offered a higher minimum 99th percentile.\nDialling up to 1440p and adding DLSS into the mix sees the RTX 3070 Ti outstrip all of the AMD cards, but not really offering much of a performance boost over the RTX 3070.\nAt 4K with DLSS disabled, the RTX 3070 Ti matched the RX 6800 XT and had a higher average frame rate too, with a decent gain there also over the RTX 3070, but not much over its one percent low minimum frame rate.\nFinally, adding DLSS into the mix again and the RTX 3070 Ti was nearly twice as fast than without it, but while it was leaps ahead of the AMD cards, it wasn't much quicker than the RTX 3070.\nWolfenstein is a pretty easy game to run and even with these mid-range cards and maximum settings, albeit ray tracing disabled, 200fps was an easy target. Again, though, while the 3070 Ti leapfrogged the RX 6800, it wasn't much quicker than the RTX 3070 and the RX 6800 XT was significantly faster still.\nAt 1440p, the RTX 3070 Ti could only match the RX 6800 and was around nine percent quicker than the RTX 3070.\nAt 4K, still with ray tracing disabled as it's not supported by AMD yet, the RTX 3070 Ti was quicker than the RX 6800 and around six percent faster than the RTX 3070. Clearly if you enable DLSS you'll see the AMD cards fall away.\nFinally, adding ray tracing into the mix as well as DLSS and the RTX 3070 Ti managed the same frame rates as the RX 6800XT did without ray tracing enabled and came close to matching the RX 6900XT in the previous graph too. It also offered a huge leap over the RTX 3070 here of over 20 percent.\nDirt 5 is another reasonably easy game to play, but the RTX 3070 Ti failed to better the RX 6800 here, which was a little quicker, while it was between five and 10 percent faster than the RTX 3070.\nIt was even between the RX 6800 and RTX 3070 Ti at 1440p and again there were decent gains over the RTX 3070.\nit was a near identical situation at 4K, with the AMD and Nvidia cards sitting on identical frame rates, but gains were again between five and ten percent higher than the RTX 3070.\nWith ray tracing enabled in Watch Dogs: Legion, the Nvidia has a clear advantage even before we switch on DLSS with both the RTX 3070 and 3070 Ti beating the RX 6800XT and the RTX 3070 Ti again offering five to 10 percent uplift over the RTX 3070.\nIt was a similar situation at 4K and with DLSS off, the RTX 3070 Ti was just about playable with a minimum 99th percentile of 25fps, again beating the RX 6800XT and offering similar gains as we've seen over the RTX 3070.\nFinally, adding DLSS into the mix at 4K and the RTX 3070 Ti was noticeably quicker than the RTX 3070, with DLSS providing playable frame rates, leapfrogging all the AMD cards, but the extra grunt and memory of the RTX 3080 and above allowing them to offer significantly higher frame rates.\nPower consumption sat at 442W under load for the system as a whole, which was nearly 40W higher than the RTX 3070. That's certainly not going to mean you'll need a new power supply, though, unless you were already running near your current unit's limits or only have one eight-pin power connector, with the RTX 3070 Ti now needing two, but that's only likely to be an issue with old sub 600W power supplies.Nvidia's RTX 3070 Ti Founders EditionAntony Leather\nConclusions\nOverall I think the RTX 3070 Ti is perhaps less exciting than the RTX 2070 Super was, which offered bigger gains over the RTX 2070 at the time. Also in the old card's favor was pricing, with the RTX 2070 not saving you much cash over the RTX 2070 Super either. Here, the RTX 3070 Ti is consistently faster, but rarely by more than five to 10 percent, with typical figures falling between those two numbers. Thankfully, it's also rare that the new card doesn't offer a significant benefit either.\nThe RTX 3070 Ti is certainly not worth considering as an upgrade over the RTX 3070, but instead slots in nicely above it and generally offers noticeable gains over the RTX 3070 as well as leapfrogging the RX 6800 in a few tests and even giving the RX 6800XT something to think about too, even without the benefit of DLSS. It also offers playable frame rates in far more situations at 4K than the RTX 3070 too, with the RTX 3070 dipping below a one percent low minimum frame rate of 25fps far more often. That's the case with DLSS enabled too, such as in Watch Dogs Legion, where the RTX 3070 Ti was a much more capable card.\nOf course, while the $100 MSRP difference would ultimately mean the RTX 3070 Ti would be worth the extra cash in a few situations, especially for casual 4K gamers, you almost certainly won't be able to buy it for $599. However, while it's not light years ahead of the RTX 3070, it's certainly worth spending a little more than that card for the extra five to 10 percent boost and more solid 4K gaming performance. Hopefully its crypto mining limiter will mean there are a few more to go around as well.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks that will Benefit from Biden's $6 Trillion Plan. United States President Joe Biden recently unveiled an ambitious $6 trillion budget proposal that includes the previously announced American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan that the White House hopes will get approved by legislators on both sides of the aisle in the coming weeks. The budget proposes over $5 trillion in federal spending on infrastructure, defense, education, housing, and health care. The $6 trillion plan is an improvement on the $4.8 trillion budget for 2020 and almost double the $3.6 trillion federal budget in 2009.   Economic experts have raised concerns around the proposed new tax hikes and increased spending in the plan that are likely to further widen the overall deficit, arguing that the proposal envisions spending that would not be made up in taxes for years to come. Giving in to some of these demands, Biden has over the last week signaled that he would be willing to roll back some of his plans in order to get the broader proposal approved by Congress. This includes a rollback of a massive hike in capital gains tax that has met fierce criticism.  Some of the stocks that would benefit if the budget is approved include Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), the telecom firm based in New York, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), the defense contractor based in Maryland, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), the California-based technology firm. All three are widely accepted as industry leaders in their respective markets, with the proposal envisioning government incentives for American manufacturers so they can compete in international markets.   More than $100 billion have been set aside for the development of communications networks, including 5G, across the United States over the next five years. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), which is one of the largest telecom firms in the country, would benefit hugely from this improved infrastructure. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) recently became the 5G partner of fifteen teams that play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and announced that it had installed 5G antennas in fourteen additional basketball arenas across the US. The Biden administration has also allocated more than $750 billion for defense spending, most of which will be rolled out to American defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) to improve the overall capabilities of the US forces. On June 4, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) announced that it had entered into talks with the government for a total of 169 F-135 aircraft deliveries and production rates for 2022. The company hopes to deliver over 130 jets this year after a disappointing 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Story Continues The improvement of 5G coverage and increased spending on housing and healthcare are expected to bring much-needed relief to the American middle class, freeing up some of their savings that could be spent on electronic devices and video games developed with the help of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company recently crushed earnings estimates and put out improved guidance numbers, prompting investment firms to upgrade NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock ratings and raise price targets. It remains to be seen whether the $6 trillion plan will be approved and the modifications that will have to be made for the proposal to become law. Meanwhile, the post-pandemic stock market continues to baffle financial experts. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\u2019s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\u2019s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

On June 3, market analysts at investment advisory Baird projected that The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) would miss delivery targets for the second quarter by 20% versus the consensus predictions, but said the overall outlook on the firm was constructive on the back of the Boeing 737 MAX recovery. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 59 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.4 billion in The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA), up from 55 in the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Just like Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) is one of the best stocks that will benefit from Biden's $6 trillion plan.In its Q1 2020 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cWe\u2019ve known Boeing for a long time. It\u2019s always been a high quality company that\u2019s traded for a premium valuation owing to its position as a global duopoly. We\u2019d looked at it recently after weakness due to its highly publicized Max 737 issues, but it never got cheap enough for us to pull the trigger. After the pandemic, the stock went into freefall as its customer bases\u2019 business dried up and people worried about its liquidity. The stock fell from $338 on February 19th when the S&P hit its high to a low of $89. We bought the stock after the new CEO Dave Calhoun said publicly that it would not take government capital if it required equity dilution because it had many other options. Our average price is just above $120 where it was trading for less than 7x what it earned in 2018. It will likely take a while to normalize to those earnings levels, but this business will survive and ultimately we will own a leader in a global duopoly. Even on depressed forecasts, the company currently has about a 10-15% free cash flow yield. If and when the economy normalizes, we think Boeing could be worth more than double its current price.\u201d 8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is a California-based company that primarily makes and sells electric vehicles but has stakes in the clean energy business as well. It was founded in 2003 and is placed eighth on our list of 10 best stocks that will benefit from Biden's $6 trillion plan. The stock has returned 238% to investors in the past few months. The $6 trillion plan by President Biden, which includes tax break extensions and other incentives for companies working on electric and new energy vehicles, gives Tesla shares increased upside potential.On June 4, media reports claimed that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) was looking to launch in India by the end of the year with initial plans seeking a sales and marketing setup to be followed by showrooms in the megacities of Mumbai, Bangalore, and capital New Delhi.At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 62 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), down from 68 in the preceding quarter worth $12 billion. Just like Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is one of the best stocks that will benefit from Biden's $6 trillion plan.Here is what Baron Partners Fund has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:\u201cTesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, energy storage solutions, and battery cells. The stock fell during the quarter as a result of general market dynamics and a potential production slowdown due to parts shortages. A refreshed S/X and China Model Y ramp could also have a negative impact on margins in early 2021. We anticipate strong growth and improved margins driven by new production capacity, manufacturing efficiencies, localization of its manufacturing and supply chain, and maturation of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving technology.\u201d 7. Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) is a New York-based company that makes and sells hydrogen fuel cell systems. It was founded in 1997 and is ranked seventh on our list of 10 best stocks that will benefit from Biden's $6 trillion plan. The company\u2019s shares have offered investors returns exceeding 526% in the past twelve months. The firm is aiming to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels by marketing hydrogen as an alternative energy source. The company will gain from the incentives offered to clean energy firms in the $6 trillion plan.On May 28, investment advisory BTIG initiated coverage on Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $40, backing the firm to succeed as the momentum around green hydrogen, an industry still in infancy, builds rapidly. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm DE Shaw is a leading shareholder in Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) with 12 million shares worth more than $433 million.Just like Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) is one of the best stocks that will benefit from Biden's $6 trillion plan.In its Q2 2020 investor letter, Massif Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cWe also closed our short position in Plug Power this quarter as the market was subsumed with enthusiasm over their recent acquisitions, resulting in an almost 80% rally in the stock over ten trading days. Our decision to exit was painful at the time as we were forced to reconcile with a collective exuberance that was (and is, in our opinion) not grounded reality. In hindsight, it was the correct decision as we avoided most of its recent vertical trajectory.\u201d 6. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) is a New York-based financial services company. It was founded in 1869 and is placed sixth on our list of 10 best stocks that will benefit from Biden's $6 trillion plan.

We look forward to continuing our journey as part of\u00a0the\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0team.\u201d\u00a0\nMaps that are accurate to within a few meters are good enough when providing turn-by-turn directions for humans. AVs, however, require much greater precision. They must operate with centimeter-level precision for accurate localization, the ability of an AV to locate itself in the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nProper localization also requires constantly updated maps. These maps must also reflect current road conditions, such as a work zone or a lane closure and efficiently scale across AV fleets, with fast processing and minimal data storage. Finally, they must be able to function worldwide.\u00a0\nExperienced Mapmakers\u00a0\nDeepMap\u00a0was\u00a0founded five years ago\u00a0by Wu and Mark Wheeler, veterans of Google, Apple and Baidu, among other companies. The U.S.-based company has developed a high-definition mapping solution that meets these requirements and has already been validated by the AV industry with a wide array of potential customers around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nA DeepMap map in San Jose, Calif., depicting highly detailed features of the road and surrounding city block environment, including a reliable semantic layer of information with key attributes such as navigable boundaries, lane boundaries, crosswalks, traffic signs and traffic signals, explicit and implicit yield lines, and lane connectivity.\nThe team, primarily located in the San Francisco Bay Area, has many decades of collective experience in mapping technology and\u00a0developed a solution that considers autonomous vehicles both map creators and map consumers. Using crowdsourced data from vehicle sensors lets\u00a0DeepMap\u00a0build a high-definition map that\u2019s\u00a0continuously updated as the car drives.\u00a0\nOngoing Partner Support\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA will continue working with\u00a0DeepMap\u2019s\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0to meet their\u00a0needs, investing in new capabilities and services for new and existing partners.\u00a0\nNVIDIA DRIVE is a software-defined, end-to-end platform \u2014 from deep neural network training and validation in the data center to high-performance compute in the vehicle \u2014 that enables continuous improvement and deployment via over-the-air updates. \u00a0\nDeepMap\u2019s technology will bolster the mapping and localization capabilities available on NVIDIA DRIVE, ensuring autonomous vehicles always know precisely where they are and where they\u2019re going.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are excited to welcome the DeepMap team to NVIDIA. They have a proven track record and are entrepreneurial, nimble and engineering-focused. DeepMap meets a deep need in the industry, and together we will develop and extend these capabilities,\u201d said Kani.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s called synthetic data.\nWhat Is Synthetic Data?\nSynthetic data is annotated information that computer simulations or algorithms generate as an alternative to real-world data.\nPut another way, synthetic data is created in digital worlds rather than collected from or measured in the real world.\nIt may be artificial, but synthetic data reflects real-world data, mathematically or statistically. Research demonstrates it can be as good or even better for training an AI model than data based on actual objects, events or people.\nUsers can generate synthetic data for autonomous vehicles using Python inside NVIDIA Omniverse.\nThat\u2019s why developers of deep neural networks increasingly use synthetic data to train their models. Indeed, a survey of the field calls use of synthetic data \u201cone of the most promising general techniques on the rise in modern deep learning, especially computer vision\u201d that relies on unstructured data like images and video.\nThe 156-page report cites 719 papers on synthetic data. It concludes \u201csynthetic data is essential for further development of deep learning \u2026 [and] many more potential use cases still remain\u201d to be discovered.\nThe rise of synthetic data comes as AI pioneer Andrew Ng is calling for a broad shift to a more data-centric approach to machine learning. He\u2019s rallying support for a benchmark or competition on data quality which many claim represents 80 percent of the work in AI.\n\u201cMost benchmarks provide a fixed set of data and invite researchers to iterate on the code \u2026 perhaps it\u2019s time to hold the code fixed and invite researchers to improve the data,\u201d he wrote in his newsletter, The Batch.\nSynthetic data will become the main form of data used in AI. Source: Gartner, \u201cMaverick Research: Forget About Your Real Data \u2013 Synthetic Data Is the Future of AI,\u201d Leinar Ramos, Jitendra Subramanyam, 24 June 2021.\nIn a report on synthetic data, Gartner predicted by 2030 most of the data used in AI will be artificially generated by rules, statistical models, simulations or other techniques.\n\u201cThe fact is you won\u2019t be able to build high-quality, high-value AI models without synthetic data,\u201d the report said.\nWhy Is Synthetic Data So Important?\nDevelopers need large, carefully labeled datasets to train neural networks. More diverse training data generally makes for more accurate AI models.\nThe problem is gathering and labeling datasets that may contain a few thousand to tens of millions of elements is time consuming and often prohibitively expensive.\nEnter synthetic data. A single image that could cost $6 from a labeling service can be artificially generated for six cents, estimates Paul Walborsky, who co-founded one of the first dedicated synthetic data services.\nCost savings are just the start. Synthetic data can address privacy issues and reduce bias by ensuring users have the data diversity to represent the real world.\nBecause synthetic datasets are automatically labeled and can deliberately include rare but crucial corner cases, it\u2019s sometimes better than real-world data. For example, in the video below NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator generates synthetic data to train autonomous vehicles to navigate safely amid shopping carts and pedestrians in a simulated parking lot.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of Synthetic Data?\nSynthetic data has been around in one form or another for decades. It\u2019s in computer games like flight simulators and scientific simulations of everything from atoms to galaxies.\nDonald B. Rubin, a Harvard statistics professor, was helping branches of the U.S. government sort out issues such as an undercount especially of poor people in a census when he hit upon an idea. He described it in a 1993 paper often cited as the birth of synthetic data.\n\u201cI used the term synthetic data in that paper referring to multiple simulated datasets,\u201d Rubin explained.\n\u201cEach one looks like it could have been created by the same process that created the actual dataset, but none of the datasets reveal any real data \u2014 this has a tremendous advantage when studying personal, confidential datasets,\u201d he added.\nClick to animate: Developers can expand synthetic datasets with alterations that provide more variety and better AI accuracy.\nIn the wake of the Big Bang of AI, the ImageNet competition of 2012 when a neural network recognized objects faster than a human could, researchers started hunting in earnest for synthetic data.\nWithin a couple years, \u201cresearchers were using rendered images in experiments, and it was paying off well enough that people started investing in products and tools to generate data with their 3D engines and content pipelines,\u201d said Gavriel State, a senior director of simulation technology and AI at NVIDIA.\nAugmented and Anonymized Versus Synthetic Data\nMost developers are already familiar with data augmentation, a technique that involves adding new data to an existing real-world dataset. For example, they might rotate or brighten an existing image to create a new one.\nGiven concerns and government policies about privacy, removing personal information from a dataset is another increasingly common practice. This is called data anonymization, and it\u2019s especially popular for text, a kind of structured data used in industries like finance and healthcare.\nAugmented and anonymized data are not typically considered synthetic data. However, it\u2019s possible to create synthetic data using these techniques. For example, developers could blend two images of real-world cars to create a new synthetic image with two cars.\nFord, BMW Generate Synthetic Data\nIndeed, car makers \u2014 as well as banks, drones, factories, hospitals, retailers, robots and scientists \u2014 use synthetic data today.\nIn a recent podcast, researchers from Ford described how they combine gaming engines and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic data for AI training.\nTo optimize the process of how it makes cars, BMW created a virtual factory using NVIDIA Omniverse, a simulation platform that lets companies collaborate using multiple tools. The data BMW generates helps fine tune how assembly workers and robots work together to build cars efficiently. (See video below).\n\nIn logistics, Amazon Robotics uses synthetic data to train robots to identify packages of varying types and sizes. Food and beverage giant PepsiCo employs Omniverse Replicator to generate synthetic data it uses to train AI models in NVIDIA TAO, making its operations more efficient. (See video below.)\n\nSynthetic Data at the Hospital, Bank and Store\nHealthcare providers in fields such as medical imaging use synthetic data to train AI models while protecting patient privacy. For example, startup Curai trained a diagnostic model on 400,000 simulated medical cases.\n\u201cGAN-based architectures for medical imaging, either generating synthetic data [or] adapting real data from other domains \u2026 will define the state of the art in the field for years to come,\u201d said Nikolenko in his 2019 survey.\nGANs are getting traction in finance, too. American Express studied ways to use GANs to create synthetic data, refining its AI models that detect fraud.\nIn retail, companies such as startup Caper use 3D simulations to take as few as five images of a product and create a synthetic dataset of a thousand images. Such datasets enable smart stores where customers grab what they need and go without waiting in a checkout line.\nHow Do You Create Synthetic Data?\n\u201cThere are a bazillion techniques out there\u201d to generate synthetic data, said State from NVIDIA. For example, variational autoencoders compress a dataset to make it compact, then use a decoder to spawn a related synthetic dataset.\nIn another approach, NVIDIA researchers used AI to turn 2D video data into full 3D simulations. Their Neural Reconstruction Engine, now part of NVIDIA Drive, lets users automate the job of developing simulations and digital twins as shown in the video below.\n\nSeparately, NVIDIA is developing thousands of full-blown 3D models of real-world objects such as forklifts, palettes and ladders that developers can drop into their simulations. These SimReady assets are available for use in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for creating and collaborating in the metaverse of virtual worlds.\nWhile GANs are on the rise, especially in research, simulations remain a popular option for two reasons. They support a host of tools to segment and classify still and moving images, generating perfect labels. And they can quickly spawn versions of objects and environments with different colors, lighting, materials and poses.\nThis last capability delivers the synthetic data that\u2019s crucial for domain randomization, a technique increasingly used to improve the accuracy of AI models and tailor them to the needs of any user\u2019s application.\nPro Tip: Use Domain Randomization\nDomain randomization uses thousands of variations of an object and its environment so an AI model can more easily understand the general pattern. The video below shows how a smart warehouse uses domain randomization to train an AI-powered robot.\n\nDomain randomization helps close the so-called domain gap \u2014 the space short of the perfect predictions an AI model would make if it was trained on the exact situation it happens to find on a given day. That\u2019s why NVIDIA is building domain randomization for synthetic data generation tools into Omniverse, one part of the work described in a recent talk at GTC.\nSuch techniques are helping computer vision apps move from detecting and classifying objects in images to seeing and understanding activities in videos.\nSynthetic data is especially valuable when working with video where users can create fully annotated video frames. Experts expect this approach to catch fire.\nWhere Can I Get Synthetic Data?\nThough the sector is only a few years old, nearly 100 companies already provide synthetic data. Each has its own special sauce, often a focus on a particular vertical market or technique.\nFor example, a handful specialize in health care uses. A half dozen offer open source tools or datasets, including the Synthetic Data Vault, a set of libraries, projects and tutorials developed at MIT.\nNVIDIA aims to work with a wide range of synthetic data and data-labeling services. Among its latest partners:\n\nSynthesis AI uses synthetic data to help customers build advanced AI models for computer vision applications.\nSky Engine, based in London, works on computer vision apps across markets and can help users design their own data-science workflow.\nIsrael-based Datagen creates synthetic datasets from simulations for a wide range of markets, including smart stores, robotics and interiors for cars and buildings.\nCVEDIA includes Airbus, Honeywell and Siemens among users of its customizable tools for computer vision based on synthetic data.\nMostly AI provides a free synthetic data generator.\n\nTraining Robots With Synthetic Data\nWith Omniverse, NVIDIA aims to enable an expanding galaxy of designers and programmers interested in building or collaborating in virtual worlds across every industry. Synthetic data generation is one of many businesses the company expects will live there.\nNVIDIA created Isaac Sim as an application in Omniverse for robotics. Users can train robots in this virtual world with synthetic data and domain randomization and deploy the resulting software on robots working in the real world.\nOmniverse supports multiple applications for vertical markets such as NVIDIA DRIVE Sim for autonomous vehicles. It\u2019s been letting developers test self-driving cars in the safety of a realistic simulation, generating useful datasets even in the midst of the pandemic.\nThese applications are among the latest examples of how simulations are fulfilling the promise of synthetic data for AI.\nLearn More About Synthetic Data\nFor more information on synthetic data, check out these resources:\n\nAn ebook by O\u2019Reilly and NVIDIA on using synthetic data in AI\nA talk on synthetic data at GTC 2022 with Bhumin Pathak, , senior product manager, Omniverse Replicator, NVIDIA (free registration required)\nAn interview with Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation technology at NVIDIA\nAn assortment of NVIDIA developer blogs published in 2021 on synthetic data.\nA presentation at GTC 2021 by Scotiabank and the University of Alberta on research using generative models to create synthetic data (Free registration required)\nOpen Synthetics provides a wealth of\u00a0 synthetic datasets and papers with contributions from Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft and NVIDIA\nExamples with code samples for synthetic data generation on Omniverse\nA technical blog on synthetic data for explainable AI\n\nWatch this on-demand technical webinar on generating synthetic data for training AI models with Isaac Replicator.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: AEC | Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Data Science | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Industrial and Manufacturing | Machine Learning | Omniverse | Synthetic Data Generation | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

During the meeting, the AI model will capture each individual\u2019s real-time motion and apply it to the previously uploaded still image.\nThat means that by uploading a photo of themselves in formal attire, meeting attendees with mussed hair and pajamas can appear on a call in work-appropriate attire, with AI mapping the user\u2019s facial movements to the reference photo. If the subject is turned to the left, the technology can adjust the viewpoint so the attendee appears to be directly facing the webcam.\nBesides helping meeting attendees look their best, this AI technique also shrinks the bandwidth needed for video conferencing by up to 10x, avoiding jitter and lag. It\u2019ll soon be available in the NVIDIA Video Codec SDK as the AI Face Codec.\n\u201cMany people have limited internet bandwidth, but still want to have a smooth video call with friends and family,\u201d said NVIDIA researcher Ming-Yu Liu, co-author on the project. \u201cIn addition to helping them, the underlying technology could also be used to assist the work of animators, photo editors and game developers.\u201d\nVid2Vid Cameo was presented this week at the prestigious Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition \u2014 one of 28 NVIDIA papers at the virtual event. It\u2019s also available on the AI Playground, where anyone can experience our research demos firsthand.\nAI Steals the Show\nIn a nod to classic heist movies (and a hit Netflix show), NVIDIA researchers put their talking-head GAN model through its paces for a virtual meeting. The demo highlights key features of Vid2Vid Cameo, including facial redirection, animated avatars and data compression.\n\nThese capabilities are coming soon to the NVIDIA Maxine SDK, which gives developers optimized pretrained models for video, audio and augmented reality effects in video conferencing and live streaming.\nDevelopers can already adopt Maxine AI effects including intelligent noise removal, video upscaling and body pose estimation. The free-to-download SDK can also be paired with the NVIDIA Riva\u00a0platform for conversational AI applications, including transcription and translation.\nHello from the AI Side\nVid2Vid Cameo requires just two elements to create a realistic AI talking head for video conferencing: a single shot of the person\u2019s appearance and a video stream that dictates how that image should be animated.\nDeveloped on NVIDIA DGX systems, the model was trained using a dataset of 180,000 high-quality talking head videos. The network learned to identify 20 key points that can be used to model facial motion without human annotations. The points encode the location of features including the eyes, mouth and nose.\nIt then extracts these key points from a reference image of the caller, which could be sent to other video conference participants ahead of time or re-used from previous meetings. This way, instead of sending bulky live video streams from one participant to the other, video conferencing platforms can simply send data on how the speaker\u2019s key facial points are moving.\nOn the receiver\u2019s side, the GAN model uses this information to synthesize a video that mimics the appearance of the reference image.\nBy compressing and sending just the head position and key points back and forth, instead of full video streams, this technique can reduce bandwidth needs for video conferences by 10x, providing a smoother user experience. The model can be adjusted to transmit a differing number of key points to adapt to different bandwidth environments without compromising visual quality.\nThe viewpoint of the resulting talking head video can also be freely adjusted to show the user from a side profile or straight on, as well as from lower or higher camera angles. This feature could also be applied by photo editors working with still images.\n\nNVIDIA researchers found that Vid2Vid Cameo outperforms state-of-the-art models by producing more realistic and sharper results \u2014 whether the reference image and the video are from the same person, or when the AI is tasked with transferring movement from one person onto a reference image of another.\nThe latter feature can be used to apply the facial motions of a speaker to animate a digital avatar in a video conference, or even lend realistic expression and movement to a video game or cartoon character.\nThe paper behind Vid2Vid Cameo was authored by NVIDIA researchers Ting-Chun Wang, Arun Mallya and Ming-Yu Liu. The NVIDIA Research team consists of more than 200 scientists around the globe, focusing on areas such as AI, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and graphics.\nOur thanks to actor Edan Moses, who performed the English voiceover of The Professor on \u201cLa Casa De Papel/Money Heist\u201d on Netflix, for his contribution to the video above featuring our latest AI research.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | NVIDIA Research | Video Streaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Tomorrow, with a Linux graphics driver update, we\u2019ll also be adding support for Vulkan API DLSS games on Proton.\nThis is in addition to the 5 recently announced DLSS titles that are coming soon, including LEGO\u00ae Builder\u2019s Journey on June 22nd, DOOM Eternal on June 29th, and Red Dead Redemption 2. And this month has already seen DLSS released in Rainbow Six Siege, No Man\u2019s Sky and The Persistence, and as a plugin in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Now Available In Unreal Engine 5 and Coming To Unity 2021.2\nNVIDIA DLSS is available as a free plugin for the industry\u2019s most used game engines: our DLSS plugin for Unreal Engine 4 launched in February, support for Unity is upcoming in 2021.2, and our DLSS plugin for Unreal Engine 5 launched on June 17th. Engine integrations make it fast and easy for developers to enable DLSS in their games.\n\u201cThe Unreal Engine 4 plugin makes light work of adding NVIDIA DLSS to your game, in fact we dropped it in over the weekend,\u201d said Matthew Kenneally, Lead Engineer at Night Dive Studios. \u201cBringing System Shock to a new generation of gamers has been a labor of love for our team, and the impact NVIDIA DLSS will have on the player\u2019s experience is undeniable.\u201d\nAdditionally, developers have brought DLSS to a dozen of their own in-house engines, making it even faster for them to bring DLSS to future titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is widely adopted within the industry because it allows developers to get higher quality experiences into the hands of more gamers. Players can double or in some cases even triple frame rates by enabling DLSS, allowing many more to experience games at the highest resolutions and with beautiful graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Linux Support For Proton\nNVIDIA DLSS support for Vulkan API games will be available from June 22nd on Proton, enabling Linux gamers to use the dedicated AI Tensor Cores of their GeForce RTX GPUs to accelerate frame rates in DOOM Eternal, No Man\u2019s Sky, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Support for DLSS-enhanced DirectX titles running via Proton will arrive this Fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS - How It Works\nNVIDIA DLSS is an AI super resolution algorithm accelerated by Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs. Super resolution is the process of accurately predicting a higher resolution output (e.g. 4K) from a lower resolution input (e.g. 1080p). It allows the game to render at 1080p, improving frame rates, then uses AI and game engine data to deliver the image quality of a native 4K output.\nIn order to generate a 4K DLSS output (8.2 million pixels) from a 1080p game input (2 million pixels), the algorithm has to predict an additional 6.2 million pixels. The more information the DLSS algorithm can receive about those pixels, the better the resulting 4K output.\nDLSS achieves great image quality by using 4 different inputs to determine the final frame seen on your display:\n\nThe lower resolution image rendered by the game engine (e.g. 1080p)\nThe motion vectors of the same image, generated by the game engine. Motion vectors tell the algorithm which direction objects in the scene are moving from frame to frame\nThe high resolution output of the previous DLSS-enhanced frame (4K)\nA large data set of 16K-resolution ground truth images of different types of game content used to train the AI network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA special type of AI network, called a convolutional autoencoder, takes the low resolution current frame, motion vectors, and the high resolution previous frame, to determine on a pixel-by-pixel basis how to generate a higher resolution current frame.\nBy looking at motion vectors and the prior high resolution output, DLSS can track objects from frame to frame, delivering stability in motion, and reducing flickering and popping artifacts. This process is known as \u2018temporal feedback,\u2019 as it uses history to inform the future.\nWith access to prior frames and motion vectors, DLSS can track each pixel, and take multiple samples of the same pixel across frames (known as temporal supersampling), delivering better detail and edge quality than traditional upscaling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy training against a large dataset of 16K-resolution images, the DLSS algorithm learns to predict high resolution frames with greater accuracy. And through continual training on NVIDIA\u2019s supercomputers, DLSS can learn how to deal with new classes of content -- from fire to smoke to particle effects -- at a rate that engineers hand-coding non-AI algorithms simply could not keep up with.\nWith GeForce RTX Tensor Cores delivering up to 285 teraflops of dedicated AI horsepower, NVIDIA DLSS can be run in real-time simultaneously with an intensive 3D game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS vs. Upscaling and Sharpening\nThere are several alternate methods to upscaling resolution, though none have achieved the image quality of DLSS. To better understand how DLSS achieves its excellent results, it is helpful to know how traditional upscaling works.\nNVIDIA offers a GPU scaling and sharpening solution called NVIDIA Image Sharpening (NIS), which is available for all games on all GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs via the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable NVIDIA Image Sharpening, open the NVIDIA Control Panel, go to \u201cManage 3D Settings,\u201d and turn on Image Sharpening & select \u201cGPU Scaling\u201d. Then set your desired resolution in your game settings, and it will automatically apply NVIDIA\u2019s upscaling and sharpening\nNVIDIA Image Sharpening upscales images by averaging neighboring pixels (using a 5 tap scaler on GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX 16-Series GPUs) and then using an adaptive sharpening filter (a shader) to enhance edges. In contrast to DLSS, the algorithm is non-AI and non-temporal, using only information from the current low resolution image rendered by the game as an input. While the resulting image quality is often better than typical monitor or in-game resolution scaling options, it lacks the temporal data and AI smarts of DLSS to deliver native resolution detail and robust frame-to-frame stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see this in action, let\u2019s look at a comparison between Native, DLSS, and NIS upscaled and sharpened content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, DLSS stabilizes the image compared to the upscaled image, and even native resolution. These results are achieved only through a combination of motion vectors, temporal feedback, and the advanced AI algorithm. \nTo understand the importance of AI in this equation, let\u2019s look at a comparison between the initial release of DLSS in Control, which used a non-AI heuristic, and DLSS 2.0, which uses AI. By training across 16K-resolution ground truth images, DLSS 2.0 learned how to capture subtle details and better handle difficult content such as the rotating fan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo captured in Control at 1920x1080 with the initial DLSS version released in Control, and with DLSS 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRust Adds NVIDIA DLSS July 1 \nFacepunch Studios is bringing NVIDIA DLSS to Rust on July 1st, accelerating performance for GeForce RTX players.

However, there are many investors who would opt for either dividend income or earnings and revenue growth. This divide between growth and dividend investors has left a rift among dividend stocks. But does there need to be one? Not necessarily.\u00a0\nWhile we can find growth stocks with a minuscule dividend \u2014 hello Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2014 we can also find dividend stocks that have growth as well. After all, the companies that are able to pay a stable, growing dividend often have a solid business behind them.\u00a0\nSo, for this article, I wanted to take a look at high-quality companies that have both growth and a decent dividend payout. Specifically, I am looking for names that have forecasts for double-digit earnings growth. The more dependable the dividend and the stronger the earnings, the better.\u00a0\nBelieve it or not, there are not that many dividend stocks that fit the bill. But here are the seven promising names that I\u2019ve found:\u00a0\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD)\nToyota Motors (NYSE:TM)\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)\n3M\u00a0(NYSE:MMM)\nRealty Income (NYSE:O)\nPepsico (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\n\nDividend Stocks with Earnings Growth: Procter & Gamble (PG)\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\nThe first name on this list is one of the dividend kings, so I\u2019m glad that P&G was able to make the cut. In May, Procter & Gamble paid out a dividend of roughly 87 cents a share, a 10% increase from the prior dividend.\u00a0\nThat marked the company\u2019s 65th consecutive year of a dividend raise. Think about that for a minute; not only has this company paid its dividend for more than six decades, it has raised that payout in each one of those years as well. With a 2.58% dividend yield and a consistently rising payout, PG stock is one worth owning. But the company even has solid growth, too.\u00a0\nP&G is forecast to grow earnings by about 10% this year. Analysts expect that growth on 6.5% revenue growth, so we should see a slight boost to margins as well. Estimates temper down in 2022, calling for earnings growth of roughly 6%, but that\u2019s still decent for a company like P&G.\nIs this the sexiest stock out there? No, not unless you love detergent and household items. But as far as portfolios go, PG stock has been an extremely rewarding pick of the dividend stocks to hold over the years.\u00a0\n\nHome Depot (HD)\n \nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n \nHome Depot is a little newer to the dividend game, but it\u2019s not wasting any time stepping up to the plate as one of the dividend stocks. The company currently pays out a 2.10% yield or $1.65 per share. Like P&G, that\u2019s after a 10% year-over-year boost.\u00a0\nHome Depot\u2019s main competitor, Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW), also has a focus on its dividend. It just gave its payout a 33% boost, its 25th consecutive year with a raise. Lowe\u2019s has also been consistently paying a dividend for more than five decades.\u00a0\nSo, Lowe\u2019s may have Home Depot beat when it comes to dividend longevity, but the latter is still a formidable competitor. For example, HD has raised its dividend by more than 10% annually for at least a decade. That\u2019s pretty darn impressive and has been a huge reward for long-term investors \u2014 particularly with shares climbing almost 800% in that span.\u00a0\nGiven the booming state of the housing market, it should also be no surprise that Home Depot has been crushing it, too. Analysts expect almost 19% earnings growth this year as consumers continue to renovate, upgrade and invest in their homes.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s hard to see that trend slowing much in the future. While Lowe\u2019s has a lower dividend yield (1.66%), it\u2019s forecast to grow earnings nearly 24% this year. As such, really both HD stock and LOW stock could be included on this list.\u00a0\n\nDividend Stocks with Earnings Growth: Toyota Motors (TM)\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\nThere\u2019s been a renewed interest in owning automakers lately. Whether that\u2019s a budding long-term secular trend or a short-term post-coronavirus phenomenon, we don\u2019t know yet. Either way, it now brings our attention to Toyota Motors for this list of dividend stocks.\u00a0\nToyota was the largest automaker in the world by market capitalization. That is, until Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) came exploding onto the scene in 2020. The electric vehicle (EV) maker obliterated its foes by market cap, amassing such a size that it quickly became one of the 10 largest companies in the country.\u00a0\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s recent acceleration doesn\u2019t make Toyota a slouch by any means. For one, this company is also investing its resources in alternative-fuel vehicles and is looking for ways to heighten its growth. Sure, TM stock has not gone through a Tesla-like rally, but it has enjoyed a strong run so far.\u00a0\nAs of June 2021, TM stock hit a new all-time high \u2014 $185.38 \u2014 not something many other auto stocks can say. Further, shares are up 40% over the past one year and about 15% year-to-date (YTD). The latter figure outpaces the S&P 500 (albeit, barely).\u00a0\nFinally, while Toyota shares may need a rest, investors can lean on the stock\u2019s 2.75% dividend yield.\u00a0\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\nNext up on this list of dividend stocks is a name in the semiconductor space, which continues to do well. Demand remains high while supply remains tight. That has stretched across multiple industries as the novel coronavirus continues to impact supply chains.\u00a0\nBut for Texas Instruments, the company continues to hum along. Analysts expect 21% revenue growth this year alongside 28% earnings growth. Additionally, the company pays out a 2.17% dividend yield. Again, that\u2019s not monstrous, but TXN\u2019s growth profile suggests it should be investing in future opportunities, too (vs. just paying out a higher yield).\u00a0\nTypically, when investors look for semiconductor stocks, they want the sexiest picks \u2014 they want the Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) of the world. However, many investors tend to find double-digit earnings and revenue growth pretty attractive as well. To that end, \u201c[t]he most owned semiconductor stocks by U.S. long-only and hedge-fund active fund managers\u201d were NVDA stock and TXN stock as of May.\nMany know Texas Instruments as the calculator maker, but it goes much further than that. This company is one of the 10 largest semiconductor companies in the world. And it services multiple industries and sectors, including automotive, computers, industrials, communications, satellites and more.\u00a0\n\nDividend Stocks with Earnings Growth: 3M (MMM)\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\nLike P&G, 3M is a dividend champion. This pick of the dividend stocks hasn\u2019t just paid its dividend for more than six decades, but has actually raised the payout for 63 consecutive years. That\u2019s incredibly impressive when you think about the economic problems that have cropped up over the years. Given these economic swoons, management\u2019s commitment to the dividend has to be admired. In fact, \u201c3M has paid dividends to its shareholders without interruption for more than 100 years.\u201d\nNow, even after a pandemic-disrupted year, 3M is expected to grow its earnings by almost 10%. If achieved, MMM stock will trade at less than 20 times earnings, which isn\u2019t bad for a dependable 3.04% dividend yield.\nPlus, with a \u201creturn to normal\u201d underway in the United States, the company should also enjoy steady demand throughout 2021. The hope is that Europe, Asia and the rest of the world will also experience a return later this year and into 2022, paving the way for industrial companies like this one.\u00a0\nIf that\u2019s the case, we could be looking at multiple years of growth for 3M and its peers. While some industrials were doing quite well prior to Covid-19, 3M was admittedly struggling a bit \u2014 or, at least its stock price was. Hopefully that changes going forward.\n\n\n \nRealty Income (O)\n \nSource: Shutterstock\n \nRealty Income has been one of investors\u2019 favorite real estates investment trusts (REITs). Known as \u201cThe Monthly Dividend company,\u201d\u00a0this name has been incredibly dependable when it comes to its payout ever since it came public in 1994.\u00a0\nIn fact, despite the Great Recession and the novel coronavirus in 2020, Realty Income has continued to be a beacon of stability for investors \u2014 even if the O stock price has swooned. From peak to trough, Realty suffered an over 50% dip in 2020, and also suffered a similar drop during the previous bear market of the financial crisis. Clearly, these periods were not kind to The Monthly Dividend company, even though patient investors have been rewarded.\u00a0\nWhile shares are just below the 52-week high, changing hands at about $68, Realty Income still yields 4.15%. Historically, that\u2019s a pretty good payout for this company. However, the estimates are even better. Currently, analysts expect about 30% earnings growth this year and roughly 11% growth in 2022.\nWith more clarity on the economy coming by the week, perhaps estimates for next year will inch higher over time. Either way, this one of the dividend stocks is one we can count on.\u00a0\n\nDividend Stocks with Earnings Growth: Pepsico (PEP)\u00a0\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\nLast on this list of dividend stocks, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Pepsico when talking about companies that combine solid growth and a nice dividend. On top of this feature, though, Pepsico has also had excellent management over the years, accumulating great brands that resonate with consumers.\u00a0\nToday, PEP stock pays out a 2.94% dividend yield, which is a bit higher than most of the other names on this list. Further, analysts expect the company to grow its earnings just over 10% this year and about 8% next year. Of course, the latter estimate could be conservative, though.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, this company continues to churn out solid sales growth as it continues to offer excellent products. That goes far beyond the Pepsi soda brand as well as beyond PEP\u2019s other soda offerings like Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist. In addition to these products, Pepsico owns other important beverage brands like Aquafina, Lipton and Gatorade as well as snack brands like\u00a0Doritos, Lay\u2019s and more.\u00a0\nNow, there\u2019s a push toward healthy and Pepsico is trying to ride that wave, too. However, good old-fashioned snacking isn\u2019t going anywhere either.\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NVDA and AMD.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorJun 02, 2021, 08:59am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0launched its RTX 3080 Ti as well as the RTX 3070 Ti yesterday, but it's the former that has seen it's performance embargo lift today, allowing us to offer full reviews of the card and reveal just how fast it is in games.\n\n\nYou can also see my RTX 3070 Ti review:\nForbesNvidia RTX 3070 Ti Vs RTX 3070 And RX 6800: Which Should You Buy?By Antony LeatherNvidia's RTX 3080 TiAntony Leather\n\nAlso in question is where this new RTX 3000-series sits in the overall scheme of things. Is it an RTX 3080 replacement? Does it outperform the RTX 3090 and AMD RX 6900 XT? Let's find out.\n\n\nTo start with, the specifications and price point at the RTX 3080 Ti sitting much closer to the RTX 3090. Only the memory amount stands as a significant trump card with the RTX 3090, with more modest advantages in boost frequency, CUDA cores, Tensor cores and RT cores for example. The price, too, is also close, with just $300 separating them, so even if the RTX 3080 Ti offers similar performance, any RTX 3090 owners out there can probably breath a sigh of relief. Had the RTX 3080 Ti landed with an MSRP of $900, that would have been a different story.\n\nNvidia's RTX 3080 TiAntony Leather \n\n\nThe RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3080 Founders Edition cards, which I'm reviewing, are physically identical in terms of the design and size of the familiar cooler, although with an extra 30W of board power to contend with - the same as the RTX 3090 - the RTX 3080 Ti may well need to spin up its fans more regularly to deal with the heat compared to the RTX 3080.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nTest system and benchmarksMy test systemAntony Leather\nI've used the latest drivers from Nvidia and AMD as well as a fully up-to-date version of Windows 10 as of 31st May 2021. As we're dealing with high-end cards in this review, my tests focus on 2,560 x 1,440 and 4K resolutions. I've tested games with DLSS and ray tracing enabled, but also disabled on occasions - I'm very much in favor of using these features where they're available, but can appreciate not all will want to. As we're dealing with ultra high-end cards here, I've only included the RX 6900 XT to save time, but will be including the RX 6800 XT in my RTX 3070 Ti review.\nMy hardware includes a water-cooled BarrowCH Rhopilema water-cooled test bench, 16GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3,466MHz memory, Intel Core i9-11900K, an Intel 760p M.2 SSD, Corsair RM850i PSU and MSI MEG Z590 Ace motherboard. I've carried out all tests with resizable BAR/Smart Access Memory support enabled.\nBenchmarks\nBelow we start with Watch Dogs: Legion and with Ray Tracing enabled but DLSS disabled, the RTX 3080 Ti came within spitting distance of the RTX 3090 and sits almost exactly where you'd expect it to in terms of price compared to the RTX 3080, with a sizable lead over it.\nDialling up to 4K and the RTX 3080 Ti slipped back from the RTX 3090, but again held a commanding lead over the RTX 3080, while the RX 6900 XT really doesn't seem to like this game with ray tracing enabled.\nWith DLSS enabled, the Nvidia cards unsurprisingly shoot ahead and once again the RTX 3080 Ti is level pegging with the RTX 3090 and offering a decent gain over the RTX 3080.\nDirt 5 below now features ray tracing support and here the RX 6900 XT performs much better, sitting between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti. Again, though, the RTX 3090 still has the edge, while the RTX 3080 is significantly slower at 1440p.\nSwitching up to 4K and and the RTX 3080 Ti falls back from the RTX 3090, but maintains its lead over the RTX 3080 with a minimum 99th percentile of 70fps over 60fps.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator is a tough game to play and here I've used an external view at low altitude taking off from a major UK airport - usually where I see the lowest frame rates. At 1440p, the RX 6900 XT was king with a minimum 99th percentile of 38fps followed closely by the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 and the RTX 3080 in a distant fourth.\nDialling up to 4K and the RTX 3090 is the card to have with the RX 6900 XT falling away to sit next to the RTX 3080. The RTX 3080 Ti offered a higher average frame rate than the RTX 3080 here.\nWolfenstein is a very easy game to play, but plenty of load put on the GPU. Here, the RTX 3080 Ti matched the RTX 3090. While the other cards were a lot slower, at these frame rates it could be down to the CPU being the bottleneck - that's certainly what the results at 4K seem to suggest below - but things don't get much faster than the Core i9-11900K so there's not much you can do about that.\nPutting more load on the GPU sees the two separate and the RTX 3090 leap ahead and once again the RTX 3080 Ti is performing roughly how you'd expect. The RX 6900 XT, meanwhile, is a long way from matching the RTX 3080 Ti, even with DLSS and ray tracing disabled\nAdding DLSS and ray tracing into the equation means dropping the RX 6900 XT from the graphs as it doesn't support ray tracing in this title. Once again the RTX 3080 Ti is sitting where it should, closer to the RTX 3090 than RTX 3080.\nThe new enhanced edition of Metro Exodus below means I can justify using this excellent benchmark again and at 4K with DLSS disabled, the RTX 3080 Ti all but matched the RTX 3090 while offering a sizeable lead over the RTX 3080 and RX 6900 XT.\nAdding DLSS into the mix saw the RTX 3090 edge out a small lead while the RTX 3080 Ti had less of a lead over the RTX 3080, with the RX 6900 XT showing why AMD needs to get its DLSS equivalent - FidelityFX out the door.\nAt 4K the difference between AMD and Nvidia was even more stark with DLSS enabled while the RTX 3080 Ti actually bettered the RTX 3090's average frame rate and again managing a decent lead over the RTX 3080.\nIf there's one area AMD has a commanding lead, it's power consumption with the RX 6900 XT certainly far more appealing than the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 Ti, both of which saw the system draw well over 500W. The RTX 3080 Ti also drew noticeably more power than the RTX 3080, confirming my thoughts that this could be a hotter/noisier card in some situations. It did seem to be a little louder in games, but the peak core temperature was only one degree higher in my power consumption stress test.\nConclusions\nThe elephant in the room is availability and pricing. None of the above matters if you can't buy the hardware or it's retailing for double the MSRP. The RTX 3080 Ti should be far less attractive to miners - I measured a hashrate of around 60MH/sec mining Ethereum, and that makes it the least attractive RTX 3000-series card by far to miners in terms of power efficiency. However, it's not just mining that's causing the crazy price and supply situation, but the microchip shortage too.Nvidia's RTX 3080 TiAntony Leather\nTime will tell, but ultimately we're not looking at an RTX 3080 replacement here anyway. It's too expensive for that and as Nvidia is ushering in hashrate-limited versions of the RTX 3080, it's not a card that's specifically aiming at being less attractive to miners either. That said, as the RTX 3090 is seemingly not going to be receiving the same light hashrate treatment as cheaper cards, the RTX 3080 Ti might be a more readily available card as a result, at least as far as the impact of the RTX 3090 being snapped up by miners goes.\nGaming performance is why we're here, though, and overall the RTX 3080 Ti sits exactly where it should - close to the RTX 3090, but usually offering a sizeable lead over the RTX 3080. Is it a 3090 killer for half the price? No. Nvidia hasn't really pulled the rug from under RTX 3090 owners here at all. It's simply filling the void between the RTX 3090 and 3080 both in terms of price and performance, without toppling the RTX 3090, which is still the ultimate gaming card, especially at 4K.\nEven without ray tracing and DLSS enabled, though, it's still a very powerful GPU, but that big elephant is still sitting there in the room. Just whether it will be available and anywhere near its MSRP is an entirely different matter and for that reason, drawing firmer conclusions, even against the RX 6900 XT, which it beat convincingly in many tests, is rather difficult. The RTX 3070 Ti, might appeal more since it's far cheaper, but Nvidia now has two monstrously powerful $1,000+ graphics cards.

As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -2.92%) has dipped below $30,000, erasing its gains for the year. Bitcoin is now down more than 50% from its all-time high.\nOther cryptocurrencies are doing even worse. Ethereum (ETH -2.74%) is down nearly 60% from its high, and joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE -5.78%) has crashed 75%.\nGraphics chip developer NVIDIA (NVDA -3.24%) has been one beneficiary of the crypto bubble. The company's graphics cards are useful for mining certain cryptocurrencies. This fact has boosted demand for graphics cards, contributing to shortages and high prices.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNVIDIA sells some models specifically aimed at cryptocurrency miners, but miners are also buying plenty of standard graphics cards through the same channels used by PC gamers. This makes it difficult to tell how much of NVIDIA's gaming revenue is a side-effect of the cryptocurrency bubble. NVIDIA's gaming revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $2.76 billion in its latest quarter.\nWhat happens if crypto prices continue to crash? It wasn't pretty for NVIDIA last time around.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom shortage to supply glut\nThe price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soared throughout 2017 and early 2018. Miners snapped up graphics cards, leading to shortages and high prices. Sound familiar?\nNVIDIA's quarterly gaming revenue held steady at around $1.8 billion through the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which ended in October of 2018. Then it fell off a cliff as interest in cryptocurrency waned. Gaming revenue crashed below $1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of that year.\n\nChart by author. Data source: NVIDIA.\n\nThe crypto crash of 2018 led to bloated channel inventories of graphics cards, which reduced NVIDIA's sales dramatically. Gaming revenue was depressed for about three quarters before bouncing back.\n\"Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line,\" NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress said during the Q4 2019 earnings call.\n\n\n\n\n\nKress continued: \"...with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be.\"\nWhat's happening now is a turbocharged version of what happened in 2018. The total value of the cryptocurrency market at the peak this time around was far higher than in 2018, topping $2 trillion in April.\nActual shipments of graphics cards were up 24.4% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, according to Jon Peddie Research. The total value of those cards soared 370% thanks to inflated prices. Some of this demand has undoubtedly been driven by the pandemic, but a big chunk is tied to the fortunes of the cryptocurrency market.\nJust like NVIDIA's gaming revenue, NVIDIA stock was hit hard by the last crypto crash. Shares tanked in the final three months of 2018 as the extent of NVIDIA's dependence on crypto miners demand became clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nNVIDIA stock has once again surged amid a cryptocurrency boom and shortages of graphics cards. The company is now worth about $460 billion, about triple its peak value during the last cryptocurrency bubble. NVIDIA has made strides outside of gaming since then, particularly in the data center. But a big drop in revenue is possible, and perhaps likely, if crypto prices keep tumbling.\n\n\n\nTimothy Green has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The cluster uses 720 nodes of 8x NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs (5,760 GPUs total) to achieve an industry-leading 1.8 exaflops of performance.\n\u201cThis is a really incredible supercomputer,\u201d Karpathy said. \u201cI actually believe that in terms of flops, this is roughly the No. 5 supercomputer in the world.\u201d\nWith unprecedented levels of compute for the automotive industry at the center of its development cycle, Tesla is making it possible for autonomous vehicle engineers to do their life\u2019s work efficiently and at the cutting edge.\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs deliver acceleration at every scale to power the world\u2019s highest-performing data centers. Powered by the NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, the A100 GPU provides up to 20x higher performance over the prior generation and can be partitioned into seven GPU instances to dynamically adjust to shifting demands.\n\nThe GPU cluster is part of Tesla\u2019s vertically integrated autonomous driving approach, which uses more than 1 million cars already driving on the road to refine and build new features for continuous improvement.\nFrom the Car to the Data Center\nTesla\u2019s cyclical development begins in the car. A deep neural network running in \u201cshadow mode\u201d quietly perceives and makes predictions while the car is driving without actually controlling the vehicle.\nThese predictions are recorded, and any mistakes or misidentifications are logged. Tesla engineers then use these instances to create a training dataset of difficult and diverse scenarios to refine the DNN.\nThe result is a collection of roughly 1 million 10-second clips recorded at 36 frames per second, totaling a whopping 1.5 petabytes of data. The DNN is then run through these scenarios in the data center over and over until it operates without a mistake. Finally, it\u2019s sent back to the vehicle and begins the process again.\nKarpathy said training a DNN in this manner and on such a large amount of data requires \u201ca huge amount of compute,\u201d which led Tesla to build and deploy the current generation supercomputer with high-performance A100 GPUs.\n\nContinuous Iteration\nIn addition to comprehensive training, Tesla\u2019s supercomputer gives autonomous vehicle engineers the performance needed to experiment and iterate in the development process.\nKarpathy said the current DNN structure the automaker is deploying allows a team of 20 engineers to work on a single network at once, isolating different features for parallel development.\nThese DNNs can then be run through training datasets at speeds faster than what has been previously possible for rapid iteration.\n\u201cComputer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and enables Autopilot. For that to work, you need to train a massive neural network and experiment a lot,\u201d Karpathy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested a lot into the compute.\u201d\nWatch the full CVPR session.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DGX | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Even the smallest reductions in latency dramatically impact performance. Powerful GPUs, high refresh displays, and tuned game settings can help players elevate their game to all-new levels.\nTo further improve performance, there\u2019s now NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Mode, a free update for many popular competitive games that reduces system latency. Acquire targets faster, react quicker, and increase aim precision simply by enabling NVIDIA Reflex in a game\u2019s settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex: Available Now In Escape From Tarkov\nBattlestate Games\u2019 Escape From Tarkov is an extremely popular, hardcore first-person tactical action game, with RPG, simulation and MMO elements. During Raids, players risk it all, potentially losing hard-fought-for gear to other players, and significant progress if they fail to insure their possessions before challenging others online. With death lurking around every corner, and stakes being so high, reducing system latency is key.\nFollowing the launch of a new update today, players with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU will get a free upgrade to their system latency with NVIDIA Reflex. The difference between success and failure, life and death, is mere milliseconds, and with NVIDIA Reflex players get a significant boost to their competitiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019re happy to bring NVIDIA Reflex to Escape from Tarkov to ensure the lowest possible system latency and the most precise, responsive gameplay. NVIDIA Reflex provides players up to a 38% reduction in system latency\" - Battlestate Games Team\nWith the update to Escape from Tarkov and upcoming support in CrossFire HD, NVIDIA Reflex latency-reducing technology will be supported in 12 of the top 15 competitive shooter-based games.\nTo activate NVIDIA Reflex in Escape From Tarkov, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver and game update. Head to the options menu in-game, select Graphics, and enable NVIDIA Reflex. Instantly, system latency will be reduced by up to 38%, greatly improving responsiveness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape From Tarkov also includes the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Flash Indicator, so if you\u2019re sporting a Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible monitor and have GeForce Experience installed, enable the flash indicator in-game and position your monitoring rectangle over the indicator location to get accurate system latency results every time.\nAnd if you wish to reduce system latency further still, there are a number of system tweaks, game tweaks and hardware upgrades that you can make, detailed in full in our System Latency Optimization Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Tuned For More Reflex and GeForce Updates\nTo be the first to learn about the latest NVIDIA Reflex games, bookmark GeForce.com and follow our social media accounts on your platform of choice. Also, be sure to check out our extensive NVIDIA Reflex and system latency primer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But a raft of startups say new architecture is needed for the fast-evolving AI fieldSave this storySaveSave this storySaveTHERE\u2019S AN APOCRYPHAL story about how NVIDIA pivoted from games and graphics hardware to dominate AI chips \u2013 and it involves cats. Back in 2010, Bill Dally, now chief scientist at NVIDIA, was having breakfast with a former colleague from Stanford University, the computer scientist Andrew Ng, who was working on a project with Google. \u201cHe was trying to find cats on the internet \u2013 he didn\u2019t put it that way, but that\u2019s what he was doing,\u201d Dally says.Ng was working at the Google X lab on a project to build a neural network that could learn on its own. The neural network was shown ten million YouTube videos and learned how to pick out human faces, bodies and cats \u2013 but to do so accurately, the system required thousands of CPUs (central processing units), the workhorse processors that power computers. \u201cI said, \u2018I bet we could do it with just a few GPUs,\u2019\u201d Dally says. GPUs (graphics processing units) are specialised for more intense workloads such as 3D rendering \u2013 and that makes them better than CPUs at powering AI.Dally turned to Bryan Catanzaro, who now leads deep learning research at NVIDIA, to make it happen. And he did \u2013 with just 12 GPUs \u2013 proving that the parallel processing offered by GPUs was faster and more efficient at training Ng\u2019s cat-recognition model than CPUs.But Catanzaro wants it known that NVIDIA didn\u2019t begin its efforts with AI just because of that chance breakfast. Indeed, he had been developing GPUs for AI while still a grad student at Berkeley, before joining NVIDIA in 2008. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s position in this market is not an accident,\u201d he says.The when and how of it all seems unimportant now that NVIDIA dominates AI chips. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA\u2019s major revenue stream is still graphics and gaming, but for the last financial year its sales of GPUs for use in data centres climbed to $6.7 billion. In 2019, NVIDIA GPUs were deployed in 97.4 per cent of AI accelerator instances \u2013 hardware used to boost processing speeds \u2013 at the top four cloud providers: AWS, Google, Alibaba and Azure. It commands \u201cnearly 100 per cent\u201d of the market for training AI algorithms, says Karl Freund, analyst at Cambrian AI Research. Nearly 70 per cent of the top 500 supercomputers use its GPUs. Virtually all AI milestones have happened on NVIDIA hardware. Ng\u2019s YouTube cat finder, DeepMind\u2019s board game champion AlphaGo, OpenAI\u2019s language prediction model GPT-3 all run on NVIDIA hardware. It\u2019s the ground AI researchers stand upon.Despite this success, Catanzaro is annoyed by the persistent suggestion that NVIDIA stumbled blindly into AI from gaming. \u201cI swear, pretty much every story that I read, the narrative is that GPUs randomly happen to be excellent at AI, and NVIDIA lucked into a temporary windfall by selling existing chips to a new market, and soon they\u2019re going to be displaced by startups,\u201d Catanzaro says. \u201cBut NVIDIA has been very strategic about how it approaches the AI market for a decade now.\u201dA decade in, that market is ripe for disruption. AI is beginning to be used by more and more businesses to make sense of the oceans of data they collect, while governments pump money into deep learning research to keep ahead of one another. The race between the US and China is particularly hot; Deloitte analyst Costi Perricos says AI will become the \u201cnext kind of superpower\u201d for nations to compete over. At the same time, deep learning models are increasing in size and complexity, requiring ever more computing power.OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, a deep learning system that can write paragraphs of sensible text, is the extreme example, made up of 175 billion parameters, the variables that make up models. It cost an estimated $4.6 million to compute, and that\u2019s since been topped by a Google language model with 1.6 trillion parameters. More efficient hardware is necessary to chew through more parameters and more data for increased accuracy, but also to keep AI from becoming even more of an environmental disaster \u2013 Danish researchers calculated that the energy required to train GPT-3 could have the carbon footprint of driving 700,000km.We need more AI chips and we need better AI chips. While NVIDIA\u2019s early work has given the GPU maker a head start, challengers are racing to catch up. Google started making its own chips in 2015; Amazon last year began shifting Alexa\u2019s brains to its own Inferentia chips, after buying Annapurna Labs in 2016; Baidu has Kunlun, recently valued at $2 billion; Qualcomm has its Cloud AI 100; and IBM is working on an energy-efficient design. AMD acquired Xilinx for AI data centre work, and Intel added AI acceleration to its Xeon data centre CPUs in 2019; it has also bought two startups, Nervana in 2016 for $408 million and Habana Labs in 2019 for $2 billion. The startups that haven\u2019t yet been snapped up have released their own hardware, with the past few years seeing AI chips released or trialled by the likes of Graphcore, SambaNova, Cerebras, Mythic AI, Blaize and TensTorrent.We are still in the early days of AI. Those cats were only calculated ten years ago; most of these startups are no more than a few years old. With more data set to flow as smart Internet of Things devices begin a machine-to-machine revolution, all have their view set on the same thing: owning the future of AI chips.MACHINE LEARNING IS a computing workload unlike any other, requiring a lot of maths using not very precise figures. Traditional high-performance computing (HPC), where multiple systems are linked together to build supercomputers to process complex workloads such as scientific simulations or financial modelling, requires high-precision maths, using 64-bit numbers if not higher. AI computing also requires massive computing infrastructure, but the maths used is less precise, with numbers that are16-bit or even 8-bit \u2013 it\u2019s akin to the difference between hyper-realistic graphics and pixelated games from the 80s. \u201cThe math is mostly easy, but there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d says Andrew Feldman, CEO of AI chip startup Cerebras.An AI chip is any processor that has been optimised to run machine learning workloads, via programming frameworks such as Google\u2019s TensorFlow and Facebook\u2019s PyTorch. AI chips don\u2019t necessarily do all the work when training or running a deep-learning model, but operate as accelerators by quickly churning through the most intense workloads. For example, NVIDIA\u2019s AI-system-in-a-box, the DGX A100, uses eight of its own A100 \u201cAmpere\u201d GPUs as accelerators, but also features a 128-core AMD CPU.AI isn\u2019t new, but we previously lacked the computing power to make deep learning models possible, leaving researchers waiting on the hardware to catch up to their ideas. \u201cGPUs came in and opened the doors,\u201d says Rodrigo Liang, co-founder and CEO of SambaNova, another startup making AI chips.In 2012, a researcher at the University of Toronto, Alex Krizhevsky, walloped other competitors in the annual ImageNet computer vision challenge, which pits researchers against each other to develop algorithms that can identify images or objects within them. Krizhevsky used deep learning powered by GPUs to beat hand-coded efforts for the first time. By 2015, all the top results at ImageNet contests were using GPUs.Deep learning research exploded. Offering 20x or more performance boosts, NVIDIA\u2019s technology worked so well that when British chip startup Graphcore\u2019s co-founders set up shop, they couldn\u2019t get a meeting with investors. \u201cWhat we heard from VCs was: \u2018what's AI?\u2019\u201d says co-founder and CTO Simon Knowles, recalling a trip to California to seek funding in 2015. \u201cIt was really surprising.\u201d A few months later, at the beginning of 2016, that had all changed. \u201cThen, everyone was hot for AI,\u201d Knowles says. \u201cHowever, they were not hot for chips.\u201d A new chip architecture wasn\u2019t deemed necessary; NVIDIA had the industry covered.What\u2019s in a name?GPU, IPU, RPU \u2013 they\u2019re all used to churn through datasets for deep learning, but the names do reflect differences in architecture.\u00a0GraphcoreGraphcore\u2019s Colossus MK2 IPU is massively parallel with processors operated independently, a technique called multiple instruction, multiple data. Software is written sequentially, but neural network algorithms need to do everything at once. To address this, one solution is to lay out all the data and its constraints, like declaring the structure of the problem, says Graphcore CTO Simon Knowles. It\u2019s a graph \u2013 hence the name of his company.But, in May 2016, Google changed everything, with what Cerebras\u2019 Feldman calls a \u201cswashbuckling strategic decision\u201d, announcing it had developed its own chips for AI applications. These were called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and designed to work with the company\u2019s TensorFlow machine learning programming framework. Knowles says the move sent a signal to investors that perhaps there was a market for new processor designs. \u201cSuddenly all the VCs were like: where are those crazy Brits?\u201d he says. Since then, Graphcore has raised $710 million (\u00a3515 million).NVIDIA\u2019s rivals argue that GPUs were designed for graphics rather than machine learning, and that though their massive processing capabilities mean they work better than CPUs for AI tasks, their market dominance has only lasted this long due to careful optimisation and complex layers of software. \u201cNVIDIA has done a fabulous job hiding the complexity of a GPU,\u201d says Graphcore co-founder and CEO Nigel Toon. \u201cIt works because of the software libraries they\u2019ve created, the frameworks and the optimisations that allow the complexity to be hidden. It\u2019s a really heavy lifting job that NVIDIA has undertaken there.\u201dBut forget GPUs, the argument goes, and you might design an AI chip from scratch that has an entirely new architecture. There are plenty to choose from. Google\u2019s TPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), designed for specific workloads; Cerebras makes a Wafer-Scale Engine, a behemoth chip 56 times larger than any other; IBM and BrainChip make neuromorphic chips, modelled on the human brain; and Mythic and Graphcore both make Intelligence Processing Units (IPU), though their designs differ. There are plenty more.But Catanzaro argues the many chips are simply variations of AI accelerators \u2013 the name given to any hardware that boosts AI. \"We talk about a GPU or TPU or an IPU or whatever, but people get too attached to those letters,\" he says. \u201cWe call our GPU that because of the history of what we\u2019ve done\u2026 but the GPU has always been about accelerated computing, and the nature of the workloads people care about is in flux.\u201dCan anyone compete? NVIDIA dominates the core benchmark, MLPerf, which is the gold standard for deep-learning chips, though benchmarks are tricky beasts. Analyst Karl Freund of Cambrian AI Research notes that MLPerf, a benchmarking tool designed by academics and industry players including Google, is dominated by Google and NVIDIA, but that startups usually don\u2019t bother to complete all of it because the costs of setting up a system are better spent elsewhere.NVIDIA does bother \u2013 and annually bests Google\u2019s TPU. \u201cGoogle invented MLPerf to show how good their TPU was,\u201d says Marc Hamilton, head of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA \u201cJensen [Huang] said it would be really nice if we show Google every time they ran the MLPerf benchmark how our GPUs were just a little bit faster than the TPU.\u201dTo ensure it came out on top for one version of the benchmark, NVIDIA upgraded an in-house supercomputer from 36 DGX boxes to a whopping 96. That required recabling the entire system. To do it quickly enough, they simply cut through the cables \u2013 which Hamilton says was about a million dollars worth of kit \u2013 and had new equipment shipped in. This may serve to highlight the bonkers behaviour driven by benchmarks, but it also inspired a redesign of DGX: the current-generation blocks can now be combined in groups of 20 without any rewiring.When it comes to benchmarks and supercomputers, you can always add more chips. But for the other side of AI computing \u2013 something called inference at the edge \u2013 it\u2019s a different story.NVIDIA GRABBED THE world\u2019s attention in 2020 when it bid $40 billion for ARM, the British chip designer whose architecture powers 95 per cent of the world\u2019s smartphones. But the response wasn\u2019t entirely positive. ARM co-founder Hermann Hauser, who no longer works at the company but still retains shares, has called it a \u201cdisaster\u201d that may destroy ARM\u2019s neutrality in the market. Regulators around the world \u2013 in the EU, UK, China and US \u2013 are closely studying the deal.ARM designs chips, licensing the intellectual property out to companies to use as they see fit. If an AI chip maker needs a CPU for a system, they can license a chip design from ARM and have it made to their specifications. Rivals are concerned that NVIDIA taking control of ARM could limit those partnerships, though Huang has said \u201cunequivocally\u201d that NVIDIA would respect ARM's open model. The UK government is reportedly considering any national security implications, though ARM is currently owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank, and there are concerns in China that ARM being owned by an American company could mean its designs are banned from export to blacklisted Chinese companies under existing restrictions.CerebrasAt Cerebras, CEO Andrew Feldman realised that communications on-chip are fast, but the slowdown happens between them \u2013 so why not just build a really big chip, so your data never has to leave? The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine crams 400,000 cores onto 46.225 square millimetres. \u201cGPUs have the right cores, but the wrong communication architecture,\u201d he says.ARM is a major designer of the chips that will apply deep learning in the real world \u2013 so-called inference at the edge. This means the deal could have a huge impact on the shape of the market; NVIDIA could dominate the data centre side with its GPUs and the edge with help from ARM.What is inference at the edge? NVIDIA\u2019s beefy, high-performance systems churn through data in order to train and apply models, but there\u2019s another AI workload known as inference, which is the more lightweight task of using a trained model to then interpret something \u2013 such as a driverless car understanding what its cameras see, a smartphone app finding the edges of your face to apply cat ears to your selfie, or a medical imaging model spotting signs of cancer in a scan. Because of the huge amounts of computing power required, training is done in a data centre, but inference can be found in two places.The first is also in the data centre: when you ask Alexa or Siri a question, it\u2019s sent back to servers at Amazon and Apple for transcription and a response. The second place inference happens is in end-user devices, such as cameras, cars and smartphones \u2013 this is called edge computing. This requires less processing power, but it needs to be fast (no one wants to wait for their driverless car to think before deciding whether to brake).NVIDIA currently dominates the data centre side. Its A100 churns through data for training, while inference is virtualised into smaller mini-servers, allowing 50 or more inference workloads to happen at the same time on the same hardware. That\u2019s helpful for tech giants like AWS that offer AI as a service, as multiple companies can use the same hardware without risk of data leaking. At the edge, NVIDIA has DRIVE for driverless cars and EGX for on-location inference, but low-power chips aren\u2019t its traditional speciality \u2013 if you\u2019ve ever used a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll have noticed it needs to be plugged in more regularly than a Chromebook. Low-power chips are the domain of ARM, which is why NVIDIA has dropped $40 billion to acquire the company.When it comes to AI, ARM\u2019s efforts centre on two areas. First, it is fitting software frameworks onto its existing CPUs. For more intense workloads, it has developed a neural processing unit (NPU) called Ethos to be used as an accelerator. Rene Haas, president of ARM\u2019s IP Products Group, says that devices using the Ethos-U55 should be arriving soon, as companies that licensed the design already have silicon produced.With AI on the edge, voice assistants would no longer need to upload speech to AWS or Apple servers for processing, but could respond based on local intelligence. \u201cIt allows the work to be done close to the source, which helps in many ways in terms of efficiency,\u201d Haas says, noting that sending data back and forth to the cloud chews through battery power.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about IoT for a long time, but the vision\u2019s never been realised until now,\u201d says David Hogan, vice-president of EMEA at NVIDIA. \u201cIt\u2019s this transformation that\u2019s at the heart of our plans to acquire ARM.\u201dWHILE THE REST of us baked banana bread and binged Netflix, Marc Hamilton, head of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA, spent much of the last year building a \u00a340 million supercomputer, navigating shortages caused by the pandemic to assemble the Cambridge-1 mostly on time. The build was made easier by NVIDIA\u2019s LEGO-style system. Eight A100 chips make up the heart of the computing system it calls DGX \u2013 it\u2019s the same relationship between the Intel or AMD chip running your laptop. Costing $199,000, the DGX is a full AI computer, with memory and networking and everything else, designed to be relatively plug-and-play. Cambridge-1 consists of racks upon racks of gold boxes in premade sets of 20 DGXs, known as a SuperPod.Cambridge-1 will be the largest and most powerful AI supercomputer in the UK, and about 30th in the world, Hamilton says (though that ranking is likely to shift) \u2013 but it will only be the fifth largest in NVIDIA's own collection. Cambridge-1 was built using 80 DGX A100 boxes versus 560 for Selene, its largest.NVIDIA built Cambridge-1 in the UK partially because of the ARM acquisition, as the buyout would mean the company gained employees in the UK. While it\u2019s not the overall fastest nor the biggest, Cambridge-1 claims two firsts. Hamilton calls it the world\u2019s first cloud-native supercomputer, as it features compartmentalisation akin to AWS, letting companies use the same hardware without risk of security breaches or data leaking. And that lets Cambridge-1 have its second first: this is the only supercomputer that NVIDIA will open up to external partners, letting universities and healthcare giants AstraZeneca, Oxford Nanopore and GSK run their own deep learning models.Why does NVIDIA build its own supercomputers? One reason is that it needs toys to attract the best people. Back in 2016, NVIDIA didn\u2019t have a supercomputer, and Facebook and Google were snapping up the best AI researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s not because they pay them more,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cIt\u2019s because Google and Facebook have thousands of GPUs that they use to run their business, and they make those accessible to their AI researchers.\u201dSambaNovaSambaNova Systems\u2019 software-defined approach puts data to the fore, replacing integers such as add and subtract with instructions to filter and reduce. SambaNova calls its design a reconfigurable dataflow, and that\u2019s achieved with 1.5TB of memory per \u201cCardinal\u201d chip, with eight of those in each of its DataScale SN10-8R systems.Now, NVIDIA\u2019s supercomputer Selene is fifth largest in the world, after one in Japan, one in China and two owned by the US government. That means, Hamilton says, that if you\u2019re a researcher who wants access to the fastest AI hardware, you can work for China, the US, or NVIDIA. China aims to be a global leader in AI by 2030, while the US wants to maintain its lead in the technology; there was already tension on the AI front, but the recent trade war between the two countries may turn it into something of an arms race. As a US company, NVIDIA doesn\u2019t completely avoid such issues.Researchers in Catanzaro\u2019s 40-person lab develop AI to be used inside NVIDIA\u2019s own systems, but the lab also acts as a \"terrarium\" for systems architects to peek in and see how deep-learning models may work in the future. \u201cIf you want to build a chip for the future, you want it to be useful for the future, you have to have skill with forecasting what are the most important workloads of the future \u2013 what they look like computationally,\u201d says Catanzaro. \u201cIf you mess it up, you build the wrong chip.\u201d Chips take years to design and build, so such foresight is necessary.What happens if models are developed that no longer work on GPUs, or at least not as well? NVIDIA\u2019s Dally admits it\u2019s a possibility, but with most researchers working on GPUs, he thinks it\u2019s unlikely. \u201cBefore a new model takes off, we have generally heard about it and had a chance to kick its tyres and make sure it runs well on our GPUs,\u201d he says.Others disagree \u2013 and believe GPUs may be holding back deep learning models from their full potential. \u201cEverybody bends their models to today\u2019s technology,\u201d says Cerebras\u2019 Feldman. \u201cOne of the things we are happiest and most excited about are a group of customers who are writing entirely new models.\u201d He says this year Cerebras will show examples of what it calls \u201cGPU impossible work\u201d \u2013 work that simply can\u2019t be done on GPUs.Graphcore\u2019s Toon says researchers have long told him they\u2019re held back by today\u2019s hardware; his partner Knowles compares it to Orwell\u2019s Newspeak, simple language that prevents people thinking more complicated thoughts. \u201cThere are ideas, such as probabilistic machine learning, which is still being held back because today\u2019s hardware like GPUs just doesn\u2019t allow that to go forward,\u201d Toon says. \u201cThe race will be how fast NVIDIA can evolve the GPU, or will it be something new that allows that?\u201dNeil Thompson, a researcher at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, noticed a trend at AI conferences of researchers hinting that computational limits were holding back their models, limiting their choices and datasets, and compelling some to leave mistakes in their work because they couldn\u2019t afford to re-run a model to fix the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s really widespread and it\u2019s a really big problem in terms of the future of deep learning if we\u2019re going to practise it as we have been so far,\u201d he says.Thompson and colleagues analysed 1,058 AI papers, and found that the computing demands of machine learning were far outstripping hardware improvements or model training efficiencies. On this path, systems will one day cost hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to train \u2013 and have other costs. \u201cThe problem with chucking more GPUs at it is every time you double the number of GPUs, you double the cost, you double the environmental footprint, carbon and pollution,\u201d Thompson says.He believes that hardware solutions alone \u2013 be they from NVIDIA or challengers \u2013 won\u2019t be enough to prevent AI innovation from stumbling. Instead, we need to build more efficient models and make better use of what we already have. Ideas such as sparsity \u2013 ignoring the zeros in a data set to save on calculations \u2013 can help, as can being more methodical about data, only putting it against related parameters. Another idea is distilling what we learn from models into more lightweight equations, running only a relevant section of a model rather than a massive universal one.Without such efforts, we\u2019ll need bigger data centres. But AI shouldn\u2019t be limited just to those who can afford a supercomputer. \u201cUniversities with less computer power are already becoming a smaller proportion\u201d of those doing top-end deep-learning work, says Thompson. \u201cThere\u2019s still quite a few people who can play in the game, but the number of players is getting smaller as the computation burden goes up. And we\u2019ve already gotten to the point where some people have been excluded.\u201dCosts can be cut, which may be one way for startups to win customers against incumbents. AWS added chips from Habana Labs to its cloud last year, saying the Intel-owned Israeli designer was 40 per cent cheaper to run. \u201cFor AI to reach everyone and not just the rich, you really need to improve price performance,\u201d says Eitan Medina, chief business officer at Habana Labs.AI already has a bias problem, and that is exacerbated by unequal access to hardware. \u201cIt means we\u2019ll only be looking at one side of the coin,\u201d says Kate Kallot, head of emerging areas at NVIDIA. \u201cIf you leave out a large chunk of the population of the world\u2026 how are we going to be able to solve challenges everywhere in the world?\u201d She points to the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals: plenty of AI researchers are turning their work to address challenges such as poverty and the climate crisis, but these are issues that will largely impact emerging markets.There are other challenges to add to the mix. Manufacturing of processors has been constrained during the pandemic, while last year\u2019s trade skirmish between the US and China raised concerns that the world\u2019s chip factories are predominately in Asia, with the EU recently pledging to produce a fifth of the world\u2019s top-end chips by 2030. Chip designers largely outsource manufacturing \u2013 NVIDIA\u2019s are made by Taiwan\u2019s TSMC \u2013 though Intel has its own foundries. In March, Intel announced plans to open two new factories in the US to make chips for external designers for the first time, perhaps giving the US more control over manufacturing.As these hurdles are overcome, and chips continue to evolve, AI will expand to touch everything, akin to the wave of connectivity that saw wi-fi support and apps added to objects from toasters to fridges. But in the future, smart won\u2019t just mean internet-connected, but embedded with AI. \u201cIt will be everywhere,\u201d ARM\u2019s Haas says. \u201cIt will be ubiquitous in every single computing application in the next few years.\u201dThis article was originally published by WIRED UKNicole Kobie is a WIRED contributing editor. ...

Dell, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo, Nettrix and Supermicro joined NVIDIA to demonstrate industry-leading results training neural networks with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nOnly NVIDIA and its partners ran all eight workloads in the latest round of benchmarks. Together, our work made up more than three-quarters of all submissions, and the results were stunning.\nCompared to last year\u2019s scores, we delivered up to 3.5x more performance. For massive jobs that demand the most muscle, we mustered resources from a record 4,096 GPUs, more than any other submission.\nWhy MLPerf Matters\nThis is the fourth and strongest showing for the NVIDIA ecosystem in training tests from MLPerf, an industry benchmarking group formed in May 2018.\nMLPerf gives users the confidence to make informed buying decisions. It\u2019s backed by dozens of industry leaders including Alibaba, Arm, Baidu, Google, Intel and NVIDIA, so the tests are transparent and objective.\nThe benchmarks are based on today\u2019s most popular AI workloads and scenarios, covering computer vision, natural-language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and more. And the training benchmarks focus on what users care about most \u2014 time to train a new AI model.\nSpeed + Flexibility = Productivity\nUltimately, the return on a customer\u2019s infrastructure investment depends on their productivity. That comes from an ability to be both fast and flexible when running these many kinds of AI workloads.\nThat\u2019s why users need flexible, yet powerful systems that can get a variety of AI models into production fast, speeding time to market and maximizing the productivity of their valuable data science teams.\nIn the latest MLPerf results, the NVIDIA AI platform set performance records by training models in the shortest time across all eight benchmarks in the commercially available submissions category.\nSelene, based on an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, set all eight records on commercially available systems.\nWe ran the at-scale tests on Selene, the fastest commercial AI supercomputer in the world, according to the latest TOP500 rankings. It\u2019s based on the same NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD architecture that powers a dozen other systems on the list.\nThe ability to scale to large clusters is the toughest challenge in AI and one of our core strengths.\nIn chip-to-chip comparisons, NVIDIA and its partners set records across all eight benchmarks in the latest tests on commercially available systems.\nA100 GPUs set all eight records in the category of commercially available systems.\nOverall, the results below show our performance rose up to 6.5x in 2.5 years, a testament to work across the full-stack NVIDIA platform of GPUs, systems and software.\nNVIDIA AI delivered continuous gains with full-stack improvements.\nBroad Ecosystem Offers Best Value, Choice\nThe MLPerf results demonstrate performance across a variety of NVIDIA-based AI platforms with plenty of new and innovative systems. They span entry-level edge servers to AI supercomputers that accommodate thousands of GPUs.\nThe seven partners participating in the latest benchmarks are among nearly two dozen cloud-service providers and OEMs with products or plans for online instances, servers and PCIe cards using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, including nearly 40 NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\nOur ecosystem offers customers choices in a wide range of deployment models \u2014 from instances that are rentable by the minute to on-prem servers and managed services \u2014 providing the most value per dollar in the industry.\nResults across all the MLPerf tests show our performance keeps rising over time. That comes from a platform with software that\u2019s mature and constantly improving, so teams can get started fast with systems that keep getting better.\nHow We Did It\nIt\u2019s the second round of MLPerf tests for our A100 GPUs. Speedups came from advances detailed in a separate article that spanned GPUs, systems, networking and AI software.\nFor example, our engineers found a way to launch full neural network models using CUDA Graphs, a software package of NVIDIA CUDA operations and their dependencies. That eliminated CPU bottlenecks in past tests that released AI models as a chain of many individual components, called kernels.\nIn addition, tests at scale used NVIDIA SHARP, software that consolidates multiple communications jobs inside a network switch, reducing network traffic and time waiting for a CPU.\nThe combination of the CUDA Graphs and SHARP allowed training jobs in the data center to access a record number of GPUs. It\u2019s the muscle needed in many areas such as natural-language processing, where AI models are growing to include billions of parameters.\nOther gains came from expanded memory on the latest A100 GPUs that increase memory bandwidth nearly 30 percent to more than 2 TB/s.\nCustomers Care About MLPerf\nA wide variety of AI users find these benchmarks useful.\n\u201cThe MLPerf benchmark provides a transparent apples-to-apples comparison across multiple AI platforms to showcase actual performance in diverse real-world use cases,\u201d said a spokesman for Sweden\u2019s Chalmers University, which conducts research across areas from nanotechnology to climate studies.\nThe benchmarks help users find the AI products that meet the requirements of some of the world\u2019s largest and most advanced factories. For example, TSMC, a global leader in chip manufacturing, uses machine learning to improve optical proximity correction (OPC) and etch simulation.\n\u201cTo fully realize the potential of machine learning in model training and inference, we\u2019re working with the NVIDIA engineering team to port our Maxwell simulation and inverse lithography technology engine to GPUs and see very significant speedups. The MLPerf benchmark is an important factor in our decision making,\u201d said Danping Peng, director of TSMC\u2019s OPC department.\nTraction in Medicine, Manufacturing\nThe benchmarks also are useful for researchers pushing the limits of AI to improve healthcare.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with NVIDIA to bring innovations like 3DUNet to the healthcare market. Industry-standard MLPerf benchmarks provide relevant performance data to the benefit of IT organizations and developers to get the right solution to accelerate their specific projects and applications,\u201d said Klaus Maier-Hein, head of medical image computing at DKFZ, the German cancer research center.\nA world leader in research and manufacturing, Samsung also uses MLPerf benchmarks as it implements AI to boost product performance and manufacturing productivity.\n\u201cProductizing these AI advances requires us to have the best computing platform available. The MLPerf benchmark streamlines our selection process by providing us with an open, direct evaluation method to assess uniformly across platform vendors,\u201d said a spokesperson for Samsung Electronics.\nGet These Same Results, Tools\nAll the software we used for the latest submissions is available from the MLPerf repository, so anyone can reproduce our benchmark results. We continually add this code into our deep learning frameworks and containers available on NGC, our software hub for GPU applications.\nIt\u2019s part of a full-stack AI platform, proven in the latest industry benchmarks, and available from a variety of partners to tackle real AI jobs today.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

People worldwide produce 2 billion tons of waste a year, with 37 percent going to landfill, according to the World Bank.\n\u201cSorting by hand on conveyor belts is dirty and dangerous, and the whole place smells like rotting food. People in the recycling industry told me that robots were absolutely needed,\u201d said Horowitz, the company\u2019s CEO.\nHis startup, which has 130 employees, can double sorting output and increase purity for bales of materials. It can also sort municipal waste, electronic waste, and construction and demolition materials.\nNeuron\u2019s Heaping Dataset\u00a0\nAMP has collected one of the world\u2019s largest labeled datasets of images for recyclables with its Neuron AI platform.\n\u201cIt\u2019s well into the millions now,\u201d said Horowitz.\nThat\u2019s used in training its image recognition models, run on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs. Training with such a massive dataset from packaging types from all over the world, different lighting conditions and many unique recycling businesses has provided AMP as much as 99 percent accuracy on inference.\nA National Science Foundation grant in 2015 helped Horowitz hatch a small team to jump on the problem early.\nAMP, based outside Boulder, Colo., has scooped up business with more than 40 recyclers. Along the way, the company has attracted $75 million in funding as it\u2019s become the rising star of AI for recycling. It recently landed on the Forbes AI 50, a list of the top AI companies to watch.\nThe company is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a virtual accelerator program that helps startups in AI and data science get to market faster. Direct connections to NVIDIA and training credits provided from the Inception program helped accelerate experimentation and innovation for AMP, said Horowitz.\nDirty Recyclables Ban\nRecyclers can\u2019t keep up with sorting. Tighter restrictions against contamination in recycled materials sent to China have made combing through it more work, creating more landfill. Worse yet for recyclers, these new added sorting costs come amid a tight labor market.\nU.S. exports of plastic scraps to China have slid nearly 90 percent, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. Recycling processors worldwide are struggling to better sort trash to produce cleaner recyclables and stay in business.\nThe problem now for U.S. recyclers is that the costs of sorting domestically \u2014 if labor is even available \u2014 are close to the value of the materials on the commodities markets, said Horowitz.\n\nGPU-Driven Recyclers\u00a0\nAMP has changed the economics for recyclers. Its image classification models are deployed on NVIDIA GPUs to enable robot arms with suction cups to zip about conveyor belts, picking out trash to help.\nThe computer vision system for the robot arms can recognize an ever-expanding number of items. It can swiftly sort everything from Starbucks cups, PET plastic bottles and clamshell containers, to office paper, aluminum cans, hazards and many more items. The system identifies dozens of categories simultaneously.\nThe company\u2019s millions of labeled images drive its highly accurate image classification models, capable of identifying thousands of recyclables in milliseconds, so its robotic arms can sweep into action. AMP Robotics relies on NVIDIA GeForce RTX or V100 GPUs, depending on the recycling center, to run this split-second inference.\nAMP uses the end-to-end NVIDIA workflow to train its Neuron AI platform. The system can train on over a billion types of garbage and recyclables and run on the network in real time. NVIDIA TensorRT enables a doubling in speed-up on inference and a 50 percent reduction in latency.\nBecause AMP keeps a fixed amount of computing resources for latency and inference, anything the company can do to accelerate existing networks allows the company to reinvest that into larger networks that unlock more performance.\nThe startup now has more than 120 recycling robots deployed worldwide. Its customers span the U.S., Spain, Japan, Canada and other countries that are soon to launch.\nAccelerated Business Prospects\nAnother capability AMP Robotics provides is data collection and analytics. This way recyclers can keep track in real time of how much revenue-generating materials are being collected and how much is being sent to landfill. Previously this was nearly impossible to track, Horowitz said.\nAMP Robotics NVIDIA GPU-driven systems enable customers to bring costs down as well as sort plastics into different categories to achieve better returns. For instance, it can sort out HDPE color plastics, which is more valuable, from other plastics.\nAlso, the neural network can learn new materials over time, offering a wider range of sorting capabilities and new opportunities for revenue.\n\u201cYou can separate out by color, brand or form factor, and when you start to do this, you can make the material worth a lot more,\u201d he said.\nLearn more about AMP Robotics from its GTC 2021 presentation.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Delaunay is responsible for the Isaac robotics initiative and leads a team to bring Isaac to market for roboticists and developers worldwide.\nMeanwhile, the U.K. continues to invest heavily in AI and innovation, with a new AI strategy expected this year. The government\u2019s current industry strategy, promulgated in 2017, includes a package of up support worth as much as \u00a30.95 billion ($1.3 billion) for the AI sector.\nMore recently, the Advanced Research and Invention Agency said it will allocate up to \u00a350 million ($70 million) through 2022 for high-risk, high-reward research.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Natural language processing, recommendation systems, healthcare research, drug discovery and energy, among other areas, have all seen tremendous progress enabled by accelerated computing.\nMuch of that progress has come from applications operating at massive scale. To accelerate this trend, applications need to run on architecture that is flexible, accessible and can both scale up and scale out.\nThe ND A100 v4 VM brings together eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in a single VM with the NVIDIA HDR InfiniBand that enables 200Gb/s data bandwidth per GPU. That\u2019s a massive 1.6 Tb/s of interconnect bandwidth per VM.\nAnd, for the most demanding AI and HPC workloads, these can be further scaled out to thousands of NVIDIA A100 GPUs under the same low-latency InfiniBand fabric, delivering both the compute and networking capabilities for multi-node distributed computing.\nReady for Developers\nDevelopers have multiple options to get the most performance out of the NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the ND A100 v4 VM for their applications, both for application development and managing infrastructure once those applications are deployed.\nTo simplify and speed up development, the NVIDIA NGC catalog offers ready-to-use GPU-optimized application frameworks, containers, pre-trained models, libraries, SDKs and Helm charts. With the prebuilt NVIDIA GPU-optimized Image for AI and HPC on the Azure Marketplace, developers can get started with GPU-accelerated software from the NGC catalog with just a few clicks.\nThe ND A100 v4 VMs are also supported in the Azure Machine Learning service for\u00a0 interactive AI development, distributed training, batch inferencing and automation with ML Ops.\nDeploying machine learning pipelines in production with ND A100 v4 VMs is further simplified using the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, an open-source inference serving application that\u2019s integrated with Azure ML to maximize both GPU and CPU performance and utilization to help minimize the operational costs of deployment.\nDevelopers and infrastructure managers will soon also be able to use Azure Kubernetes Service, a fully managed Kubernetes service to deploy and manage containerized applications on the ND A100 v4 VMs, with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nLearn more about the ND A100 v4 VMs on Microsoft Azure and get started with building innovative solutions on the cloud.\nFor more, watch the GTC21 talk I co-presented on \u201cAzure: Empowering the World with High-Ambition AI and HPC\u201d with Girish Bablani, corporate vice president of Microsoft.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data CenterTags: NGC | NVIDIA A100 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With more memory and significantly enhanced processing, they promise to make light work of demanding real-time ray tracing, GPU rendering and VR workflows.\n\nIn February 2021 we reviewed the Nvidia RTX A6000, the first pro desktop GPU to be based on Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Ampere\u2019 architecture. With 48 GB of memory and buckets of processing power, the dual slot 300W graphics card is designed for the most demanding visualisation workflows \u2013 think city-scale digital twins or complex product visualisations using very hi-fidelity textures, such as those captured from real-life scans.\nOf course, the Nvidia RTX A6000 is complete overkill for most architects or product designers who simply want a capable GPU for real-time visualisation, GPU rendering or VR. And it\u2019s here that the new Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 come into play.\nAnnounced at Nvidia\u2019s GTC event this year, the PCIe Gen 4 \u2018Ampere\u2019 Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 are the replacements for the PCIe Gen 3 \u2018Turing\u2019 Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and Quadro RTX 5000, which launched in 2019.\nUPDATE: 25 March 2022. Nvidia recently launched the Nvidia RTX A4500 and RTX A5500 to held boost supply of its high-end pro workstation GPUs. Read our review of the Nvidia RTX A4500\nThe RTX A4000 and A5000 are mid-range \u2018Quadro\u2019 GPUs in everything but name. Nvidia\u2019s long-serving Quadro workstation brand might be being retired, but the features remain the same.\nBoth cards offer more memory than their consumer GeForce counterparts, are standard issue in workstations from Dell, HP and Lenovo, and come with pro drivers with ISV certification for a wide range of CAD/BIM applications.\nAnd with an estimated street price of $1,000 for the Nvidia RTX A4000 and $2,250 for the Nvidia RTX A5000, they have much more palatable price tags than the Nvidia RTX A6000 which comes in at $4,650.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX (Ampere) / Quadro RTX (Turing) comparison\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX A4000\nNvidia RTX A5000\nNvidia RTX A6000\nQuadro RTX 4000\nQuadro RTX 5000\nQuadro RTX 6000\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\nTuring\nTuring\nTuring\n\n\nGPU memory\n 16 GB GDDR6\n 24 GB GDDR6\n 48 GB GDDR6 \n8 GB GDDR6\n16 GB GDDR6\n24 GB GDDR6\n\n\nECC memory\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCUDA cores \n 6,144 \n 8,192 \n10,752\n2304\n3,072\n4,608\n\n\n Tensor Cores \n192 \n256 \n336\n288\n384\n576\n\n\nRT Cores \n48 \n64 \n84\n36\n48\n72\n\n\n SP perf\n 19.2 TFLOPS \n 27.8 TFLOPS \n38.7 TFLOPS\n7.1 TFLOPS\n11.2 TFLOPS\n16.3 TFLOPS\n\n\nRT Core perf\n\n37.4 TFLOPS \n54.2 TFLOPS \n75.6 TFLOPS\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nTensor perf\n\n153.4 TFLOPS \n222.2 TFLOPS \n309.7 TFLOPS\n57.0 TFLOPS\n89.2 TFLOPS\n130.5 TFLOPS\n\n\nMax Power\n140W\n230W\n300W\n160W\n265W\n295W\n\n\nGraphic bus\n PCI-E 4.0 x16 \n PCI-E 4.0 x16 \n PCI-E 4.0 x16 \n PCI-E 3.0 x16 \n PCI-E 3.0 x16 \n PCI-E 3.0 x16 \n\n\nConnectors \n DP 1.4 (4) \n DP 1.4 (4) \n DP 1.4 (4) \nDP 1.4 (3), USB-C\nDP 1.4 (4), USB-C\nDP 1.4 (4), USB-C\n\n\nForm Factor \nSingle slot\n Dual Slot \n Dual Slot \nSingle slot\n Dual Slot \n Dual Slot \n\n\nvGPU Software\n\nN/A\nNVIDIA RTX vWS\nNVIDIA RTX vWS\nN/A\nN/A\nNVIDIA RTX vWS\n\n\nNvlink\nN/A\n 2x RTX A5000 \n2x RTX A6000 \nN/A\n 2x RTX 5000 \n 2x RTX 6000 \n\n\nPower Connector \n 1x 6-pin PCIe \n 1x 8-pin PCIe \n1x 8-pin CPU\n 1x 6-pin PCIe \n 1x 8-pin PCIe \n 2x 8-pin PCIe \n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX A4000 (16 GB)\nWith 16 GB of GDDR6 ECC memory, the Nvidia RTX A4000 offers a big step up from the 8 GB Quadro RTX 4000. 8 GB is fine for mainstream viz workflows but for more complex projects it can be limiting, so delivering 16 GB in a sub $1,000 pro GPU is a big step forward. Previously, 16 GB was only available on the \u2018Turing\u2019-based Quadro RTX 5000.\nAs you\u2019d expect from Nvidia\u2019s new \u2018Ampere\u2019 architecture, the Nvidia RTX A4000 also offers a significant improvement in processing. This can be seen in all areas of the GPU with more CUDA cores for general processing, third-generation Tensor Cores for AI operations and second-generation RT Cores for hardware-based ray tracing. It leads to a substantial performance increase in many different applications (see later on).\nFurthermore, as the Nvidia RTX A4000 is a single slot GPU with a max power consumption of 140W delivered through a single 6-pin PCIe connector, it\u2019s available in a wide range of desktop workstation form factors. This includes compact towers like the HP Z2 Tower G8 and Dell Precision 3650.\nThe compact HP Z2 Tower can host the Nvidia RTX A4000 or Nvidia RTX A5000 GPU\nThe board features four DisplayPort 1.4a ports and can drive up to four displays at 5K resolution. It is cooled by a single \u2018blower\u2019 type fan, which draws in cool air from the top and bottom of the card, pushes it through a radiator and then directly out of the rear of the workstation chassis. This is in contrast to most consumer GeForce GPUs which use axial fans that recirculate air inside the machine.\nThere are pros and cons to each design, but a blower fan does mean you can stack cards within the chassis without having to leave space between them. This means you can get a very good density of GPUs inside a mid-sized chassis.\nWith the AMD Threadripper Pro-based Lenovo ThinkStation P620, for example, you could get four Nvidia RTX A4000s back-to-back, which could be a very interesting proposition for GPU rendering. Even though the RTX A4000 doesn\u2019t support NVlink (so there\u2019s no pooling of GPU memory) 16 GB is still a good amount and two, three or four RTX A4000s could work out well in terms of price/performance compared to the more powerful RTX A5000 or A6000.\nAnother potential use case for high-density multi-GPU is workstation virtualisation using GPU passthrough, where each user gets a dedicated GPU. Again, this workflow looks well suited to the Lenovo ThinkStation P620, which can be configured with up to 64 CPU cores and 2TB of memory.\nOther more niche pro viz features include support for 3D Stereo, Nvidia Mosaic for professional multi-display solutions, and Quadro Sync II, an add-in card that can synchronise the display and image output from multiple GPUs within a single system, or across a cluster of systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Nvidia RTX A4000 single slot card features a blower that pulls in air from both sides.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Nvidia RTX A5000 supports NVlink to pool memory in multi GPU configrations\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nNvidia RTX A5000 (24 GB)\nWith 24 GB of GDDR6 ECC memory, the Nvidia RTX A5000 offers only a 50% memory uplift compared to the Quadro RTX 5000 it replaces.\nLike the Nvidia RTX A4000 it offers a significant upgrade in all areas of processing \u2013 CUDA, Tensor and RT cores.\nIt\u2019s a double height board, with a max power consumption of 230W which it draws from the PSU via an 8-pin PCIe connector, but it\u2019s still available in compact towers.\nThe board also features four DisplayPort 1.4a ports and is cooled by a single \u2018blower\u2019 type fan, but only draws in cool air from one side of the card.\nThe Nvidia RTX A5000 supports all the same features as the Nvidia RTX A4000 but differs in two main areas.\nOne, it supports Nvidia NVLink, so GPU memory can be expanded to 48 GB by connecting two 24 GB GPUs together.\nTwo, it supports Nvidia RTX vWS (virtual workstation software) so it can deliver multiple high-performance virtual workstation instances that enable remote users to share resources. In the Lenovo ThinkStation P620, for example, you could get a very high density of CAD/BIM users who only need high-end RTX performance from time to time.\n\nTesting the Nvidia RTX A4000 / RTX A5000\nWe put the Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 through a series of real-world application benchmarks, for GPU rendering, real-time visualisation and 3D CAD.\nAll tests were carried out using the AMD Ryzen-based Scan 3XS GWP-ME A132R workstation at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution using the latest 462.59 Nvidia driver.\nThe full spec can be seen below. We\u2019ll be posting a full review soon.\n\nScan 3XS GWP-ME A132R\n\nAMD Ryzen 5950X CPU (3.4GHz to 4.9GHz) (16 cores)\n64 GB (2 x 32 GB) Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3200MHz memory\n2 TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD system drive\n4 TB Samsung 870 Evo SATA SSD storage drive\nAsus Pro WS X570-ACE motherboard\nNoctua NH-D15 air cooler\n750W Corsair RMX, 80PLUS Gold PSU\n1GbE NIC Networking\n3XS workstation case with tempered glass window\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Professional 64-bit\n3 Years \u2013 1st Year Onsite, 2nd and 3rd Year RTB (Parts and Labour) warranty\nPrice (with Nvidia RTX A4000) \u00a33,333 (Ex VAT) (not yet available).\nPrice (with Nvidia RTX A5000) \u00a34,166 (Ex VAT)\n\n\nFor comparison, we used the last two generations of \u20184000\u2019 class Nvidia pro GPUs \u2013 the 8 GB \u2018Turing\u2019 Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 (from 2019) and the 8 GB \u2018Pascal\u2019 Nvidia Quadro P4000 (from 2017). Three to four years is quite a typical upgrade cycle in workstations, so the intention here is to give a good idea of the performance increase one might expect from an older machine.\nWe also threw some Nvidia RTX A6000 scores in there. These were done on two different workstations with a 32-core Threadripper Pro 3970X and a quad core Intel Xeon W-2125 CPU. While both CPUs have lower frequencies and instructions per clock (IPC) the results should still give a pretty good idea of comparative performance, especially in GPU rendering software.\n\nHardware-based ray tracing with the Nvidia RTX A4000 / A5000\nIt\u2019s been just over two years since Nvidia introduced \u2018Turing\u2019 Nvidia Quadro RTX, its first pro GPUs with RTX hardware ray tracing.\nIn a classic chicken and egg launch, there were very few RTX-enabled applications back then, but this has now changed. For design viz, there\u2019s Chaos V-Ray, Chaos Vantage, Enscape, Unreal Engine, Unity, D5 render, Nvidia Omniverse, Autodesk VRED, KeyShot, Siemens NX Ray Traced Studio, Solidworks Visualize, Catia Live rendering and others.\nNvidia RTX gave GPU rendering a massive kick start and while there is increased competition from hugely powerful CPUs like the 64-core AMD Threadripper [Pro], we are seeing deeper penetration of GPU rendering tools, especially in architect / engineer / product designer friendly workflows.\nNvidia RTX is being used to massively accelerate classic viz focused ray trace renderers like V-Ray, KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize, which we test below. However, some of the more exciting developments are coming from the AEC sector in tools like Enscape, Chaos Vantage and Unreal Engine, which really make ray tracing \u2018real-time\u2019. Vantage, for example, is built from the ground up for real-time ray tracing so can maximise the usage of RT cores within the new GPUs.\n\nChaos Group V-Ray\nV-Ray is one of the most popular physically based rendering tools, especially in architectural visualisation. We put the new cards through their paces using the freely downloadable V-Ray 5 benchmark, which has dedicated tests for Nvidia CUDA GPUs, Nvidia RTX GPUs, as well as CPUs.\nThe results were impressive. In the CUDA test, the Nvidia RTX A4000 was 1.62 times faster than the previous generation Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and in the RTX test 1.70 times faster. The lead over the Pascal-based Quadro P4000 was nothing short of colossal \u2013 3.53 times faster in the CUDA test. As the P4000 does not have dedicated RT cores, it could not run the RTX test.\nStepping up to the Nvidia RTX A5000 will give you an additional boost. Compared to the Nvidia RTX A4000 it was between 1.27 and 1.37 times faster.\nInterestingly, the RTX A5000 was not that far behind the RTX A6000, which costs more than twice as much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxion Keyshot\nKeyShot, a CPU rendering stalwart, is a relative newcomer to the world of GPU rendering. But it\u2019s one of the slickest implementations we\u2019ve seen, allowing users to switch between CPU and GPU rendering at the click of a button.\nIn the Keyshot 10 benchmark, part of the free KeyShot Viewer, the performance leap was even more substantial than in V-Ray. The Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 outperformed the Quadro RTX 4000 by a factor of 1.89 and 2.51 respectively. And the RTX A5000 was only 20% slower than the RTX A6000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDS Solidworks Visualize 2021 SP3\nThe name of this GPU-accelerated physically based renderer is a bit misleading as it works with many more applications than the CAD application of the same name. It can import models from Creo, Solid Edge, Catia and Inventor, as well as several neutral formats.\nSince the 2020 release the software has supported Nvidia RT cores and Tensor cores to improve rendering performance with Nvidia RTX GPUs. Users can choose to render scenes with or without denoising enabled.\nDenoising is a post-processing technique based on machine learning that filters out noise from unfinished / noisy images and is the foundation for many RTX-accelerated applications. It means you can get better looking renders with significantly fewer rendering passes.\nDS Solidworks reckons that if a scene routinely needs 500 passes without the denoiser, then you may be able to achieve the same rendering quality with 50 passes with the denoiser enabled.\nWe tested the stock 1969 Camaro car model at 4K resolution with 1,000 passes (denoising disabled) and 100 passes (denoising enabled) set to accurate quality. Both settings produced excellent visual results.\nThe RTX A4000 and RTX A5000 delivered the 100-pass render in 22 seconds and 14 seconds respectively. This isn\u2019t the most complex scene but being able to render at such speeds is quite incredible and can have a profound impact on workflows. In comparison, it took the Quadro P4000 GPU 105 seconds, so you can see just how far things have progressed in four years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal time 3D with the Nvidia RTX A4000 /\u00a0 A5000\nWhile GPU rendering is a major play for the Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000, real-time 3D using OpenGL, DirectX and (in the future) Vulkan continues to be a very important part of architectural visualisation, with applications including TwinMotion, Lumion, Enscape, Unreal Engine, LumenRT and others.\nOf course, the boundaries between real-time 3D and ray tracing continue to blur. In fact, out of the list above only Lumion and Twinmotion are yet to support RTX, although it should be coming to Twinmotion soon.\nTo test frame rates, we used a combination of monitoring software including FRAPS, Xbox Game Bar and MSI Afterburner. We only tested at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution. At FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution this class of GPU simply isn\u2019t stressed enough.\n\nEnscape 2.6\nEnscape is a real-time viz and VR tool for architects that uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality graphics in the viewport. Enscape has used elements of ray tracing in its software for some time. Version 3.0 is RTX-enabled, so full ray tracing can be toggled on and off. Later versions will use the more modern Vulkan API and support ray tracing on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs.\nFor our tests, we used a large architectural scene of a museum and its surrounding area in Enscape 2.6 (non RTX). At 7.5GB, the GPU memory requirements of this model are relatively high, but Enscape models can be much larger.\nIn terms of performance, the Nvidia RTX A4000 and A5000 delivered a very smooth experience with 30 and 40 FPS respectively. This is around twice as fast as the Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 and three to four times faster than the Nvidia Quadro P4000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutodesk VRED Professional 2022\n\nAutodesk VRED Professional is an automotive-focused 3D visualisation, virtual prototyping and VR tool. It uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality visuals in the viewport. It offers several levels of real-time anti-aliasing (AA), which is important for automotive styling, as it smooths the edges of body panels. However, AA calculations use a lot of GPU resources, both in terms of processing and memory. We tested our automotive model with AA set to \u2018off\u2019 and \u2018ultra-high\u2019.\nConsidering that this pro viz application used to only really run effectively on Nvidia\u2019s ultra-high-end professional GPUs, it\u2019s quite astounding that the Nvidia RTX A4000 \u2013 a sub $1,000 card \u2013 delivered over 30 FPS at 4K resolution with medium anti-aliasing. In saying that, those really pushing the boundaries of automotive visualisation will still likely need the top-end Nvidia RTX A6000 especially for high-res VR workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnreal Engine 4.26\n\nOver the past few years Unreal Engine has established itself as a very prominent tool for design viz, especially in architecture and automotive. It was one of the first applications to use GPU-accelerated real-time ray tracing, which it does through Microsoft DirectX Ray tracing (DXR).\nWe used two datasets for testing, both freely available from Epic Games: an arch viz interior of a small apartment and the Automotive Configurator, which features an Audi A5 convertible. Both scenes were tested with ray tracing enabled (DirectX Ray tracing (DXR)) and without (DirectX 12 rasterisation).\nThe results were pretty much as expected with good scaling between all the GPUs with DirectX 12 rasterization. With real-time ray tracing enabled, performance naturally takes a hit in general, but the Quadro P4000 really suffers without any RT cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVRMark\n\nWe also tested with VRMark, a dedicated Virtual Reality benchmark that uses both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12. It\u2019s biased towards 3D games, so not perfect for our needs, but should give a good indication of the performance one might expect in \u2018game engine\u2019 viz tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAD and BIM with the Nvidia RTX A4000 / A5000\nMost 3D CAD and BIM tools tend to be CPU limited, so performance is largely bottlenecked by the frequency (GHz) of the CPU. As a result, the Nvidia RTX A4000 and Nvidia RTX A5000 are really overkill for most CAD and BIM applications. They are unlikely to give you significantly better 3D performance than more mainstream GPUs like the Nvidia Quadro P1000 or P2200.\nHowever, CAD applications are changing and, in the future, should be able to make much better use of the plentiful power of higher-end GPUs like the RTX A4000 and A5000. Both Autodesk with its new One Graphics System and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes are currently working on new graphics engines that use more modern graphics APIs like Vulkan. This should not only improve general 3D performance but will make real-time ray tracing available directly in the viewport. So, while the RTX A4000 / A5000 might not give notable performance benefits in CAD right now, they could certainly do so in the future.\nIn addition, it is important to note that both GPUs will be certified for a wide range of pro CAD / BIM applications, which is important for some firms. This is especially true for enterprises that buy 100s or 1,000s of workstations from large OEMs like HP, Dell and Lenovo and want assurance that the GPUs will be stable and that they will be properly supported by the software developer.\nCertification is a major reason why some firms choose Nvidia\u2019s pro-focused RTX GPUs over their \u2018consumer GeForce\u2019 counterparts so they can confidently use applications like Revit, Solidworks, PTC Creo, and Siemens NX alongside more viz-focused tools like Chaos V-Ray, Enscape, Luxion KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize.\n\nSolidworks 2021\n\nWhile most CAD applications won\u2019t benefit from any GPU more powerful that the Nvidia Quadro P1000 or P2200, Solidworks 2021 is an exception. By using OpenGL 4.5, a more modern version of the popular graphics API, more algorithms can be pushed onto the GPU so there is a benefit to higher performance GPUs.\nEven so, the application is still CPU limited to some extent, so the performance benefit the new cards give you isn\u2019t as big as you\u2019d get from a dedicated real-time viz tool.\nLike most CAD tools, the most popular way to view models in Solidworks is in shaded with edges mode. Using the SPECapc for SolidWorks 2021 benchmark we saw a small improvement, generation on generation with this display style. The Nvidia RTX A4000 was 1.10 times faster than the Quadro RTX 4000 and 1.44 times faster than the \u2018Pascal\u2019 Quadro P4000.\nSolidworks also features more realistic display styles for viewing models in real time. SolidWorks RealView, which is only supported by pro GPUs, adds realistic materials and supports environment reflections and floor shadows. Meanwhile, ambient occlusion adds more realistic shadows and helps bring out details.\nBoth viewing styles are more GPU-intensive, so performance is less limited by the frequency of the CPU. In our tests, we saw a bigger benefit over older GPUs. With RealView, Shadows and Ambient Occlusion enabled the Nvidia RTX A4000 was 1.16 times faster than the Quadro RTX 4000 and 1.57 times faster than the Quadro P4000.\nWe were unable to test the Nvidia RTX A5000 as Solidworks 2021 SP3 did not recognise the card. We expect this to be fixed in SP4, out soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWith the new Nvidia RTX A4000 and A5000, Nvidia has made its \u2018Ampere\u2019 GPU architecture much more accessible to a wider audience. In particular, we see the sub $1,000 Nvidia RTX A4000 hitting the sweet spot for designers, engineers or architects that want a pro viz capability in their workflow.\nThe performance leap from \u2018Turing\u2019 to \u2018Ampere\u2019 (Quadro RTX 4000 to RTX A4000) is nothing short of impressive. In real-time 3D, a 45% to 60% boost, generation on generation, seems typical, with even bigger gains from real-time ray tracing when the enhanced RT and Tensor cores come into play. The step up from the four-year old \u2018Pascal\u2019 Quadro P4000 is simply phenomenal, especially for GPU rendering.\nEquipping the RTX A4000 with 16 GB of memory is very significant. While we often see models / scenes that surpass 8 GB (the capacity of the previous generation Quadro RTX 4000) scenes that are 16 GB and above are certainly less common, and more the preserve of viz specialists than most architects or product designers who use standard materials and assets.\nAs we wait for AMD to deliver a Pro version of its \u2018Big Navi\u2019 Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs with hardware ray tracing, Nvidia\u2019s biggest competitor in pro graphics is currently itself.\nThe new 12 GB \u2018consumer\u2019 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, for example, might have half the memory of the Nvidia RTX A5000, but offers more performance on paper for half the price. Nvidia even has a GeForce Studio driver for applications including Enscape, Unreal Engine and V-Ray.\nDespite the obvious attraction of Nvidia\u2019s consumer GPUs, Nvidia\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 class models should continue to find favour in large firms and enterprises that buy in volume, want more memory, consistent supply, pro viz features or the assurance of certification. There\u2019s also the question of supply. As the global chip shortage continues to bite, Nvidia may well prioritise manufacture of its higher-margin pro GPUs, making GeForce even harder to get hold of.\nNvidia still has some work to do to flesh out its Ampere family. While mobile workstations already have entry-level RTX A2000 and A3000 GPUs, there\u2019s no equivalent for desktops.\nThe AEC industry would certainly welcome a sub $500 pro RTX GPU to replace the Pascal-based Quadro P2200, which is now long in the tooth. In years gone by, we would have expected to see a desktop RTX A2000 before the end of 2021, but with ongoing supply challenges and high demand, things are very hard to predict right now.\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s 2021 workstation special report.

In March, we reduced system latency in Rainbow Six Siege with NVIDIA Reflex, and now we\u2019re accelerating performance by up to 50% at 4K, enabling all GeForce RTX GPUs to game at 100+ FPS at 4K with the launch of NVIDIA DLSS. Available as part of the new North Star update, Rainbow Six Siege players with GeForce RTX graphics cards and laptops can enable DLSS with just a few clicks in Options --> Graphics, instantly enhancing their experience.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), it\u2019s a groundbreaking AI rendering technology that increases graphics performance using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. In Rainbow Six Siege, it gives you even faster performance, and the headroom to turn up detail levels and rendering resolutions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn Rainbow Six Siege, split-second reactions can be the difference between winning and losing. NVIDIA DLSS ensures that you\u2019ve got maximum performance and image quality so you\u2019ve always got victory in your sights.\u201d - Anthony De Rochefort, 3D Programmer, Ubisoft\nNVIDIA DLSS is supported in the Vulkan version of Rainbow Six Siege and boosts performance by up to 50% at 4K, enabling all GeForce RTX GPUs to game at 100+ FPS at 4K with every setting maxed out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how you enable NVIDIA DLSS in Rainbow Six Siege:\n\nDownload and install our latest Game Ready Driver from our website, or via GeForce Experience\u00a0\nDownload the North Star Rainbow Six Siege update from the Ubisoft Connect client\nLoad the game, go to Options --> Graphics, and enable NVIDIA DLSS\nSelect the NVIDIA DLSS quality level. Quality Mode is recommended for 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, and Performance Mode for 3840x2160. If your resolution differs from the examples, pick the closest setting\n\nWhile you\u2019re in the options menu, you can also enable NVIDIA Reflex, if it isn\u2019t already activated. NVIDIA Reflex reduces latency while maintaining FPS, so whenever it\u2019s available it\u2019s always beneficial to enable, giving you a more responsive experience that\u2019ll make you more competitive online. Lower latency reduces the delay between a mouse click and a weapon firing in-game, reduces peeker\u2019s advantage, and increases your chance at victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the availability of both NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex in Rainbow Six Siege, players with GeForce RTX GPUs can get the best experience possible, with faster performance and optimized system latency.\nTo learn about all the other games that have recently added NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and ray tracing, head to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We learned that the company we\u2019ve built, all of us, has great power to improve lives.\u201d\nOur key initiatives and corresponding outcomes include:\n\n\n Taking Care of Our People and Communities During Times of Crisis\n\n\nThe pandemic allowed companies to show the importance of putting people first. At NVIDIA, we promised no layoffs and pledged, instead, to move up salary increases to support families. Vendors and contractors \u2014 such as workers in our caf\u00e9 and janitorial services \u2014 have been paid even while sites have been closed. Company-wide efforts support the thousands of employees still working from home.\nWhen families were further hit by wildfires in the U.S., COVID-19 surges in India and civil unrest in multiple regions, we reached out with additional resources. Our philanthropic arm, the NVIDIA Foundation, encouraged employee giving \u2014 but NVIDIANs went above and beyond, contributing $17 million to help thousands of organizations worldwide, including over $1 million in response to the recent devastating COVID surge in India.\n\n\n Strengthening Diversity and Inclusion, in the Workplace and Beyond\n\n\nOver the past year, we moved to create new opportunities to advance diversity and inclusion companywide and in our developer ecosystem.\nWe made strong outreach efforts in recruiting and tripled the number of Black employees in our workforce. And we began tracking promotion parity and improved transparency by sharing additional detail about our pay practices in the corporate social responsibility report.\nWe\u2019re also launching an immersion program for first- and second-year students at historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions to motivate and encourage the continuation of computer science and engineering studies.\nOur most recent GPU Technology Conference attracted more than 20,000 developers from emerging markets, hundreds of women speakers and a variety of session topics discussing diversity and inclusion in AI. Compared to last fall\u2019s event, it saw a 6x increase in female attendees, a 6x jump in Black attendees and a 5x boost in Hispanic and Latino attendees.\n\n\n Protecting People and the Planet with Our Products\n\n\nNVIDIA technology has long been used to accelerate applications with social impact. Since the pandemic began, teams across the company have worked on hundreds of initiatives with researchers, scientists, leading healthcare organizations and governments worldwide to fight COVID-19.\nWe\u2019re a member of the COVID-19 HPC Consortium, which bolsters coronavirus research with the world\u2019s most powerful computing resources. And startups and leading researchers around the globe are using NVIDIA technology to simulate the virus at the molecular level, detect COVID-19 in CT scans and create touch-free AI platforms to safely monitor hospital patients.\nThe NVIDIA GPUs behind these projects aren\u2019t just optimized for performance \u2014 parallel processing on GPUs consumes up to 42x less energy than traditional CPUs. The NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system captured the top spot on the latest Green500 ranking of most efficient supercomputers and set a new world record in power efficiency. NVIDIA-powered machines are featured in 26 of the list\u2019s top 30 spots. We also announced the 400-petaflops Cambridge-1 supercomputer, our first to use 100 percent renewable energy.\nWe strive to improve data center energy efficiency in design, construction, and operations, and we evaluate sustainability criteria when procuring new sites. Our key data centers are certified to the ISO 50001 energy management standard, and we have a goal to source 65 percent of our energy use from renewables by 2025.\nThese and other efforts have been met with widespread recognition. NVIDIA has in recent months ranked highly on lists including:\n\nGlassdoor\u2019s Best Places to Work in 2021, Employee\u2019s Choice\nNewsweek\u2019s America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies\nAmerica\u2019s Most JUST Companies\nFortune\u2019s Change the World ranking\nPeople magazine\u2019s 50 Companies That Care\nFortune\u2019s ranking of America\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For\n\nWe\u2019re also included in the following indexes: the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u2019s 2020 Best ESG Companies List, Corporate Knight\u2019s 2021 Global 100 index, MIT and Glassdoor\u2019s Culture 500 and the Corporate Equality Index, a U.S. benchmark for LGBTQ workplace inclusion.\nLearn more about corporate sustainability at NVIDIA here.

Specifically engineered to ease a company\u2019s IT burden, Fleet Command helps democratize AI everywhere by letting users quickly install, update and manage software from a central location.\nEarly adopters of Fleet Command include the world\u2019s leading retail, healthcare and logistics companies, and the specialty software companies that work with them.\n\u201cThe ability to deploy and manage AI applications at the edge is one of the most complex problems facing businesses as they move toward an Internet of Things era, including smart factories, intelligent retail and smart cities,\u201d said Manuvir Das, head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA Fleet Command drives efficiency across a business, helping scale edge AI with unprecedented speed.\u201d\nWithin minutes of installation, the platform lets administrators add or delete applications, update system software over the air, and monitor the health of devices spread across vast distances.\nImproving Accuracy and Speed\nBollore Logistics, a top 10 retail logistics company with more than 700 distribution centers globally, is moving to use AI to improve the accuracy and speed of order fulfillment in its distribution centers. The company is implementing a solution from NVIDIA partners Dematic and Osaro, which will be using Fleet Command to deploy and manage AI applications across hundreds of locations.\nEnd-to-End Creation to Deployment\r\nThe AI deployment and management tool, offered by subscription from NVIDIA, can be combined with NVIDIA Base Command, a cloud-hosted development hub that lets enterprises quickly move their AI projects from prototypes to production. The platforms together allow businesses to quickly conceive, deploy and manage edge and industrial AI.\nData Monsters has been one of more than a dozen early access partners using Fleet Command. The AI consultancy is working with one of the world\u2019s largest beverage companies to deploy and manage software across its many manufacturing facilities to catch dents and wrinkles in consumer cans through computer vision, and to notify employees when problems arise.\n\u201cFleet Command provides a unified approach for secured deployment and management of computing resources at scale, including hardware resources provisioning, deployment automation and monitoring. And it provides integration with NVIDIA GPU Cloud \u2014 a single global and private registry for application containers and DNN models,\u201d said German Suvorov, head of Industrial AI at Data Monsters. \u201cAll these features enable seamless scaling of our edge AI applications over a network of manufacturing sites globally.\u201d\nNVIDIA Certified\r\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems bring together NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs and NVIDIA networking in servers from leading NVIDIA partners. Systems certified by NVIDIA are configured to deliver excellent performance for edge AI workloads and are optimized for Fleet Command.\nFleet Command is a leading solution of the NVIDIA AI LaunchPad program, also announced today. Delivered through hybrid-cloud providers, AI LaunchPad gives enterprises immediate access to NVIDIA-powered infrastructure and software to streamline the entire AI lifecycle.\nAvailability\r\nThe Fleet Command hybrid-cloud managed service is available direct from NVIDIA to accompany edge AI deployments with NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

Over 70 RTX games have been released or updated with support for these and other NVIDIA technologies, and today DOOM\u24c7 Eternal gets its own RTX enhancements.\nThis new RTX upgrade, available now, gives GeForce gamers a DOOM Eternal experience that is second to none, with blazing fast frame rates courtesy of NVIDIA DLSS, and gorgeous ray traced reflections that enhance the DOOM Slayer\u2019s campaign. Visual effects and their lighting reflects, enemies and scenery are accurately reflected, and players experience a superior level of image quality that further improves DOOM Eternal\u2019s award-winning gameplay, while engrossing them with the increased dynamism delivered by ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay tracing and NVIDIA DLSS combine to deliver the highest levels of fidelity and performance in our DOOM Eternal RTX video, captured on a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOOM Eternal\u2019s RTX Upgrade Available Now\nid Software and Bethesda Softworks\u2019 DOOM Eternal launched last year to critical acclaim and the adoration of fans who can\u2019t get enough of the franchise\u2019s fast-paced action, spectacular visuals, and amazing gameplay. Powered by idTech, id\u2019s incredibly fast game engine, DOOM Eternal is pushing the visual boundaries even further by adding Khronos Vulkan ray-traced reflections and performance-accelerating NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections\nWith the power of ray tracing, id Software has upgraded DOOM Eternal\u2019s campaign and expansions. Now, virtually all metallic surfaces and objects realistically reflect their environment, as do bodies of water and other materials with reflective properties. See the DOOM Slayer reflected, along with demons and weapons fire, and enjoy gameplay enhanced with realistic reflections that further immerse you in the action.\nBelow, we\u2019ve assembled examples of ray-traced reflections in action - click each to load interactive comparisons comparing RTX ON and RTX OFF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a 4K full screen comparison: In many locations, ray-traced reflections are combined with screen space reflections in a hybrid solution for optimum image quality and performance. This scene demonstrates the added off-screen detail that ray-traced reflections can add - now, the ceiling and occluded detail is rendered, adding greatly to image quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a 4K full screen comparison: Reflections are applied to both transparent and opaque surfaces, and are capable of reflecting both friendly and enemy weapon fire and impacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a 4K full screen comparison: In Earth-bound locales, transparent ray-traced reflections enhance glass and windows. And in cutscenes, the DOOM Slayer\u2019s visor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a 4K full screen comparison: Ray-traced reflections are detailed and extremely accurate, as on this broken shop front window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a 4K full screen comparison: Ray-traced reflections enhance virtually all materials with reflective properties, including these health pickups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to load a 4K full screen comparison: Realistic reflections improve the appearance of the DOOM Slayer, when seen in cutscenes and in third-person in the Photo Mode\nTo enable ray tracing, update to the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, grab the newest DOOM Eternal update, and in the game\u2019s video options simply toggle on \u201cRaytracing\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nNVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is a groundbreaking AI rendering technology that increases graphics performance using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. NVIDIA DLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images for your games.\nIn DOOM Eternal, a highly performant game, DLSS is best used in conjunction with the oh-so-pretty ray-traced reflections, to improve upon the game\u2019s already trademark lightning-fast performance.\nWhen activated, NVIDIA DLSS accelerates performance by up to 60% at 4K, enabling virtually every GeForce RTX GPU to exceed 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled, and all settings cranked to their max:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen applying graphics presets like \u201cUltra Nightmare,\u201d enabling ray tracing for GPUs with 8 GB or 6 GB frame buffers requires enabling DLSS and adjusting the texture pool size to fit within allocated memory. This change is nearly transparent on image quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBethesda\u2019s DOOM Eternal GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Demon Slayer Bundle\nOur friends at Bethesda Softworks and id Software have put together a very limited DOOM Eternal bundle that gamers in North America and Europe can potentially get their hands on.

This follows large-scale genomics initiatives rolled out in Thailand and Japan this year. And gene therapy startup Greffex recently adopted Parabricks Pipelines to accelerate its project to develop a universal influenza vaccine.\nIdentifying Genomic Insights for Population Studies\nParabricks Pipelines speed up DNA- and RNA-based projects by up to 50x on NVIDIA GPUs, enabling scientists to extract as much useful information as possible from the hundreds of terabytes of instrument data generated daily. This acceleration is especially powerful for public health institutions and research labs running population studies with tens of thousands of genomes to be analyzed.\nMingma Biotechnology adopted Parabricks Pipelines and NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs to accelerate its work in sequencing and multi-omics data analysis. The company provides medical institutions, pharmaceutical companies and researchers with genomic insights for disease research and drug development.\nAt the National Biobank of Thailand, an NVIDIA DGX A100 system is powering Genomics Thailand, an initiative to introduce genomic medicine as a common healthcare service in the country. The research institution is using Parabricks Pipelines to analyze genetic variations from 50,000 Thai volunteers\u2019 whole genome sequencing data.\nPairing the DGX system with Parabricks Pipelines reduced the project\u2019s whole genome data processing time by four months. Insights from this work will help researchers better analyze genetic variation specific to the Thai population.\nAnd in Japan, the University of Tokyo\u2019s Human Genome Center recently launched SHIROKANE, the country\u2019s fastest supercomputer for life sciences. The DGX A100-powered system is running Parabricks Pipelines to sequence whole genomes of 92,000 patients, creating a database that is foundational to precision medicine efforts for cancer and intractable diseases.\nPowering Clinical Sequencing, Drug Discovery\u00a0\nThe Parabricks Pipelines suite of genetic tools can be configured to meet each laboratory\u2019s specific needs. Researchers run Parabricks Pipelines workloads on NVIDIA GPU systems that range from desktop workstations to GPU-accelerated clouds and some of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\nWithin weeks of getting started with an HP data science workstation featuring NVIDIA RTX GPUs, Houston-based Greffex is using Parabricks Pipelines and NVIDIA Clara Discovery to advance its efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine.\nThe startup uses a combination of genomic sequencing, molecular dynamics tools and wet lab research to study how influenza strains evolve over time, and how these mutations impact vaccine efficacy.\nTo monitor changes in the flu, Greffex collects tens of thousands of flu genomes from around the world and runs massive sequence alignments on NVIDIA RTX 8000 GPUs to identify where the virus\u2019s genetic code is changing. Running genomic workloads on GPUs is saving the company up to 13 hours per sample, while also enabling its team to rerun samples with different parameters to fine-tune the alignment results.\nGreffex scientists run compute-intensive molecular dynamics simulations of hemagglutinin, a protein on the surface of influenza viruses, to see how it behaves in a natural environment.\nOnce genetic variants are identified, Greffex scientists use molecular dynamics to visualize how these genetic changes alter the physical shape of the flu virus. They\u2019re on the lookout for divergent mutations, where the flu virus may morph to a shape that doesn\u2019t bind as well with vaccine-prompted antibodies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very lengthy and expensive process to optimize the protein structure for a vaccine that binds not just with the current flu strain, but a bunch of other strains,\u201d said Daniel Preston, a bioinformatics scientist at Greffex. \u201cWith computational methods, we can get a sense of what will likely work before testing in real-world labs. It\u2019s like using a scalpel versus using a hammer.\u201d\nAbout NVIDIA Clara Parabricks\nNVIDIA Clara Parabricks brings GPU speedups to the Broad Institute\u2019s industry-standard Genome Analysis Toolkit, as well as popular tools like Google\u2019s DeepVariant genetic caller. Running on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, Parabricks accelerates secondary analysis times of a whole human genome to 23 minutes for DNA germline variant calling, compared to more than 20 hours on a CPU system.\nStarting with DNA sequencing reads, Clara Parabricks Pipelines can align, sort, filter and call variants for germline and somatic variant detection, as well as support RNA-based applications. Germline variants are those inherited through an individual\u2019s ancestry, while somatic mutations occur in human cells over a person\u2019s lifetime and can lead to cancer.\nParabricks Pipelines version 3.6, releasing next month, will offer more tools for somatic variant calling \u2014 which gives researchers insights for precision oncology \u2014 and de novo germline variant calling, which informs research into complex diseases like autism.\nThe de novo germline variant calling pipeline was developed in collaboration with researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine. The technique reduces runtime to under an hour to parse genome data and identify novel variants within a family pedigree or parent-child trio.\nGet started with NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines for accelerated genome analysis on NGC or on the AWS Marketplace.\nMain image shows a structural alignment of 17 H1 Hemagglutinin proteins spanning 102 years with simulated bound antibodies. Colored segments correspond to different types of mutations in the proteins.

Compared to the RTX 3080, the Ti model adds cores, and includes 2GB more memory. Our first performance focus is on 4K, with RTX 2080 Ti and GTX 1080 Ti performance included for a generational improvement look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery GeForce generation needs an X080 Ti model, and with Computex acting as a backdrop, NVIDIA revealed that now is the time to introduce the latest: RTX 3080 Ti. As with previous generation models, a la 2080 Ti and 1080 Ti, NVIDIA considers the RTX 3080 Ti to be its newest flagship; an ideal upgrade for those using previous-generation Ti cards of the same level.\nNVIDIA also announced its RTX 3070 Ti, due next week. Between the two of these new cards, the RTX 3080 Ti sees the bigger boost to capabilities over the non-Ti part. Its higher core count and memory bandwidth help bring the Ti\u2019s performance close to the biggest gun of them all, RTX 3090. With such close performance, the RTX 3090 becomes really geared towards creators who crave lots of graphics memory.\n\nWhile the RTX 3070 Ti isn\u2019t available until next week, NVIDIA was kind enough to give us all of the details now so that you can get a better glimpse of its current stack (last-gen stack included for comparison\u2019s sake):\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Gaming GPU Lineup\n\n\n\nCores\nBase MHz\nPeak FP32\nMemory\nBandwidth\nTDP\nSRP\n\n\nRTX 3090\n10,496\n1,400\n35.6 TFLOPS\n24GB 1\n936 GB/s\n350W\n$1,499\n\n\nRTX 3080 Ti\n10,240\n1,370\n34.1 TFLOPS\n12GB 1\n912 GB/s\n350W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 3080\n8,704\n1,440\n29.7 TFLOPS\n10GB 1\n760 GB/s\n320W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 3070 Ti\n6,144\n1,580\n21.7 TFLOPS\n8GB 1\n608 GB/s\n290W\n$599\n\n\nRTX 3070\n5,888\n1,500\n20.4 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n220W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n4,864\n1,410\n16.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n200W\n$399\n\n\nRTX 3060\n3,584\n1,320\n12.7 TFLOPS\n12GB 2\n360 GB/s\n170W\n$329\n\n\nRTX 2080 Ti\n4,352\n1,350\n13.4 TFLOPS\n11GB 2\n616 GB/s\n250W\n$1,199\n\n\nRTX 2080 S\n3,072\n1,650\n11.1 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n496 GB/s\n250W\n$699\n\n\nRTX 2070 S\n2,560\n1,605\n9.1 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n215W\n$499\n\n\nRTX 2060 S\n2,176\n1,470\n7.2 TFLOPS\n8GB 2\n448 GB/s\n175W\n$399\n\n\nRTX 2060\n1,920\n1,365\n6.4 TFLOPS\n6GB 2\n336 GB/s\n160W\n$299\n\n\nNotes\n1 GDDR6X; 2 GDDR6\nRTX 3000 = Ampere; RTX 2000 = Turing\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a good time to point out that the RTX 3080 Ti improves on the 3080\u2019s total memory by 2GB, giving us 12GB total. Considering the RTX 2080 Ti and 1080 Ti both included 11GB, we\u2019re relieved to find 12GB here, because a gain over similar level cards from four years ago seems right. And, a 1GB difference would look a bit strange when comparing the 3080 Ti to non-Ti. The RTX 3070 Ti bucks the frame buffer bump trend to stick to 8GB \u2013 but with the twist of it being much faster GDDR6X memory.\nWhat might stand out in the table above is the 3080 Ti\u2019s price. It\u2019s $500 more than the non-Ti model, and it can be battled two different ways on whether that adds up or not. On one hand, the 3080 Ti is still $300 less than the RTX 3090, but delivers almost the same performance; on the other, it\u2019s $200 more than the current top-end AMD competition. We\u2019ll evaluate after the results whether that premium is justified.\nAs with all of its launches, NVIDIA used this one to remind us of some of its exclusive features, or features it believes it does a better job on than the competition. A notable mention is with NVIDIA Broadcast, a robust solution for cleaning up your mic, speakers, or even camera. We\u2019re talking virtual green screens and noise removal, just to start.\nI was slow jumping on the Broadcast bandwagon, but I finally installed the software a couple of months ago, as I found myself recording a lot of Apex Legends matches with friends, and all I could hear was background noise. I effectively found out what my teammates hear from my end, and in the pursuit of cleaner audio, I\u2019ve been using the noise removal filter on my mic ever since.\n\nLike every other RTX card, the 3080 Ti includes cores to accelerate both ray tracing and deep-learning workloads. We learned quickly with the original RTX launch that even dedicated cores for RT acceleration isn\u2019t always enough to enable playable frame rates, which is where DLSS comes in. DLSS will take advantage of the hardware\u2019s deep-learning capabilities to upscale content to display it at a monitor\u2019s native resolution. Different DLSS levels allows you to favor performance or image quality. In a best-case scenario, DLSS can double a game\u2019s frame rate.\nTo NVIDIA\u2019s chagrin, we\u2019re sure, AMD used Computex to announce its FidelityFX Super Resolution, touted as a DLSS competitor that will be more open. The kind of \u201copen\u201d we\u2019re talking about is that FSR will be able to run on NVIDIA GPUs, even on those older than NVIDIA\u2019s RTX series. With a launch date of June 22, we\u2019ll hopefully soon be able to see how both technologies ultimately compare. Since FidelityFX exists in the same game engines as NVIDIA\u2019s GameWorks, we\u2019re hopeful many games will offer both options.\nWe\u2019ll be digging into DLSS and ray traced performance in the weeks ahead, but for this launch article, we\u2019re going to focus exclusively on 4K resolution. With the launch of the RTX 3070 Ti next week, we plan to add ultrawide resolution in time for that, as well as a separate article targeting rendering performance.\nFor now, let\u2019s get into the meat of this article:\nBenchmarking PC & Testing Methodology\n\n\n\n\nTechgage Gaming GPU Test PC\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X (3.4GHz Base, 4.9GHz Turbo, 16C/32T)\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X570 TAICHI (EFI: P4.30 04/14/2021)\n\n\nMemory\nG.SKILL TridentZ Royal (F4-3600C16-8GTRG) 8GB x 2\nOperates at DDR4-3600 16-16-16 (1.35V)\n\n\nAMD Graphics\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT (16GB; Adrenalin 21.5.2)\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16GB; Adrenalin 21.5.2)\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 (16GB; Adrenalin 21.5.2)\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT (12GB; Adrenalin 21.5.2)\n\n\nNVIDIA Graphics\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (24GB; GeForce 466.47)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12GB; GeForce 466.54)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10GB; GeForce 466.47)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (8GB; GeForce 466.47)\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (11GB; GeForce 466.47)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11GB; GeForce 466.47)\n\n\nStorage\nGeForce: WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB (SATA 6Gbps)\nRadeon: WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB (SATA 6Gbps)\n\n\nPower Supply\nCorsair RM850x (850W)\n\n\nChassis\nFractal Design Define C Mid-tower\n\n\nCooling\nCorsair iCUE H115i RGB PLATINUM (240mm)\n\n\nEt cetera\nResizable BAR is disabled\nWindows 10 Pro build 19043.1023 (21H1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\nAs tested configuration: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6800\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6800\n\n\n\n\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT\nAs tested configuration: AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of our testing is completed using the latest versions of Windows (10, 21H1), the graphics drivers, and all of the games tested. Because some games update frequently, our goal is to clear through our chosen set of GPUs before any of the tested games manage to drop a new update. If an update does roll out, we quickly sanity check a previous result to make sure performance remains the same.\nHere are some other general guidelines we follow:\n\nDisruptive services are disabled; eg: Search, Cortana, User Account Control, Defender, etc.\nOverlays and / or other extras are not installed with the graphics driver.\nVsync is disabled at the driver level (and in any tested game).\nOSes are never transplanted from one machine to another.\nWe validate system configurations before kicking off any test run.\nTesting doesn\u2019t begin until the PC is idle (keeps a steady minimum wattage).\nAll tests are repeated until there is a high degree of confidence in the results.\n\nThis article includes testing with nine standard (non-RT) games at 4K. We hoped to include ultrawide resolution here, but will instead save that for our RTX 3070 Ti launch article. For the sake of seeing how NVIDIA\u2019s X080 Ti flagship has improved its performance over the years, we\u2019re including the results for the Turing-based 2080 Ti and Pascal-based 1080 Ti.\nAs mentioned earlier, we\u2019re also going to be diving into testing ray traced and DLSS-specific titles in the weeks ahead. We\u2019ll also be posting a creator look at both of these new NVIDIA GPUs next week \u2013 so there\u2019s a lot of gaming and creator goodness in the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands 3\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding\nDeath Stranding\n\n\n\n\nDestiny 2\nDestiny 2\n\n\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nHorizon Zero Dawn\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter: World\nMonster Hunter World\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n\n\n\n\nTotal War Three Kingdoms\nTotal War Three Kingdoms\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion\nWatch Dogs Legion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the full breakdown of our tested games:\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla \u2013 AMD Ryzen partner\nBorderlands 3 \u2013 AMD Radeon partner\nDeath Stranding\nDestiny 2\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nMonster Hunter World\nTom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2 \u2013 AMD Radeon partner\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms\nWatch Dogs Legion \u2013 NVIDIA GeForce partner\n\nNote: You can download all of the tested setting images at once here (ZIP, 9.6MB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla - Configuration (1)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla tested settings\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla - Configuration (2)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla tested settings\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla - Configuration (3)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (1)\nBorderlands 3 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (2)\nBorderlands 3 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nBorderlands 3 - Configuration (3)\nBorderlands 3 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding - Configuration (1)\nDeath Stranding tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding - Configuration (2)\nDeath Stranding tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding - Configuration (3)\nDeath Stranding tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDestiny 2 - Configuration (1)\nDestiny 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nDestiny 2 - Configuration (2)\nDestiny 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn - Configuration (1)\nHorizon Zero Dawn tested settings\n\n\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn - Configuration (2)\nHorizon Zero Dawn tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter World - Configuration (1)\nMonster Hunter: World tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter World - Configuration (2)\nMonster Hunter: World tested settings\n\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter World - Configuration (3)\nMonster Hunter: World tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (1)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (2)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (3)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (4)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (5)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (6)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 - Configuration (7)\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTotal War Three Kingdoms - Configuration (1)\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms tested settings\n\n\n\n\nTotal War Three Kingdoms - Configuration (2)\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (1)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (2)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (3)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion - Configuration (4)\nWatch Dogs Legion tested settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\n\nWe kick off our performance results with Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, a game that gives the performance edge to the red team. Both the RX 6800 XT and 6900 XT outpace the RTX 3090 by a few frames, while the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 could pretty well be considered equals.\nBorderlands 3\n\nWith Borderlands 3, the top cards change up a bit over the previous test. AMD\u2019s RX 6900 XT takes the lead, with both the RTX 3080 Ti and 3090 placing ahead of the 6800 XT. The cards in the top half of the graph would ultimately deliver similar performance, with the bottom half of the graph seeing pretty immediate performance drops.\nDeath Stranding\n\nBoth Radeon and GeForce deliver great performance in Death Stranding at 4K, with the top few cards toppling over each other\u2019s performance numbers. AMD\u2019s 6900 XT manages to get that extra frame or two to step ahead of the 3080 Ti. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that this game supports DLSS, and in our tests on the 3080 Ti, it gives about a 33% FPS improvement when using the Quality setting.\nDestiny 2\n\nDestiny 2 runs great on the top-flight cards, as you\u2019d expect, but as you can see across the entire collection here, the percentile lows exhibit a larger delta to the average than every other game we\u2019ve tested here. The effect is even worse on AMD\u2019s GPUs than NVIDIA\u2019s, which is actually noticeable when doing back-to-back testing.\nOverall, Destiny 2 could really use some optimization to enable a smoother experience overall, but fortunately, it\u2019s not hard to hit a high average FPS at 4K.\nHorizon Zero Dawn\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn gives us our first taste of how a card like the 3080 Ti can leap ahead of AMD\u2019s competition. Both that and the RTX 3090 keep are glued to the top of the chart, with the 3080 Ti delivering a seven FPS gain over the RX 6900 XT. The RTX 3090 proves quickest here, but doesn\u2019t pull that far ahead of the 3080 Ti.\nMonster Hunter: World\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs perform really well in Monster Hunter: World, and that\u2019s proven here with the top three Ampere GPUs leading the pack. It\u2019s notable that this game also offers DLSS support, although we\u2019ve yet to test its impact. Fortunately, most of NVIDIA\u2019s current or recent high-end GPUs will hit 60 FPS pretty easily at 4K. If you\u2019re struggling with it, the game has an almost ridiculous number of graphics settings you can tweak.\nTom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2\n\nThe Division 2 is an AMD-sponsored game, but somehow over time, the performance improved enough with NVIDIA\u2019s drivers to give its cards the edge overall. Both the 3080 Ti and 3090 lead the pack. If you have a high-refresh monitor, you can explore the game\u2019s many graphics options to help you inch closer towards your refresh rate.\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX 3080 Ti goes head-to-head with AMD\u2019s RX 6900 XT in Three Kingdoms, and once again sits just behind the RTX 3090 by a few frames.\nWatch Dogs Legion\n\nWe round out our testing with another game test result that puts the RTX 3080 Ti ahead of the RX 6900 XT, albeit by a pretty insignificant amount. This is another title that uses DLSS, however, which would give NVIDIA an edge on the top end. In a quick test with the 3080 Ti, DLSS Balanced increased the FPS from 74 to 98. Note that this was without ray tracing.\nPower Consumption\nTo take a look at GPUs from a power perspective, we\u2019re using UL\u2019s 3DMark Fire Strike 4K stress test, and the PC plugged into a Kill-A-Watt to monitor full system power draw. The PC is left to sit idle for about five minutes, or at least until the PC is idle, at which point that number is recorded. After five minutes of running the Fire Strike test, the load value is recorded (at the same point in the looping test).\n\nIt\u2019s not too surprising to see the RTX 3080 Ti slot right in between the 3080 and 3090, and that happening means that NVIDIA has three GPUs that use more power than AMD\u2019s top dogs. Considering the TDP difference between the GDDR6-equipped 3070 and GDDR6X-equipped 3070 Ti, we feel like the fast GDDR6X is responsible for this hike, but it of course brings with it improved memory bandwidth.\nFinal Thoughts\nAs has become the norm lately, NVIDIA can\u2019t release a new GPU without it being heavily rumored about for ages leading up to its eventual unveiling. In some ways, it\u2019s satisfying to see a launch finally happen, just so the incessant rumors can come to a stop. Naturally, that never actually happens, since the next leak or rumor is out before you can even hit the publish button.\nAt $1,199 SRP (we wish that meant Scalper-Resistant Pricing), the RTX 3080 Ti carries a $500 premium over the RTX 3080, which is quite the hike, to say the least. Is it worth it? The answer to that question is largely subjective, because the FPS % increase obviously hasn\u2019t matched the price % increase.\n\nIn our eyes, the RTX 3080 is really the sweet spot in NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere lineup. Ignoring the disastrous scalper market for a moment, $699 for that GPU delivers fantastic performance overall. Despite there being an even higher-end GPU, NVIDIA calls the 3080 Ti its new \u201cflagship\u201d, making us believe even more that the RTX 3090 probably should have been a TITAN.\nUltimately, the RTX 3080 is great for those who want to go with a top-level GPU and are fine not splurging on the two even higher-end options that generally offer 10-15% performance boosts. The RTX 3080 Ti is suited for those who want NVIDIA\u2019s current \u201cflagship\u201d \u2013 the card that offers the best Ampere has to offer, without breaking into the territory with GPUs with even more memory (eg: workstation cards). The faster memory bandwidth along with the extra 2GB makes the 3080 Ti a well-rounded top-end creator card.\n\nTo that end, high-end creators will still have lots of reason to pay attention to the RTX 3090, as getting such a massive frame buffer (24GB) on the consumer-level is not going to happen any other way. We suspect most of our readers will be fine with 12GB, and if not, you\u2019re probably already aware of your need for lots of memory.\nNVIDIA has said that availability of the RTX 3080 Ti will begin immediately, and we caught some etailers holding stock ahead of the launch. As the way things go right now, we don\u2019t expect supply will last long, so you have to exercise some patience and exceptional mental fortitude in your forthcoming purchase challenge.\nAs covered earlier, we\u2019ll include ultrawide benchmarks with our look at the RTX 3070 Ti at its launch next week. That will come in conjunction with an updated look at rendering performance in a variety of applications (including, hopefully, the soon-to-launch Blender 2.93).\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport our efforts!

The app displays the photographic result as people paint, so they don\u2019t need to wait to see the form of their vision \u2014 they see it right away.\nNVIDIA Canvas is part of NVIDIA Studio, a program that provides creators with hardware and software tools to assist in realizing their creative visions.\n\n\u00a0\nUsers start by sketching simple shapes and lines with a palette of real-world materials, like grass or clouds. The AI model then immediately fills the screen with show-stopping results. Four quick shapes and a stunning mountain range appears. A few more lines produce a beautiful field.\nDraw in a pond and nearby elements like trees and rocks appear as reflections in the water. Swap a material, changing snow to grass, and the entire image changes from a winter wonderland to a tropical paradise.\nLines and shapes turn into life-like landscapes in seconds.\nThe tool allows artists to use style filters, changing a generated image to adopt the style of a particular painter. NVIDIA Canvas isn\u2019t just stitching together pieces of other images, or cutting and pasting textures, but creating brand new images, just like an artist would.\nArtists looking to take their digital da Vincis to the next level can save their work as a .psd file and import it into Adobe Photoshop to continue refining or combine with other artwork.\nThe creative possibilities are endless. NVIDIA Canvas helps artists rapidly ideate \u2014 a daunting task at the beginning of a project when faced with a blank canvas.\nIt can also bring time savings to a range of creators and designers. Consider an art director on a time crunch who needs to refine the hero product in an ad campaign. A landscape will complete the shot. Using NVIDIA Canvas, the director is only a few clicks from generating several beautifully rendered images. In a matter of moments, the tool provides multiple options for the client to review, saving precious time before finalizing the featured product.\nNVIDIA Canvas has nine styles that modify the look and feel of a painting and 15 different materials, ranging from sky and mountains to river and stone. Paint on different layers to keep elements separate. Start from scratch, or launch and modify one of the app\u2019s premade scenes for a fresh hint of inspiration.\nTurn your doodles into gorgeous landscapes with NVIDIA Canvas.\nThe Art Behind the Canvas\nNVIDIA Canvas uses a form of AI called generative adversarial networks, which consist of a generator and a discriminator.\nThe generator aims at converting material maps into images. The discriminator knows that real ponds and lakes contain reflections \u2014 and tells the generator to create a convincing imitation. To deliver realistic portraits for artists, the GAN has been trained on an NVIDIA DGX system using over 5 million images.\nNVIDIA Canvas gives you 15 different materials to use, powered by AI.\nDownload the Canvas beta, take it for a test drive and give us your feedback on the NVIDIA forums. Inspire others with your works of art by sharing Canvas paintings with the hashtag #StudioShare for a chance to be featured on Studio social channels.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Creators | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Together, they provide the extreme performance to enable industrial HPC innovation.\nAtos, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NetApp are among dozens of partners using the NVIDIA HGX platform for next-generation systems and solutions.\n\u201cThe HPC revolution started in academia and is rapidly extending across a broad range of industries,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cKey dynamics are driving super-exponential, super-Moore\u2019s law advances that have made HPC a useful tool for industries. NVIDIA\u2019s HGX platform gives researchers unparalleled high performance computing acceleration to tackle the toughest problems industries face.\u201d\nIndustry Leaders Use HGX Platform to Power Innovation Breakthroughs\nThe HGX platform is being used by high-tech industrial pioneer General Electric, applying HPC innovation to computational fluid dynamics simulations that guide design innovation in large gas turbines and jet engines. The HGX platform has achieved order-of-magnitude acceleration for breakthrough CFD methods in GE\u2019s GENESIS code, which employs Large Eddy Simulations to study the effects of turbulent flows inside turbines that are composed of hundreds of individual blades and require uniquely complex geometry.\nBesides driving industrial HPC transformation, the HGX platform is also accelerating scientific HPC systems around the world, including the next next-generation supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh, also announced today.\nNVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe Performance Enhancements for AI and HPC\r\nNVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs deliver unprecedented HPC acceleration to solve complex AI, data analytics, model training and simulation challenges relevant to industrial HPC. A100 80GB PCIe GPUs increase GPU memory bandwidth 25 percent compared with the A100 40GB, to 2TB/s, and provide 80GB of HBM2e high-bandwidth memory.\nThe A100 80GB PCIe\u2019s enormous memory capacity and high-memory bandwidth allow more data and larger neural networks to be held in memory, minimizing internode communication and energy consumption. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, it enables researchers to achieve higher throughput and faster results, maximizing the value of their IT investments.\nA100 80GB PCIe is powered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, which features Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology to deliver acceleration for smaller workloads such as AI inference. MIG allows HPC systems to scale compute and memory down with guaranteed quality of service. In addition to PCIe, there are four- and eight-way NVIDIA HGX A100 configurations.\nNVIDIA partner support for the A100 80GB PCIe includes Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, H3C, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo, Penguin Computing, QCT and Supermicro. The HGX platform featuring A100-based GPUs interconnected via NVLink is also available via cloud services from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nNext-Generation NDR 400Gb/s InfiniBand Switch Systems\nHPC systems that require unparalleled data throughout are supercharged by NVIDIA InfiniBand, the world\u2019s only fully offloadable in-network computing interconnect. NDR InfiniBand scales performance to tackle the massive challenges in industrial and scientific HPC systems. The NVIDIA Quantum\u2122-2 fixed-configuration switch systems deliver 64 ports of NDR 400Gb/s InfiniBand per port (or 128 ports of NDR200), providing 3x higher port density versus HDR InfiniBand.\nThe NVIDIA Quantum-2 modular switches provide scalable port configurations up to 2,048 ports of NDR 400Gb/s InfiniBand (or 4,096 ports of NDR200) with a total bidirectional throughput of 1.64 petabits per second \u2014 5x over the previous-generation. The 2,048-port switch provides 6.5x greater scalability over the previous generation, with the ability to connect more than a million nodes with just three hops using a DragonFly+ network topology.\nThe third generation of NVIDIA SHARP In-Network Computing data reduction technology boosts performance for high-performance industrial and scientific applications with 32x higher AI acceleration power compared to the previous generation.\nAdvanced management features include self-healing network capabilities and NVIDIA In-Network Computing acceleration engines. Data center downtime is further minimized with the NVIDIA UFM\u00ae Cyber-AI platform.\nBased on industry standards, the NVIDIA Quantum-2 \u00a0switches \u2014 which are expected to sample in the third quarter \u2014 are backward- and forward-compatible, enabling easy migration and expansion of existing systems and software.\nIndustry-leading infrastructure manufacturers \u2014 including Atos, DDN, Dell Technologies, Excelero, GIGABYTE, HPE, Lenovo, Penguin Computing, QCT, Supermicro, VAST and WekaIO \u2014 plan to integrate the Quantum-2 NDR 400Gb/s InfiniBand switches into their enterprise and HPC offerings. Cloud service providers including Azure are also taking advantage of InfiniBand technology.\nIntroducing Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage \nProviding unrivaled performance for complex workloads, Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage enables direct memory access between GPU memory and storage. The direct path enables applications to benefit from lower I/O latency and use the full bandwidth of the network adapters while decreasing the utilization load on the CPU and managing the impact of increased data consumption.\nIndustry leaders supporting Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage, which is available now, include DDN, Dell Technologies, Excelero, HPE, IBM Storage, Micron, NetApp, Pavilion, ScaleFlux, VAST and WekaIO.

I\u2019ve gotten older and I\u2019m tired.\n\"NVDA in 2022 will be my last release. And there\u2019ll be no more touring or promo.\"\nThe 'Nothing Compares 2 U' hitmaker said the announcement was \"staggeringly beautiful\" news as she feels it is the right time to step away from music.\n\nSinead wrote: \"This is not sad news. It\u2019s staggeringly beautiful news. A warrior knows when he or she should retreat. It\u2019s been a forty year journey. Time to put the feet up and make other dreams come true.\"\n\nThe singer then explained that she had taken the decision on social media to explain that she wanted to make the announcement for herself after being emboldened by the release of her autobiography 'Rememberings'.\n\nSinead added: \"Apologies if any upset caused to booking agents or promoters or managers due to my tweeting about my retirement.\n\n\"I guess the book made me realise I\u2019m my own boss. I didn\u2019t wanna wait for permission from the men, as to when I could announce it (sic).\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sinead recently accused Prince of being a devil worshipper as she noted in her memoir that the irises of the late music icon's eyes disappeared when he guarded the front door of his Hollywood mansion when she was invited after covering his tune 'Nothing Compares 2 U'.\n\nShe told The Times newspaper: \"That is as true as God. I believe he was involved in Devil business because an old girlfriend of his told me he had the power to make s*** move around the room.\n\n\"He got me up there to see: could this b**** be one of mine?

On the back of a spectacular performance by the FAANG stocks, the Nasdaq indices still hold long-term promise for global investors.

O\u2019Connor, 54, rose to fame in the 1980s following the release of her critically acclaimed debut album\u00a0The Lion and the Cobra. With the quick surge in popularity, O\u2019Connor then became an international phenomenon in 1990 when she released the now legendary cover of\u00a0Prince song \u2018Nothing Compares 2 U\u2019.Now though, the life of a touring musician is over for O\u2019Connor. Taking to social media to confirm the news, the musician wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis is to announce my retirement from touring and from working in the record business.\u00a0I\u2019ve gotten older and I\u2019m tired.\u201dAdding: \u201cNVDA in 2022 will be my last release.

Nvidia also takes the opportunity to increase base and boost frequencies by a small amount. The net result is an extra seven per cent shading power adjudged by comparing RTX 3070 Series Founders Editions cards to one another.\nHardly much to get excited about, you would think. Nvidia knows that it can't add to the shader-core count without moving to a larger, more expensive  die so does the next best thing by increasing the performance of the memory subsystem. It's still 8GB running across a 256-bit bus, which feels eminently stingy for a premium GPU in 2021 - but now uses 19Gbps-rated GDDR6X memory instead of 14Gbps GDDR6. The move is an easy one to make as the faster GDDR6X memory is already present in the RTX 3080/Ti GPUs.\nCranking up the frequency realises some impressive on-paper gains. There's 36 per cent more bandwidth that ought to come in useful at higher resolutions and image-quality settings. There's no free lunch, however, as increasing the number of cores and utilising speedier memory cause the overall power consumption to rise significantly. \nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti runs with a 290W TGP, up from 220W - a whopping 32 per cent increase - so it is very likely that Nvidia's partners building these GPUs will use RTX 3080-optimised cooling instead of smaller cards we sometimes  see in the RTX 3070/3060 Ti firmament.\nIn effect, Nvidia is using a brute-force approach to uplift RTX 3070 performance by up to 10 per cent. This move ought to put the new Ti at around rival Radeon RX 6800 levels, albeit with half the graphics memory. We have no qualms about how Nvidia has gone about constructing this specific GPU from a frequency point of view, but we'd have released the RTX 3070 Ti with 16GB of memory, using double-density modules, in the name of futureproofing. The only reason for not doing so rests with power because GDDR6X memory operating at 19Gbps is known to be  power hungy.\nNow we know how it's built, let's take a look at the Founders Edition model before running the benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Jump:\n ========== \n1 - Introduction\n2 - The Founders Edition Card\n3 - Test Methodology\n4 - Futuremark Tests I\n5 - Futuremark Tests II\n6 - Borderlands 3\n7 - Dirt 5\n8 - Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers\n9 - Forza Horizon 4\n10 - Gears Tactics\n11 - Watch Dogs: Legion\n12 - Watch Dogs: Legion DLSS\n13 - Power, Temperature and Noise\n14 - Overclocking\n15 - Overall Performance, Energy Efficiency, Mining\n16 - Conclusion\n\n\n\nNEXT PAGE  \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY HEXUS\n\n\nSign in for the best HEXUS experience\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL EVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDUSTRY PRESS RELEASES\n\n\n\n1\nIntroducing CORSAIR\u00ae DDR5 Memory\n\n\n\n2\nCORSAIR Announces Full Range of Components\n\n\n\n3\nTwo AOC GAMING mice and a wireless headset.\n\n\n\n4\nAGON by AOC presents three displays aimed at competitive gamers \n\n\n\n5\nPhilips monitors launch the new M3000 and M5000 PC gaming monitor series\n\n\n\n6\nASUSTOR is authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMATION\n\nAbout us \nAdvertise \nContact us \nHow Competitions work \nHow we test \nAbout Cookies \nWhat our awards mean \nTerms of use\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nRSS / Alerts / Twitter \nFacebook / Newsletter \nUnsubscribe \n\n\n\nHEXUS Community\n\n\nMembers: 4\nForum posts: 353,396\nForum threads: 39,617\nCurrently active users: 99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

Photo of John Soh: Bloomberg John Soh\u2019s evidence on not giving instructions on trades was challenged once again on June 1, the fourth day of the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Teo Guan Siew showed the court several instances where Soh \u2013 the alleged mastermind of the saga \u2013 had seemingly giving instructions to Adeline Cheng Jo-Ee for trades to be made in the account of Neo Kim Hock.  One of Soh\u2019s close associates, Neo was formerly the executive chairman of Blumont while Cheng, who runs her own firm Alethia Asset Management, has been described as Soh\u2019s \u201con again and off again girlfriend,\u201d during the trial. Soh and his co-accused and other romantic partner Quah Su-Ling are on trial for allegedly orchestrating Singapore\u2019s largest share manipulation scheme between 2012 and 2013 involving three stocks: Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital (now Attilan Group) and LionGold, which has since become Shen Yao Holdings. The eventual collapse of these counters \u2013 collectively referred to as BAL \u2013 in October 2013 wiped out some $8 billion in market value. A boss? In one instance, Cheng told Soh that 1.4 million LionGold shares have been bought at $1.055 under Neptune\u2019s account with Credit Suisse. The account had been managed by Neo. \u201cI will say she kept me \u2013 informed of [the trade] being done, yes,\u201d Soh responded when pressed if Cheng had been informing him. He went on to say that he is \u201cworried about the word \u2018reporting\u2019\u201d and agreed that Cheng had informed him of the trade.  In another instance on 10 Oct 2012, Cheng told Soh that she\u2019s on \u201cstandby\u201d soon after she\u2019s asked to \u201ctake 100 at 1.07\u201d. According to Soh, Neo would have already decided on the portfolio construction with Credit Suisse and Cheng. As such Soh\u2019s role was only to assist Neo in \u201ctrying to accumulate at better prices\u201d. Soh added that the objective for most people who are committed to a portfolio is to try and collect and accumulate shares at better prices without running the risk of being \u201cfront-run by opportunistic private bankers\u201d. Front running occurs when a broker trades a stock while knowing of a future transaction that could possibly affect its price substantially. These circumstances pushed Neo to tell Cheng, \u201cokay do your coordination. If John is free, get him to advise you,\u201d Soh explained, adding that he would do his part by giving his inputs. Even so, he stressed that Neo was the one to make the final decision. \u201cI\u2019m the one that guides them,\u201d he notes, referring to Cheng and Neo. With some of the trades put in by Cheng being just two minutes after her correspondence with Soh, DPP Teo asked how Neo could have given his nod of approval.   Story continues To this Soh said Neo might have given Cheng a certain latitude in terms of price and volume. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I would know for sure that decisions had been made and it\u2019s an accumulation exercise,\u201d he added.Soh\u2019s advice-giving also extended to trades made under Alethia Elite which was Cheng\u2019s family account that went on to become a temporary account arrangement of sorts for Billy Ooi, another known associate of Soh.The arrangement happened when Cheng offered the account to function as a warehouse account for around two to three weeks, before the trades were put into Alethia Elite.On one occasion, Cheng is seen asking Soh if there are any last orders to be made in this account at around 5pm.\u201cNo, darling, stand down, relax,\u201d Soh replied.\u201cIt appears to be you making the decision,\u201d DPP Teo puts forth.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a grand scheme of things,\u201d Soh says, adding that Cheng had been asked to look towards him for guidance on how to trade.In this case, he noted that \u201cnobody in their right sense\u201d would want to collect shares around 10 minutes before the market closes, as it will \u201creally drive the price down\u201d.In another instance, Soh is seen telling Cheng, \u201cowe you one darling\u201d.The context of this, Soh claimed, was that Cheng had offered to warehouse 500 shares to placate Neo after Credit Suisse threatened to close his account and dump his shares.\u201cMr Neo was after her and was on the warpath. Everybody felt it [so] it is good to have some peace,\u201d he says in explanation for his text.DPP Teo put across that the shares were meant for Soh and that\u2019s why he told Cheng he owes her one.Soh disagreed.Soh also told that court that Cheng had sent several messages \u201cpestering\u201d him and saying things to the tune of \u201cI am your girlfriend, why you never take care of me,\u201d.At that time, Cheng was looking to build a name for herself and was working towards getting her brokerage license.This also made her \u201cparanoid of being competed against\u201d by other traders like William Chan, Soh said.\u201cOther than my fixation with her, everyone was very much pilloried with her,\u201d he added.In spite of being appeased by Cheng\u2019s 500 shares in warehouse offer, Neo and Cheng were not on the best of terms with the latter fearing he would speak to the bank.Cheng was also constantly bugging several of Soh\u2019s associates like his brother and Peter Chen Hing Woon in hopes of getting more business.In this time, Cheng is seen telling Soh, \u201cin the long run, you will need to hedge your dependence on her and her nominees\u201d, in reference to Quah whom she viewed as her romantic rival.\u201cI will my darling,\u201d Soh replied.The context of this, the court heard was that Cheng wanted him to cut off all ties with Quah.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say that without feeling all funny all over \u2013 she was working with me to conceal more things with Su-Ling, and she was getting more ambitious on the relationship,\u201d he elaborated.By saying, \u201cI will\u201d, Soh hoped to buy time.\u201cI disagree,\u201d he responded when pressed by DPP Teo on whether Quah was bringing her nominees and contacts into the pool of accounts that the both of them supposedly controlled.The trial resumes on June 2 with DPP Teo continuing with his cross examination of Soh.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Soh claims his presence was a \"catalyst\" to get investments; admits to weakness for sob stories There is a difference between confirming and reporting instructions, says Soh Soh kept co-accused Quah away from share promotion activities Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

While you might not have heard of KYEC before, according to Nikkei Asia it is \"the world's leading chip testing service provider and a key supplier to Nvidia, Intel, MediaTek and many other top global chip developers\".\n\nOn Sunday, the firm was ordered to stop foreign labour from coming to work, allowing them to begin quarantine for at least 7 days with full pay. It seems like the virus has spread particularly speedily through the immigrant labourers as they often share accommodation or dormitories while working in Taiwan. About 30 per cent of KYEC workers are foreign, but within this group the virus spread is much more prevalent \u2013 158 (foreign) to 24 (Taiwanese) on Sunday, for example.\nWhile the situation is still hot, contract tracing activity has been intense by Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) and the body has ordered KYEC to take five measures to reign in the virus spread. Meanwhile, KYEC operations might be allowed to partially resume under a site-specific Covid-19 prevention program once on-site inspections have been completed by the CECC, the Industrial Development Bureau, the company, and others.\nAs many readers will be aware, disruptions in the supply chain like this are perhaps inevitable during a global pandemic, but Taiwan had done very well to avoid any Covid ingress into its population until very recently. Now it is dealing with three significant clusters in the capital city, the neighbouring New Taipei City, and at these semiconductor facilities in Miaoli county. Total detected cases per day in Taiwan peaked at about 500 this weekend, but have been under 220 for the last two days.\n\nKYEC's typical monthly operations\nThe latest info from KYEC indicates that June production figures will be down by about 30 to 35 per cent, as more workers have been found to be infected and quarantined.\nOther companies that have seen related clusters emerge in recent hours are; chip packaging and testing supplier Greatek Electronics, and networking gear provider Accton Technology (both situated near KYEC). Hopefully, the action of the government and authorities, with the compliance of industry and the people, can make this a storm in a teacup as far as semiconductor production is concerned.\nOther sources: Taipei Times, analyst Dan Nystedt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nTSMC announces N4P process as value N3 alternative for 2023\n\n                    Fifth process to be developed from original N5 promises 6 per cent perf uplift over N4. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

SATS, on June 8, has entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement (SPA) to acquire an 85%-stake in Thailand\u2019s Food City Company for a consideration of 484.5 million baht ($21 million).  The agreement was signed by SATS\u2019s indirect subsidiary, SATS (Thailand) Co. Food City\u2019s current owner, Thai-listed Bangkok Ranch PLC, will retain the remaining 15%. Under the agreement, Food City will fully settle all outstanding intragroup trade payables and intragroup trade receivables owed to or owing from Bangkok Ranch and its subsidiaries calculated as at Dec 31, 2020. Outstanding amounts incurred after said date will be settled \u201cin the normal course of business and credit terms\u201d. Food City is expected to execute the transitional services under the transitional service agreement with Bangkok Ranch after the completion of the acquisition. Bangkok Ranch will execute a call option agreement with SATS, which gives the latter the option to acquire the remaining 15% stake it does not own in Food City. Following the acquisition, SATS (Thailand) will own 7.85 million shares in Food City, representing an 84.97% stake. Bangkok Ranch will own 1.39 million shares, or 15% in Food City, while SATS Investment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SATS, will own 2,400 shares, or 0.026% in Food City.  Food City\u2019s main asset is the Pathumthani food production facility, which covers a land area of 30,000 sqm. The facility benefits from the well-established food ecosystem in Thailand. Following the acquisition, the facility will be configured to produce 90,000 ready-to-eat meals per day. Based on Food City\u2019s management accounts as at April 30, the company\u2019s book value and net tangible asset value stands at around 521.5 million baht and 521.5 million baht respectively. SATS says it has been investing in large-scale kitchens and food technologies to increase productivity and reduce wastage.

The new Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan is being launched as a limited edition product of 100 units with an MSRP of US$4,999.\n\nThe sticker price is quite a shock even in the current market but Colorful boats that this Kudan graphics card delivers all the brand's \"most advanced premium features,\" to deliver \"extreme performance\". Considering the appearance of this product first, the design uses black and grey colours for the bulk of its \"precision CNC machined aluminium alloy shroud and backplate\". Looking closer, you will see \"intricate patterns along with the iconic Golden Gears and gold accents to complete its luxurious look \u2013 styling that's fitting for a king\". In addition to the passive bling, the Kudan sports a 90 degree flip LCD display (for monitoring or frills), and vibrant RGB lighting effects on both graphics card shroud and radiator.\n\nColorful's new graphics card has what you might call a comprehensive cooling solution. On the PCIe slot side of the equation we have what looks like enough to be a traditional air cooled graphics card - featuring a trio of newly developed 'Storm Chaser' 90mm fans, a heatsink assembly, plus six 6mm high-performance heat pipes.\nAs well as the air cooling hardware, the Kudan has a liquid cooling system with a nine-stage water block and a high-performance 240mm radiator. Colorful says that the water block and integrated heat sink \"use the Breathe-Gill Technology used in the Neptune Series graphics cards\". It then explains that this tech uses \"a much denser water lane structure,\" for improved cooling performance. Quality Swiss-made quick release fully-rotatable water cooling fittings from St\u00e4ubli are provided to complete the product.\n\nHEXUS has reviewed three Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 graphics cards previously, all with fairly traditional triple fan shrouds. The fastest card we tested, from MSI, which apparently costs \u00a32,159 from Scan, was the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Gaming X Trio which boasts a GPU boost clock of 1,785MHz is eclipsed by the Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Kudan in 'Turbo mode' which boost up to 1,860MHz out of the box. Full specs of the new Colorful Kudan can be spied below.\n\nAs this is a limited edition, with a hefty premium price, it is good to see Colorful at least add some trinkets into the package to warm the hearts of those extracting $5k from their wallets. In addition to a \"luxurious and durable suitcase,\" buyers get exclusive Kudan accessories including a Kudan screwdriver, Kudan keycaps, and a Kudan graphics card holder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 4 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The NVIDIA AI Launchpad service will be available as an on-demand service with hourly billing. \nRich MillerNVIDIA-DGX-SuperPOD      Would you like some AI with your hybrid cloud? Perhaps with a side helping of edge computing?As enterprise customers wrestle with new computing architectures, NVIDIA wants to make it easier to access its powerful artificial intelligence hardware across their infrastructure. Today NVIDIA is rolling out services that integrate its AI technology into hybrid cloud deployments, including a new software service for managing on-demand AI workloads across a distributed\u00a0 edge network.The first data center partner for the NVIDIA AI Launchpad service will be Equinix, the largest player in colocation and interconnection. Starting later this year, customers will be able to rent AI servers at Equinix on several types of NVIDIA-certified hardware, including AI infrastructure as a service (IaaS) hybrid clouds using bare metal servers. The AI Launchpad service will be available as an on-demand service with hourly billing, and the option to reserve servers for longer term usage.\u201cNVIDIA AI LaunchPad puts AI at the fingertips of enterprises everywhere with fully automated, hybrid-cloud infrastructure and software for every stage of the AI lifecycle,\u201d said Manuvir Das, head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA.Enterprise users are eager to use AI to enhance their products, services and IT operations. But AI requires powerful hardware and large datasets, and organizations must sort out the best way to deploy these capabilities across infrastructures that may include on-premises data centers, public cloud platforms and cloud workloads.NVIDIA has worked closely with the data center industry to support its high-density compute hardware. With 220 data centers, Equinix offers a large global footprint for AI Launchpad.Hybrid Cloud as an AI PlatformNVIDIA executives said the AI infrastructure at Equinix will enable customer to deploy in minutes to provide enterprises with access to a wide spectrum of NVIDIA resources that support virtually every aspect of AI, from data center training and inference to full-scale deployment at the edge.That will include NVIDIA Fleet Command, a managed platform to deploy edge AI services across a distributed network. Fleet Command is remote management software that lets users install and manage software from a central location.\u201cThe ability to deploy and manage AI applications at the edge is one of the most complex problems facing businesses as they move toward an Internet of Things era, including smart factories, intelligent retail and smart cities,\u201d said Das. \u201cNVIDIA Fleet Command drives efficiency across a business, helping scale edge AI with unprecedented speed.\u201dEquinix is the world\u2019s leading provider of colocation, with a focus on interconnections that move data traffic across network boundaries. This formula has allowed the company to create a digital infrastructure empire, with a presence in more than 50 markets across the globe.\u201cMany industries use private clouds to keep costs down by having computing resources close to the data, for performance, data privacy, ownership and sovereignty reasons,\u201d said Steve Steienhilber, vice president, Business Development at Equinix. \u201cWith NVIDIA AI LaunchPad globally available at Equinix, enterprises will have immediate access to NVIDIA software and NVIDIA-Certified infrastructure in a comprehensive hybrid-cloud solution.\u201dNVIDIA: We Want to Democratize AINVIDIA\u2019s GPU technology has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rise of specialized computing, gaining traction with workloads in supercomputing, artificial intelligence (AI) and connected cars. NVIDIA has been investing heavily in innovation in AI, which it sees as a pervasive technology trend that will bring its GPU technology into every area of the economy and society.This week\u2019s service offerings are part of NVIDIA\u2019s push to make its technology available to a broader set of customers, including those who may not have massive budgets or data center infrastructures that can support high-density deployments.\u201cAI is the superpower, that\u2019s going to be part of everybody\u2019s life,\u201d said Justin Boitano, the VP/GM for Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cIt\u2019s time to democratize AI across every industry, by bringing its transformational power to every company, and every company\u2019s customers.\u201cThe most common question we get in a supply-constrained world is \u2018how do I get access to infrastructure to get started right away,\u2019 \u201d said Boitano. \u201cWe want to provide that infrastructure with providers like Equinix. This program makes it easier for enterprises to get access to AI infrastructure in a cloud-like consumption model.\u201dNVIDIA works with about 20 data center operators through the DGX Ready program, which certifies providers that can support deployments of its DGX \u2018supercomputer in a box.\u201d Not every data center can support these densities, especially on-premises facilities which were likely designed and built in an era of much lower rack power densities.DGX SuperPods, then Edge Servers to FollowThe first phase of the NVIDIA AI Launchpad Partnership with Equinix will focus on the DGX platform. Equinix will be the first colocation provider with an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD offered for rental with Base Command, the NVIDIA platform for managing AI development. The SuperPOD combines multiple DGX A100 systems, which take up 6 rack units.Access to the DGX SuperPOD is expected to be available by the end of summer, and NVIDIA has previously said that pricing for the Base Command Platform with DGX SuperPOD service starts at $90,000/month. The companies have not outlined the full specs for the SuperPOD deployment at Equinix.In the next phase, customers will have on-demand access to AI capabilities on bare metal deployments of NVIDIA-certified servers from Dell Technologies and Lenovo. These servers are part of the NVIDIA EGX Edge AI platform, which is designed to offer distributed computing horsepower for hospitals, stores, farms and factories that must manage growing amounts of data streaming from edge sensors. The platform makes it possible to securely deploy, manage and update fleets of servers remotely.Users will be able to add NVIDIA Base Command or Fleet Command services to these servers, providing options for either development or production workloads. \u201cThey can on-board our services, and we\u2019re working to make it as seamless and unified as possible,\u201d said NVIDIA\u2019s Boitano. \u201cEven if it\u2019s delivered at Equinix, it feels like one common consumption model.\u201dThe most powerful opportunity will be to deploy AI servers across edge locations. NVIDIA says it is working with Equinix on the timing and locations where AI Launchpad\u00a0 will be available as an edge service. Pricing for additional NVIDIA services will be available as each reaches general availability at Equinix.

As we said at the time, this update could make a big difference to Rainbow Six Siege players, especially those wishing to use higher-res monitors at their native resolutions.\nCoincidentally, Rainbow Six Siege became the first game to benefit from the latest update of Nvidia DLSS, version 2.2. With such an introduction, it isn't really possible to see the benefits of moving from an earlier version of DLSS to this latest DLSS 2.2. However, some enterprising folk have replaced a file in their Cyberpunk 2077 installation with a DLSS 'database' file from Rainbow Six Siege and are very pleased with the results.\n\nA simple file swap is \"enough to update the open-world game's implementation of DLSS to 2.2,\" reports PCGamesN. \"And the result is better framerate, crisper visuals, and the elimination of the 'ghosting' artefacts frequently seen around small objects and lights while using DLSS.\"\nThe site read about this 'mod' via Nexus Mods, where the file can be downloaded (please proceed with caution, and back up files, so you can roll back). In its own tests, PCGamesN said that the change in performance was easily noticeable. \"An encounter scene in downtown Night City that had produced framerates of about 28 FPS improved to about 36-40 FPS with the replacement file, using the \u2018balanced\u2019 DLSS setting at a 1440p output resolution,\" it claimed.\n\nOther Nvidia DLSS news\nIn addition to the above, the Nvidia GeForce blog is bursting with news ahead of the official launch of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology, later today. On Monday the GeForce blog talked about DLSS coming to Rust, DOOM Eternal, LEGO Builder\u2019s Journey and more this month. Perhaps even bigger news was that the DLSS plugin launched for Unreal Engine 5 last Thursday, and it is coming to Unity 2021.2 shortly. Other engines with support for DLSS include Frostbite, idTech 5, CryEngine, and RedEngine.\n\nLast but not least, DLSS is on the way to Linux gamers in titles using Proton and the Vulkan API. That Linux support starts today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 2 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Four-time grand slam tennis champion Naomi Osaka\u2019s announcement that she wouldn\u2019t be going to the post-match press conference following her first-round victory in the French Open just shows that experiencing burnout is not exclusive to any sector of society.  Osaka said on Twitter that answering questions from the media after a harrowing match could harm her mental health. The world\u2019s top-two women\u2019s tennis player has been open about her mental health struggles. She admitted on Twitter that since the US Open in 2018, she\u2019s been \u201csuffering long bouts of depression.\u201d   French Open organisers reacted to Osaka\u2019s press pull-out by fining her USD15,000. Days later, Osaka dropped out of the French Open altogether.  Despite all four Grand Slam tournaments threatening her with further penalties because of this, more people flocked to Osaka\u2019s side. For one, mindfulness app Calm offered to pay Osaka\u2019s fine. Additionally, the Japan Tennis Association, world-class athletes, along with numerous sponsors, propped up Osaka, who is Japanese, with their support. Companies such as Nike, Nissin Foods, Nippon Airways, Nissan, TAG Heuer, and Mastercard praised Osaka\u2019s honesty about her mental health, and pledged their continued collaboration with her.  Indeed, the world has come far with regards to how it prioritises mental health.  Osaka\u2019s decision could be described by health professionals as burnout\u2014the consequence of severe mental, emotional, and physical stress. This can happen in any setting, to anyone.  The good news, however, is that everyone shares the ability to avoid this devastating effect of stress.   The corporate workplace has its share of stress inducers, unfortunately, and, more recently, the work-from-home setup has only compounded that issue. In a survey of 1,407 respondents conducted by the National University Health System\u2019s Mind Science Centre, 61% of those based at home said they are stressed compared to 53% of frontliners.  Are you one of them? You could avoid it by managing the work stress well before it builds up into a burnout.  Here are four tips on how to slam the stress out of bounds: Find healthy ways to respond to work stress Too often, office workers tend to fall back on alcohol or binge eating when they try to deal with stress. Unfortunately, this only adds to the strain. Instead, when tension at work rises, choose coping strategies that are good for you.  Exercise is always helpful. When you work out or engage in any physical activity, you encourage the release of endorphins, dopamine, and adrenaline, which are hormones and neurotransmitters that deal with the mood centers of the brain. You end up feeling happier and more confident. Other alternatives are yoga and meditation which have been proven to calm and relax the senses.    Story continues You could also catch up with friends (even virtually), eat a leisurely dinner with your family, or take a rest from social media. Even 20 minutes a day spent on these relaxing activities can help you a great deal in coping. Communicate your needsBefore issues come to a head at work, talk to your superior. Let them know about the problems you are having at work. Remember not to enumerate your complaints. Rather, clarify what is expected of you. If you have needs at work that are not being met, bring them up. Discuss with your supervisor a plan to control your stressors, as well as your work motivators. Perhaps they could recommend some resources you could use? Do you need your tasks to be more meaningful? More often than not, you will discover that managers appreciate these one-on-one talks with their employees. Say noLike Naomi Osaka, establishing boundaries could be the best thing you could do for your mental health. Begin with something simple: stop checking your mail after you leave the office. Instead, list down all the tasks you need to follow up on before turning in for the week. This way, you won\u2019t leave work hanging and you have closure to really keep your weekends free for hobbies and relaxation. If you keep working even when you should not be, people may start expecting you to do this all the time. And when you are in the midst of all that work, it will be complicated to stop. This is especially true if you are a mother working from home. So before you get smothered by unlimited demands on your time, practice saying no. Start today. Practice time managementOften, we get stressed out when there is just so much work to do. Sometimes, this cannot be helped. Other times, though, it may just boil down to poor time management skills. This is why it is important to prioritise the urgent tasks on your to-do list. Then schedule your day so that you have enough time for each project. Try focusing on one assignment at a time. Divided attention means you may end the day with all your tasks just half-done. Be flexible enough, though, to not get derailed by anything unexpected that happens. Avoiding burnout from work takes commitment to a healthy lifestyle. Once you understand how your mental health affects your overall well-being, it will be easier to stick to healthier habits.

I\u2019ve gotten older and I\u2019m tired. So it\u2019s time for me to hang up my nipple tassels, having truly given my all. NVDA in 2022 will be my last release. And there\u2019ll be no more touring or promo,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nReplying to a fan who inquired about her upcoming concert dates, O\u2019Connor clarified: \u201cYes, all shows which were originally set for 2020, rescheduled to 2021 and then to 2022 are going to be pulled. Because this soldier woman has grown old quicker than covid.\u201d\nIn a follow-up tweet, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not sad news. It\u2019s staggeringly beautiful news. A wise warrior knows when he or she should retreat: #MeTime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a forty year journey,\u201d said O\u2019Connor, who\u2019s released 10 full-length studio albums over the years. \u201cTime to put the feet up and make other dreams come true.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, O\u2019Connor returned to Twitter to say she was sorry to anyone on her team who might have been taken aback by her sudden announcement.\n\u201cApologies if any upset caused to booking agents or promoters or managers due to my tweeting about my retirement,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI guess the book made me realise I\u2019m my own boss. I didn\u2019t wanna wait for permission from the men, as to when I could announce it. Also, I\u2019d had a few whiskeys.\u201d\nO\u2019Connor just released a memoir titled Rememberings. The book, which delves into her upbringing, her journey in music and her struggles with illness, was first announced in December, soon after the singer had said she was entering a year-long treatment program for trauma and addiction. At the time, she told fans that she planned to return with both a new album and tour in 2022.\n\n\u201cI grew up with a lot of trauma and abuse. I then went straight into the music business. And never learned really how to make a normal life. Never took proper time to heal. Wasn\u2019t ready to either,\u201d she wrote on Twitter in November.\nhttps://twitter.com/MagdaDavitt77/status/1400912214874329093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1400912214874329093%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Farticles%2Fnews%2F9583210%2Fsinead-oconnor-retirement%2F\nThis

Limited to only 680 units, the vehicle is available in two trims: Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance.The former sports black paintwork with red and silver accents, while the latter gets a white hue coupled with red-yellow lines and the Rebel Alliance's logo.Here are more details.  Design: The scooter has a digital instrument console  Yamaha NMAX 160 ABS Star Wars edition has an eye-catching look, featuring a headlight-mounted front apron flanked by turn indicators, a raised windscreen, high-set handlebars, a stepped-up single-piece seat with a pillion grab rail, and an upswept exhaust. The scooter has a digital instrument console, an LED headlight, and rides on designer blacked-out wheels. A 25-liter storage compartment is also available.  Fact: It is fueled by a 15hp, 155cc engine  The Yamaha NMAX 160 ABS Star Wars edition draws power from a 155cc, SOHC, 4-stroke, liquid-cooled engine linked to a CVT gearbox. The mill generates a maximum power of 15.4hp at 8,000rpm and a peak torque of 13.7Nm at 6,500rpm.  Safety: There are disc brakes on both the wheels  In terms of safety equipment, the Yamaha NMAX 160 ABS Star Wars edition is equipped with disc brakes on both the front and rear wheels, along with dual-channel ABS for better handling on the roads. Suspension duties on the maxi-style scooter are taken care of by telescopic forks on the front side and a shock absorber on the rear end.  Fact: Yamaha NMAX 160 ABS Star Wars edition: Pricing and availability  In Brazil, the Yamaha NMAX 160 ABS Star Wars edition carries a price-tag of BRL 12,998 (around Rs. 1.92 lakh). However, the mean-looking maxi-style scooter is unlikely to make its way to India.  The news article, Yamaha NMAX 160 launched in a limited-run Star Wars avatar appeared first on NewsBytes.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

This $2,332 laptop in silky dark side of the moon finish has some attractive specs like its AMD Ryzen R9 5900HX CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 laptop GPU, 32GB DDR4 and 1TB PCIe SSD as standard. However, some review sites, Redditors, and YouTubers who got their hands on the device at launch, noticed something curious \u2013 tools like GPU-Z showed that the laptop's GPU had been short-changed.\n\nNvidia's Ampere laptop GPUs are already something the general public need to be wary of. The GeForce RTX 30X0 Laptop GPUs are quite different to their desktop counterparts in specification. Then, they put in laptops and configured with a wide range of GPU power limits and boost clock maximums (depending on whether you have a regular or slim gaming laptop design and the resulting thermals, for example). Now it looks like systems makers have just decided to start deactivating CUDA cores, TMUs, and RT cores \u2013 without mentioning it in the specs / product pages.\n\nYouTuber Jarrod'sTech noticed that out of the seven or so RTX 3070 laptops he had tested, the new AMD-equipped Alienware m15 R5 appeared to be dragging its heels in his modern AAA gaming tests. Looking at GPU-Z it appeared that the GPU was 10 per cent deactivated, meaning its CUDA cores had been reduced from 5,120 to 4,608. Moreover, the TMU count has been reduced from 160 to 144, and the RT cores cut from 40 to 36. On the other hand, it is interesting to see the GA104-based GPU has 96 ROPs reported \u2013 significantly more than the 90 expected and the max for this GPU, putting it on a par with the desktop RTX 3070 in this respect.\n\nDell responded to Jarrod's queries about the alien anomaly by saying that OEMs were allowed to tweak CUDA core counts by Nvidia in the name of \"performance tuning\". It went on to say that the experience users were getting had been deemed \"the most stable and best performance possible,\" though it left the door open to unlocking further CUDA cores at a later date via BIOS updates.\n\nA somewhat different response on the same issue was sent from Dell to Hot Hardware. To this query, Dell said that there was an \"incorrect setting\" in the vBIOS. \"This is an error that we are working diligently to correct as soon as possible. We're expediting a resolution through validation and expect to have this resolved as early as mid-June\". Though I have read about various users fiddling with the vBIOS to grab back performance, doing so is not officially recommended \u2013 it sounds safer to have a bit of patience with regard to your current sub-optimal performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 7 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends.Update June 3rd, 3:23PM ET: All initial stock of the RTX 3080 Ti, including Best Buy\u2019s in-store stock, appears to be sold out. Newegg\u2019s lottery-like Shuffle has also ended; if selected, you\u2019ll be notified between 5PM and 9PM ET.The Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti is here, at least for those lucky enough to find one. Announced earlier this week alongside the forthcoming RTX 3070 Ti, the 3080 Ti serves as the pricier successor to the GeForce RTX 3080, an excellent graphics card that made 4K gaming that much more affordable and exemplified just how transformative DLSS technology could be.Like the RTX 3090, Nvidia\u2019s newest flagship touts impressive 1440p and 4K performance, albeit in a smaller, quieter package with half the VRAM. It certainly isn\u2019t cheap at $1,200, but given the ongoing semiconductor shortage and the outlandish street prices of most GPUs right now, the RTX 3080 Ti might be more affordable at MSRP than if you were to succumb to the resale market.While we expect availability to be limited at launch and throughout the remainder of the year, several retailers currently have the RTX 3080 Ti in stock. Best Buy announced yesterday that it would give customers a chance to purchase a Founder\u2019s Edition of the card at select stores today, however, unlike previous years, Best Buy will only offer the GPU in-store. Customers who are hoping to pick it up at launch will need to line up early and secure a ticket at 7:30AM local time before it officially goes on sale at 9:00AM local time. If you\u2019re reading this now, chances are good that you\u2019re already too late.RelatedNvidia is nerfing new RTX 3080 and 3070 cards for Ethereum cryptocurrency miningHeading to your local Micro Center might be your only other viable option, if you\u2019re hoping to get one in-store. That retailer lists five RTX 3080 Ti models on its site from Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, and MSI. If you\u2019re looking to purchase the RTX 3080 Ti online, your options are limited. The cards will go on sale at B&H Photo, Newegg, Micro Center, and Amazon, however, we expect stock to sell out fast. You might have luck getting one online through MSI, PNY, Zotac, or EVGA\u2019s site.Here are some of the specific models available at the online retailers above (we\u2019ll add more individual listings as they go live at other sites):Gigabyte RTX 3080 Ti Gaming OC GPU$0$0 at B&H PhotoGigabyte RTX 3080 Ti Eagle OC GPU$0$0 at B&H PhotoASUS TUF RTX 3080 Ti$1200$1200$1200 at NeweggEVGA RTX 3080 Ti FTW3 Ultra Gaming$1130$143021% off$1130EVGA\u2019s RTX 3080 Ti FTW3 PCIe 4.0 video card has 12GB of GDDR6X video memory, support for ray tracing and DLSSS AI scaling, and a bright strip of RGB lighting across its metal housing and three-fan array.Read More$1130 at AntonlineNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founder\u2019s Edition$1200$1200Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 Ti is expensive, but it offers sterling 4K performance, impressive DLSS, and quiet operation, something not found on all 30-series cards.Read More$1200 at NvidiaIf these options fail you, try your luck in the Newegg Shuffle lottery, which begins today at 9AM ET:Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we\u2019ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

As part of a major Spark initiative to better unify deep learning and data processing on Spark, GPUs are now a schedulable resource in Apache Spark 3.0.\u00a0\nWhen combined with the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark, Spark can now accelerate SQL and DataFrame data processing on GPUs without code changes.\u00a0\nThe combination of Deep Java Library, Apache Spark 3.x, and NVIDIA GPU computing, simplifies end to end GPU accelerated big data processing pipelines, DL training and inference.\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\nMany large enterprises and AWS customers are interested in adopting deep learning with business use cases ranging from customer service (including object detection from images and video streams, sentiment analysis) to fraud detection and collaboration. However, until recently, there were multiple difficulties with implementing deep learning in enterprise applications:\n\nThe adoption learning curve was steep and required development of internal technical expertise in new programming languages (e.g., Python) and frameworks.\nDeep Learning training and Inference is compute intensive and typically performed on GPUs, while large-scale data engineering was typically programmed in Scala on multi-CPU distributed Apache Spark.\n\nIn this tutorial we share how the combination of Deep Java Learning, Apache Spark 3.x, and NVIDIA GPU computing simplifies deep learning pipelines while improving performance and reducing costs.\u00a0 In this post, you learn about the following:\n\nDeep learning use cases with Apache Spark\nSpeeding up end-to-end ETL, ML, DL pipelines with Apache Spark and NVIDIA GPU computing\nDeepJavaLibrary (DJL), a Deep Learning framework implemented in Java, which aims to make popular open source deep-learning frameworks accessible to Java/Scala developers\nCreating a cluster of GPU machines and using Apache Spark with DJL on Amazon EMR to leverage large-scale image classification in Scala.\n\nDeep Learning on Apache Spark\nData processing and deep learning are often split into two pipelines, one for ETL processing, and one for model training. Enabling deep learning frameworks to integrate with ETL jobs allows for more streamlined ETL/DL pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\n\n\nApache Spark has emerged as the standard framework for large-scale, distributed, data analytics processing. Apache Spark's popularity comes from the ease-of-use APIs and high-performance big data processing. Spark is integrated with high-level operators and libraries for SQL, stream processing, machine learning (ML), and graph processing.\nMany developers are looking for an efficient and easy way\u00a0 to integrate their deep learning (DL) applications with Spark. However, there is no official support for DL in Spark. There are libraries that try to solve this problem such as TensorFlowOnSpark, Elephas, and CERN, but most of them are engine-dependent. Also most of the Deep Learning Frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Apache MXNet\u2026) do not have good support for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which Spark runs on.\nDeep Learning use cases with Apache Spark\nIn this section, we\u2019ll walk through several DL use cases for different industries using Scala.\nFinancial Institutions\n\nMachine learning and deep learning have many applications in the financial industry. J.P. Morgan summarized six initiatives for their machine learning applications: Anomaly Detection, Intelligent Pricing, News Analytics, Quantitative Client Intelligence, Smart Documents, Virtual Assistants. This indicates deep learning has its position in many business areas in financial institutions. A good example for this point comes from Monzo bank, a fast-growing UK-based \u201cchallenger bank\u201d, which reached its 3 million customers in 2019. They successfully automated 30% to 50% of the potential user\u2019s enquiries by applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on their users\u2019 sequential event data.\nCustomer experience is an important topic for most financial institutions. Another example of applying deep learning to improve customer experience is Mastercard, a first-tier global payment solution company.\u00a0 Mastercard successfully built a deep learning-based customer propensity recommendation system with Apache Spark and their credit card transaction data. Such a recommender can provide better and more suitable goods and services to their customers, potentially benefiting the customer, the merchants and Mastercard. Before this project, Mastercard built a Spark ML recommendation pipeline with traditional machine learning methods (i.e. matrix factorization with Alternating Least Square, or ALS) on their data consisting of\u00a0 over 1.4 billion transactions. In order to determine if new deep learning methods could\u00a0 improve the performance of their existing recommender system, they benchmarked 2 deep learning methods: \u201cNeural Collaborative Filtering\u201d and \u201cWide and Deep Model\u201c. Both achieved a significant\u00a0 improvement compared to the traditional ALS implementation.\nFinancial systems require very high fault-tolerance and security levels. Java was widely used in these companies to achieve better stability. Since Financial systems also face the challenges of huge amounts of data (1.4 Billion transactions), big data pipelines like Apache Spark are a natural choice to process the data. The combination of Java/Scala with Apache Spark is predominant in these fields.\nBig Data Analytics\nAs the data continues to grow, there is a new type of company that mines and analyzes business data. They serve as a third-party to help their client to explore the valuable information from their data. This data is typically system logs, anonymous non-sensitive customer information, sales and transaction records. As an example, TalkingData is a data intelligence service provider that offers data products and services to provide businesses insights on consumer behavior, preferences, and trends. One of TalkingData\u2019s core services is leveraging machine learning and deep learning models to predict consumer behaviors (e.g., likelihood of a particular group to buy a house or a car) and use these insights for targeted advertising. Currently, TalkingData is using a Scala based big data pipeline to process hundreds of million data a day. They built a Deep Learning model and used it across a Spark cluster to do distributed inference tasks. Compared to single machine inference, the Spark cluster reduced the total inference time from 8 hours to less than 3 hours. They chose DJL with Spark for the following reasons:\n\nDJL eliminates the need to maintain additional infrastructure other than Apache Spark. DJL let TalkingData fully utilize the computing power from Apache Spark for inference. If Spark is already being used for big data processing, this computation power can be reused to deal with DL inference. This helps to further save money and improve efficiency.\nSpark has a good fault-tolerant mechanism to help manage failure in the middle of processes. The DL inference on big data can last for hours and even tens of hours. In that case, they are looking for an auto-recovery solution for these machines.\nDJL is framework-agnostic, which gives TalkingData the ability to deploy any deep learning model (i.e, Tensorflow, PyTorch, MXNet, etc.) without any deployment code change, reducing time to market for TalkingData\u2019s new products/services.\n\nFor the online retail industry, recommendations and Ads are important to provide a better customer experience and revenue. The data sizes are usually enormous and they need a big data pipeline for them to clean up and extract the valuable information. Apache Spark becomes a natural fit to help deal with these tasks.\nToday more and more companies are taking a personalized approach to content and marketing. Amazon Retail used Apache Spark on Amazon EMR to achieve this goal. They created a multi-label classification model to understand customer action propensity across thousands of product categories and used these propensities to create a personalized experience for customers. Amazon Retail built a Scala-based big data pipeline to consume hundreds of million records and used DJL to do DL inference on their model.\nAccelerating ML pipelines with Apache Spark and NVIDIA GPU Computing\nAs shown above, many companies and institutions are using Apache Spark for their Deep Learning tasks. However, with the growing size and complexity of their Deep Learning models, developers are leveraging GPUs to do their training and inference jobs. The CPU only computational power on Apache Spark is not sufficient enough to handle large models.\nGPUs, with their massively parallel architecture, are driving the advancement of deep learning (DL) in the past several years. With GPUs, you can exploit data parallelism through columnar data processing instead of traditional row-based reading designed initially for CPUs. This provides higher performance and cost savings.\nApache Spark 3.0 represents a key milestone in this advancement, combining GPU acceleration with large-scale distributed data processing and analytics. Spark 3.0 can now schedule GPU-accelerated ML and DL applications on Spark clusters with GPUs.\u00a0 Spark conveys these resource requests to the underlying cluster manager.\u00a0 Also, when combined with the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark, Spark can now accelerate SQL and DataFrame data processing with GPUs without code changes.\u00a0 Because this functionality allows you to run distributed ETL, DL training, and inference at scale, it helps accelerate big data pipelines to leverage DL applications.\n\nIn Spark 3.0, you can now have a single pipeline, from data ingestion to data preparation to model training on a GPU-powered cluster.\nBefore Apache Spark 3.0, using GPUs was difficult. Users had to manually assign NVIDIA GPU devices to a Spark job and hardcode all configurations for every executor/task to leverage different GPUs on a single machine. Because the Apache Hadoop 3.1 Yarn cluster manager allows GPU coordination among different machines, Apache Spark can now work alongside it to help pass the device arrangement to different tasks. Users can simply specify the number of GPUs to use and how those GPUs should be shared between tasks. Spark handles the assignment and coordination of the tasks.\nTo leverage the best power from it, let\u2019s discuss the following two components:\nRapids: the NVIDIA GPU powered Spark data pipeline\nThe RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark combines the power of the RAPIDS library and the scale of the Spark distributed computing framework. In addition, RAPIDS integration with ML/DL frameworks enables the acceleration of model training and tuning. This allows data scientists and ML engineers to have a unified, GPU-accelerated pipeline for ETL and analytics, while ML and DL applications leverage the same GPU infrastructure, removing bottlenecks, increasing performance, and simplifying clusters.\n\nApache Spark-accelerated end-to-end ML platform stack\nNVIDIA worked with the Apache Spark community to add GPU acceleration on several leading platforms, including Google Cloud, Databricks, Cloudera and Amazon EMR making it easy and cost-effective to launch scalable, cloud-managed Apache Spark clusters with GPU acceleration.\nAmazon EMR, Spark + NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator GPU vs. CPU Performance Comparison\nFor its experiments to compare CPU vs. GPU performance for Spark 3.0.1 on AWS EMR, the NVIDIA RAPIDS accelerator team uses 10 TB of simulated data and queries designed to mimic large scale ETL from a retail or company (similar to TPC-DS).\u00a0 This comparison was run both on a CPU cluster and a GPU cluster with\u00a0 3TB TPC-DS data stored on AWS S3.\u00a0 The CPU cluster consisted of 8 instances of m5d.2xlarge as workers and 1 instance of m5d.xlarge as a master. The GPU cluster consisted of 8 instances of\u00a0 g4dn.2xlarge as workers, which has one NVIDIA T4 GPU in each instance (the most cost-effective GPU instances in the cloud for ML)\u00a0 and 1 instance of m5d.xlarge as a master. The CPU cluster costs $3.91 per hour and the GPU cluster costs $6.24 per hour.\nIn this experiment, the RAPIDS Accelerator team used a query similar to TPC-DS query 97. Query 97 calculates counts of promotional sales and total sales, and their ratio from the web channel for a particular item category and month to customers in a given time zone.\u00a0 You can see from the Spark Physical plan and DAG\u00a0 for query 97 shown below,\u00a0 that every line of\u00a0 the Physical plan has a GPU prefix attached to it, meaning that every operation of that query runs entirely on the GPU.\n\nSpark SQL query 97 DAG\nWith this query running almost completely on the GPU, processing time was sped up by a factor of up to 2.6x with 39% cost savings compared to running the job on the Spark CPU cluster. Note that there was no tuning, nor code changes for this query.\n\nImprovements in query time and total costs.\nIn addition, the NVIDIA RAPIDS accelerator team\u00a0 has run queries with Spark windowing operators on EMR and seen speeds up to 30x faster on GPU than CPU on large datasets.\nDJL: Deep Learning Framework in Java\nDeep Java Library (DJL) is a Deep Learning Framework written in Java, supporting both training and inference. DJL is built on top of modern Deep Learning engines (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, etc). It provides a viable solution for users who are interested in Scala/Java or are looking for a solution to integrate DL into their Scala-based big data pipeline. DJL aims to make deep-learning open source tools accessible to developers/data engineers who use primarily Java/Scala by using familiar concepts and intuitive APIs. You can easily use DJL to train your model or deploy a model trained using Python from a variety of engines without any additional conversion.\n\nBy combining Spark 3.x, the Rapids Accelerator for Spark and DJL, users can now build an end-to-end GPU accelerated Scala-based big data + DL pipeline using Apache Spark.\n\nDeep Learning on Scala Example\nNow let\u2019s walk through an example using Apache Spark 3.0 with GPU for image classification tasks.\u00a0 This example shows a common Image Classification task on Apache Spark for Online Retail. It can be used to do content filtering like eliminating inappropriate images that merchants have uploaded. The full project is available in the DJL demo repository.\nStep 1: Prepare Spark application\n1.1 Setup\nFor full setup information, refer to the Gradle project setup. The following section highlights some key components you need to know.\nFirst, we\u2019ll import the Spark dependencies. Spark SQL and ML libraries are used to store and process the images.\n\r\nconfigurations {\r\n   exclusion\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n   implementation \"org.apache.spark:spark-sql_2.12:3.0.1\"\r\n   implementation \"org.apache.spark:spark-mllib_2.12:3.0.1\"\r\n   implementation \"org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-hdfs:2.7.4\"\r\n\r\n   exclusion \"org.apache.spark:spark-sql_2.12:3.0.1\"\r\n   exclusion \"org.apache.spark:spark-mllib_2.12:3.0.1\"\r\n   exclusion \"org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-hdfs:2.7.4\"}\r\n}\r\n\r\njar {\r\n   from {\r\n       (configurations.runtimeClasspath - configurations.exclusion).collect {\r\n           it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it)\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n}\nNext, we import the DJL-related dependencies. We use DJL API and PyTorch packages, which provide the core DJL features and load a DL engine to run for inference. We also leverage PyTorch-native-cu101 to run on GPU with CUDA 10.1.\n\r\n  implementation platform(\"ai.djl:bom:0.8.0\")\r\n  implementation \"ai.djl:api\"\r\n  runtimeOnly \"ai.djl.pytorch:pytorch-model-zoo\"\r\n  runtimeOnly \"ai.djl.pytorch:pytorch-native-cu101::linux-x86_64\"\n1.2 Load model\nTo load a model in DJL, we provide a URL (e.g., file://, hdfs://, s3://, https://) hosting the model. The model will be downloaded and imported from that URL.\n\r\ndef loadModel(device : Device): ZooModel[Row, Classifications] = {\r\n   val modelUrl = \"https://alpha-djl-demos.s3.amazonaws.com/model/djl-blockrunner/pytorch_resnet18.zip?model_name=traced_resnet18\"\r\n   val criteria = Criteria.builder\r\n     .setTypes(classOf[Row], classOf[Classifications])\r\n     .optModelUrls(modelUrl)\r\n     .optTranslator(new MyTranslator())\r\n     .optProgress(new ProgressBar)\r\n     .optDevice(device)\r\n     .build()\r\n   ModelZoo.loadModel(criteria)\r\n}\nThe input type here is a Row in Spark SQL. The output type is a Classification result. We also defined a Translator (not shown in this document) named MyTranslator that deals with preprocessing and post-processing work. The model we load here is a pre-trained PyTorch ResNet18 model from torchvision.\n1.3 Main logic\nIn the main function, we download images and store them into the hdfs. After that, we can create a SparkSession and use the built-in Spark image loading mechanism to load all images into Spark SQL. After this step, we use mapPartition to fetch the GPU information.\nAs shown in the following, TaskContext.resources()(\"gpu\") stores the assigned GPU for this partition. We can assign the GPU id to the model to load the model on that particular GPU. This step will ensure all GPUs on a single device are properly used. To run inference, run predictor.predict(row).\n\r\ndef main(args: Array[String]) {\r\n\r\n   // download images\r\n   val imagePath = downloadImages(new Path(\"hdfs:///images\"))\r\n\r\n   // Spark configuration\r\n   val spark = SparkSession.builder()\r\n     .appName(\"Image Classification\")\r\n     .config(new SparkConf())\r\n     .getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n   val df = spark.read.format(\"image\").option(\"dropInvalid\", true).load(imagePath)\r\n\r\n   val result = df.select(col(\"image.*\")).mapPartitions(partition => {\r\n     val context = TaskContext.get()\r\n     // get assigned GPU\r\n     val gpuId = context.resources()(\"gpu\").addresses(0)\r\n     val model = loadModel(Device.gpu(gpuId.toInt))\r\n     val predictor = model.newPredictor()\r\n     partition.map(row => {\r\n       predictor.predict(row).toString\r\n     })\r\n   })(Encoders.STRING)\r\n   println(result.collect().mkString(\"\\n\"))\r\n}\n1.4 Wrap it up\nNext, we run ./gradlew jar to bundle everything we need into a single jar and run it in a Spark cluster.\nOptional: Setup Spark Cluster with NVIDIA GPU on AWS\nWith EMR release version 6.2.0 and later, you can quickly and easily create scalable and secure clusters with Apache Spark 3.x, the RAPIDS Accelerator, and NVIDIA GPU-powered Amazon EC2 instances.\u00a0 (To set up a cluster using the EMR console follow the instructions in this article. )\nTo set up a Spark cluster using AWS CLI, create a GPU cluster with three instances using the command below. To run the command successfully, you\u2019ll need to change myKey to your EC2 pem key name. The\u00a0 --region flag can also be removed if you have that preconfigured in your AWS CLI.\n\r\naws emr create-cluster \\\r\n   --name \"Spark cluster\" \\\r\n   --release-label emr-6.2.0 \\\r\n   --region us-east-1 \\\r\n   --ebs-root-volume-size 50 \\\r\n   --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark \\\r\n   --ec2-attributes KeyName=myKey \\\r\n   --instance-type g3s.xlarge \\\r\n   --instance-count 3 \\\r\n   --use-default-roles \\\r\n   --configurations https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/djl-demo/master/aws/emr-distributed-inference/image-classification-gpu/configurations.json\nWe use the g3s.xlarge instance type for testing purposes. You can choose from a variety of GPU instances that are available in AWS. The total run time for the cluster setup is around 10 to 15 minutes.\nStep 2: Execute the Spark job\nNow, we can run the distributed inference job on Spark. You can choose to do it on the EMR console or from the command line.\nThe following command tells Spark to run a Yarn cluster and setup-script to find GPUs on different devices. The GPU amount per task is set to 0.5, which means that two tasks share one GPU. You may also need to set the CPU number accordingly to ensure they match. For example, if you have an 8-core CPU and you set spark.task.cpus to 2, it means that four tasks can run in parallel on a single machine.\nTo achieve the best performance, you can set spark.task.resource.gpu.amount to 0.25, which allows four tasks to share the same GPU. This helps to maximize the performance because all cores in the GPU and CPU are used. Without a balanced setup, some cores will be in an idle state, which wastes resources.\n\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n   --master yarn \\\r\n   --conf spark.executor.resource.gpu.discoveryScript=/usr/lib/spark/scripts/gpu/getGpusResources.sh \\\r\n   --conf spark.worker.resource.gpu.discoveryScript=/usr/lib/spark/scripts/gpu/getGpusResources.sh \\\r\n   --conf spark.task.resource.gpu.amount=\"0.5\" \\\r\n   --conf spark.task.cpus=2 \\\r\n   --conf spark.executor.resource.gpu.amount=1 \\\r\n   --conf spark.worker.resource.gpu.amount=1 \\\r\n   --class com.examples.ImageClassificationExample \\\r\n   build/libs/image-classification-gpu-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nThis script takes around 4 to 6 minutes to finish, and you will get a printout inference result as output.\nSummary\nDL on Spark is growing rapidly with more applications and toolkits. Users can build their own DL with NVIDIA GPUs for better performance.

It was also an appealing prospect for miners after Nvidia accidentally released a driver that bypassed its own hash rate limiter.\nIt means the card has been one of the more difficult to buy---not that they aren't all hard to find---but a report from ITHome claims Nvidia is increasing supply of the new Limited Hash Rate (LHR) RTX 3060 cards.\nThe initial production is reportedly being prioritized for internet caf\u00e9s in China. The cards are said to arrive on July 10, and caf\u00e9 owners can pay a deposit now to secure shipments, but the extra numbers will eventually start moving down the supply lines to the retail sector.\n\nImage Credit: 3DCenter\nThis is latest piece of positive news regarding the graphics card crisis: retailers are implementing more ways of stopping scalpers; GPU prices are dropping following the China crackdown on mining; ASRock and this recent report claim prices and availability are improving; and falling crypto values are making multi-GPU mining rigs less appealing. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n AMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one \n\n\n\nWe're still some way off any semblance of normality. However, our monthly look at GPU availability and pricing shows the average eBay selling price of Ampere/RDNA 2 cards fell -8% from May to June, while the Nvidia RTX 2000-series was down -14% during the same period.\n\n\n\n\n 8 comments\n \n132 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

When we reviewed that GPU in October, the Founder's Edition was supposed to cost $499 and be just as fast as NVIDIA's previous flagship, the $999 RTX 2080 Ti. In reality, though, the global chip shortage and a proliferation of scalpers drove the cost of the 3070 up to $1,500 on eBay. On the rare occasion you could find it in stores, it typically sold for around $800.1 / 8NVIDIA RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti\nSo really, who knows how much NVIDIA's new mid-range GPU, the RTX 3070 Ti, is actually going to sell for. The company says its retail price is $599, though, so that's what we'll run with for now. The real question: Is it really worth a $100 price increase over the 3070, especially when the far more capable RTX 3080 is listed at $699? Yes and no.Under the hood, the RTX 3070 Ti sports 6,144 NVIDIA CUDA cores, compared to 5,888 on the 3070 and 2,560 on the RTX 2070 Super. (That latter card is effectively what the 3070 Ti is replacing.) The new GPU also features slightly faster base and boost clock speeds than the RTX 3070, but it's such a small jump you'd barely notice it. The 3070 Ti also comes with 8GB of DDR6X RAM, instead of just DDR6, which lifts memory bandwidth to 608 GB/s from 448 GB/s. Thanks to those additional CUDA cores, the 3070 Ti uses 290W of power instead of 220W. Consequently, it now requires at least a 750W power supply, a 100-watt jump from the 3070.RTX 3070 TiSM count46486880CUDA cores5,8886,1448,70410,240RT cores46486880Tensor cores184192272320Boost clock1,750MHz1,770MHz1,710MHz1,665MHzMemory8GB GDDR68GB GDDR6X10GB GDDR6X12GB GDDR6XMemory bandwidth448 GB/s608 GB/s760 GB/s912 GB/sTDP220W290W320W350WPrice$499$599$699$1,199Given the minimal spec bump over the 3070, I didn't expect a huge performance jump from the Ti model. The benchmarks just proved my hunch: The 3070 Ti hit 6,842 points in 3DMark's TimeSpy Extreme test, compared to 6,226 on the previous card. Similarly, I saw close to a 10 percent improvement in the Port Royal raytracing benchmark. That's nice to see, but it's not enough to make 3070 owners regret their purchase. Unfortunately, I didn't have a RTX 2070 Super to compare on my current rig \u2014 which is powered by a Ryzen 5800X and 32GB of DDR4 RAM \u2014 but it scored 4,474 in TimeSpy Extreme with my last system. NVIDIA claims the 3070 Ti should deliver up to 50 percent faster speeds than the 2070 Super.None3DMark TimeSpy ExtremeDestiny 2Hitman 3Port Royal (ray tracing)NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti6,842145-155fps155fps8,745/49fpsNVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti8,683175-195fps170fps12,948/59.95fpsNVIDIA RTX 30808,009150-165fps161fps11,623/53.81fpsNVIDIA RTX 30706,226140-150fps151fps8,032/37fpsAMD Radeon RX 68006,74280-100fps185fps7669/35.51fpsAll benchmarks run in 1440p at the highest graphical settings on a PC powered by a Ryzen 7 5800X and 32GB of RAM.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe 3070 Ti cemented itself as an excellent 1440p GPU during my testing, but again, it was only slightly better than the 3070. I hit 145 to 155fps in Destiny 2 with maxed out graphics settings, compared to 140 to 150fps on the 3070. And with Control, my current stress test for most GPUs, I reached up to 75fps while playing in 1440p natively with high graphics settings (but no ray tracing) on the 3070 Ti. The 3070, meanwhile, struggled to get past 60fps.The comparison was similarly small once I flipped ray tracing and DLSS, NVIDIA's feature which renders games at lower resolutions and upscales them with AI processing. The 3070 Ti reached up to 55fps while running Control in 4K with 1440p DLSS rendering and medium ray tracing settings. The 3070 hit up to 52fps. 2070 Super owners will definitely notice a bigger difference though. That card scored 5,845 points on the Port Royal benchmark on my old system, compared to 8,745 with the 3070 Ti on my new build. (And since that's a mostly GPU-bound test, the numbers are still worth assessing.)Since it's more power-hungry, the RTX 3070 Ti also ran hotter than the 3070 after hours of gaming and benchmarking. I reached up to 78 Celsius (the same as the RTX 3080 Ti), whereas the 3070 leveled out at 70 Celsius. This isn't too surprising, though, given that the Ti is using the same case and cooling design as the earlier card. Fan noise was more persistent too, but that's to be expect for a hotter card. Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetIn a world where GPUs were actually easy to buy, the 3070 Ti doesn't strike me as a major leap ahead of the 3070. If you're willing to spend $599 on a video card, what's another $100 to reach touch heights of gaming nirvana with the RTX 3080? That card would be even more capable with 4K and 1440p performance, and it's better equipped to crank up ray tracing settings. Perhaps NVIDIA just needs some better naming conventions so we can really tell its GPUs apart. As we noted in the RTX 3080 Ti review, that graphics card is basically a less powerful 3090, hence the $500 price bump and the more noticeable performance gain from the 3080. The 3070 Ti, meanwhile, is a slightly souped-up 3070.My big takeaway: it's hard to tell what GPU you'll actually be able to buy. So if you're desperate, and need something for your new rig, you'd probably be satisfied with the 3070, the 3070 Ti or the 3080. Buy what you can and run before someone notices what you're holding.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

The company previously said it would invest $55m in the supercomputer.Located at the Kao Data campus in Harlow, the system will initially feature 80 Nvidia DGX A100 systems combined, for 400 petaflops of 'AI compute,' or eight petaflops of standard Linpack performance.The supercomputer was announced at the same time as Nvidia's acquisition of Cambridge-based Arm. Nvidia is negotiating with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to officially open the data center.The investment comes as the UK government's Competition and Markets Authority investigates the Arm deal for national security risks or monopoly concerns.Microsoft, Google, Qualcomm, Graphcore, and others have written to the CMA asking for it to block the deal - with some saying they would invest in Arm themselves.Nvidia has said that it expects the acquisition to go through early next year, although it also faces a tough investigation from US, EU, and Chinese regulators. In China, an ongoing civil war between different Arm factions also risks delaying the deal.\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02 Mar 2021\n\n\n\n\nNvidia talks building the UK's fastest supercomputer, Cambridge-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Dec 2019\n\n\n\n\nHuawei unveils motherboards for Arm processors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07 Feb 2019\n\n\n\n\nSoftBank sells entire stake in Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nCompetition and Markets Authority\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\nArm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

But in the world of technology, a deep freeze has set in for a number of reasons, most stemming from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its negative impact on production and logistics. The most basic principle of economics, the law of supply and demand, applies especially well to graphics cards at the moment. Prices have skyrocketed as stock has dried up.\n The situation surrounding the video card shortage \u2013 which is so severe these days that arguments break out in tech stores that still manage to sell the product \u2013 is not just caused by the negative consequences of the pandemic itself. The current global apocalypse sure accounts for a fair share of the effect \u2013 it may even be the first reason for the shortage. But as I said, there is more to it than that. Let\u2019s take a look at the reasons and try to work out whether the shortage will end any time soon.\n The pandemic It all started in China. I\u2019m talking about the turning point in the world of technology: Right after the outbreak, Chinese companies understandably ordered their employees to work from home, which led to shipping delays, more shipping delays and even more shipping delays. The country \u2013 love it or hate it \u2013 predominantly controls the mass production of high-tech goods, even though the rise of Taiwan as a major chip manufacturer has had an impact on the mainland's dominance. But still, \u201cDesigned in California, assembled in China\u201d \u2013 as Apple puts it. As the COVID-19 epidemic evolved into a full-fledged pandemic, logistics also began experiencing its fair share of problems, causing even more issues and delays in shipping. The effect of the first-ever wave in Wuhan was just a snowball, which would become an avalanche as it got bigger and bigger, spurred on by several other factors.\n Chip shortage hits globally It\u2019s not only graphics cards that are in short supply. Even if you do have the money, have you been able to buy the PlayStation 5? I didn't think so, as Sony's next-gen powerhouse is nowhere to be found. And if you\u2019ve found one actually being sold \u2013 it is probably the first and last one in that particular tech store you\u2019re visiting. This is due to the fact there is a silicon chip shortage. Semiconductors, as they are known technically, and computer chips more informally, are materially based on silicon, an element central to mass tech production. The globe has experienced similar shortages. The 1988 chip shortage is a good example, so let\u2019s take a quick look at what happened back then. It was the height of the Mario craze in the world of gaming. The first two games were blockbusters, and gamers and Mario fans alike were incredibly hyped up for the then-revolutionary Super Mario Bros. 3. The game was ready to be released, but there was an issue: the 1988 chip shortage. The Mario maker, Nintendo, struggled to meet the incredible demand due to the shortage. People everywhere were on a hunt to find the game, but only a few managed to get their hands on the shiny cartridge that was the new Mario game. At the height of the 1988 chip shortage, as Super Mario Bros. 3 was preparing to hit the market and dozens of titles were being scrapped to produce more Mario copies, Nintendo of America\u2019s then-Vice President of Marketing Peter Main was asked what they were doing about the shortage. \u201cBesides hoping and praying?\u201d he replied. As tech became more accessible and cheaper to produce, the 1988 chip crisis subsided. So too will this crisis end as the pandemic wraps up and as chip prices inevitably drop in the long run. But with the added factor of the ongoing pandemic, which is probably going to define our lives for at least one more year, this time recovery will take longer, it seems. Annoying scalpers How funny is this: You cannot find a PS5, graphics card or any other gadget for that matter but scalpers are everywhere. Sony\u2019s mammoth new console is especially scarce. Whenever it is put on sale, scalpers appear out of nowhere and buy them all in a matter of seconds thanks to the algorithms they allegedly use to automate the process of buying in bulk, especially during a time when a majority of purchases are made online and not in physical stores due to the current pandemic. Just pay a visit to eBay and see what it has to offer. Let me assure you that you will see scores of PS5\u2019s for sale, albeit at exorbitant, unreasonable, astronomical prices. Are you willing to pay $1,500 for a console that is supposed to be sold for a third of that amount? Sure, go ahead, no one\u2019s holding you back. But as these scalpers get stronger, the weaker all of us gamers become. So it would be wise to keep that in mind before making the impulse purchase. Video cards \u2013 \u201cto the moon\u201d \u201cTo the moon\u201d is like a catchphrase among cryptocurrency investors. They express their hope by saying, for example, \u201cDogecoin to the moon\u201d \u2013 especially when Tesla and SpaceX mastermind Elon Musk shares a picture of his dog, live streams eating a hotdog or barks or something. I\u2019m all for cryptocurrencies \u2013 I\u2019m sure they have great potential. But please, bitcoin people, don't mess with our graphics cards. As cryptocurrency mining uses heavy processing power, powerful graphics cards are seen as the best option to produce coins, be it bitcoin, ethereum or other altcoins. I know it\u2019s a free market economy, capitalism and big fish eat little fish kind of deal, but please at least let us gamers live, am I right? The cryptocurrency-graphics card tensions have been going on for years now. Nvidia, the maker of the finest video cards with raytracing support, has alluded that they are planning to offer separate mining-focused cards so gamers can experience the RTX life. I don\u2019t know if they are actually working to resolve the stock issues, but they had better be because the company is losing its popularity and reputation by the day as it continues to fail to meet the demand. What the future holds The GeForce maker has recently announced that the global video card shortage will continue throughout 2021. What\u2019s worse, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and processor maker Intel also warned that the shortage may continue all the way through 2022. Considering the state of the pandemic and these announcements by major companies, the near future seems grim to be honest. For at least a couple more years, the entry-level to mid-tier graphics card market will probably be dominated by the GTX 1030s, and high-power cards such as the RTX series will be even scarcer. I\u2019m pretty sure many people who would otherwise build a PC for themselves have opted for higher-priced laptops just because they needed more graphical power since this shortage began. Even though the near future is not too bright, every shortage ends one way or another in this world order. As Turks ironically joke: \u201cThere is no shortage of solutions in capitalism.\u201d Yes, the current shortage will end too, albeit not in a very short time. Nowadays, waiting seems like the only option for gamers, besides hoping and praying.\n\n\nAbout the author\nSenior editor at Daily Sabah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshortlink copied\n\n\n\n                                                        Last Update: Jun 13, 2021 3:01 pm\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        KEYWORDS\n                    \n\n\ngraphics cards\nnvidia\nchip shortages\ntechie tuesdays\ncyber mondays\ntechnology\ngaming\ncryptocurrency\nmining\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    The Daily Sabah Newsletter\n                \n\n                    Keep up to date with what\u2019s happening in Turkey,\n                    it\u2019s region and the world.\n                \n\n\nSIGN ME UP\n\n\n                    You can unsubscribe at any time.

DeepMap has raised more than $90 million in funding since launching six years ago from investors that included Andreessen Horowitz.\nThe San Francisco-based startup makes software that automakers can use to create high-fidelity maps of roads. Such maps are essential for autonomous vehicles, which rely on them to plan the best way to reach a destination and identify potential obstacles. The more data a vehicle\u2019s artificial intelligence driving system has about roads, the more reliably it can navigate them.\nDeepMap has announced two mapping-related offerings since October, which Nvidia is set to absorb as part of the deal.\u00a0\nThe first offering is called DeepMap HDR. According to the startup, DeepMap HDR can help automakers generate maps and continuously update them over time to ensure autonomous vehicles have an accurate view of their environment. More recently, the startup introduced an offering called RoadMemory that can automatically build maps using the sensors attached to vehicles.\nDeepMap\u2019s technology will expand Nvidia\u2019s growing lineup of products for the auto sector. The company has built an end-to-end set of solutions for autonomous vehicles that includes not just chips but software tools for building, training and testing AI driving systems.\nThe centerpiece of Nvidia\u2019s auto portfolio is its Drive AGX series of system-on-chip processors. They can be deployed inside autonomous vehicles to power the onboard AI software that makes navigation decisions. The newest chip in the Drive AGX series is the Orin, which was described as seven times faster than its predecessor when it debuted. Each Orin chip combines graphic processing elements with Arm Ltd. central processing units to deliver maximum performance of 200 trillion operations per second.\nBefore an AI driving system is ready to be deployed in vehicles, an automaker has to run the system through simulated road tests to ensure it\u2019s capable of operating reliably. For that aspect of development projects, Nvidia offers its Drive Sim software platform. The platform enables automakers to put their AI algorithms to the test on simulated roads that they can parallelize across multiple graphics processing units to speed up experiments.\nDrive Sim draws on Nvidia\u2019s ray tracing technology, which the chipmaker originally developed for its consumer graphics cards. Ray tracing is a rendering technique popularized in the film industry that provides the ability to generate highly realistic light and shadow effects. Drive Sim uses it to increase the realism of AI simulations by adding in details that would be difficult to render otherwise, such as dim shadows inside a tunnel or light rays reflected off a truck.\nThe other components of Nvidia\u2019s autonomous vehicle portfolio cover subsequent phases of the development process. When it\u2019s time to build a prototype vehicle to test an AI driving system, automakers can save time by buying chipmaker\u2019s Drive Hyperion kit, which offers a pre-packaged suite of vehicle sensors. To increase the underlying AI algorithms\u2019 accuracy, automakers can train them on Nvidia\u2019s DGX machine learning appliances.\nThe mapping technology Nvidia is set to gain through the acquisition of DeepMap will improve its ability to address another key project requirement of companies building autonomous vehicles. At the same time, the deal could help the chipmaker step up competition against Intel Corp.\u2019s Mobileye unit.\nMobileye sells chips and other technology for building partially autonomous driver assistance systems that automate tasks such as parking. It\u2019s also working toward assembling a technology stack for building fully autonomous vehicles. As part of the effort, the Intel unit\u00a0 has created a mapping service that generates maps of roads using sensor data collected by vehicles from several major automakers.\nWith DeepMap\u2019s mapping technology, Nvidia can more directly take on that part of Mobileye\u2019s business. The technology could in the process increase the overall value of its end-to-end product lineup for autonomous vehicles, thereby potentially helping it sell more AGX Drive systems-on-chip in the long run.\nNvidia expects to close the acquisition in the third quarter. The startup\u2019s technology will extend the company\u2019s existing Drive Mapping offering, which allows autonomous vehicles to assemble a map of a road from data gathered by their onboard sensors.\u00a0\nImage: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

The latest update to Android TV on Shield TV devicesbegan rolling out earlier this month and featured a small UI redesign that added large banner images to Android TV\u2019s home screen, similar to what you get when using Google TV devices like the Chromecast with Google TV.\u00a0 Now technically, Google calls these banner images \u201crecommendations,\u201d as they are regularly updated and rotated to help users find new streaming content Google thinks they might enjoy. However, a number of Shield TV users consider these images to be advertisements (especially when they recommend shows on services users aren\u2019t even subscribed to), and as such, have taken to showing their displeasure with the recent update by review bombing the listing for the Android TV Home app, which now has a one-star rating across more than 800 reviews.\n\n\n Here\u2019s an example of how the Android TV home screen looked like in a previous update. Image: Nvidia As seen in a number of reviews and complaints on Reddit, many Shield TV users are unhappy about the way Google has killed off Android TV\u2019s previously minimalist design by implementing intrusive banner ads that take up significantly more space, particularly on what is supposed to be a premium streaming device that goes for $150 or $200 depending on the model. Thankfully, if you own a Shield TV and aren\u2019t a fan of the new banner ads, there are a couple of things you can do. First, while it won\u2019t completely eliminate recommendations, you can reduce their impact by going into the Settings menu, finding Device Preferences, clicking on Home Screen, and disabling the toggles for video and audio previews. Alternatively,  you can use ADB to replace the standard Android TV launcher with something else, though I wouldn\u2019t recommend this option unless you are comfortable tweaking your device using command line functions.\n\n\n\nAnd now here\u2019s an updated screenshot of what the Shield TV looks like, note the large banner ad at the top of the sceen. Image: Nvidia But more importantly, the addition of new banner images in Android TV is merely just one example of a growing trend in which major OS makers have begun inserting ads in a number of devices from smartphones to smart TVs. Sometimes these ads are presented as tools to help users find new content, while in other situations (like on Samsung phones), ads can appear as unwanted notifications alerting users about a newly announced Samsung device or service. Unfortunately, oftentimes there\u2019s no easy way to get rid of the ads, which causes user dissatisfaction or may even eventually drive users away from their current devices or platforms. But the real sad part is that until users make enough noise or cause a company\u2019s sales to drop, it\u2019s hard to say when this trend of seeing more and more ads in modern gadgets will stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\n\n\r\n          Select\r\n

Embracing a new culture was the biggest adjustment that he made while experiencing the daily \"culture shock\" in the foreign country.By the time you look again at your RTX cards, maybe you are wondering how it all started. Huang's struggles would inspire you that being different would let you reach the heights that you want to achieve. Regardless of race and color, the GPU boss' persistence has been his key weapon to overcome numerous hardships along his way.Who is NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang?\n\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\nWu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) via screenshot from Twitter\n\nAccording to a post by The Immigrant Learning Center, Huang has managed to endure lots of challenges after migrating to the United States. He first worked in Denny's, a famous American fast-food chain.When he was a kid, he had a penchant for seeing new things in the country including the biggest restaurants like Pizza Hut and McDonald's. However, he felt scared and sad during that time.Huang was born in Tainan, Taiwan in 1963. Before going to the United States, his family first moved to Thailand. From what he remembered, Jensen said that his childhood experience was somehow \"difficult\" for the children of his age. At nine years old, his main chore involves cleaning toilets in the comfort room.When his family transferred to Tacoma, Washington in the US, Huang proved to the world that he could be \"different.\" His skills in sports put him in third place in the US Open Table Tennis Championship (junior doubles) at the age of 15.After migrating to the US, he continued his studies until he graduated from Oregon State University in 1984 with an undergraduate degree in BS in Electrical Engineering. Years later, he finished his master's degree at Stanford University.At 30 years old, Huang co-founded NVIDIA as the CEO. There was a time when he became one of the highest-paid founders among tech companies until he decided to slash his salary to a whopping-low $1.00.With this persistence and perseverance. Huang managed to survive the odds that almost devoured him. He has failed many times but did not stop him from trying again. The only thing that he knew at that time was NVIDIA could be successful someday--which happened later.From the rise of the graphics processing unit (GPU) to the cards running several devices, Jensen knew that his company's contribution to technology, AI, VR, and autonomous driving has become a sparkplug of the other tech firms.Read also:\nNvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080 vs RTX 3090: Which is the Best?NVIDIA CEO is Leaning on AI This TimeFrom CRN's report last month, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said that his chip-making company would be driven by the \"next major wave of AI\" this year.\"This is a really large endeavor and the early indications of it are really exciting, and the reason for that is because our data center business is more than 50 percent vertical industry enterprises already. And by creating this easy-to-adopt and easy-to-integrate stack, it's going to allow them to move a lot faster,\" Huang said during the company's Q1 2022 Earnings Call.Moreover, Huang continued that NVIDIA was selling components to their resellers and integrators, but only a few of them were existing. So far, he relies on his mantra \"Buy more and save more,\" which tackles the benefits of the NVIDIA GPUs to the data centers.The semiconductor creator commended their efforts in crafting software en route to its AI path. Some of the company's newest software products, NVIDIA Fleet Comment and NVIDIA Omniverse have been set already to serve its customers.Despite the ongoing global chip shortage, NVIDIA is confident that it would survive the card crisis that continuously hits several tech giants.Related Article: Fact-Check: Is NVIDIA CEO an 'Uncle' of AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su?This article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by Joseph Henry  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

This means most GeForce GTX 700 and 600 series cards will not benefit from performance optimizations or gain access to new features, or even receive bug fixes once support comes to an end.\"Kepler-based desktop GPUs initially launched in March of 2012. Since then, gaming technology has evolved dramatically with technologies like DirectX 12 Ultimate and Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Moving forward, Nvidia\u2019s software QA team will be focusing on hardware that supports newer technologies,\" Nvidia stated in an FAQ on the topic.The decision affects over two dozen graphics card models. They include:\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is winding down developer support for 9 and 10-series graphics cards, but they'll likely keep getting driver updates for a while yet\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has quietly ended support for 32-bit PhysX on its new RTX 50-series, so games like Batman: Arkham City might look and run better on older GPUs\n\n\n\nGeForce GTX Titan Z\u00a0GeForce GTX Titan Black\u00a0GeForce GTX Titan\u00a0GeForce GTX 780 Ti\u00a0GeForce GTX 780\u00a0GeForce GTX 770\u00a0GeForce GTX 760 Ti\u00a0GeForce GTX 760GeForce GTX 760 (192-bit)GeForce GTX 760 Ti OEM\u00a0GeForce GT 740\u00a0GeForce GT 730\u00a0GeForce GT 720\u00a0GeForce GT 710GeForce GTX 690GeForce GTX 680GeForce GTX 670GeForce GTX 660 TiGeForce GTX 660GeForce GTX 650 Ti BoostNGeForce GTX 650 TiGeForce GTX 650GeForce GTX 645GeForce GT 640GeForce GT 635GeForce GT 630A few GeForce GTX 700 series cards are noticeably absent from the list. Namely, the GeForce GTX 750 Ti, GeForce GTX 750, and GeForce GTX 745 (OEM). Those parts actually utilized a first-generation Maxwell GPU (specifically the GM107), which succeeded Kepler, and will presumably still be eligible for Game Ready driver updates for a bit longer.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restWhile some may find this disappointing, it does not come as a surprise, for a couple of reasons. For one, Kepler is almost a decade old at this point, so it has had a good long run. And secondly, Nvidia a few weeks ago had updated a data center document to indicate that the R470 driver would be the end of the road for Kepler.\u00a0Curiously, Nvidia later removed the entry, reverting back to listing driver support as \"ongoing\" for Kepler. This led us to wonder if Nvidia had backtracked, given the current landscape\u2014it's next to impossible to buy a new GPU right now, unless you're willing to pay reseller pricing.Now we know Nvidia did not change its mind. Instead, the final Game Ready driver for Kepler (R470 GA5) will arrive on August 31, 2021. The first Game Ready driver that doesn't support Kepler (R495 GA1) will be pushed out a few days later, on October 4.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The R470 GA5 driver will also be the last one for Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1. In a separate support document, Nvidia noted that future driver releases would leave those OSes behind, as \"the vast majority of our GeForce customers have migrated to Windows 10.\"That is close to when Microsoft is expected to release the next generation of Windows, which is unofficially being referred to as Windows 11. Whatever it ends up being called, it seems as though Windows 10's days are numbered\u2014in yet another support document, Microsoft has listed October 14, 2025 as the retirement date for Windows 10.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nPaul LillySocial Links NavigationPaul has been playing PC games and raking his knuckles on computer hardware since the Commodore 64.

In a pair of support pages published over the weekend, Nvidia announced that on August 31, 2021, the final Game Ready drivers with support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 as well as older \u201cKepler\u201d GPU-based GeForce graphics cards will be posted. After that, your existing setup will continue to work, but you won\u2019t receive bug fixes or optimizations for new PC games, though \u201ccritical\u201d security updates will continue to be provided through September 2024.\nIt\u2019s always a bummer when support ends for hardware and software, but Nvidia (and rival AMD) maintains older configurations for longer than many companies. Windows 7 released all the way back in 2009, while Windows 8 launched in 2012. Windows 8 wasn\u2019t great, however, and Microsoft quickly hit the reset button with Windows 10 and offered free upgrades to users of both of those older versions of Windows. Neither 7 nor 8 is maintained by Microsoft any longer.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has officially\u00a0ended support for Windows 7\u00a0and\u00a0Windows 8, with Windows 8.1 nearing the end of its lifecycle as well,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s support plan states. \u201cThe vast majority of our GeForce customers have migrated to Windows 10 OS. \u00a0In order to ensure GeForce owners experience the best possible security, support, and functionality, Nvidia will now focus on Windows 10 operating system.\u201d\n Nvidia\n\nRIP to this dual-GPU beast.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Kepler architecture, meanwhile, powered the GeForce GTX 600- and 700-series graphics cards, as well as the first couple generations of the company\u2019s flagship Titan GPUs. The GTX 600-series debuted nearly a decade ago, in 2012, and the GTX 700-series hit the streets a year later.\n\n\n\nThe following graphics cards will receive their final Game Ready drivers on August 31:\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX TITAN Z\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX TITAN Black\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX TITAN\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX 780\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX 770\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760 Ti\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760 (192-bit)\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760 Ti OEM\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GT 740\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GT 730\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GT 720\u00a0\nNvidia GeForce GT 710\nNvidia GeForce GTX 690\nNvidia GeForce GTX 680\nNvidia GeForce GTX 670\nNvidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti\nNvidia GeForce GTX 660\nNvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost\nNvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti\nNvidia GeForce GTX 650\nNvidia GeForce GTX 645\nNvidia GeForce GT 640\nNvidia GeForce GT 635\nNvidia GeForce GT 630\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best Windows antivirus\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nNorton 360 Deluxe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re still using one of those older GPUs but want to continue receiving game optimizations and bug fixes, you\u2019ll need to upgrade your hardware.

And if you refuse to ditch the ultra-popular Windows 7 until your computer gives up the ghost, be sure to install an antivirus and read our tips on how to stay as safe as possible.

But if we weren\u2019t in the middle of a crippling GPU shortage, it\u2019d be hard to recommend.\nWhile the ferocious RTX 3080 Ti we reviewed last week bears more resemblance to Nvidia\u2019s flagship 3090 than the graphics card that shares its name, the spec sheet shows that the new RTX 3070 Ti wields only a slightly more powerful GPU than the vanilla 3070. That modest uplift proved true across our gaming benchmarks even after Nvidia grafted much faster GDDR6X memory to it. Considering that our roundup of the best GPUs recommends that most PC gamers should opt for the $400 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti over the $500 RTX 3070 for 1440p gaming, spending another $100 on a barely faster RTX 3070 Ti is a hard sell at that resolution. (Or at least it would be in normal times.) Conversely, spending $700 on a GeForce RTX 3080 would get you significantly faster 4K and 1440p performance.\n\nSo the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is a bizarre creature: a very good graphics card that\u2019s bracketed by better options. But its release helps Nvidia in key strategic ways. First, the company can slap the \u2018Ti\u2019 moniker on these full-GA104 dies and sell them for a sizeable premium over the\u00a0very slightly cut-down 3070. That\u2019s huge for Nvidia\u2019s bottom line at a time when every high-end GPU sells out instantly. Second, this card boosts GeForce back into competition against its AMD rivals, after the $580 Radeon RX 6800 blew past the 3070 in many games. Nvidia hates to lose in benchmarks (though AMD\u2019s $580 Radeon RX 6800 still edges it out overall).\nLet\u2019s dig into Nvidia\u2019s own $600 GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition, which will be (sporadically) available via the GeForce website as well as Best Buy when the 3070 Ti launches on June 10.\n\n\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti specs, features, and price\nNvidia compares the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti against last generation\u2019s GeForce RTX 2070 Super in the specifications page it provided reviewers, as you can see below. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the price creep we\u2019ve witnessed across all tiers of graphics card pricing (and mentioned at the end of our 3080 Ti review) continues here: The RTX 3070 Ti costs $600, while the RTX 2070 Super cost $500, while the GTX 1070 Ti cost $450. So if you\u2019re looking to upgrade from a GTX 1070 Ti, this isn\u2019t really an apples-to-apples comparison despite the similar branding.\n Nvidia\nThe comparison that matters if you\u2019re buying new is against the cards bracketing the 3070 Ti in Nvidia\u2019s product stack. With 6,144 CUDA graphics cores, the RTX 3070 Ti only has a few hundred more than the 5,888 found in the vanilla 3070, but thousands fewer than the 8,704 CUDA present in the RTX 3080. A few hundred more cores\u00a0gives a little extra oomph, as you\u2019ll see in our benchmarks, but nothing game-changing. (By comparison, the other new Ti card, the RTX 3080 Ti, wound up only a few hundred CUDA cores short of the step-up 3090, and thousands ahead of\u00a0the vanilla 3080\u2014the opposite of this scenario.)\nNvidia sweetened the pot by equipping the Ti version with 8GB of cutting-edge GDDR6X memory, which rockets the card\u2019s total memory bandwidth to a speedy 608GB/s. The vanilla 3070 uses a standard non-X version of GDDR6 memory, which runs much slower, bringing its effective memory bandwidth down to 448GB/s. The extra VRAM speed helps the RTX 3070 Ti get a little more pep in its step in memory-constrained games, if you\u2019re playing at the higher resolutions for which this card is built.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThat said, Nvidia still only gave this card 8GB of raw capacity (despite giving the $330 RTX 3060 16GB of GDDR6). As with the non-Ti 3070, the decision is a bit concerning in an era when games are demanding more VRAM for high-res textures. That amount should suffice for now, for most games at 1440p resolution\u2014though some games, like Watch Dogs Legion, already blow past that even at 1440p with everything cranked. But this modest serving of RAM may make AMD\u2019s rival Radeon RX 6800 and its ample 16GB of GDDR6 more appealing, especially if you plan on playing at 4K. We said the following about the vanilla 3070, and it still holds true:\n\n\n\u201cThe 8GB memory buffer gives me pause for 4K gaming. It holds up just fine in most (but not all) games today with all visual options cranked to Ultra, but it may hold back performance in a couple of years, especially since the\u00a0PlayStation 5\u00a0and\u00a0Xbox Series X\u00a0consoles are both moving to 16GB of VRAM when they launch in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s hard to know what the future holds, but it\u2019s worth considering before you make your purchase. If you plan to hold onto your graphics card for four or five years, and plan to play at 4K resolution, you might want one with more memory.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, this is yet another RTX 30-series Founders Edition card. Nvidia\u2019s 3070 Ti cooler design basically splits the difference between the 3070 FE and 3080 FE setups. While the RTX 3070 FE used dual fans on the bottom face of the card, the 3070 Ti FE returns to the radical one-fan-on-top, one-fan-on-bottom \u201cflow-through\u201d configuration deployed by higher-end Founders Edition models. The fan closest to the rear of your PC acts like a blower-style cooler, while the top fan sucks air through the card and pushes it up into your CPU cooler and case fans, so those components can deal with the heat.\n Nvidia\nThe 3070 Ti\u2019s proprietary 12-pin power connector peeks out through the thick metal heat fins in the side of the card in 3080 FE-like fashion, rather than being deployed horizontally. Despite the many similarities to the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition cooler design, the 3070 Ti uses the smaller, thinner heat fins found on the 3070, rather than the bristling-thick metal found on the 3080.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s proprietary 12-pin power connector\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use Nvidia\u2019s bundled 12-pin power adapter to connect to a pair of conventional 8-pin plugs. (It\u2019s still ugly, and if you care about aesthetics in your build, it might be worthwhile to spring for a pricey full-size converter cable, if your particular modular power supply supports it.) The power requirements for Nvidia GPUs went up significantly this generation, and the RTX 3070 Ti drives that home. The last-gen RTX 2070 Super drew 215 watts of total graphics power, and Nvidia recommended pairing it with a 650W power supply. The 3070 Ti takes 290W and a 750W PSU.\nThe card comes with a single HDMI 2.1 connection and a trio of DisplayPorts, same as every other RTX 30-series Founders Edition offering. Beyond that, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti includes everything you get with all RTX 30-series GPUs: Best-in-class ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, Nvidia Reflex\u2019s awesome latency lowering capabilities, the sublime NVENC encoder for streaming and video creation, and so on.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the benchmarks!\nNext page: Our test system, benchmarks begin\n\n\nOur test system\nWe\u2019re using our new AMD Ryzen 5000-series test rig to be able to benchmark the effect of PCIe 4.0 support on modern GPUs, as well as the performance-boosting AMD Smart Access Memory and Nvidia Resizable BAR features (which are both based on the same underlying PCIe standard). Currently, we\u2019re testing it on an open bench with AMD\u2019s Wraith Max air cooler. In the future, we\u2019ll move the setup into a case and add an NZXT Kraken liquid cooler to the mix. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settings\nAMD Wraith Max cooler\nMSI Godlike X570 motherboard\n32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply\n1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD\n\nWe\u2019re sticking to direct competitors from the current generation, because the RTX 30-series and its Ampere architecture are known quantities. Let\u2019s compare the $600 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti against Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition models of the $500 RTX 3070 and $700 RTX 3080, of course, as well as AMD\u2019s rival $580 Radeon RX 6800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMD's rival GPU\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$580 at  Best Buy \n\n\n\n\n\nTime constraints prevented us from testing Resizable BAR or ray tracing performance. That said, because the 3070 Ti is essentially a 3070 with a few more cores and faster GDDR6X memory, its ray tracing and DLSS performance should be close to that card\u2019s, just a hair faster.\nThis evaluation focuses purely on traditional gaming benchmarks. We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits. We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. The RTX 3080 wasn\u2019t tested at 1080p, because that card is overkill for that resolution.\nBecause the 3070 Ti is just a bit faster than the 3070, we\u2019re going to present these benchmark charts but save our wrap-up commentary for the end. In general, though, while the RTX 3070 Ti gets Nvidia within spitting distance of the Radeon RX 6800, AMD\u2019s card continues to hold the overall performance advantage in non-ray traced games.\nGaming performance benchmarks\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nWatch Dogs: Legion\u00a0is one of the first games to debut on next-gen consoles. Ubisoft upgraded its Disrupt engine to include cutting-edge features like real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. We disable those effects for this testing, but\u00a0Legion\u00a0remains a strenuous game even on high-end hardware with its optional high-resolution texture pack installed.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, PlayStation exclusives are coming to the PC now.\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers\u00a0Death Stranding.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics\u00a0puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the\u00a0XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark\u00a0Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\u00a0is more fun when you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but\u00a0it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API,\u00a0Youngblood\u00a0achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we tested Riverside.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019,\u00a0Metro Exodus\u00a0remains one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. The Extreme graphics preset we benchmark can melt even the most powerful modern hardware, as you\u2019ll see below, though the game\u2019s Ultra and High presets still look good at much higher frame rates.\nWe test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands\u00a0is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter. This game tends to favor AMD hardware.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular\u00a0Total War\u00a0saga,\u00a0Troy\u00a0was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale.\u00a0Total War: Troy\u00a0is built using a modified version of the\u00a0Total War: Warhammer 2\u00a0engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We test the more intensive battle benchmark.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s still utterly\u00a0gorgeous a couple of years after its debut. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12 and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider\u00a0and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nRainbow Six Siege\u00a0still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and Ubisoft supports it with frequent updates and events. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: Power, thermals, and noise\n\n\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\n\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is a bit faster than the vanilla 3070, and comes with higher-powered GDDR6X memory, so it appropriately enough draws more power. The real standout here is AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6800, which uses significantly less power than either GeForce card despite going toe-to-toe with Nvidia\u2019s amped-up Ti in most games. I suspect GDDR6X is behind most of the higher power draw for Nvidia\u2019s new card.\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAdding GDDR6X memory to the mix stresses Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition cooler much more. The 3070 Ti runs a full 5 degrees Celsius warmer than the vanilla version under load, despite being equipped with the fancier flow-through cooling design from the RTX 3080 and 3090. GDDR6X not only demands more power, it also generates more heat, because energy can\u2019t just magically disappear.\n\nNext page: Should you buy the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti?\n\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti?\nWe\u2019ve said it in every graphics card review we\u2019ve published this year, and we\u2019ll say it again: You probably shouldn\u2019t buy\u00a0any\u00a0graphics card right now. Prices are just plain ridonkulous. I\u2019d recommend most people sit on the sidelines and stream their PC games via\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service\u00a0until the dust settles. While this card ostensibly costs $600, I\u2019d expect the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti to go for several hundred dollars more than that until the crippling GPU shortage ends.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nI\u2019m also concerned about how the price of this class of graphics card has trended upward over the last couple of generations. The RTX 3070 Ti costs a full $150 more than the GTX 1070 Ti from two generations ago, going off retail pricing that means little in the real world today.\nThat said, even if the supply and demand situation weren\u2019t so wack, we couldn\u2019t give this GPU our full-throated recommendation. The RTX 3070 Ti is only about 5 to 10 percent faster than the vanilla 3070 that costs $100 less. We recommend most people with 1440p monitors opt for the even-cheaper $400 RTX 3060 Ti unless you\u2019re looking for maximum performance on a 144Hz monitor. If you\u2019re planning on playing at 4K resolution, dropping another $100 on the $700 RTX 3080 unlocks heaps more performance, along with a larger 10GB memory buffer that will almost certainly hold up better over the coming years than the RTX 3070 Ti\u2019s 8GB capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSlightly faster in more games\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$580 at  Best Buy \n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019d recommend going with either of those options if you want to stick with Nvidia, or strongly consider the Radeon RX 6800 for $580 if you don\u2019t mind giving up GeForce\u2019s superior ray tracing performance and killer features like Shadowplay, NVENC encoding, and Nvidia Reflex. AMD\u2019s high-end rival slugs it out with the 3070 Ti, winding up slightly faster in most games and picking up some additional wins at 1440p and 1080p resolutions thanks to the RDNA 2 architecture\u2019s radical Infinity Cache. That GPU comes with a massive 16GB of GDDR6 non-X memory, so it\u2019s much more future-proof. The $650 Radeon RX 6800 XT also comes with 16GB and is even faster, being an RTX 3080 rival.\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs offer much better ray tracing performance and the company\u2019s sublime DLSS 2.0 technology, however. AMD\u2019s answer to that\u2014FidelityFX Super Resolution\u2014is slated to launch in some form on June 22.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti falls into a weird nether region between its siblings. In a sane world, you\u2019d probably skip it for those better options with more clearly defined value propositions. But in a world where the ancient GTX 1650 Ti was pressed back into service and GPUs are going for up to double their MSRP, this might be the only option available to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t despair if you wind up with this graphics card though. Product stack context aside, the RTX 3070 Ti is a great 1440p and darn-good 4K GPU. You won\u2019t be disappointed in how it plays\u2026for now. In a couple of years you may need to dial back some settings to avoid exceeding its 8GB memory buffer, especially at 4K resolution\u2013there are already games where that\u2019s the case today. Expect bulkier, tricked-out third-party cards from the likes of EVGA, Asus, MSI, etc. to handle the heat generated by all that GDDR6X memory better as well.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia is reportedly set to prioritize production of its latest graphics cards at the expense of an older model. In this case, supply of the RTX 2060 will be cut so the company can focus on its RTX 3000 series. \nAs reported by ITHome (via VideoCardz), a post from Board Channel forums, which are closed forums for distributors and board partners within the industry, reveals that Nvidia has sent out an internal notice to board partners that it will be halving supply of RTX 2060 chips starting from this month.\n\nThe strategy appears to be a U-turn by Nvidia after in February saying it would be releasing more stock of the RTX 2060 GPU, along with the Pascal-based GTX 1050 Ti GPU, as a response to the graphics card shortages. It pulled the same move with the GTX 1650 a couple of months later.\nThe GTX 1050 Ti, GTX 1650, and RTX 2060 occupy the second, third and fourth spots, respectively, on the latest Steam survey, with the GTX 1650 seeing the most significant gains among Steam users for the second month in a row.\n\nWhile TSMC makes the TU106 in the RTX 2060, GPUs in the consumer RTX 3000 series are made by Samsung. However, the production capacity mentioned here likely refers to the entire supply chain, including other components.\nJust how much difference the move will make to the availability of the RTX 3000 series remains to be seen. Surprisingly, the RTX 3060 and RTX 3070 saw the joint-largest gains alongside the GTX 1650 in last month's Steam hardware survey, so some people must be buying the newest cards, even if they are from eBay.\nShifting production priorities in the face of the global chip shortage is something AMD has also done, albeit with CPUs. The company admitted it is focusing on its flagship processors over lower-end offerings to, hopefully, improve supply. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Qualcomm levels up handheld gaming with Snapdragon G-series chips \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12 comments\n \n180 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

More info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA SHIELD, later known as SHIELD Portable, was so, so sweet. It was a Tegra-powered, Android-toting little badass gaming machine, perfect for commutes or long flights where you ain\u2019t got nothing better to do than play some games.\nAt the time when this device launched, waaay back in 2013 (original review), it felt like there was an influx of older AAA console titles making their way to Android and we needed a machine capable of playing those games properly with a controller. Additionally, the mobile game scene in general was booming, with mobile-focused titles like Dead Trigger and SHADOWGUN making a big name for themselves. It was beautiful timing that NVIDIA released the SHIELD, and if I\u2019m being honest, I wouldn\u2019t hate it if NVIDIA tried to do it again.\nThere\u2019s a few ways I could see a SHIELD Portable (2021) being pretty sweet. The obvious way is cloud gaming. GeForce NOW and Stadia are available on mobile devices, but you need a paired controller to take advantage of the titles completely. With something like SHIELD, the built-in controller makes the device the ultimate portable cloud-gaming device. We have all of this computing power in the cloud without a proper device to take advantage of it. I say, let\u2019s try a new SHIELD!\n\nHaving used the old device for many hours, I actually found it to be rather comfortable in my hands, so I don\u2019t think NVIDIA would have to do all too much to bring it up to 2021 standards. It\u2019s not the prettiest thing, but it totally worked and screams \u201cNVIDIA\u201d design language. For starters, we\u2019ll up the display\u2019s resolution and refresh rate which shouldn\u2019t be too difficult given how common that is now, and obviously toss in the latest Tegra chipset with a heavy helping of RAM. Boom, you got yourself a SHIELD Portable 2.0. Honestly, the original SHIELD was ahead of its time, possibly making way for devices like the Nintendo Switch to be super popular.\nIt\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever see a new SHIELD Portable, but even thinking about the fact that we never got a sequel SHIELD Portable 2 is super depressing. This device deserved a sequel. What happened, NVIDIA?\nDid you own of these?

There wasn't a lot to like as Nvidia is charging 80% of the cost for an RTX 3090, but only gave gamers half as much memory and a much smaller FE graphics card. Put differently, the Ti is an RTX 3080 with 2GB more VRAM for a 71% increase in price. The extra cores amounted to a 10% boost on average, so a negligible performance uplift. Should we also mention the fact that you can't really buy it anywhere?\nFor gamers, the RTX 3080 Ti is a flop, but for Nvidia it allows them to cash in big time on silicon that wasn't good enough to be binned for use as an RTX 3090, extending their profit margins. So that's the story of the RTX 3080 Ti, but what about the RTX 3070 Ti?\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti comes in at half the price, which is quite incredible and just goes to show how ridiculous the 3080 Ti's pricing is. The 50% reduction in price sees a 40% drop in core count, 14% fewer ROPs, 33% less memory bandwidth and capacity. The new Ti is based on the same GA104 silicon as the RTX 3070.\nWith an MSRP of $600, the RTX 3070 Ti slots in between the 3070 and 3080. That means it's 20% more expensive than the 3070, at least at MSRP, and for that you're getting just 4% more cores with no increase in ROPs. That's a minuscule upgrade to the core, but thankfully Nvidia has tweaked the memory, opting to upgrade the GDDR6 memory with GDDR6X at the same 8GB capacity.\n\nThe upgrade to 19 Gbps memory from 14 Gbps means that the 256-bit wide memory bus now has a theoretical peak bandwidth of 608 GB/s up from 448 GB/s, a 36% increase.\nWhile we're looking at a piddly 4% increase in cores, the 3070 Ti does improve memory bandwidth by 36%. How much this will improve performance overall will likely vary from game to game, so that might help make the testing a bit more interesting.\n\nWith that said, let's go over a few of the benchmarks using the Founders Edition card. All benchmark results are based on AMD and Nvidia GPUs running at the official specifications, so no factory overclocking. In total we tested 12 games at 1440p and 4K using our Ryzen 9 5950X test system, which has been configured with 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory.\n\nBenchmarks\nFirst up we've got Assassin's Creed Valhalla. This AMD sponsored title heavily favors Radeon GPUs and for some reason Nvidia has been unable to optimize their hardware for this game. As a result the 3070 Ti is 18% slower than the 6800 and 28% slower than the 6800 XT, which is a massive performance difference.\nWhen compared to the RTX 3070, it's 11% faster, which is to be expected given the specifications.\n\n\nNvidia's 2xFP32 design does work better at 4K and as a result the 3070 Ti is now 15% slower than the 6800 and 22% slower than the 6800 XT. Still big margins, but smaller than what was seen at 1440p. Unfortunately the additional memory bandwidth didn't help the 3070 Ti at 4K as it was just 7% faster than the 3070. Single-digit gains aren't impressive for a 20% increase in MSRP.\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider is sponsored by Nvidia, though I consider this to be a neutral title, at least for rasterization performance which is what we're looking at here. The RTX 3070 Ti matched the RX 6800 with 130 fps on average at 1440p, making it 14% slower than the 6800 XT, which isn't bad given it's 8% cheaper, though it does only feature half the VRAM.\nWhen compared to the 3070, we're looking at single digit gains. This time the 3070 Ti was 9% faster. The 4K margins look similar: the 3070 Ti matched the RX 6800, and it was 12% slower than the 6800 XT. When compared to the original RTX 3070 it was 11% faster, which is the biggest margin we've seen so far, certainly not amazing and not nearly enough to justify the 20% increase in MSRP.\n\n\nWatch Dogs: Legion is another Nvidia sponsored title that supports ray tracing and DLSS, but it works well on both AMD and Nvidia hardware. The RTX 3070 Ti is seen trailing the RX 6800 by a 5% margin, making it a whopping 20% slower than the 6800 XT. We're also looking at a tiny 4% boost over the 3070.\nMoving up to 4K sees the 3070 Ti match the RX 6800, though it was barely any faster than the standard 3070.\n\n\nThere are probably much cheaper GPUs you could use for playing competitive titles, but if you want ~300 fps using the maximum visual quality settings, the 3070 Ti will suffice as it delivered RX 6800-like performance, making it just 13% slower than the 6800 XT, but also 6% faster than the 3070.\nThe 4K frame rates are a lot less ridiculous as the 3070 Ti was good for 152 fps on average, placing it ahead of the RX 6800 by a small 4% margin.\n\n\nNext up we have Horizon Zero Dawn and once again the 3070 Ti is slower than the RX 6800, this time falling behind by 6% margin and that meant it was 16% slower than the 6800 XT. Not a terrible result, but it was only 7% faster than the 3070, so you have to wonder what the point is.\nAt 4K we do see the 3070 Ti beat the original 3070 by a 10% margin, but that hardly offsets the 20% increase in cost.\n\n\nTesting with Doom Eternal reveals similar margins between the 3070 Ti and RX 6800, though the cheaper Radeon GPU was still 4% faster and the 6800 XT was 15% faster.\nNow at 4K we see something interesting. It's worth noting that at 4K, using the ultra nightmare quality settings, Doom Eternal calls for 9GB of VRAM and that's not allocation but actual memory usage. As such, GPUs with 8GB or less VRAM struggle more at 4K relative to models with more memory. At 1440p the game only calls for 7 GB of VRAM.\nFor example, the RTX 3080 is 27% faster than the 3070 at 1440p, but at 4K that margin more than doubles to 59%. The 3070 Ti has the same memory capacity as the 3070, but bandwidth has been increased by 36% and that really helps here. At 1440p the 3070 Ti was 11% faster than the 3070, but at 4K it's 18% faster.\n\n\nMoving on to the Death Stranding testing, we find some particularly disappointing results for the RTX 3070 Ti. Here it was 13% slower than the RX 6800 and 20% slower than the 6800 XT. But most disappointing of all was the margin to the 3070, here it was just 4% faster.\nThat margin does increase at 4K, but even here the 3070 Ti was just 7% faster than the 3070 and that meant it was still 11% slower than the RX 6800 and 19% slower than the 6800 XT.\n\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077 the 3070 Ti isn't overly impressive, 73 fps on average meant it was just 7% faster than the original 3070, and 8% slower than the RX 6800.\nThen at 4K we're looking at just 37 fps on average using the high preset, not ultra. That's a 9% boost over the 3070 and 5% slower than the RX 6800 or 16% slower than the 6800 XT.\n\n\nBorderlands 3 is AMD sponsored though like Shadow of the Tomb Raider I consider it to be a neutral title for testing. The results have the RTX 3070 Ti performing 9% slower than the RX 6800 and 23% slower than the 6800 XT. That said, the results are interesting as the 3070 Ti was 17% faster than the 3070 and that's a much larger performance difference than we've seen in pretty much every other title tested so far.\nA similarly large margin was seen at 4K, where the 3070 Ti was 18% faster than the original 3070, rendering 52 fps on average, enough to match the RX 6800.\n\n\nHitman 2 provides us with fairly typical results with what we've seen thus far. The 3070 Ti was just 4% faster than the 3070 at 1440p and that meant it was 7% slower than the RX 6800 and 17% slower than the 6800 XT. The 4K results are more of the same: the 3070 Ti was 6% faster than the 3070, 7% slower than the RX 6800 and 18% slower than the 6800 XT.\n\n\nResident Evil 3 is yet another title where the 3070 Ti loses out to the Radeon competition. Although it was 12% faster than the 3070, it's 9% slower than the cheaper RX 6800 and 17% slower than the 6800 XT. Figures improve a little at 4K but not enough to overcome the Radeons.\n\n\nF1 2020 makes us finish on a weak note for the RTX 3070 Ti. Nvidia's new $600 GPU is just 3% faster than the $500 version, and so it was 11% slower than the RX 6800 and 19% slower than the 6800 XT. Even at 4K the 3070 Ti receives a dusting, losing to the RX 6800 by an 11% margin and the 6800 XT by a 21% margin.\nAverage Performance\nHere's a summary of all the previous results with no surprises to be found. At 1440p, the RTX 3070 Ti is on average 8% slower than the RX 6800, and 18% slower than the 6800 XT, while beating the original RTX 3070 by 8%.\n\n\nAt least at 4K the 3070 Ti is able to pull out a double-digit margin over the 3070, if only just, beating it by 11% on average. Overall it remains ~5% slower than the RX 6800 and 16% slower than the 6800 XT.\n\nPower Consumption\nWhen it comes to power consumption, the RTX 3070 Ti consumes significantly more power than the RX 6800, increasing total system usage by 20%, and that's a significant increase when factoring in entire system usage.\n\nGPU Recap, What We Learned\nThat's our look at the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, and now it's time to make sense of it. But before we do, here's a quick Ampere vs. RDNA2 recap of how we've called it so far...\nIn a mostly no-sense battle for gamers, between the GeForce RTX 3090 and Radeon RX 6900 XT, we picked the RTX 3090 as the clear winner here as it's a no-compromise solution offering more VRAM and better performance at 4K. If you have money for the best and want the best, the 3090 is at least that, the 6900 XT is a compromise and at $1000 makes less sense than the 3090 at $1500.\n\nNext, we have the battle between the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT. And again we went with the Nvidia GPU when making our 30 game benchmark analysis. The GeForce GPU offers a similar level of performance at 1440p with marginally better 4K results, but the deal breaker for AMD is the lack of DLSS-like technology, weaker encoding support, and immature ray tracing.\nPicking between the RTX 3070 and RX 6800 has been more difficult. The RX 6800 benefits from a significant increase in VRAM, doubling what the 3070 offers to 16 GB, that's nice and should see the Radeon GPU age far better. But the lack of DLSS (with FSR coming but in unknown form later this month), Nvidia's better encoder and ray tracing support, it's a close call, assuming both were readily available around the MSRP.\n\nThen we had the Radeon 6700 XT vs. GeForce RTX 3070 battle, and for that one we went with Nvidia. The 6700 XT just wasn't priced competitively enough.\nAs for the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, how does it slot into all of this? At $600, it's priced to compete with either the RX 6800 or RX 6800 XT. However it's slightly more expensive and 8% slower than the RX 6800, and then 8% cheaper but 18% slower than the 6800 XT. Then again, we have the DLSS and encoder factors, but to simplify this, let's just remove AMD offerings from the equation and focus on Nvidia's own products...\n\nThe simple math is this: the RTX 3070 Ti costs 20% more than the 3070 and is on average 8% faster. It does nothing to strengthen Nvidia's position against AMD. There's no extra VRAM, and gamers get a small performance increase to justify the extra $100 over the RTX 3070. For Nvidia, it virtually gives them the opportunity to sell higher quality silicon at a higher price for those willing to pay for it already.\nAnd that's about it. The RTX 3070 Ti is a much better release than the RTX 3080 Ti and yet it's still kind of pointless if you won't be able to buy any for $600. And with that, we're going to end this review and get back to testing some older GeForce GPUs like the GTX 1060 and 1070 to see how they're holding up in 2021 and if they're viable options on the second hand market.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5950X on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5900X on Amazon\nRyzen 5 5600X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 37\n\n\n Got something to say?

Nvidia has done precisely that with the arrival of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti premium graphics cards announced yesterday.\r\nBuilt to offer an additional bump in performance compared to non-Ti cards debuting last September, today we're putting the RTX 3080 Ti through its paces on our new benchmark suite.

RTX 3080 Ti uses the same GA102 die as the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080. For those that need a refresher on what the Ampere architecture brings to the table, head over here. The specs intimate it is closer to the RTX 3090 in composition, so the best method of discerning potential is to compare it to the flagship GPU. \nWhereas RTX 3090 uses an 82-SM approach yielding 10,496 Cuda cores, RTX 3080 Ti trims this down to 80. Crunching the 128-cores-per SM reveals a 10,240-shader GPU endowed with a commensurate ratio of Tensor and RT Cores. As the table shows, the Ti variant is comfortably more powerful than the non-Ti, but overall performance is not as clear cut as the Ti ships with marginally lower clocks. Do be aware that no GeForce uses the full might of the GA102 architecture; that honour is left to the workstation-optimised RTX A6000 housing the full complement of 10,752 cores.\nThe similarities to RTX 3090 persist through Nvidia choosing to maintain a 384-bit memory bus, albeit with two key differences. The memory footprint is halved to 12GB, which feels stingy, and speed reduced by an effective 500MHz. The other difference is a lack of NV-Link support on the newest member of the Ampere clan, but who runs SLI nowadays anyway?\nAll the numbers point to the RTX 3080 Ti benchmarking at around 95 per cent of the RTX 3090's levels, perhaps even closer. Nvidia therefore plumbs this GPU with the same TGP of 350W. It's easy to think of this as repurposed silicon that didn't quite make the higher RTX 3090 grade.\nLet's be clear. This is an RTX 3090 Lite more than an upgraded RTX 3080, and Nvidia knows this. We can liberally discard MSRPs these days, but for what it's worth, the RTX 3080 Ti comes in at $1,199 (\u00a31,049), further underlining its RTX 3090 Lite credentials. Is this a value-focussed part? Of course not, but when regular RTX 3080 boards are selling for $2,000-plus on popular auction sites, due to a combination of stock shortages and inflated cryptocurrency interest, talking about price is verging on pointless.\nSpeaking of crypto, like very recent RTX GPUs, Nvidia is limiting the  hash-rate potential of this card. There's no mention of this anywhere in the specifications, but if you're thinking of buying one to mine, think again, and we'll show you just how artificially castrated it is later on.\nIn summary, before we go on a benchmarking journey, know that GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12GB feels like an interesting but largely unnecessary addition to the high-end gaming fold during times of constraint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Jump:\n ========== \n1 - Introduction\n2 - The Founders Edition Card\n3 - Test Methodology\n4 - Futuremark Tests I\n5 - Futuremark Tests II\n6 - Borderlands 3\n7 - DiRT 5\n8 - Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers\n9 - Forza Horizon 4\n10 - Gears Tactics\n11 - Watch Dogs: Legion \n12 - Watch Dogs: Legion DLSS\n13 - Power, Temperature and Noise\n14 - Overclocking\n15 - Overall Performance, Energy Efficiency, Mining \n16 - Conclusion\n\n\n\nNEXT PAGE  \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY HEXUS\n\n\nSign in for the best HEXUS experience\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALL EVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDUSTRY PRESS RELEASES\n\n\n\n1\nIntroducing CORSAIR\u00ae DDR5 Memory\n\n\n\n2\nCORSAIR Announces Full Range of Components\n\n\n\n3\nTwo AOC GAMING mice and a wireless headset.\n\n\n\n4\nAGON by AOC presents three displays aimed at competitive gamers \n\n\n\n5\nPhilips monitors launch the new M3000 and M5000 PC gaming monitor series\n\n\n\n6\nASUSTOR is authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMATION\n\nAbout us \nAdvertise \nContact us \nHow Competitions work \nHow we test \nAbout Cookies \nWhat our awards mean \nTerms of use\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nRSS / Alerts / Twitter \nFacebook / Newsletter \nUnsubscribe \n\n\n\nHEXUS Community\n\n\nMembers: 4\nForum posts: 353,396\nForum threads: 39,617\nCurrently active users: 99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

At $499, it arrived as a more budget-friendly option for those not ready to move to 4K. Now, Nvidia has another option: the $599 RTX 3070 Ti.Compared to the standard version, the RTX 3070 Ti has been redesigned and comes with 8GB of newer and more efficient GDDR6X RAM instead of GDDR6. Like all of Nvidia\u2019s 30-series cards, the RTX 3070 Ti also supports ray tracing and AI-powered DLSS technology to improve frame rates and maintain image quality.The bump to performance is small, though. I spent the last week testing out the RTX 3070 Ti at both 1440p and 4K, and in most titles, it falls behind AMD\u2019s cheaper RX 6800 card. I wasn\u2019t expecting the RTX 3070 Ti to come close to the RTX 3080, but there\u2019s a big enough performance gap here where it makes more sense to buy AMD\u2019s RX 6800 or be willing to pay extra for the RTX 3080.None of this pricing really matters, though. We\u2019re in the middle of a global chip shortage that\u2019s driving GPU prices to ridiculous levels way beyond $1,000 a card. You\u2019ll probably end up buying whatever GPU is available to buy at your ideal price point.7.5Verge ScoreNvidia RTX 3070 Ti$0The GoodVery quietSuited for 1440p gamingDLSS boosts frame rates at 1440p and 4KThe BadLoses out to AMD at this price750W power supply requirement and extra power drawClunky 12-pin power adapterHow we rate and review productsHardwareNvidia has turned the RTX 3070 Ti into what looks like a smaller version of the RTX 3080. It\u2019s a design bump over the RTX 3070, which results in the 3070 Ti being slightly longer and requiring more power. The RTX 3070 Ti has one fan on either side of the card, with a push-pull system in place. The bottom fan pulls cool air into the card, which then exhausts on the opposite side that\u2019s closest to your CPU cooler and rear case fan. A traditional blower cooler also exhausts the hot air out of the PCIe slot at the back.It\u2019s the same system found on the RTX 3080, and it keeps the RTX 3070 Ti humming along quietly. Just like the RTX 3070 before it, Nvidia is using its new 12-pin single power connector. It\u2019s designed to replace existing 6- or 8-pin connectors, and there\u2019s an adapter in the box. Due to the new power requirements, you\u2019ll need to use two single 8-pin connectors with the adapter. I\u2019d highly recommend just getting a single new cable (they\u2019re around $20) from your PSU supplier to connect directly to this card, as it\u2019s way less clunky than the included adapter.The RTX 3070 Ti looks more like a RTX 3080. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeThe RTX 3070 Ti has all the ports you\u2019d expect to find on a modern GPU. There\u2019s a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. While the RTX 3070 design was simple, I much prefer the look of the 3070 Ti. It doesn\u2019t have light-up LEDs like the RTX 3080, but it still looks great inside a case with a window.RelatedNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review: the 1440p sweet spotNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: 4K PC gaming finally makes senseAMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4KUnfortunately, the RTX 3070 Ti requires more power than the RTX 3070. The RTX 3070 Ti pulls up to 290 watts by itself, a more than 30 percent jump over the RTX 3070. This also means Nvidia is recommending a 750W power supply here, instead of the 650W requirement for the RTX 3070. That pushes the 3070 Ti up to the same power supply requirements as the RTX 3090, even though it consumes far less power. It\u2019s a big jump considering the RTX 2070 only needed a 550W power supply.The RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3070.

For 1440p tests, I\u2019ve also paired the GPU with a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 240Hz, as well as Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync technology.I compared the RTX 3070 Ti with the previous RTX 3070, the RTX 3080, and AMD\u2019s RX 6800 to figure out where it fits into the $599 price point. I tested a variety of AAA titles, including Fortnite, Control, Death Stranding, Metro Exodus, Call of Duty: Warzone, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and many more. You can also find the same games tested at 4K resolution below.All games were tested at max or ultra settings on the RTX 3070 Ti, and nearly all of them comfortably exceeded 60fps, with some reaching 100fps and beyond. Gears 5, Control, and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla saw the biggest gains over the RTX 3070 here, with more than 10 percent improvement each. But Call of Duty: Warzone, Death Stranding, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Watch Dogs: Legion were the same or very close.RTX 3070 Ti (1440p)BenchmarkRTX 3070 Founders EditionRTX 3070 Ti Founders EditionAMD RX 6800RTX 3080 Founders EditionMicrosoft Flight Simulator40fps39fps41fps46fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider115fps126fps136fps147fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)119fps128fpsN/A154fpsCoD: Warzone119fps119fps134fps124fpsCoD: Warzone (DLSS+RT)127fps125fps134fps (only RT)133fpsFortnite132fps142fps157fps160fpsFortnite (DLSS)153fps164fpsN/A181fpsGears 572fps84fps103fps87fpsDeath Stranding136fps136fps155fps163fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS quality)165fps153fpsN/A197fpsControl95fps107fps101fps124fpsControl (DLSS quality + RT)98fps109fps51fps (only RT)126fpsMetro Exodus43fps46fps45fps56fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS+RT)53fps56fps39fps67fpsAssassin's Creed: Valhalla64fps72fps96fps73fpsWatch Dogs: Legion65fps67fps71fps79fpsWatch Dogs: Legion (DLSS+RT)43fps44fpsN/A67fpsWatch Dogs: Legion (RT)24fps33fps28fps49fpsFortnite and Death Stranding were the best performing games at 1440p, and with DLSS enabled, both exceeded 150fps averages. The RTX 3070 Ti is extremely capable at 1440p, and if you\u2019re willing to lower settings in favor of high frame rates, then this card will pair very well with 144Hz or faster monitors.Where the RTX 3070 Ti really disappoints is when you compare it to the AMD competition. AMD\u2019s RX 6800 beats the RTX 3070 Ti in nearly every game at 1440p, with Control and Metro Exodus being the rare exceptions. Some of AMD\u2019s beats here are significant, with Gears 5 and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla both seeing more than 20 percent performance increases. I tested all cards with Nvidia\u2019s Resizable Bar enabled and AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory enabled. Both are identical technologies designed to boost frame rates, and it\u2019s clear certain games favor AMD\u2019s card here.The RTX 3070 Ti uses a push-pull cooling method. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge4K testingOver on the 4K side, performance is less impressive. I used Acer\u2019s 27-inch Nitro XV273K, a 4K monitor that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates and G-Sync support for all of the testing. None of the games came close to maxing out the 144Hz refresh rate, and if you really want high frame rate 4K gaming, then you\u2019ll need an RTX 3080 or RTX 3080 Ti.Only half of the games I tested managed to hit 60fps or beyond at 4K, and you\u2019ll need to drop settings to high or mid levels to achieve playable frame rates. Like always, DLSS helps, but ray tracing alone is too much for this card at 4K. Watch Dogs: Legion ran at just 10fps and was unplayable at ultra settings and with ray tracing on. DLSS helped bump that to a slightly more playable 26fps, but that\u2019s still not a very smooth experience.RTX 3070 Ti (4K)BenchmarkRTX 3070 Founders EditionRTX 3070 Ti Founders EditionAMD RX 6800RTX 3080 Founders EditionMicrosoft Flight Simulator21fps21fps26fps30fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider62fps69fps71fps84fpsShadow of the Tomb Raider (DLSS)75fps82fpsN/A102fpsCoD: Warzone67fps67fps84fps89fpsCoD: Warzone (DLSS+RT)68fps95fps82fps (only RT)119fpsFortnite67fps71fps76fps84fpsFortnite (DLSS)101fps108fpsN/A124fpsGears 545fps51fps56fps64fpsDeath Stranding78fps85fps90fps98fpsDeath Stranding (DLSS quality)103fps114fpsN/A131fpsControl55fps55fps51fps65fpsControl (DLSS quality + RT)54fps62fps24fps (only RT)72fpsMetro Exodus25fps28fps26fps34fpsMetro Exodus (DLSS+RT)38fps41fps22fps50fpsAssassin's Creed: Valhalla55fps63fps89fps64fpsWatch Dogs: Legion38fps39fps43fps52fpsWatch Dogs: Legion (DLSS+RT)27fps26fpsN/A40fpsWatch Dogs: Legion (RT)7fps10fps15fps21fpsMuch like at 1440p, AMD also beats Nvidia here with the RX 6800. Microsoft Flight Simulator, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, and Call of Duty: Warzone all manage more than 20 percent improvements over the RTX 3070 Ti. Where the RTX 3070 Ti really excels against AMD is when you enable DLSS, but with AMD\u2019s answer to DLSS arriving later this month, that could soon change.Some of the gaps in performance between the RTX 3070 Ti and RX 6800 are likely down to AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory performing well in certain titles, compared to Nvidia\u2019s more limited Resizable BAR support. I also noticed during Watch Dogs: Legion tests that the average frame rate varied heavily during tests, in what could be some type of driver or game bug. Nvidia is currently investigating whether this is a bug or not.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 Ti keeps quiet during demanding games. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeWith a $599 retail price, I was expecting more from the RTX 3070 Ti. AMD\u2019s RX 6800 is still technically priced lower than the RTX 3070 Ti, and my tests showed it surprisingly outperformed the Nvidia card. On the Nvidia side, you get the addition of DLSS and with that better ray-tracing performance if you couple them together. Nvidia\u2019s NVENC and professional tooling support is also extremely useful if you\u2019re video editing or streaming to Twitch.But for games, AMD\u2019s RX 6800 takes the edge at this price point. Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 Ti also only ships with 8GB of VRAM, compared to the 16GB found on the RX 6800. I can\u2019t help but feel like 8GB will be challenging at some point during the lifetime of this card, so it\u2019s a shame Nvidia only bumped the memory spec and not the size.Not that the retail pricing of either card really matters right now. The chances are very slim that you\u2019ll be able to find the RX 6800 or RTX 3070 Ti in stock this week. That means, once again, the best GPU you can buy right now is often whatever you can actually buy.Photography by Tom Warren / The VergeSee More: EntertainmentGamingPC GamingReviewsTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Huang, a big proponent of artificial intelligence, unveiled a lower resolution graphics card at the conference that has been designed specifically for crypto mining. He also addressed the global chip shortage, Nvidia's role in it and whether he believes the Chinese government will interfere in the development of artificial intelligence.\nHere are Huang's ten best quotes from the interview, lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\n\n\"Am I excited about proof of stake? The answer's yes....Ethereum has established itself. It has the opportunity now to implement a second generation that carries on from the platform approach and all of the services that are built on top of it. It's legitimate. It's established. There's a lot of credibility. It works well. A lot of people depend on it for DeFi and other things. This is a great time for proof of stake to come.\" - on the opportunities ethereum provides and the network's value for blockchain and crypto.\n\"We reduced the performance of our GPU on purpose so that if you would like to buy a GPU for gaming, you can. If you'd like to buy a GPU for crypto mining, either you can buy the CMP version, or if you really would like to use the GeForce to do it, unfortunately the performance will be reduced.\" - on how Nvidia is trying to decrease graphic card prices and why they developed CMP.\u00a0\n\"We'll just keep working with our supply chain to inform them about the changing world of IT, so that they can be better prepared for the demand that's coming in the future. But I believe that the areas that we're in, the markets that we're in, because we have very specific reasons, will have rich demand for some time to come.\" -\u00a0on managing the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors.\n\"It's now established that ethereum is going to be quite valuable. There's a future where the processing of these transactions can be a lot faster, and because there are so many people built on top of it now, ethereum is going to be valuable. \" - on the outlook for the ethereum network based on its scalability.\u00a0\n\"I believe we're right on the cusp of it. [...] There will be many types of metaverses, and video games are one of them, for example. [...] We'll see this overlay, a metaverse overlay if you will, into our physical world.\" - on when and how a metaverse will become real.\u00a0\n\"You need that blockchain to have some fundamental value, and that fundamental value could be mined. Cryptocurrency is going to be here to stay. Ethereum might not be as hot as it is now. In a year's time, it may cool down some. But I think crypto mining is here to stay.\" - on the future of crypto mining and blockchain networks.\n\"I believe that there will be a larger market, a larger industry, more designers and creators, designing digital things in virtual reality and metaverses than there will be designing things in the physical world. [...] The economy in the metaverse, the economy of Omniverse, will be larger than the economy in the physical world.

Plus as Wccftech notes, this also occurred possibly to help deal with crypto demand.In the latter case, this rumored reversal of the situation would make sense now that Nvidia has dedicated (CMP) crypto-mining GPUs to cope with the pressure on that front.Whatever\u2019s going on behind the scenes isn\u2019t clear, naturally, and we shouldn\u2019t get carried away with the theorizing \u2013 although we can obviously keep our fingers crossed that more RTX 3000 stock is on the way.Even if that\u2019s true, how much difference this move would make is another arguable point, because no one is expecting the GPU shortage to go away any time soon; we can only hope for some element of mitigation at best in the short-term, realistically. After all, Nvidia itself has admitted that stock of its graphics cards is likely to continue to come up short of demand for the rest of 2021.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for you\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

This supply boost will initially be focused on the internet caf\u00e9 market, but will allegedly trickle down to general retail as well.Find where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 TiWhere to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070: Restocks and retailers trackedPlus: AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT reveal could be imminent \u2014 here\u2019s whyWhile it\u2019s unlikely that Nvidia will be able to fully meet demand for its gaming GPUs, in theory a\u00a0supply boost could help take the pain out of hunting for GeForce RTX 3060 restocks. This model, as well as cards like the GeForce RTX 3080 and much newer GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, has been almost permanently out of stock since launch, as supply shortages bump up against a highly active reseller market and a demand boom from cryptocurrency miners.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nFinally!

These large farms tend to buy up graphics cards in bulk, causing a scarcity that in turn raises prices, so with their forced closure, GeForce RTX 3060 models have dropped in price by as much as 45%.Obviously that\u2019s only in China, not the U.S. or U.K., but it does indicate that territorial GPU prices could fall significantly once the current interest in crypto mining wanes. It may also get slightly easier to get lucky with an RTX 30-series restock if Chinese mega-farms aren\u2019t buying and importing cards from overseas retailers.We\u2019ll have to wait and see, though if nothing else it would be encouraging if Nvidia really can improve graphics cards production. We understand that a components shortage has been largely to blame for the non-availability of the latest graphics cards, both from Nvidia and AMD, so this may be the first sign of returning to normalcy. Or less intense lunacy, anyway.Plus: Steam Summer Sale 2021: dates, discounts, tips and moreToday's best gaming keyboard deals No price informationCheck Amazon No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nJames ArcherSocial Links NavigationJames is currently Hardware Editor at Rock Paper Shotgun, but before that was Audio Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide, where he covered headphones, speakers, soundbars and anything else that intentionally makes noise.

From silicon shortages to cryptocurrency craziness, the average price of a graphics card in 2021 has surged past all expectations, with models both used and new selling for multiples more than the original MSRP, even years after their initial release. But, realities of the current marketplace aside, today we're here to talk about the objective performance of the latest object of desire for GPU shoppers (and likely newest target for scalpers), the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and how it stacks up against its own (hopefully, one day!) objective MSRP of $1,199.Let's start off this graphics card review the same way we've started many over the past 12 months: We know you likely will not find the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti at MSRP for the foreseeable future, and those who do manage to get their hands on the card at a fair price likely did so either through a quick trigger finger, the luck of a draw on a GPU lottery, or by fighting fire with fire and employing a card-buying bot of their own.For those determined many, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is a gaming powerhouse almost worth fighting the hordes for. However, its high price point is the only thing that keeps it from true greatness. It's supposed to be a slightly less powerful, slightly less pricey GeForce RTX 3090 for gamers and creators. But that means it also comes with the same caveat as the original: Even with a lower MSRP from the RTX 3090, the original Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition sets up the RTX 3080 Ti for some seriously out-of-whack price-to-performance ratios. If price is no issue (and it better not be, if you can't get your hands on the first wave at MSRP), the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is a worthy buy as one of the fastest GPUs in the game today. For the rest of us, the RTX 3080 is almost as good in many 1440p and 4K runs, while costing\u2014at least at MSRP\u2014around 40% less. Now that's a discount we can get behind in 2021. Of course, you have to find either card first!RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition Specs: Playing in Elite CompanyStraight out of the gate, let's talk about the $1,199-pound gorilla in the room: the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition is, MSRP versus MSRP, more than 70% more expensive than the original GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition at $1,199 to $699. However, glance twice at the specs, and you might start to look at it another way. Despite sharing the same GA102 die and many of the same specs (discounting some slower clocks and lower VRAM), the GTX 3080 Ti is just under 15% less expensive than the RTX 3090 Founders Edition. With those numbers in mind, let's see from where Nvidia might have pulled its pricing inspiration...For starters, as we mentioned, the specs of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti have less in common with the original RTX 3080 than with Nvidia's top-dog RTX 3090 Founders Edition. When the RTX 3090 Founders Edition first launched, the card seemed stuck between two worlds. On the one hand, content creators at this price level had, for many years, defaulted to Nvidia's Titan brand of cards, usually stuffed with premium specs and as much VRAM as the technology of the time allowed for, past a certain budget. (Then you would start getting into Nvidia's Quadro workstation card territory, but no time for that today.) The gaming crowd, then, looked to the rest of the RTX and GTX lineup for cards that catered to them; think entries like the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, GTX 1660, or RTX 3080. Until the launch of today's RTX 3080 Ti, any Nvidia Founders Edition graphics card that called itself \"for gamers\" was priced under $999 at launch, a ceiling set by the RTX 2080 Ti in September of 2018. When the RTX 3090 debuted with the rest of the RTX 30 Series late last year, it assumed the de facto mantle of \"content creator card,\" inherited from the Titan line before it, but not the name. In both power and price, the Titan-esque RTX 3090 lived above the clouds with the other gods of card Olympus at $1,399 MSRP, where it still sits today. Of course, this is all in the current fairy-tale land of MSRP. Translated to today's prices via a quick scan of eBay? That \"$1,399 suggested price\" averages out to a street price of about $3,200, or roughly a 130% increase. Carry that math over to the RTX 3080 Ti, and we're talking about an RTX 3080 variant that, if trends hold, could shortly be floating right around $2,700 street (depending on whether the scalper stiffs you for shipping, of course).Image: eBayThe point? This is an ill time for Nvidia to raise the floor on what it suggests gamers will spend for cards that have essentially been rebranded as \"gaming GPUs that also work for content creation,\" and doing away with Titan and its cachet. How bad could it be? Well, we're afraid to check eBay in the days after this launch, because who knows what the price of the RTX 3080 Ti (or \"Titan Junior\") might be once the first wave sells through. (And will that be in minutes, or seconds?) The Latest Founders Edition Design: Don't Mess With SuccessIf you loved the design of previous models in Nvidia's RTX 30 Series (as we have), you'll likely be a fan of the RTX 3080 Ti and its effectively identical design, save for some added weight and length. We could gush all over again about how from both a technology and an aesthetic standpoint, the RTX 30 Series Founders Edition cards are artful marvels.\u00a0It's a familiar formula: PCBs that have been shrunk by more than 50%, in some cases, according to Nvidia, with the remaining some-odd percentage replaced by more heatsink, attached to the same push-pull fan design we saw when the RTX 30 Series debuted last fall.The 11.2-inch, double-slot card is smaller compared to some of the crazier third-party RTX 3080 models we've tested, such as the 12.3-inch MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio 10G (which you could also dub, were it a hero sandwich, the \"$1,000 footlong\"). However, the RTX 3080 Ti is just on the edge of what a strategic compact-PC builder might be able to fit in certain isolated Mini-ITX and MicroATX cases.Like the iPhone was for smartphones before it, Nvidia's RTX 30 Series is, at least in my opinion, the game-changer of GPU design going forward. Where other graphics cards can often come off as an exercise in excess (looking at you, Colorful), the RTX 30 Series Founders Edition cards remain a masterclass in restraint. The only drop of color you'll see on this card comes courtesy of our RGB RAMThe idea that Nvidia has found a way to expertly balance the space needed for a PCB against the heatsink, which itself has to offset increased heat from cramped components, is a real feat of engineering. Based on recent efforts, it could be years before AMD, or even Nvidia's own third-party manufacturing partners, catch up.The card is, once again, powered by Nvidia's proprietary 12-pin power connector, which on the RTX 3080 Ti needs two eight-pin power-supply leads to jack into. As for the port selection on the rear plane, the design and the number of available slots remains the same among Founders Edition cards in Nvidia's RTX 30 Series, with three DisplayPort 1.4b ports alongside a single HDMI 2.1 output, and a lot of backplane ventilation. (That port mix is just enough to keep up with some of Acer's new monitors slated for release this year.)Like on the RTX 3080, one port common on last-generation Turing cards is absent: the USB Type-C-lookalike VirtualLink. It's gone from all the Ampere cards so far, and we suspect, forever. It never caught on with the VR headset makers it was meant to serve. Adios, friend: Pour one out for VirtualLink.Testing the RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition: Sparrin' With the RTX 3090So, back to the card on hand. PC Labs ran the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition through a series of DirectX 11- and 12-based synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our 2021 PC Labs test rig is Intel-based and employs a PCI Express 3.0, not 4.0, motherboard. It's equipped with an Intel Core i9-10900K processor, 16GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 memory, a solid-state boot drive, and an Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero (Wi-Fi) Z490 motherboard. All cards below were retested on this rig with their latest drivers at launch for an even playing field. Given our tests with the Core i9-10900K and recent Ryzen 9 CPUs, this rig is the best reasonable configuration of the moment in 2021 to cut the CPU out of the equation for frame rates. (Read more about how we test graphics cards.)For our testing, we focused some of the effort on the esports aspect of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti with games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and Rainbow Six: Siege. We also ran the card through the rest of our new standard benchmark regimen, which tests a card's abilities to handle AAA games at the highest possible quality settings, as well as how it rides during synthetic benchmarks that stress the card in a variety of ways.Also remember that almost every test we run (aside from the esports titles) is done at the highest possible quality preset or settings. If you have a higher-hertz gaming monitor and you're worried your card might not make the frame-rate grade, it could still be possible with the right card and a combination of lower settings. Not only that, but many of these titles (including Death Stranding, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and F1 2020) have both DLSS and FidelityFX CAS with Upscaling integrated directly into the game. This can mean boosts of up to 40% more performance on top, depending on the setting and the card you're playing with.And so, onward to our test results. Note: If you want to narrow down our results below to a specific resolution (say, the resolution of the monitor you plan to game on), click the other two resolution dots in the chart legends below to suppress them and see a single set of results. Our mix of AAA titles includes a mix of recent AAA titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 and F1 2020, as well as some older-but-still-reliable pillars of the benchmarker's toolkit, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry 5.Testing Results: Synthetic BenchmarksSynthetic benchmarks can be good predictors of real-world gaming performance. UL's circa-2013 Fire Strike Ultra is still a go-to as an approximation of the load levied by mainstream 4K gaming. We're looking only at the test's Graphics Subscore, not the Overall Score, to isolate the card performance. Meanwhile, we also ran 3DMark's Time Spy Extreme test, which is a good test of how well a card will do specifically in DirectX 12 games at 4K resolution. Finally, there's Port Royal, which is strictly a test for RTX cards right now, measuring how well they handle ray-tracing tasks. (Thus why blank results for the AMD cards on that one.) Also here are a handful of GPU-acceleration tests (Furmark, LuxMark); more details on those at the \"how we test\" link above.As a \"discount\" RTX 3090 with half the available VRAM on board, synthetic testing is the first stop to show what kind of difference you can expect in rendering tasks between the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3090. Recommended by Our EditorsEVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G - ReviewMSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X 24G - ReviewColorful iGame GeForce RTX 3080 Vulcan OC 10G-V - ReviewHere the results showcase the RTX 3080 Ti, in rendering, as a price-to-performance winner over the RTX 3090. We don't run the most extreme gamut of 3D rendering tasks that the RTX 3090 and Titan variants are more famous for crunching through; however, the margins of difference in LuxMark results between the two show the RTX 3080 Ti as an impressive RTX 3090 alternative for roughly 15% less.Testing Results: Recent AAA GamesNow, on to the real-world gaming stuff. The following benchmarks are games that you can play. We typically used in each case (for these AAA games) the highest in-game preset and, if available, DirectX 12. The multiplayer-focused and esports titles (such as CS:GO and Rainbow Six) coming up in the next chart group were set slightly below top detail settings to maximize frame rates. We'll talk more about them there. If the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is the perfect 4K gamers' card (and in our opinion, it is), the RTX 3090 holds a more specialized crown: best...or, really, only card for so-called \"8K gamers.\" We don't test at 8K yet (the monitors barely exist, the game support is hardly baked), so we can't say for sure if the RTX 3080 Ti is the world's best value for 8K gaming. But from our results in 4K, we can easily see that it's overpriced if it'll serve just as a 4K gaming engine alone. The results of these gaming runs cement the identity of the RTX 3080 Ti as a down-spec RTX 3090 in disguise. The power is obviously there; however, the rubber meets the road on just how much more powerful the RTX 3080 Ti is versus the original RTX 3080. Note: On the AMD Radeon side, we haven't had an opportunity to test a Radeon RX 6900 XT for ourselves (stock of that card is scarce all around). However, the Radeon RX 6800 XT, as a near-equal to the RTX 3080 depending on the game, falls under the same category as an, ahem, relative \"value pick\" versus the RTX 3080 Ti. There will always be diminishing returns on value the higher you go in a respective GPU stack. However, at such a vast price difference taken against an average of just 14% more performance in 4K gaming, the value proposition for the RTX 3080 Ti would be tough to justify even with scalpers and GPU bots out of the picture. This is made clearer thanks to overclocked third-party GeForce RTX 3080 card versions like the MSI Gaming X Trio 10G mentioned earlier. While retailing just above the RTX 3080 Founders Edition at a $759 MSRP, it comes within just a few frames of the RTX 3080 Ti in 4K, narrowing the value proposition further still. However, the RTX 3080 Ti so regularly matches up with the RTX 3090 in these same tests (a top-of-the-top overclocked RTX 3090, no less), that it simply resembles a better RTX 3090 for 4K gaming...but no one should be buying an RTX 3090 for current-day gaming, right?Testing Results: Multiplayer GamesThough most of PC Labs' game tests are maxed out in graphical fidelity to push the cards to their limit, multiplayer gaming is all about maintaining the best balance between graphical fidelity and frame rate. With that in mind, we've kept CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Final Fantasy XIV tuned to the best combination of necessary improvements in settings (higher anti-aliasing and lower shadows, for example), while still trying to keep frame rates for 1080p games above 144fps.Why 144fps? That's a coveted target for highly competitive esports gamers who have high-refresh-rate 144Hz or 165Hz gaming monitors. For more casual players with ordinary 60Hz monitors, a solid 80fps or 90fps at your target resolution, with some overhead to account for dips under 60fps, is fine. Then again, we are talking about a $1,000-plus card here, so...As an exercise in charity for the people, I should, in good faith, ask you to skip this section entirely. If you're considering buying up what limited RTX 3080 Ti stock there is to play games like Counter-Strike Global Offensive...might I interest you in an equally-impressive Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super instead? It cleanly blows out any 360Hz monitors on shelves in 1080p and hits well above 240Hz in 1440p. Not only that, it also has the added bonus of not being a state-of-the-art card used to play a 20-year-old game!Testing Results: Legacy AAA TitlesSpeaking of \"way, way more than enough horsepower,\" let's see how the RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition does against some AAA games that have long since passed their prime as the most graphically demanding titles on shelves. We ran some quick tests on some oldies-but-goodies that still offer the AAA gaming experience. These legacy tests include runs of Tomb Raider (2013), the original Sleeping Dogs, and Bioshock: Infinite, the last being a game that has no business still being as well optimized as it is here in 2021.Do we even need to say it? It's a blowout. This is another of those \"So, how much does it win by?\" scenarios, rather than whether or not it wins at all. And again, just for the preservation of what video-card stock there is out there, we'll repeat the request from above: Please don't buy an RTX 3080 Ti (or an RTX 3090, for that matter) just to play Sleeping Dogs at a higher refresh rate than the developers could have ever dreamed of. We beg of you!Overclocking and Thermals: Almost as Cool as It LooksWe ran a 10-minute stress test in 3DMark Port Royal on the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition, and the card peaked at a temperature of 81 degrees C. That's a bit hotter than the RTX 3080 Founders Edition at 77 degrees C, and shows that as the RTX Founders Edition family scales and grows, temps grow along with it. Like in our RTX 3080 Founders Edition review, and in our FLIR One Pro thermal-camera evaluation, much of the waste heat looks to be collecting in the middle of the card, rather than in an even dispersion across its length. The Founders Edition cards have been nothing if not consistent in this regard. Go ahead, head back through some of our Founders Edition reviews and check the photos for yourself!Seeing such stable thermals gave us the confidence to see what kind of overclock we could get out of the card using the EVGA Precision X1 utility. After some tuning, I was able to achieve a stable clock of 1,915MHz, 225MHz over the baseline, which brings it just over the boost clocks of the RTX 3090 and translated to around a 5% bump in benchmark results. Founders Edition cards are known for their overclocking stubbornness, so it's nice to see anything at all in this department, let alone a perceptible gain like that. Well played, Nvidia.Verdict: The Most Muscled-Up Middle Child EverA card this small, light, quiet, and cool has no business looking as good as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition does. Nvidia is, once again, sitting pretty not only versus AMD, but also against any third-party manufacturer that produces its own RTX 3080 Ti models in tandem this launch. The company's Founders Edition cards are engineered beyond what any other card maker seems capable of these days, and the RTX 3080 Ti is yet another near-flawless example of Nvidia's technological dominance in the space.But that precision comes at a price. Oh, the price: The MSRP, and then whatever mangling the current market may wreak on it. The RTX 3080 Ti may be beautiful on the outside, and a 4K-gaming beast inside, but  it doesn't generate quite enough extra performance over the non-Ti RTX 3080 to justify the big increase in MSRP. How that plays out in real world pricing is anyone's guess, but we don't expect the price proportions to be any prettier in its favor. Think of it this way: In the current supply-squeezed ecosystem, cards are averaging between 1.25 times and 4 times their retail price on some open marketplaces. Hundreds of dollars added to the MSRP of a card\u2014like, say, $500 between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti\u2014ends up inflated by that multiple, putting the cards even further out of reach for your average buyer than they already were before. And further from each other in absolute price, as well. The GPU market of today\u2014June 2nd, 2021\u2014doesn't have tolerances for gaps like that. If you're buying an RTX 3090 or an RTX 3080 Ti, you should really love creating and gaming. But if you're just on the hunt for a gaming card that powers games in 1440p and 4K at a superhero level, the RTX 3080 (despite what eBay might say) is still objectively the better deal.That said, with crypto prices falling by the minute at this writing, it may not be long before a wave of used RTX 30 Series GPUs hits the secondhand marketplace. Soon after, we could see a stabilization of prices for newer GPUs like the RTX 3080 Ti, in which case it may be only a few months before you're able to get your hands on an RTX 3080 Ti at the $1,199 price point that Nvidia is suggesting to retailers at launch. (That would make it a steal vs. the current RTX 3080 street price of $1,399, but presumably the RTX 3080 would drop proportionally, too.)The RTX 3080 Ti isn't a bad graphics card by any stretch, far from it. It's a wild beast of a 4K card. It's just that the RTX 3080 is a really great one, especially at the price at which it first launched. If the card market stabilizes in 2021, a $699 version of an RTX 3080 will still be the best thing to happen to 4K gaming yet, perhaps surpassed in certain situations only by the equally stellar GeForce RTX 3070.The Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti isn't a faster RTX 3080; it's a slower RTX 3090. As an $1,199 card, the RTX 3080 Ti is a discounted RTX 3090 that, like that card and the Titans before it, should only be seriously considered by content creators and Powerball winners. As such, it deftly wiggles itself into a niche slot for budget-focused content creators who might be able to take the VRAM and clock-speed hit without losing anything visible in their render times. But for gamers, the RTX 3080 (and AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, for that matter) are both worthy-enough 4K players to remain the premier options for 4K gamers headed into the second half of this, the craziest of all GPU years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PCMag Middle East newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Chris Stobing\n\n\n\n\nI'm a senior analyst charged with testing and reviewing VPNs and other security apps for PCMag.

It\u2019s an exceptional graphics card for 4K gaming with no major weak links, but the Founders Edition cooler isn\u2019t quite as impressive in this form and still needs an ugly power adapter.

GeForce\u2019s new \u201cgaming flagship,\u201d as Nvidia calls it, blazes through games almost as quickly as the ferocious GeForce RTX 3090. By halving the amount of ultra-fast GDDR6X memory to 12GB, this graphics card still packs more than enough VRAM to game at 4K resolution while clocking in at $300 less (though you\u2019ll no doubt wind up paying more on the street, because\u00a0graphics card pricing is insane right now).\nIt\u2019s not all addition through subtraction, though. The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti weaves in performance-boosting PCIe Resizable BAR support in select titles, which Nvidia debuted after the launch of the original RTX 3080 in response to AMD\u2019s rival Smart Access Memory. You\u2019ll find Nvidia\u2019s new \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d technology enabled as well, which cripples the card\u2019s cryptocurrency mining performance. The RTX 3080 Ti also leverages Nvidia\u2019s suite of truly killer software features, such as DLSS 2.0, the latency-reducing Nvidia Reflex API for esports games, Nvidia Broadcast\u2019s AI-powered tools for streamers and video producers, the always-excellent NVENC encoder, and more.\n\nThis is the GeForce card that deep-pocketed gamers should buy, not the RTX 3090. But does Nvidia\u2019s latest and (almost) greatest GPU pack enough of a punch to render AMD\u2019s $1,000 Radeon RX 6900 XT obsolete? Let\u2019s take Nvidia\u2019s own GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition to the test bench.\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti specs, features, and design\nWhen you take a peek at the spec sheet it\u2019s easy to see why the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti hits so hard. Under the hood, this GPU has much more in common with Nvidia\u2019s work-hard, play-hard 3090 than the $700 RTX 3080 that shares its name. Nvidia says it\u2019s also up to 1.5X faster than the RTX 2080 Ti that this card replaces.\u00a0\n\n\n\n Nvidia\n\nThat\u2019s a massive leap in power draw (TGP), though.\n\n\nBecause this \u201cTi\u201d refresh builds upon the Nvidia Ampere GPUs that came before it in the RTX 30-series lineup, we won\u2019t wade too deeply into details here, sticking largely to major differences. Our GeForce RTX 3080 review gets into Ampere\u2019s nitty-gritty enhancements and tweaks.\nThe most important thing to look at is the CUDA core count, as that\u2019s a key indicator of performance for Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards. With a whopping 10,240 cores, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti isn\u2019t much of a cut-down GPU\u2014the RTX 3090 has 10,496. By contrast, the RTX 3080 wields 8,704 CUDA cores. That alone should clue you in to how powerful the new 3080 Ti is. Our benchmarks will show it leaving the vanilla 3080 in the dust and landing right next to the 3090 in raw gaming performance.\nAnd make no mistake: This is a proper gaming card, not a work/play hybrid like the RTX 3090. While that beast comes outfitted with a gargantuan 24GB of cutting-edge GDDR6X memory, the RTX 3080 Ti comes with a more gaming-appropriate 12GB over the same wide 384-bit bus. That gives the GPU a blistering 912GB/s of memory bandwidth, just behind the 3090\u2019s 936GBps pace\u2014more than enough for high-resolution gaming, especially when paired with so much memory capacity. The vanilla RTX 3080 offers a much lower (but fine!) 760GBps with its 10GB of GDDR6X and 320-bit bus.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAMD\u2019s rival Radeon RX 6900 XT, on the other hand, packs in more raw capacity\u201416GB\u2014but of the slower GDDR6 variety across a smaller 256-bit bus, so it only has an effectively memory bandwidth of 512GBps. That\u2019s a bit deceiving though, as AMD\u2019s RDNA 2 architecture includes a very high bandwidth \u201cInfinity Cache\u201d right on the GPU die itself that can handle many frame buffer tasks without needing to access the graphics card\u2019s memory. Nvidia\u2019s cards lack a similar feature and rely on the raw power of GDDR6X over a wider bus. In practice, however, all of these high-end GeForce and Radeon cards deliver plenty of bandwidth and performance for 4K gaming.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition physically resembles its vanilla 3080 FE counterpart more than the 3090, however. All RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards sport the same fundamental (and radical) design, with a \u201cpush-pull\u201d configuration that features a blower-style fan at the rear paired with a second fan that pulls air through the card to exhaust heat upward into your case, where your CPU cooler and case fans can deal with it. (No, that doesn\u2019t make your CPU run hotter.)\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe 12-pin connector is embedded in the metal fins on the side of the card and require using an included (ugly) 2x 8-pin connector.\n\n\nThey also include Nvidia\u2019s new 12-pin power connector\u2014an adapter to plug into a pair of traditional 8-pin connectors is found in the box\u2014and a shroud design that\u2019s absolutely bristling with thick metal fins that effectively turn the entire graphics card into a heat sink. It\u2019s gorgeous.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nYou\u2019ll also find an HDMI 2.1 connection and a trio of DisplayPorts, each capable of handling 4K video feeds with ease. You\u00a0won\u2019t find extra features such as customizable RGB lighting, fan headers, or a dual-BIOS switch on FE cards, however.\nNvidia differentiates the RTX 3080 Ti from the RTX 3090 here as well, and potentially tossed its board partners a bone in the process. The Ti\u2019s cooler comes in the same two-slot design as the original RTX 3080. Nvidia expanded the RTX 3090 to a chonky three-slot thickness, which fantastically tamed the monstrous GPU. Cramming the RTX 3080 Ti\u2014which, again, is just a hair less powerful than the 3090\u2014into the 3080\u2019s dual-slot design results in higher temperatures than we see in either of the non-Ti models, and unlike the 3090, you can faintly hear the 3080 Ti working under full load. It\u2019s still a fine cooler, and a good one at that, but if you want the best, you\u2019ll still need to spring for the flagship\u2014or for a premium third-party custom 3080 Ti with a beefier body and more cooling and power management technology inside.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nThe RTX 3090 FE (left) is both much thicker and a bit longer than the RTX 3080 Ti FE (right).\n\n\nSpeaking of which, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti also includes Nvidia\u2019s \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d technology, which halves the effectiveness of mining the Ethereum cryptocurrency in half in a bid to free up GeForce stock for PC gamers during this unprecedented GPU shortage. The LHR tech is being built into all new GeForce GPUs except the 3090, as that luxury-priced graphics card is already intended to dominate at tasks that can make you money rather than simply amuse. Rumors ahead of the RTX 3080 Ti\u2019s reveal whispered that Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition model specifically lacks the LHR limiter, but that\u2019s not true. The FE card\u2019s mining efficiency is just as nerfed as it is for third-party RTX 3080 Tis by the likes of EVGA, Asus, MSI, and so on.\nBeyond that, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti includes everything you get with all RTX 30-series GPUs: Best-in-class ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, Nvidia Reflex\u2019s awesome latency lowering capabilities, the best-in-class NVENC encoder for streaming and video creation, and so on.\nBut enough chit-chat. Let\u2019s get into how the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti compares against not just Nvidia\u2019s other GPUs, but AMD\u2019s shockingly potent Radeon RX 6900 XT.\nNext page: Our test system, benchmarks begin\n\n\n\nOur test system\nWe\u2019re using our new AMD Ryzen 5000-series test rig to be able to benchmark the effect of PCIe 4.0 support on modern GPUs, as well as the performance-boosting AMD Smart Access Memory and Nvidia Resizable BAR features (which are both based on the same underlying PCIe standard) in spin-off evaluations. Currently, we\u2019re testing it on an open bench with AMD\u2019s Wraith Max air cooler; in the future, we\u2019ll both be moving the setup into a case and adding an NZXT Kraken liquid cooler to the mix. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settings\nAMD Wraith Max cooler\nMSI Godlike X570 motherboard\n32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\n1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD\n\nWe\u2019re comparing the $1,200 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti against Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition models of the $1,500 RTX 3090 and $700 RTX 3080, of course, as well as AMD\u2019s rival $1,000 Radeon RX 6900 XT. Time constraints caused by this GPU\u2019s launch during Computex on a holiday weekend prevented us from testing additional cards like the Radeon RX 6800 XT or last generation\u2019s RTX 2080 Ti, alas, and we weren\u2019t able to test Resizable BAR or ray tracing performance either. That said, because the 3080 Ti is essentially a 3090 with less memory, its ray tracing and DLSS performance should be nearly identical to that card\u2019s. You can see how the comparison GPUs all handle ray tracing in our Radeon RX 6900 XT review.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$999.99 at  Amazon  | \n$1000 at  AMD \n\n\n\n\n\nThis evaluation focuses purely on traditional gaming benchmarks. We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits. We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test.\nSpoiler alert: The RTX 3080 Ti is only a hair slower than the 3090, and matches or beats the high-end Radeon in all games except a few that strongly favor AMD\u2019s architecture. Because of that we\u2019re going to present these benchmark charts but save our wrap-up commentary for the end.\n\nGaming performance benchmarks\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nWatch Dogs: Legion\u00a0is one of the first games to debut on next-gen consoles. Ubisoft upgraded its Disrupt engine to include cutting-edge features like real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. We disable those effects for this testing, but\u00a0Legion\u00a0remains a strenuous game even on high-end hardware with its optional high-resolution texture pack installed. Few cards can maintain a 60-frames-per-second average with Ultra graphics options enabled, and the game allocates more than 8GB of memory even at 1440p. Oof.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, PlayStation exclusives are coming to the PC now.\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers\u00a0Death Stranding.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics\u00a0puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the\u00a0XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\n\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark\u00a0Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\u00a0is more fun when you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but\u00a0it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API,\u00a0Youngblood\u00a0achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we tested Riverside.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019,\u00a0Metro Exodus\u00a0remains one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. The Extreme graphics preset we benchmark can melt even the most powerful modern hardware, as you\u2019ll see below, though the game\u2019s Ultra and High presets still look good at much higher frame rates.\nWe test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands\u00a0is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter. This game tends to favor AMD hardware.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular\u00a0Total War\u00a0saga,\u00a0Troy\u00a0was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale.\u00a0Total War: Troy\u00a0is built using a modified version of the\u00a0Total War: Warhammer 2\u00a0engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We test the more intensive battle benchmark.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s still utterly\u00a0gorgeous a couple of years after its debut. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12 and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider\u00a0and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nRainbow Six Siege\u00a0still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and Ubisoft supports it with frequent updates and events. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: Power, thermals, and noise\n\n\n\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRTX 3090-like performance means RTX 3090-like power draws. Like other Nvidia Ampere GPUs, the RTX 3080 Ti draws a staggering amount of power, due in part to the high energy needs of that blazing-fast GDDR6X memory that provides so much bandwidth. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6900 XT and its standard GDDR6 memory draws significantly less power\u2014even less than the non-Ti 3080!\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s radical new cooler still delivers a very good experience\u2014AMD\u2019s standard triple-fan reference card runs hotter by several degrees. But opting for a dual-slot design makes the 3080 Ti Founders Edition less exceptional cooling-wise than the other high-end members of the RTX 30-series family. Nvidia tamed the 3090 with a massive triple-slot cooler for wondrous results. Shoving nearly the same GPU into the vanilla 3080\u2019s dual-slot design means the Ti model runs a bit hotter and slightly noisier than its siblings. Custom boards will have plenty of room to improve things with bulkier configurations.\nThat said, the Founders Edition provides a good overall experience: 75 degrees Celsius is a fine temperature for a GPU. While you can hear the 3080 Ti FE\u2019s fans blowing during gameplay, they aren\u2019t loud by any means. Nvidia\u2019s engineers did good with this design.\nNext page: Should you buy the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti?\n\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti?\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t buy\u00a0any\u00a0graphics card right now, as I said in\u00a0our GeForce RTX 3060 and Radeon RX 6700 XT reviews. Prices are just plain ridonkulous. I\u2019d recommend most people sit on the sidelines and stream their PC games via\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now service\u00a0until the dust settles. While this card ostensibly costs $1,200, I\u2019d expect the RTX 3080 Ti to go for two grand or more until the crippling GPU shortage ends.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that the price for Ti-grade cards continues creeping upward. Most RTX 2080 Ti offerings started at the same $1,200 as Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition model, sure, but that GPU actually carried a baseline retail price of $999\u2014and yes, some custom cards actually cost that. Meanwhile the GTX 1080 Ti that Nvidia hopes you upgrade from launched at \u201cjust\u201d $700 in 2017. If you do move from the 1080 Ti to the 3080 Ti, and you\u2019re able to find one at its MSRP, you\u2019re still spending $500 more out of the gate.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,829.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nAll that said, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is essentially a 3090 with half the VRAM for $300 less. That makes it much more compelling for gaming, as the 3090\u2019s 24GB was overkill unless you\u2019re performing content creation. The extra 2GB of capacity over the vanilla RTX 3080 makes this feel like a better option for long-term 4K gaming. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6900 XT has 16GB, but of the slower (but still fine) GDDR6 variety. \u00a0\nI\u2019d personally prefer the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition over the Radeon RX 6900 XT thanks to its faster 4K gaming performance overall. AMD earns a few additional victories at 1440p thanks to its Infinity Cache, and even the 3080 TI\u2019s deep arsenal of Nvidia features like DLSS, Broadcast, Reflex, Shadowplay, NVENC, and so on doesn\u2019t render AMD\u2019s Radeon flagship obsolete. If Nvidia priced it at $1,000 (which I think would be a much better MSRP), however, the Radeon rival would be a much harder sell. Pricing it at $1,200 leaves ample room for every high-end card released thus far. There are still reasons to go with the Radeon as well as the RTX 3080 and 3090.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nOf course, this is all academic while graphics cards cost so much due to a mixture of sky-high demand and a crippling chip shortage. Hopefully the new \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d technology Nvidia is working into all newly built GPUs except the RTX 3090 will motivate professional cryptominers to skip over the high-priced RTX 3080 Ti. It\u2019s a lot harder to justify such a large expense when you\u2019re mining Ethereum at half the rate you should be.\n\nBottom line? The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is a monster GPU worthy of being called a gaming flagship\u2014something the 3090 couldn\u2019t claim thanks to its massive memory buffer, high price, and content creation focus, and something the 3080 couldn\u2019t claim thanks to its somewhat skimpy 10GB of VRAM. The dual-slot Founders Edition design isn\u2019t as impressive as the FE coolers on those other cards, but it still does an admirable job. Unlike its other RTX 30-series cousins, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has no weak links (aside from the ugly 12-pin cable adapter and high price).\nIf you\u2019re looking to drop four figures on a graphics card that can power no-compromises 4K experiences, Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 Ti is well worth the money. But if money\u00a0is an object, the $700 GeForce RTX 3080 and $650 Radeon RX 6800 XT also deliver very, very good 60-fps+ 4K gaming experiences for significantly less money\u2026when you can find them. In today\u2019s wild world,\u00a0all of these GPUs will set you back four figures.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1200\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The problem is, though, that every other graphics card can do that right now, meaning there's little reason to pick the RTX 3070 Ti over another GPU.

Find out more about how we test.\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 has been out for about eight months now, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is here. That's typically the time frame we see for mid-generation refreshes, but in the world of the best graphics cards we're far from \"typical times\". Right now, it's incredibly difficult to buy a new graphics card, let alone the RTX 3070, which is by and large the best GPU for most people.\u00a0So, you would think a refreshed version of that graphics card would make sense \u2013 but the pricing is completely wrong. Starting at $599 (\u00a3529, AU$959) \u2013 with prices for aftermarket versions likely getting exponentially higher \u2013 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is a full 20% more expensive than the RTX 3070, and you're not even getting that much more performance out of it. In most games, the RTX 3070 Ti is just 5-10% faster, according to our tests, and is absolutely not worth the difference in price. Once the market comes back to normal, there will be no reason to ever buy this card.But, right now the market is anything but normal, and our advice is still basically \"buy any graphics card you can find at or near MSRP\". And at the end of the day, if the RTX 3070 Ti is the graphics card you can find, it still delivers an excellent 1440p gaming experience, and can even stretch its legs into 4K given the opportunity \u2013 though this shouldn't be your first choice of a 4K graphics card.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nI really wanted to like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, but it broke my heart and it shouldn't have to break yours, too\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)Price and availabilityNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti at Amazon for $1,257.71The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is available June 10, starting at $599 (\u00a3529, AU$959). That makes it quite a bit more expensive than the original RTX 3070 at $499 (\u00a3469, AU$809), with the same difference between it and the $699 (\u00a3649, about AU$950) RTX 3080. However, while the RTX 3070 Ti sits right in the middle of the two Ampere heavyweights in price, it's much closer to the RTX 3070 in performance than the RTX 3080.\u00a0That puts the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti in a really awkward position, especially once the graphics card market returns to any semblance of normality. Because, as we'll explore further later on, this graphics card does not separate itself enough from the RTX 3070 to actually be worth the extra cash.\u00a0And, even if you do have the budget to get something more expensive than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, you shouldn't be going for the RTX 3070 Ti, because the RTX 3080 is going to be a much more impactful difference. Where the RTX 3070 is a champion of providing excellent value for the money, the RTX 3070 Ti completely goes against that card's legacy and feels more like a cash grab - it really should be sitting at around $549, with how much of an improvement it actually brings to the table.But the fact remains that if you're on the market for a graphics card, and you see the RTX 3070 Ti around its actual MSRP, you should actually jump on it. But we wouldn't recommend that you go after the RTX 3070 Ti exclusively, because in any other world, either the RTX 3070 or the RTX 3080 simply make more sense.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Chipset and featuresThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is built on the same Ampere graphics architecture as the rest of the RTX 30 series graphics cards. We've gone in-depth on this architecture in our RTX 3080 review, but we'll give a bit of a refresher here.With the Ampere graphics architecture, the biggest difference over the last-generation Turing lineup is that Nvidia was able to essentially double FP32 datapaths per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). That essentially means that while something like the RTX 2070 Super had 2,560 CUDA cores over 40 SMs, an Ampere graphics card with the same amount of SMs would have 5,120 CUDA cores.\u00a0When combined with the second-generation RT cores and third-generation Tensor cores, this means the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-series is a pretty massive improvement over the 20-series.\u00a0As for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti itself, you're looking at 48 SMs with a total of 6,144 CUDA cores, 48 RT cores, 96 Tensor cores and 8GB of GDDR6X memory on a 256 bit bus \u2013 which is a pretty massive boost over the last-generation RTX 2070 Super. But it's a different story when you look at the RTX 3070.\u00a0The original mid-range champion has 46 SMs with 5,888 CUDA cores, alongside 8GB of GDDR6 memory on the same 256-bit bus. So, you're essentially paying an extra $100 \u2013 assuming you can buy at MSRP \u2013 for 2 extra streaming multiprocessors and faster memory. When we look at the specs on paper, this graphics card would have been much better served as a replacement for the RTX 3070 at around the same price, rather than a significantly more expensive successor.\u00a0That slight boost in power also comes with a higher TGP (total graphics power) budget of 290W, which is about where the RTX 3070 Ti peaked in our testing. With a power budget this high, Nvidia is recommending at least a 750W power supply, which is more than the recommended 650W PSU recommended for the vanilla RTX 3070. That means the RTX 3070 is also probably a better pick for folks that are using small form-factor cases.\u00a0Unlike the RTX 3070, however, every RTX 3070 Ti will come with Nvidia's LHR (light hash rate) cryptocurrency limiter. This will detect the Ethereum mining algorithm and slow down the graphics card. Ideally, this will stop miners from buying up all the stock, but only time will tell how effective it is.\u00a0Of course, because the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is an Ampere GPU, that means you get access to all of Nvidia's juicy software features. RTX Broadcast is a godsend both for streamers and for anyone that has to do a lot of video calls \u2013 it filters out background noise from your microphone and headphones, and can even completely replace your background on camera without a green screen. These features work far better than similar solutions built into Zoom or Google Hangouts, too.\u00a0And, obviously, you can't talk about the RTX 3070 Ti without talking about, well, RTX. Just like the rest of the cards of this generation, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti has RT cores, with accelerate ray tracing, making games that support it, well, playable. These days, the amount of games that support the technology is growing, thanks in large part to AMD graphics cards also able to power ray-traced workloads.\u00a0However, turning on ray tracing is generally a pretty huge performance hit, which means DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) comes in handy to lighten the load a bit. This tech uses AI to upscale your game from a lower resolution to your native resolution, so you can turn on more eye candy without turning your game into a slideshow.Generally speaking, especially if you plan on pushing the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti into 4K, you should enable DLSS whenever it's available. The tech has come quite a long way since it was initially implemented with Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Metro Exodus, and it's basically free performance.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)DesignOne of the biggest drawbacks to the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti Founders Editions, when compared to the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 were the fan configurations. Rather than the unique pass-through design, they resembled a traditional dual-fan design.\u00a0This wasn't too big a deal for those cards, mostly due the lower TGP. However, the RTX 3070 Ti gets close to 300W, which means it needs more robust cooling, and Nvidia has provided.\u00a0The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition looks very similar to the RTX 3080 Ti, only it's a bit shorter, at 10.5 inches to the RTX 3080 Ti's 11.2 inches. That will make it a bit easier to fit into small cases, but it's still a bit bigger than the original RTX 3070, which is 9.5 inches long.\u00a0This extra inch allows Nvidia to move one of the fans from the front of the card to the back of the card. This cooling configuration pulls air through the bottom of your case and routes it through your graphics card, shooting the hot air through the top of your case.\u00a0It's an extremely effective method of cooling your graphics card, and it meant that even testing it during the middle of a heatwave in New York City, the RTX 3070 Ti peaked at just 82\u00b0C. That's a bit higher than the RTX 3080 in the same conditions, but we attribute that to the slightly shorter card.\u00a0Like the rest of the Founders Editions this generation, the RTX 3070 Ti is a gorgeous graphics card with a black heatsink, surrounded by a gunmetal gray trim. It looks amazing on our test bench, and we find it hard to imagine any case where it'll look out of place.But it carries the same issue as the rest of them, too: the power connector. Nvidia is sticking to the 12-pin power connector, and it's something we'll just have to get used to. Luckily, because hardly anyone has a power supply with these power connectors, Nvidia does include a 2 x 8-pin to 1 x 12-pin adapter in the box.\u00a0As for ports, you get one HDMI 2.1 and three DisplayPort 1.4, also the same as every other RTX 30-series card. And, we still miss USB-C, and we're going to keep complaining about it until Nvidia brings it back.\u00a0Image 1 of 28(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)PerformanceTest system specsThis is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition:CPU:\u00a0Intel Core i9-11900K (8-core, up to 5.3GHz)\nCPU Cooler:\u00a0Cooler Master Masterliquid 360P Silver Edition\nRAM:\u00a064GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 3,200MHz\nMotherboard:\u00a0MSI MEG Z590 ACE\nSSD:\u00a0ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB\nPower Supply:\u00a0Phanteks RevoltX 1200\nCase:\u00a0Praxis WetbenchIf it existed in a vacuum, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti would be an excellent graphics card. At 1440p, the RTX 3070 Ti is an absolute powerhouse, blowing through every game in our test suite with at least 60, but mostly around 100+ fps. Even in Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition, without DLSS, the RTX 3070 Ti sat pretty at 66 fps at 1440p - and that's with all the shiny ray-traced effects enabled.\u00a0Even at 4K the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is nothing to shake a stick at. In games like Dirt 5, Final Fantasy XIV and Horizon Zero Dawn, the RTX 3070 Ti has no problem at all staying well above 60 fps at max settings, making this an easy choice if you play a lot of MMOs and want to play at 4K.\u00a0But the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti doesn't exist in a vacuum. At 1440p, the RTX 3070 Ti is faster than the RTX 3070, but not so much that it'll make a huge difference. In Metro Exodus, we're talking the difference between 60 fps and 66 fps. That is a pretty solid 10% jump, but it's not going to exactly be noticeable, and probably isn't worth the 20% price premium you're going to pay.\u00a0And while the RTX 3070 Ti can do 4K gaming, and can do it quite well, it doesn't really come close to the RTX 3080. Looking again at Metro Exodus, the RTX 3080 is a whopping 23% faster, and just 16% more expensive. That means that the RTX 3080, even though it's more expensive, is simply a better value.\u00a0So while the RTX 3070 Ti definitely works, and provides some excellent gaming performance, we can't really recommend it. And it's not because the RTX 3070 Ti is a bad card, the problem is instead that the other graphics cards out there are so good, that it makes the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti completely pointless.(Image credit: Future)Buy it if...You just need a graphics card\nWe get it, it's hard to buy a graphics card. So, if you can find the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti around its $599 MSRP, it's probably worth jumping on.\u00a0You're playing games at 1440p\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is probably one of the best graphics cards for 1440p gaming right now.You want an attractive Founders Edition\nLike the rest of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-series, the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition is a gorgeous piece of hardware that will look good in any case.\u00a0Don't buy it if...You can afford an RTX 3080\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is just $100 more than the RTX 3070 Ti and provides a huge jump in performance.\u00a0You can find an RTX 3070\nWhile the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is faster than the original RTX 3070, it's not enough of a performance boost to be worth the higher price tag.\u00a0You have less than a 750W PSU\nIn the past a lot of mid-range cards like the GTX 1070 Ti and RTX 2070 Super only needed a 550W PSU, so you may need to upgrade your power supply for the RTX 3070 Ti, which is quite a chore.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: Price Comparison $1,257.71View $1,479.90View $1,484.99ViewLow Stock $1,504.99ViewLow Stock $1,688.88ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJackie ThomasSocial Links NavigationJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.

Average prices for the latest NVIDIA and AMD cards have dropped by as much as 50 percent over there, which is one of the biggest price drops yet.A certain Reddit user plotted the data on the chart, and the numbers don't seem to lie. As soon as June started, GPU prices are on the downward trend, with several of the latest releases from NVIDIA (i.e. RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3060/3060 Ti) dropping to their lowest asking prices since launch.Digital Trends also picked up on the trend, stating that the pricing for the NVIDIA RTX 3080 (which has become the \"poster child\" of the GPU shortage) dropped from around $2700 minimum to around $1700 within a one-month span. That's already a massive $1000 discount, though it's still far from the advertised MSRP of $699.Graphics cards from Team Red are on a downward trend as well when it comes to pricing. The RX 6700 XT, for one, now sits at an average of 799 (roughly $947 at the time of this writing) as of June 17, from a high of 929 ($1100) a month ago, as reported by Tom's Hardware. Other RDNA2 cards have also seen $100-$300 price drops.Read also: NVIDIA Will Soon Kill Driver Support for the 600, 700 Series; Can You Still Upgrade in Time?NVIDIA and AMD Finally Keeping Up With Demand?NVIDIA made headlines earlier this year for claiming that the GPU shortage will last until 2021 ends. Perhaps they didn't really see this trend coming, but maybe they should have.One of the biggest contributing factors to graphics card prices going berserk is the current cryptocurrency mining boom. Miners have been snagging GPU stocks since last year, which caused street pricing to go bonkers. This is why NVIDIA tried its absolute best to sway miners from buying up stocks by releasing LHR versions of the RTX 3000 line. And these cards actually work, too.But does this mean NVIDIA and AMD are now keeping up with demand? Not really, though actual GPU stocks are doing fine. Major retailers do have graphics cards for sale right now, even if the prices are still inflated.Crypto Mining Not As Profitable AnymoreAsrock, a major GPU maker, forecasts that graphics card demand from miners is going to decrease soon. And that's because some major governments (China, specifically) are cracking down at crypto mining, mainly due to its insane power requirements. It also doesn't help that crypto values are becoming increasingly volatile, which means miners aren't earning as much in the long run.\n\n\n\nAlpine Mining co-founder and CEO Ludovic Thomas works at company's main cryptocurrency mining site jam-packed with metal racks lined with hundreds upon hundreds of graphic cards in the tiny southern Swiss village of Gondo on March 9, 2018.\n\nFABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf you're a PC gamer, then you should brace yourself: the GPU-pocalypse could finally end soon.Related:\nGPU 101: How To Extend The Lifespan Of Your Graphics CardThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by RJ Pierce  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

First announced in NVIDIA\u2019s custom SXM form factor last fall, the 80GB version of the A100 was introduced to not only expand the total memory capacity of an A100 accelerator \u2013 doubling it from 40GB to 80GB \u2013 but it also offered a rare mid-generation spec bump as well, cranking up the memory clockspeeds by a further 33%. Now, after a bit over 6 months, NVIDIA is releasing a PCIe version of the accelerator for customers who need discrete add-in cards.\nThe new 80GB version of the PCIe A100 joins the existing 40GB version, and NVIDIA will continue selling both versions of the card. On the whole, this is a pretty straightforward transfer of the 80GB SMX A100 over to PCIe, with NVIDIA dialing down the TDP of the card and the number of exposed NVLinks to match the capabilities of the form factor. The release of the 80GB PCIe card is designed to give NVIDIA\u2019s traditional PCIe form factor customers a second, higher-performing accelerator option, particularly for those users who need more than 40GB of GPU memory.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\n80GB A100\n\t\t\t(PCIe)\n80GB A100\n\t\t\t(SXM4)\n40GB A100\n\t\t\t(PCIe)\n40GB A100\n\t\t\t(SXM4)\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n6912\n6912\n6912\n6912\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.41GHz\n1.41GHz\n1.41GHz\n1.41GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n3.0 Gbps HBM2\n3.2 Gbps HBM2\n2.43Gbps HBM2\n2.43Gbps HBM2\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n5120-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n1.9TB/sec\n\t\t\t(1935GB/sec)\n2.0TB/sec\n\t\t\t(2039GB/sec)\n1.6TB/sec\n\t\t\t(1555GB/sec)\n1.6TB/sec\n\t\t\t(1555GB/sec)\n\n\nVRAM\n80GB\n80GB\n40GB\n40GB\n\n\nSingle Precision\n19.5 TFLOPs\n19.5 TFLOPs\n19.5 TFLOPs\n19.5 TFLOPs\n\n\nDouble Precision\n9.7 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n9.7 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n9.7 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n9.7 TFLOPs\n\t\t\t(1/2 FP32 rate)\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n624 TOPs\n624 TOPs\n624 TOPs\n624 TOPs\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n312 TFLOPs\n312 TFLOPs\n312 TFLOPs\n312 TFLOPs\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n156 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs\n\n\nRelative Performance (SXM Version)\n90%?\n100%\n90%\n100%\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 3\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\nNVLink 3\n\t\t\t12 Links (600GB/sec)\n\n\nGPU\nGA100\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGA100\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGA100\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\nGA100\n\t\t\t(826mm2)\n\n\nTransistor Count\n54.2B\n54.2B\n54.2B\n54.2B\n\n\nTDP\n300W\n400W\n250W\n400W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 7N\n\n\nInterface\nPCIe 4.0\nSXM4\nPCIe 4.0\nSXM4\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\n\nAt a high level, the 80GB upgrade to the PCIe A100 is pretty much identical to what NVIDIA did for the SXM version. The 80GB card\u2019s GPU is being clocked identically to the 40GB card\u2019s, and the resulting performance throughput claims are unchanged.\nInstead, this release is all about the on-board memory, with NVIDIA equipping the card with newer HBM2E memory. HBM2E is the informal name given to the most recent update to the HBM2 memory standard, which back in February of this year defined a new maximum memory speed of 3.2Gbps/pin. Coupled with that frequency improvement, manufacturing improvements have also allowed memory manufacturers to double the capacity of the memory, going from 1GB/die to 2GB/die. The net result being that HBM2E offers both greater capacities as well as greater bandwidths, two things which NVIDIA is taking advantage of here.\nWith 5 active stacks of 16GB, 8-Hi memory, the updated PCIe A100 gets a total of 80GB of memory. Which, running at 3.0Gbps/pin, works out to just under 1.9TB/sec of memory bandwidth for the accelerator, a 25% increase over the 40GB version. This means that not only does the 80GB accelerator offer more local storage, but rare for a larger capacity model, it also offers some extra memory bandwidth to go with it. That means that in memory bandwidth-bound workloads the 80GB version should be faster than the 40GB version even without using its extra memory capacity.\nThis additional memory does come at a cost, however: power consumption. For the 80GB A100 NVIDIA has needed to dial things up to 300W to accommodate the higher power consumption of the denser, higher frequency HBM2E stacks. This is a very notable (if not outright surprising) change in TDPs due to the fact that NVIDIA has long held the line for its PCIe compute accelerators at 250W, which is broadly considered the limits for PCIe cooling. So a 300W card not only deviates from NVIDIA\u2019s past cards, but it means that system integrators will need to find a way to provide another 50W of cooling per card. This isn\u2019t something I expect to be a hurdle for too many designs, but I definitely won\u2019t be surprised if some integrators continue to only offer 40GB cards as a result.\nAnd even then, the 80GB PCIe A100 would seem to be held back a bit by its form factor. The 3.0Gbps memory clock is 7% lower than the 80GB SXM A100 and its 3.2Gbps memory clock. So NVIDIA is apparently leaving some memory bandwidth on the table just to get the card to fit in the expanded 300W profile.\n\nOn that note, it doesn\u2019t appear that NVIDIA has changed the form factor of the PCIe A100 itself. The card is entirely passively cooled, designed to be used with servers with (even more) powerful chassis fans, and fed by dual 8-pin PCIe power connectors.\nWith regards to overall performance expectations, the new 80GB PCIe card should trail the SXM card in a similar fashion as the 40GB models. Unfortunately, NVIDIA\u2019s updated A100 datasheet doesn\u2019t include a relative performance metric this time around, so we don\u2019t have any official figures for how the PCIe card will compare to the SXM card. But, given the continued TDP differences (300W vs 400W+), I would expect that the real-world performance of the 80GB PCIe card is near the same 90% mark as the 40GB PCIe card. Which serves to reiterate that GPUs clockspeed aren\u2019t everything, especially in this age of TDP-constrained hardware.\nIn any case, the 80GB PCIe A100 is designed to appeal to the same broad use cases as the SXM version of the card, which roughly boils down to AI dataset sizes, and enabling larger Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) instances. In the case of AI, there are numerous workloads which can benefit in terms of training time or accuracy by using a larger dataset, and overall GPU memory capacity has regularly been a bottleneck in this field, as there\u2019s always someone who could use more memory. Meanwhile NVIDIA\u2019s MIG technology, which was introduced on the A100, benefits from the memory increase by allowing each instance to be allocated more memory; running at a full 7 instances, each can now have up to 10GB of dedicated memory.\nWrapping things up, NVIDIA isn\u2019t announcing specific pricing or availability information today. But customers should expect to see the 80GB PCIe A100 cards soon.\nGallery: NVIDIA ISC 2021 Press Deck\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n15 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nshabby - Monday, June 28, 2021 - link\nSo will we ever see any more gpu reviews here Ryan? \n\n\n\nYB1064 - Monday, June 28, 2021 - link\nGood luck trying to find a GPU to review.\n\n\n\nJimRamK - Monday, June 28, 2021 - link\nI mean media tend to get samples from the manufacturers so it shouldn't be an issue for them.

They represent just a sliver of the rich archaeological heritage of the southeastern United States.\n\u201cThere are tens if not hundreds of thousands of sites that were occupied 1,500 years ago until modern times by the Hopi and the Zuni in Arizona in New Mexico,\u201d explains Pawlowicz, an adjunct faculty member at Northern Arizona University (and a Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions winner in 1992).\nThe challenges archaeologists studying pottery sherds face parallels those confronted by scientists across a sprawling array of fields \u2014 from astronomy to zoology \u2014 who are turning to AI to harness larger and larger quantities of data to tackle increasingly ambitious projects.\nIdentifying Long-Dead Artisans\nDownum, an anthropology professor at Northern Arizona University, says quickly analyzing sherds from the region \u2014 and worldwide \u2014 would allow researchers to glean new insights into life hundreds of years ago.\nThey might even be able to, one day, recognize the work of individual artisans and trace the distribution of pottery across long-dormant trading networks.\nThe problem is that very few have the training \u2014 and the decades of experience needed \u2014 to understand what they\u2019re looking at.\nFor archaeologists, turnover is a concern. For example, there\u2019s only one person still actively working who was trained by the first-generation definers of the design categories, and perhaps a dozen trained by the second generation of experts.\nExamples of bowls and jars for Tusayan White Ware types from Museum of Northern Arizona.\nSo digitizing hundreds of thousands of images of sherds, along with geographical information, would be a potent tool.\nHuman-Level Expertise\nIn their study, Pawlowicz and Downum showed that, when properly trained, a deep learning model can assign types to digital images of decorated sherds with an accuracy comparable to, and sometimes higher than, four expert-level contemporary archaeologists.\nPawlowicz trained the AI model used for the study in just a few hours on his PC, which is equipped with an NVIDIA GPU running a pair of common convolutional neural network models, VGG16 and ResNet50.\nAnd the model, far from competing with existing archaeologists, could even be a valuable tool for training new ones.\nMore Explainable\nDeep learning, Pawlowicz and Downum explain, has long been seen as a \u201cblack box.\u201d\nBut new tools such as Grad-CAM (gradient-based class activation maps) \u201cqueries\u201d the model to determine which areas of the input image were most important in assigning a type confidence to the image, Pawlowicz and Downum write.\nThe results are then displayed as a \u201cheat map,\u201d where areas most relevant to the type classification are shaded in red and less relevant areas in blue.\nBy contrast, human experts often struggle to point to the specific features in a sherd sample that led them to categorize, making it more challenging to explain their work and train others.\nSherd images with diagnostic design elements of Tusayan White Ware types identified.\nConsistency is another advantage. While one human expert will often classify a sherd differently from another human, an AI can measure consistently. Thus, even with a flawed yardstick, comparisons among vast quantities of samples with AI is possible and valuable.\nDeep learning also makes it easier to apply new insights to sherd samples classified a century or more ago, using new concepts on older work.\nCrowdsourced Archaeology?\nNext, Pawlowicz plans to turn to NVIDIA-powered systems at Northern Arizona University to analyze even larger sample sets using more complex models.\nDownum and Pawlowicz would like to create a central searchable database of images. Smartphone apps might even help people in the field with little experience add to the database \u2014 snapping photos of sherds in situ without disturbing them.\nOnce uploaded, AI would allow for expert analysis of every fragment. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge potential for this,\u201d Downum said.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Researchers Chris Downum and Leszek Pawlowicz Use Deep Learning to Accelerate Archaeology \u2013 Ep. 154\nImage credits: Leszek Pawlowicz and Christian Downum/Northern Arizona University\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But for many, doing that is simply a case of window shopping and looking at a potential future where you just so happened to stumble onto a briefcase full of money. In the case of the recently released NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti that hypothetical becomes a window where you get to see DOOM Eternal running at well over 150-fps in 4K. \r But NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-based RTX 30 Series is just that, a series of GPUs. Each designed and built to offer up performance, fidelity, and additional cutting edge features no matter the entry point. With that in mind, the arrival of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti presents a new member of the family. And one that sits in-between the formidable RTX 3070 and RTX 3080. \r When it made its debut late last year, the RTX 3070 arrived on the scene as something that not only matched GeForce RTX 2080 Ti performance, but did so whilst being more affordable and efficient.\r  For those that need a refresher, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti sat atop the GPU mountain for quite some time -- so much so that its ray-tracing and overall in-game performance is still what you\u2019d consider high-end. So yeah, it's no wonder the RTX 3070 quickly became the most popular GPU in the Ampere range  -- a fact you can see first hand in the latest Steam Hardware Survey. It hits that double sweet spot of price and performance. Of course that was before the current climate of GPU scarcity and the dawn of the age of hardware prices ripped from a future where inflation means people buy groceries with wheelbarrows full of cash.\r That whole deal aside, incredible QHD 1440P performance, with all of the advances made in real-time ray-tracing and AI-based rendering thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s new Ampere architecture -- is what the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti are all about. Cranking the details in Cyberpunk 2077 is a sight to behold, as is witnessing the amazing difference ray-tracing can make in a game as seemingly simple as Minecraft. The magical combo of RTX On with DLSS is something that adds a generational leap on top of an existing generational leap, and a key part of the RTX 30 Series story. \r Speaking of which, you might be wondering how the RTX 3070 Ti stacks up? Seeing as you're reading this review, well, it would be a little strange if you weren\u2019t. With most of the mystery surrounding the Ampere range already \u201casked and answered\u201d with the non Ti trio release of the RTX 3070, 3080, and 3090 last year -- the RTX 3070 Ti is exactly what it promises to be. What the name implies. \r It\u2019s the bridge between models, and the bump needed to take the RTX 3070 to the next level of high-end cutting-edge performance.\rAn Ampere Primer  The below is a summary of the RTX 30 Series technology, applicable to all RTX 3070 Ti models. An Ampere primer if you will.  A sizable portion of games currently in development for PC and consoles, from indies to AAA high-end titles, will be driven by resolution, frame-rate, and cutting-edge effects like real-time ray-tracing. The latter is already here, first brought to the scene in 2018 with the GeForce RTX 20 series. The original \u2018RTX On\u2019, NVIDIA made that tech-dream of real-time ray-tracing a reality.\r Something that, with the arrival of affordable RTX-powered gaming laptops and consoles like the Xbox Series S, has become mainstream.\r Incredible QHD 1440P performance, with all of the advances made in real-time ray-tracing and AI-based rendering thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s new Ampere architecture -- is what the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti are all about. From NVIDIA\u2019s side, being first to implement ray-tracing also meant being on the cutting edge from the get-go, and at the forefront of in-game performance. Additional hardware in the form of RT Cores were brought into the picture to take some of the taxing computation off of GPU processors. To ensure that games ran at the coveted 60-fps, Tensor Cores were added into the mix -- building on NVIDIA\u2019s expertise in the field of AI to drive rendering with DLSS.\r Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Death Stranding, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and more -- DLSS is without a doubt one of the most impressive technical feats we\u2019ve seen in a long time. With or without ray-tracing, it provides a generation leap in performance without sacrificing visual quality. Ampere features second generation RT Cores (NVIDIA\u2019s dedicated ray-tracing hardware) and third-generation Tensor Cores (the AI stuff that makes DLSS the perfect match for hardware intensive ray-tracing in addition to simply boosting performance).\r There\u2019s also the new custom Samsung 8nm process and a chipset that radically re-designs the Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) to effectively double the concurrent calculations and what have you. To get technical we\u2019re talking about FP32 and INT32 operations, two things that are, err, things. Topping it all off is the introduction of HDMI 2.1 support and a PCIe Gen 4 interface leading to better CPU utilisation and faster loading times.\r In the end Ampere is all about the future -- resolution, frame-rate, AI-rendering, and cutting-edge effects like real-time ray-tracing using smart design and forward thinking innovation. From the GeForce RTX 3060 to the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti to the flagship GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, Ampere that powers it all.\rOf Numbers and Heat Sinks  Outside of the flagship RTX 2080 Ti, the Turing-based RTX 20 Series didn\u2019t see a string of \u2018Ti\u2019 upgrades -- instead, as the months rolled on NVIDIA debuted the \u2018SUPER\u2019 range. A little naming detour that makes the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti a direct successor to the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER -- a card we reviewed back in 2019. And although we\u2019re looking at roughly two-years -- which isn\u2019t all that much time when you think about it -- the differences are like that thing the sun does. Make things go from night into day.\r DLSS is without a doubt one of the most impressive technical feats we\u2019ve seen in a long time. With or without ray-tracing, it provides a generation leap in performance without sacrificing visual quality. With the newly designed Ampere Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) setup, the result spec-wise is over double the CUDA Core count in addition to the benefit that comes from next-gen RT Cores and Tensor Cores. In pure Teraflop talks you\u2019re looking at over double the TFLOP count -- 22 Shader TFLOPS versus 9 Shader TFLOPS -- across the board. Not that we know what a Teraflop does or really means other than sound very cool. And very technical.\r The general rule of thumb is the higher the number the better, which isn\u2019t always the case, but the touted 1.5x performance increase that the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti delivers over the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER is something we found to be true.\rNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition Architecture (GPU): Ampere\rCUDA Cores: 6144\rRT Cores: 48 (2nd Gen)\rTensor Cores: 192 (3rd Gen)\rGPU Boost Clock: 1770 MHz\rMemory Capacity: 8GB GDDR6X\rMemory Interface/Clock: 256-bit/9500 MHz\rMemory Bandwidth: 608 GB/s\rTDP: 290W Switch up the comparison to the baseline RTX 3070 though and the on-paper difference doesn\u2019t feel all that monumental. You\u2019re looking at a 5888 CUDA Core count versus the 6144 here, which is only a difference of around 4%. \r The big change comes with the arrival of 8GB of GDDR6X memory, the new super-fast VRAM solution found in the RTX 3080 and higher. With the increased bandwidth the question becomes, what sort of difference does GDDR6X bring to the table? Well, for one the faster memory alongside the modest bump in specs results in the most power hungry x70 Ti card to date. But even with a somewhat beefy 290W TDP rating of the RTX 3070 Ti, the performance increase and overall efficiency still impresses.\r It also raises the question of whether or not 8GB is enough when looking at modern titles pushing 4K with detail settings cranked. We\u2019ll get to the answers to both of those shortly, but before we do that it\u2019s worth taking another quick detour into Ampere-land.\rMore Than a Number  One of the big draws that comes from NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPU architecture lies beyond raw performance, and that\u2019s applicable whether you\u2019re talking about the RTX 3060 or the new RTX 3070 Ti. Both DLSS and hardware-driven real-time ray-tracing are game changers, DirectX 12 features like Variable Rate Shading and Mesh Shaders too. AI-based video production tools for creators, full Adobe integration, RTX Broadcast which can turn any space into a streaming setup with AI powered voice and visual controls. \r The list goes on, and these \u201cfeatures\u201d are now at a place where they\u2019re essentially selling points. As in, core to the modern GeForce line-up.\r The big change comes with the arrival of 8GB of GDDR6X memory, the new super-fast VRAM solution found in the RTX 3080 and higher. With the increased bandwidth the question becomes, what sort of difference does GDDR6X bring to the table? Resizable BAR support, as seen in the RTX 30 Series Laptop GPU range, is also here -- improving performance by better utilising PCIe express lanes across AMD and Intel-based CPUs. In terms of competitive games and esports, NVIDIA Reflex is something of a game changer in its own right, lowering system latency across a wide range of titles by reducing the time between input and seeing the corresponding action carried out on screen.\r With Reflex already an in-menu tick-box in Fortnite, Apex Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and more -- it\u2019s support is virtually everywhere in the competitive space. Paired with NVIDIA\u2019s own G-Sync display tech it\u2019s another value-add that goes beyond simply looking at an fps counter. \r All of these things are the direct result of hardware, software, and AI coming together - a testament to a future where raw power only represents part of the story. But, like any story that features charts and spreadsheets and talks of performance and resolution -- there\u2019s just something about power. \r As the prophecies foretold in our RTX 3080 Ti review, we\u2019ve now arrived at that part of the story. Let the Power Talk commence.\rGame Performance  There\u2019s nothing quite like seeing a brand-new GPU in action, watching that smooth buttery performance keep up even as you crank up detail settings and try and find that limit. That moment where the card begins to noticeably sweat and take a moment between tracing rays of light whilst rendering an idyllic sunset locale to tell you to back-off and give it some space. \r Even before we began testing the RTX 3070 last year, the assumption heading in was that it was going to be a 1440P powerhouse, something to match the unmatched 4K performance of the RTX 3080\u2019s debut. Thanks to the existing RTX 30 Series cards we\u2019ve tested, some of the mystery is indeed gone - but that hasn\u2019t stopped us getting all assume-y heading into testing this latest piece of Ampere.\r So then, is the RTX 3070 Ti a 1440P powerful-powerhouse? Something to match the unmatch-y unmatched 4K performance of the RTX 3080 Ti? Yes, yes it is.   \rGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition\rCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3800X\rMotherboard: MSI MEG X570 UNIFY\rMemory: HyperX FURY DDR4 RGB (32GB at 3600 MHz) Here is the first batch of results, covering non-DLSS or RTX enhanced titles.\r     Including 1080P in the results above isn\u2019t merely there to show you what an RTX 3070 Ti would do when connected up to a high refresh-rate full-HD display, but to illustrate that the noticeable bump in performance you\u2019re getting over the RTX 2080 Ti (again, a card that is still high-end) means we\u2019re entering bottleneck territory.\r The place other factors in a PC build, or even the capabilities of games themselves, impact performance. This is best illustrated when looking at the drop-off in performance when moving from 1080P to 1440P -- where at 14% on average across 20 or more games and benchmarks, that\u2019s impressive to say the least. \r The drop-off in performance when moving from 1080P to 1440P sits at 14% on average across the 20 or more games and benchmarks we carried out, and that\u2019s impressive to say the least. As is seeing so many titles, with detail settings cranked, hit triple-digits or frame-rates far above the 60-fps target most PC gamers set for that \u2018smooth experience\u2019 at 1440P. The visual feast that is Horizon Zero Dawn maintains over 100-fps, with DOOM Eternal averaging over 200-fps. Compared to the already impressive and established RTX 3070, the RTX 3070 Ti performs on average around 10% faster when playing games at 1440P and 4K resolutions.\r   Of course moving up to 4K we begin to see the limitations of the RTX 3070 brought to the fore, where a 38% on average drop-off in performance sees a number of titles hover around the 60-fps range. As a resolution, the sheer number of pixels you need to render a native 4K image is the reason why most PC displays are QHD. \r And if performance continues its trend of becoming as important or more important than fidelity -- that will most likely continue for some time. Compared to the RTX 2080 Ti and the RTX 3070, the RTX 3070 Ti is far better at delivering an impressive 4K experience -- even with the seemingly limited 8GB of VRAM. And it\u2019s at this point where the jump to the RTX 3080 and higher makes the most sense. \rRay Tracing and DLSS  With titles like Remedy\u2019s Control, CD Projekt RED\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077, or Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition (pictured above), turning on impressive real-time ray-tracing effects that cover things like lighting, shadows, reflections, and global illumination puts some considerable strain on hardware. And isn\u2019t to be taken lightly. \r Being on the cutting edge of in-game visuals means exactly that, but thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS rendering we\u2019re now at a stage where ray-tracing effects can co-exist alongside high-resolution images and overall performance.\r   As seen in non-RTX tests, the RTX 3070 Ti delivers powerhouse 1440P performance even with ray-tracing enabled and detail settings cranked. On the low-end this results in a smooth 60-fps Cyberpunk 2077 and on the high-end Wolfenstein: Youngblood turning in an insane 160+-fps. Which is a pretty good indicator of what to expect with DOOM Eternal\u2019s upcoming RTX and DLSS patch, similar triple-digit performance but now with added ray-traced goodness.\r With ray-tracing and DLSS the 10% increase over the baseline RTX 3070 continues.\rAnd It Looks Good Doing it Too  With the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition we see an overall design and look and feel that\u2019s more in-line with the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti than the RTX 3070. The same brand-new cooling setup that involves a fan sitting on either side and an exhaust on the rear is here -- and after using a Founders RTX 30 series card for many months now, remaining quiet even when under load is a story that the RTX 3070 Ti is glad to continue.\r That said, compared to the RTX 3080 the RTX 3070 Ti is smaller and weighs noticeably less. That said, in terms of temperatures it idles warmer than the RTX 3070 and runs a little hotter too -- with temperatures hovering in the 75-degree range when under load. But, this is with the default just about whisper quiet fan profile. And can be cranked to get things a little cooler.\r As seen in non-RTX tests, the RTX 3070 Ti delivers powerhouse 1440P performance even with ray-tracing enabled and detail settings cranked. On the low-end this results in a smooth 60-fps Cyberpunk 2077 and on the high-end Wolfenstein: Youngblood turning in an insane 160+-fps. NVIDIA now also offers its own safe-to-use overclocking tool with its latest drivers, something that can boost the RTX 3070 Ti\u2019s clock speeds by a modest amount -- for a modest performance boost. It\u2019s negligible stuff (and it can be tweaked if you\u2019re willing to mess around with system stability) but a welcome addition for those that smile when they see frame-rates go up slightly after tweaking settings. \r In the end, if we were living in a parallel dimension where GPU prices remained as they were alongside stock issues not being an issue then it would be easy to label the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti the most impressive GPU in the RTX 30 Series alongside the baseline RTX 3070. On that note, we\u2019d also be in a dimension where you could walk into a store and see one of those new-fangled next-gen consoles sitting on a shelf. Also, you could probably simply.. walk into a store. Or slide. \r That said, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is still an impressive bit of graphics hardware -- and a reminder that when it comes to a GPU range the stuff that sits near the top of the mountain can often be more impressive in the long run. Thanks to incredible 1440P performance alongside RTX and DLSS magic, not to mention Reflex and other tools, it\u2019s hard to not be taken aback. All we need really, is some deep-learning to fix the whole global hardware situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we liked\nAn impressive leap over the previous gen\u2019s RTX 2070 SUPER\rAnd an improvement over the RTX 2080 Ti\rA 1440P powerhouse, even when it comes to ray-tracing\rGorgeous Founders Edition design\rQuiet even when given a slight overclock\r\n\n\n\nWhat we didn't like\nEven though its GDDR6X the 8GB limitation might be a problem for those looking for a 4K performer\rThe current GPU climate means it\u2019ll be hard to find one close to the MSRP\n\n\n\nWe gave it:\n\n\n\n9.5\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOUT OF 10\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Comments\n\n\n\nNo comments currently exist.

Prior to the RTX 3070 Ti's release it was a space wholly occupied by AMD's Radeon RX 6800, which is perhaps why Nvidia sees it a vital gap to fill as quickly as possible. It aims to do so with a blend of the RTX 3070's full GPU and the RTX 3080's speedy memory, all combined into one card, which will deliver high frame rate 1440p and more affordable 4K gaming.The RTX 3070 Ti sits directly between the GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce RTX 3080, but doesn't have any ideas of supplanting either one. Rather, with a $599 (\u00a3529, \u20ac619) price tag, it is an exercise in shoring up the GeForce RTX 30-series lineup should any gamer get any wild ideas about jumping ship to team Radeon.It does just that too, which doesn't make it the most exciting graphics card launch from a PC gamer's perspective. But at a time like this, when graphics cards are all too hard to come by, and even more so at MSRP, its greatest strength may not be in exceptional price or game-changing performance but instead in the mere fact it exists.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti review (MSI Ventus 3X)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\nSpecs(Image credit: Future)What are the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti specs?The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is mostly created from parts skimmed from the existing RTX 30-series GPU stack. As such, you'll find no major surprises on this card, but that's not to say there haven't been adjustments to offer something new.First off, there's the GA104 GPU. The RTX 3070 Ti uses the complete, uncut GPU only currently found within the mobile RTX 3080. It's confusing, and AMD has similarly chosen to name its mobile GPUs in such an obfuscating fashion to make matters worse. Nonetheless, what will be key to desktop PC gamers is that this is a slightly more performant version of the GA104 GPU found within the RTX 3070. It achieves this extra power with a moderate CUDA Core increase: 6,144 on the RTX 3070 Ti to the 5,888 on the RTX 3070.That's less than a 5% increase in CUDA Cores from the RTX 3070 moving to the RTX 3070 Ti.You can also expect boost clocks to officially top 1,770MHz with the RTX 3070 Ti, which is a little higher than the 1,725MHz found on the RTX 3070 FE. During three runs of Metro Exodus at 4K, however, that clock speed lead falls away, and it was actually the RTX 3070, with the help of GPU Boost, which comes out ahead at 1,862MHz to the RTX 3070 Ti's 1,829MHz.\u00a0That could be down to thermal headroom, which as you'll see later the RTX 3070 FE appears to have a more generous helping of.Passing on any significant shake-up in the GPU silicon, Nvidia has instead seen fit to equip the RTX 3070 Ti with GDDR6X memory. That's the same speedy memory found in the RTX 3080, GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and GeForce RTX 3090. This sees the RTX 3070 Ti arrive with 608GB/s, a notable improvement on the RTX 3070's 448GB/s, despite both featuring an identical 256-bit wide memory bus.(Image credit: Future)RTX 3070 Ti specs GPU\u00a0- GA104\nLithography - Samsung 8nm\nCUDA Cores - 6,144\nSMs - 48\nRT Cores - 48\nTensor Cores - 192\nGPU Boost clock - 1,770MHz\nMemory bus - 256-bit\nMemory capacity - 8GB GDDR6X\nMemory speed - 19Gbps\nMemory bandwidth - 608GB/s\nTGP - 290W\nPrice - $599 (\u00a3529, \u20ac619)GDDR6X's secret is PAM4 signalling, which effectively doubles the number of signals the memory transmits with each clock. It's not quite doubly effective in practice, unfortunately for us, but it has allowed its manufacturer, Micron, to deliver 19Gbps with GDDR6X, while GDDR6 manages just 14Gbps.So there's great pedigree in that memory technology, which is at the bleeding edge of high-bandwidth chips today. Micron doesn't offer it out freely, either. Nvidia is, so far, the only GPU manufacturer to offer it in its products. I'd expect it to stay that way, too; GDDR5X memory remained an Nvidia-exclusive for the duration of its life.Yet while GDDR6X offers Nvidia speed beyond the grasp of the competition, it has only seen fit to load 8GB of the fancy memory onto the RTX 3070 Ti. That puts it at a loss next to the 16GB AMD Radeon RX 6800, which launched a bit too pricey at $579 for consideration next to the RTX 3070, but is now nominally a little cheaper than the $599 RTX 3070 Ti.In memory terms, then, you have the speedier, smaller GeForce RTX 3070 Ti facing down the slower, more capacious Radeon RX 6800. The deciding factor is, of course, gaming performance, and once again there's plenty to talk about when comparing Nvidia Ampere and AMD RDNA 2. More on that in the performance section below.Its greatest strength may not be in exceptional price or game-changing performance but instead in the mere fact it exists.Back to the RTX 3070 Ti for a moment and let's talk construction.\u00a0Nvidia has opted for a new Founders Edition shroud with the RTX 3070 Ti, a sort-of middle ground between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 FE coolers. In essence, it looks the part of the RTX 3070 cooler except it's a little longer, and that allows Nvidia to mount a single fan on both sides of the card. Nvidia calls this 'flow-through cooling' and it's something you'll spot on the RTX 3080 and above too. Also there are more heatpipes than the RTX 3070 FE, with a total of six running through the RTX 3070 Ti to wick heat away from the GPU, memory, and VRM components rapidly.This cooler redesign may be essential to the internal overhaul. With a slightly tougher job keeping the RTX 3070 Ti's components cool, the card ends up reaching higher temperatures under load than I had expected: 75\u00b0C on average across three runs of Metro: Exodus at 4K.\u00a0That's pretty toasty by today's standards. It's still a happy enough medium for any case with decent airflow, but the 3070 Ti has been the hottest of all the Founders Edition cards in our testing.It's a given, then, that the RTX 3070 Ti consumes more power from the PSU than the RTX 3070. And does so by some margin. The RTX 3070 comes with a TDP of 220W while the RTX 3070 Ti demands 290W. In operation, the RTX 3070 Ti chewed through 291W of power, while the RTX 3070 stuck to 222W.A larger GPU and thirstier GDDR6X chips beget greater power demands and more heat generation, that's a given, but the unequal increases with this card are perhaps proof of the balancing act that modern GPUs must maintain for peak power efficiency and performance. In the RTX 3070 Ti's case, that's a slightly more shaky tightrope walk than the RTX 30-series cards before it.And it carries through into pricing, too. The RTX 3070 Ti is a $599 graphics card, straddling the RTX 3070 at $499 and the RTX 3080 at $699. In theory, anyways.I say that for obvious reasons: the graphics card market is anything but healthy today and finding any modern graphics card at MSRP is a struggle. That said, you will at least be able to find the RTX 3070 Ti for a brief moment in time at MSRP, which will inevitably end up as one of the cheapest prices for that graphics card you'll find for the foreseeable future.What really matters, though, is that, for all the specification and price changes, Nvidia's tinkering equates to a notable and justifiable improvement in frame rates. With that, let's get into the numbers.Performance(Image credit: Future)How fast is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti?4K performanceImage 1 of 8(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Test rigCPU - Intel Core i7 10700K\nMotherboard - MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Carbon WiFi\nRAM - Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro @ 3,200MHz\nCPU cooler - Corsair H100i RGB Pro XT\nPSU - NZXT 850W\nChassis - DimasTech Mini V2Let's start at 4K, which is a bit more of a reach for the RTX 3070 Ti than say the RTX 3080, yet most definitely within its wheelhouse.\u00a0Generally, 4K gaming enjoys memory bandwidth, and comparatively the RTX 3070 Ti has that in swathes versus the RTX 3070 or GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. It's a card more naturally inclined to the demanding Ultra HD resolution, but importantly it's also able to offer a little more bandwidth than the RX 6800\u2014608GB/s to 512GB/s\u2014and that sees both cards competing within a frame or two of each other within many of our benchmarks.This performance battle goes down to the wire. Game-by-game you're looking at marginal leads in either direction; or every game the RTX 3070 Ti leads, the RX 6800 comes right back at it in another.That makes for plenty playable 4K frame rates with the RTX 3070 Ti. In less demanding games it will glide past 60fps, and in more demanding titles you may be only a few settings tweaks away from that all-important performance milestone.Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition and the surprisingly demanding Total War: Three Kingdoms require more drastic action to bring them in line, but the RTX 3070 Ti is a decent way into 4K gaming. I'd still recommend the RTX 3080 for 4K gaming if you could stretch to it, stock and pricing pending, as its extra oomph sees it more comfortably surmount the demands of high resolution gaming.1440p performanceImage 1 of 7(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)I would consider 1440p to be the RTX 3070 Ti's bread and butter. While 4K is far more attainable now than ever before, as evidenced by the performance you can see above, the mix of high fidelity and frame rates with more affordable 1440p gaming monitors is sure to tempt a good many gamers.The RTX 3070 Ti boasts high double-digit performance in more visually-demanding games and surpasses triple digits in most everything else. Making it a decent fit for gaming at 1440p without compromising on quality or playability.The card also tends to distance itself a little from the RTX 3070 at this resolution, although the RX 6800 largely remains out of reach. The RDNA 2 architecture is playing to its strengths at 1440p\u2014the RX 6800, specifically, was built to conquer at this resolution, and still does.There is one notable exception in Horizon Zero Dawn, which tends to favour Nvidia silicon through and through. You'll likely find other cases where Nvidia pulls ahead, especially as there's often only a handful of frames separating the two, but generally the RX 6800 tends to lend to faster frame rates.1080p performanceImage 1 of 7(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)It's at 1080p where the RTX 3070 Ti most struggles to compete with AMD's RX 6800. It's here where we'd traditionally see less of a reliance on faster memory, which effectively nixes the RTX 3070 Ti's strongest feature. To make matters worse, AMD's RDNA 2 architecture tends to perform its best at 1080p.That most often sees the RTX 3070 Ti struggle to keep apace of the cheaper RX 6800 at 1080p. It's not a tremendous lead, only single-digit percentiles separate the two in all but the games most favourable to AMD's GPUs, but it's certainly a strike against the RTX 3070 Ti when it already commands a higher price tag than the RDNA 2 chip.The lessened impact of memory bandwidth on 1080p gaming performance also sees the RTX 3070 Ti only edge slightly ahead of the RTX 3070. At higher resolutions this performance gap tends to grow in the Ti's favour, but I wouldn't recommend opting for the more expensive card if you are only looking for 1080p performance. There's really very little in it.If you brush aside specific GPU comparisons for a moment, however, the RTX 3070 Ti is a really solid graphics card for 1080p gaming at high frame rates. That's thankfully a bit of a given with any modern graphics card\u2014the 1080p pixel count has become rather pedestrian for all but the slimmest iGPUs going.Ray tracing performanceImage 1 of 6(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Ray tracing comes with a hefty hit to performance, but once again Nvidia's RT Cores work wonders for mitigating the impact in most games. The RTX 3070 Ti is equipped with 48 of Nvidia's second generation RT Cores, which are a notable improvement over Turing's 1st Gen lot.That's also two more RT Cores than the RTX 3070, although those don't count for a whole lot in ray-traced performance. The two perform near-enough identically in the DXR Feature Test.The RTX 3080 does, however, pull away from the RTX 3070 Ti in ray tracing workloads. With 68 RT Cores, that's perhaps no surprise. So if it's ray tracing performance you're after it is once again the RTX 3080 that gets our recommendation.Importantly, though, these RT Cores are better suited for the task than AMD's equivalent Ray Accelerators, and that makes for a better ray tracing card in the RTX 3070 Ti than the Radeon RX 6800 by some margin. The RTX 3070 Ti's raw RT performance is actually superior to even the RX 6900 XT with 80 Ray Accelerators, although the rasterised performance of the RX 6900 XT will see it retain the performance lead in ray-traced games, as these blend both ray tracing and shader cores.Saying that, it's pretty close in Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition between the RTX 3070 Ti and RX 6900 XT. The 3DMark Port Royal test, not so much. The RX 6900 XT shows a clear lead in the purpose-built benchmark.DLSS often comes to the rescue of the RTX 3070 Ti, though. This feature is as much a boon as ever for GeForce RTX cards in supported games, although AMD will release something akin to the feature in FidelityFX Super Resolution later this month.Thermal and power performanceImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)As I alluded to earlier in the specifications, the RTX 3070 Ti seems to be the result of pushing the GA104 silicon to its limit. Power demands are high, despite a not altogether massive improvement in clock speed or CUDA Core count, and therefore it demands a beefier cooler.\u00a0Yet even the slightly larger Founders Edition cooler on the RTX 3070 Ti struggles to deal with the faster, slightly chunkier spec. It reached the highest average temperature we've measured so far on any of the reference cards from Nvidia or AMD. That may go some ways to explaining the lower GPU Boost clocks in-game, as this feature uses available power and thermal headroom to boost beyond a card's original spec.Analysis(Image credit: Future)What does the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti mean for PC gaming?Nvidia told me the RTX 3070 Ti had one job to do: compete with the AMD Radeon RX 6800. It does just that, but it's not a comfortable win, nor is it the RX 6800 killer I had expected at first.AMD effectively left the door open for Nvidia to come back at it with a highly competitive card following the launch of the RX 6800. Nvidia had a card either side the RDNA 2 release at the time, the RTX 3070 at $499 and the RTX 3080 at $699, which left a sizeable window for Nvidia to exploit should it so wish. It seemed clear, then, that it would do just that with the RTX 3070 Ti, which could parachute into that gap with performance ready to make mincemeat of the RX 6800.Fast forward to June 2021 and Nvidia is offering competition at this price bracket, but not so much a definitive answer to AMD's RX 6800. The RTX 3070 Ti stays abreast of the RDNA 2 chip at 4K but slips away from it at 1080p and, more importantly, 1440p.In my mind this comes down to the decision to adopt only pristine GA104 GPUs for the RTX 3070 Ti. That's necessarily expensive and Nvidia nets only a small increase in CUDA Cores with the full graphics silicon; just 5%. Nvidia therefore needs to search out further performance wins elsewhere to attempt to hit its competitive goals versus AMD.Nvidia's thrown everything at the wall to push the GA104 GPU towards RX 6800 performance.That's where GDDR6X comes in, and the improved memory chips offer less sure-fire performance improvements across resolution than a simple CUDA core uplift. Importantly they do make those improvements stick at 4K.Nvidia's choice of GPU comes down to many factors, and I do not care to try and speculate on all of them. What's clear here, through the performance figures to the thermal and power demands of the card, is that Nvidia's thrown everything at the wall to push the GA104 GPU towards RX 6800 performance, and its best efforts have got it something close to it, but not quite there in every regard. Certainly not without DLSS to speed its chips up, or ray tracing to slow AMD's down, anyways.As with the RTX 3080 Ti launch, pricing has fallen on the wrong side of my own expectations.\u00a0Perhaps that's a sign of the times; graphics card demand is so immense that manufacturer set pricing doesn't mean a whole lot anymore. Yet I also feel the lack of availability of AMD's RDNA 2 chips has swayed the decision. It's all well and good us comparing the RTX 3070 Ti and RX 6800 for the purpose of this review, but out there in the wilds of retail it is hardly a comparison worth making with an obvious absence of AMD GPUs.\u00a0You take what you can get in today's GPU market and perhaps Nvidia here is playing that to its advantage. The RX 6800 would be the better choice at MSRP for rasterised gaming performance, but in lieu of that the RTX 3070 Ti is a fair alternative. With DLSS and ray tracing factored in, I dare say it's even a good one.The RTX 3070 Ti doesn't shift much attention from the RTX 3080, however. Once again, if MSRP is anything to go on in these dire times, the RTX 3080 at $699 remains a monstrously good deal. If I were to dedicate my days to checking retailers for availability, that remains the card I'd be chasing. Similarly, if it were AMD I was after, I'd track down an RX 6800 XT as opposed to the RX 6800. There's a lot more on offer when you step into the truly high-end cards.\u00a0That will depend on your ability to allocate more of your budget to your GPU and save elsewhere, of course, which understandably isn't always a possibility.Verdict(Image credit: Future)Should you buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti?Any graphics card launch is something of a blessing for anyone in the market today. It's another bite of the cherry; a chance to actually pick up a card at the price the manufacturer intended and avoid greasing the wheels of an exploitative second-hand market. That's perhaps where all of my excitement for the RTX 3070 Ti comes from, because otherwise it's a fairly utilitarian card from the green team.The RTX 3070 Ti exists to plug a hole in the GeForce lineup where the Radeon RX 6800 currently has its elbows out. As such, the RTX 3070 Ti is nearly as much a performant 1440p graphics card, and it gets by just fine at 4K, too.\u00a0When it doesn't manage this in raw rasterised performance, it partially makes up for the deficit with Nvidia's breadth of features and a ray tracing performance lead. It could perhaps do so with a little more grace, though, as Nvidia's clearly pushing the RTX 3070 Ti to its limits in order to compete.It's not a great deal, however\u2014I fear the days of manufacturers throwing pricing under the bus to screw with the competition are well and truly behind us. Priced more than the RX 6800 at launch and lumped right between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, you pay what you might expect for the 3070 Ti's performance and possibly even a little more.\u00a0Admittedly, the small price difference between Nvidia and AMD's chips will not play a huge role in the decision to purchase for most right now\u2014you'll be lucky to even get the chance to hit the checkout button\u2014but it still feels like this battle may have been more fierce had we a steady supply of graphics cards on both sides.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti: Price Comparison \u00a3859.94View \u00a3876.20ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti delivers frustratingly variable performance, often too close to an RTX 3070 for a price smack between it and the RTX 3080.

But the NV1 was based on quadratic texture mapping instead of polygon rendering that prevailed at the time.Jon PeddieRelated To: Jon Peddie Research      This article is part of the\u00a0Electronics History\u00a0series:\u00a0The Graphics Chip Chronicles.Founded in early 1993, Nvidia set out to revolutionize the PC and console gaming market with 3D graphics technology. They succeeded beyond anyone\u2019s wildest imagination but not without suffering some bumps and bruises in the process. It just made them smarter and stronger.Nvidia announced itself in the summer of 1994. It planned to develop single-chip media accelerators for high-quality interactive multimedia on PCs.\u201cWe intend to focus our engineering resources on the rapid development and introduction of new families of industry-defining Media Accelerators,\u201d said president and co-founder Jensen  Huang. Nvidia said that its first-generation Media Accelerator would enable PC  platforms to deliver high-performance 2D and 3D graphics, video, a digital joystick interface, and advanced audio capabilities to accelerate the rapidly growing installed base of multimedia applications. The premise was to build a 3D  graphics controller based on quadratic texture mapping. Quadratic rendering was a dramatically different approach to the polygon rendering that prevailed at the time. The company was also seeking to differentiate itself by incorporating audio capabilities in the chip. If it succeeded, gamers would only have to purchase a single add-in board (AIB). Nvidia followed the fabless model. However, it was not easy for a startup to grab a foundry\u2019s attention and,  more importantly, commitment. Setting up a production line was (and still is) a  risky and tricky proposition. Nvidia lucked out and convinced SGS-Thomson  Microelectronics (SGS) to build the first-generation multimedia chip, and in exchange, SGS would market it.SGS and Nvidia rolled out two versions of the NV1 multimedia accelerator. They said the chips were the first multimedia accelerators to deliver real-time photorealistic 3D graphics on the same die.Nvidia marketed the NV1 VRAM  version, while SGS offered the STG2000, the DRAM version. Introduced in May 1995,  the STG2000 was a PCI-based multimedia PCI AIB. Nvidia also secured a design win with Diamond, the largest AIB supplier at the time. Diamond then introduced the  Diamond Edge 3D to retailers.But Nvidia, Diamond, and SGS struggled to get game developers to invest in the NV1\u2019s quadratic texture mapping technology and Nvidia\u2019s accompanying software development kit (SDK).Figure 1. Diamond Multimedia\u2019s Edge 3D with Nvidia chip manufactured by SGS.The first video game company to show interest in Nvidia\u2019s chip was Sega, which was looking to bring the games available on its Sega Saturn to PCs. Saga\u2019s interest prompted Nvidia to include a joypad port in the chip.The Nvidia NV1The NV1 chip was the PC industry\u2019s first single-chip accelerator supporting the multimedia features of Windows 95.  The features included 2D/GUI acceleration, real-time texture-mapped 3D  acceleration, wavetable audio acceleration, full-motion video acceleration, and digital input acceleration. The NVI also supported legacy applications with multimedia drivers for Windows 3.11 and integrated VGA for  DOS.The key features of the NV1:Single-chip multimedia accelerator  Support for industry standardsAcceleration for all DirectX  API\u2019s under Windows 95Industry-leading GUI acceleration  Full-motion video acceleration  (Indeo, MPEG, Cinepak) Real-time texture-mapped 3D graphics  Acceleration of all 3D standards:  triangles, quadrilaterals, and curves Hardware audio wavetable synthesis  Enhanced digital game port System-level performance and  cost optimizationAround 200,000 of the approximately  250,000 transistors in the NV1 were devoted to the chip's purely graphical (2D and 3D)  portions.The first LSI graphics accelerator chips came to market in the early 1980s as 2D drawing engines with CAD as the primary application. In 1981, SGI introduced the first 3D transform engine, the Geometry engine. In 1997, Matrox became the first company to offer a 3D AIB with the SM 640 based on the SGI Geometry Engine.The first 3D graphics chip was the Yamaha YGY611. However, it was not fully integrated, lacking VGA and perspective capabilities. The first completely integrated 2D/3D chip was Nvidia's NV1, which supported VGA, translation, plus video and audio capabilities.Figure 2. Nvidia\u2019s NV1.The chip was the earliest example of accelerated computing, making the peripherals the accelerators. A virtualized programming interface allowed hardware to change while software (the programming architecture) continued to work. Nvidia\u2019s strategy is the same today,  tracing its roots to the early days of the company.Nvidia co-founder Curtis Priem and Chief Scientist David Rosenthal were the chief architects of the chip and its programming model, and another co-founder Chris Malachowsky was the chief engineer. The company\u2019s goals went beyond the NV1. Nvidia was looking to create a virtualized architecture for things I/O (including graphics and audio that it could build on into the future.As a result, Nvidia\u2019s SDK was very object-oriented. A developer would open a class type (graphics, streaming,  or audio) and then write directly to the class type\u2019s registers in the targeted chip. If the chip supported the class and those registers, the operation would be executed in the chip\u2019s hardware. If not, a privileged software kernel would be called by the chip (unbeknownst to the developer) that would execute the operation on the host, often with support from the chip\u2019s hardware. As far as the developer was aware, the targeted chip supported everything exposed in the  SDK.Before Microsoft introduced DirectX,  Nvidia envisioned game developers would write to the SDK for their application\u2019s acceleration.The same approach is at the heart of Nvidia\u2019s designs today, allowing the company to reuse large swathes of code between generations of its graphics processors. The company\u2019s strategy is most clearly displayed in its drivers and the new platforms created with it \u2013  CUDA and Deepsteam, for instance.Nvidia said that its goal was a multimedia architecture that would address the well-known problem with multimedia PCs of the time. The PC of that era was not so much a platform as a  collection of single-function add-ons that made life difficult for both developers and consumers. Nvidia claimed its architecture provided a \u201ccoherent multimedia platform\u201d with concurrent media streaming, interactive 3D graphics,  high-fidelity audio synthesis, full-motion video texturing, and a digital joystick.The Sega DealThe big win, PR-wise, was its partnership with Sega. Sega of America established an exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia and said it would convert Sega\u2019s Saturn and arcade software to CD-ROMs for PCs equipped with Nvidia\u2019s multimedia accelerators. Nvidia set up an exclusive license for PC 3D accelerator AIBs, meaning that  Saturn-based games could not be ported to any other 3D PC AIB hardware. That software pushed Sega  Saturn\u2019s sales to more than one million units in Japan in the wake of its release in November 1994. Launched in the U.S. in May 1995, the Sega Saturn quickly sold out of its limited initial U.S. distribution. The company said it would be in full distribution by early September. Saturn games were set to be released for Nvidia-based products three to six months after appearing for the Saturn console.Tom Kalinske, president and  CEO of Sega\u2019s US division, said at the time that he believed the markets for gaming PCs and game consoles such as the Sega Saturn would thrive in the future.  The PC games market could reach approximately 20% to 25% of the video game market by 1990, he estimated. Sega said it would spend $30 million to $50  million on advertising for Saturn over the next year. According to Nvidia, Sega\u2019s software would take advantage of every facet of the NV1 processor, driving the chip to its limit. Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, believed that \u201cPC consumers are going  to be stunned with the results of our combined efforts.\u201d Intel also entered the picture and planned a presentation at SIGGRAPH with Nvidia. Intel said it would also make Sonic the Hedgehog available to OEMs (Intel ported it using its native signal processing software, or NSP. That effort later resulted in a fight with Microsoft that got to the U.S. Department of Justice (but that\u2019s a story for another time). The Sega deal was a significant coup for Nvidia. The company\u2019s quad-patch approach had some industry analysts wondering if it was too radical a departure from conventional tri-meshes to get developers on board. ConclusionBut Nvidia was too far ahead of the curve, as it turned out. The PC industry ended up staying with polygonal graphics. There were criticisms of Nvidia\u2019s approach, including the assertion that 2D graphics performance could not compete with other options at the time, particularly in DOS. The NV1\u2019s audio quality failed to live up to expectations, and the AIB was expensive. The result? It failed to gain ground in the market.Nvidia co-developed the NV2 with  Sega for use in the Dreamcast console. But Sega ended up dropping Nvidia as a partner and supplier. The NV2 never came to market, and when Nvidia failed to recoup its investment, the company almost folded. Nvidia dropped its spherical approach in one of the PC industry\u2019s most daring turnarounds, repositioning the company to a polygon design. In 1997, it introduced the Riva 128\u2014one of the most successful graphics chips of all time.This article is part of the\u00a0Electronics History\u00a0series:\u00a0The Graphics Chip Chronicles.

That could be a boon for the\u00a0chronically unkempt, but you should probably test the technique before you turn up in your birthday suit.\nThe system can also adjust your talking head\u2019s viewpoint to show you looking straight at the screen, when secretly your eyes are fixed on a TV in the background.\nTNW Conference - The 2025 Agenda has just touched downDiscover the insightful and dare we say controversial sessions that will take place June 19-20.\nCheck It Out\n[Read:\u00a0Why entrepreneurship in emerging markets matters]\nThey sound like nifty features for those of us who dread video calls, but the most useful aspect of the model may be bandwidth reduction. Nvidia says the technique can cut the bandwidth needed for video conferences by up to 10x.\nGANimated video\nVid2Vid Cameo is powered by\u00a0generative adversarial networks (GANs), which produce the videos by pitting two neural networks against each other:\u00a0a generator that tries to create realistic-looking samples, and a discriminator that attempts to work out whether they\u2019re real or fake.\nThis enables the two networks to synthesize realistic videos from a single image of the user, which could be a real photo or a cartoon avatar. During the video call, the model will capture their real-time motion and apply it to the uploaded image.\n\n\nThe model was trained on a dataset of 180,000 talking-head videos, which taught the network to identify 20 key points that encode the location of features including the mouth, eyes, and nose.\nThese points are then extracted from the image uploaded by the user to generate a video that mimics their appearance.\nThe model will be available soon in the\u00a0Nvidia Maxine SDK and Nvidia Video Code SDK, but you can already try a demo of it here. I gave it a go, and was pretty impressed by the system\u2019s efforts \u2014 although I wouldn\u2019t let it cut my hair.\nMy talking head spotted a barbershop in the distance.\nYou can read a research paper on the technique here.\nGreetings Humanoids!

The report comes from ITHome who state that tech insiders in the Asia Pacific region are expecting NVIDIA to cut the supply of older GPUs in half to focus on its brand new chips.\nNVIDIA Expected To Prioritize GeForce RTX 30 Series Supply This Month, Increased Production Capacity For Ampere GPUs Could Lead To Better Stock & Prices In 2H 2021\nWe know that earlier this year, NVIDIA reintroduced its older GeForce RTX 20 series and GeForce GTX 16 series cards such as the RTX 2060, GTX 1660 SUPER, GTX 1650 Ti, etc. The green team did this for several reasons with the primary one being the crypto situation. NVIDIA hadn't launched the CMP series yet and they were trying really hard to get something to gamers. However, their strategy wasn't that successful as the miners were still gobbling any GPU that they could get their hands on.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNow that the CMP series is officially here, NVIDIA has decided to refocus its gaming supply on Ampere GPUs. Sure the Turing architecture will still be produced for crypto mining users & on-order, cryptocurrency has fallen a lot over the past few weeks & doesn't seem to be recovering. This has given NVIDIA to once again cut off the production of its older GPUs and move to next-generation parts such as the Ampere-based GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards.\n\nStarting this month, the supply of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card is going to be halved & shipments to major partners are also going to be reduced significantly. The production capacity that opens up with this move is going to be prioritized to the GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs based on the Ampere architecture. This still leaves the GeForce GTX 16 series in play but those are also now expected to be cut-off in the coming months. This would further open up increased production capacity for GeForce RTX 30 chips and we can see price/availability starting to get normalized by the second half of 2021.\nNVIDIA has already implemented its LHR 'Lite Hash Rate' technology within its brand new Ampere GPUs that restrict mining in various cryptocurrency algorithms. The LHR implementation is yet to be bypassed and that's really a good sign and we hope for it to stay that way. The CMP lineup also sold well as reported in NVIDIA's last financial results so overall, things are moving at a steady pace but the GPU shortages will take some time to be rectified.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n123\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n105\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\niPhone 17 Air Pricing Details Suggest It Will Occupy The Same Bracket As Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Plus, And Will Arrive With Better Battery Life, But At The Cost Of Extra Features\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1475\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

At $599, it\u2019s marketed as a direct upgrade for RTX 1070 and 2070 Super users, but at $100 more than the standard RTX 3070, is it worth paying extra for? I\u2019ve spent the last week testing the card to answer exactly that question and see what kind of upgrade this card offers for last-gen users.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition11 ImagesNvidia RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition \u2013 Design and FeaturesLike the rest of this generation of Founders Edition cards, the RTX 3070 Ti is all about one-upmanship of the RTX 20-series. If you haven\u2019t experienced a Founders Edition card from this generation, you\u2019ll be in for a treat. Like the original 3070 (reviewed here), the 3070 Ti features Nvidia\u2019s dual-axial cooler. Despite its compact size, the actual PCB is even smaller, which allows the heatsink to overhang, directly below the fan. Paired with a sizable vent along the back, air is whisked out the back of the card, allowing it to stay at safe temperatures and high clock speeds. This generation of Founders Edition cards represents Nvidia\u2019s best work when it comes to its in-house coolers, and though this does run warmer than the version found on the RTX 3080, it\u2019s a big improvement from the 20-series cards.Under the simple yet eye-catching exterior of the card, the RTX 3070 Ti packs some impressive specs. It features 6144 CUDA cores and 8GB of upgraded GDDR6X memory. Both the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 3070 featured standard GDDR6. The bump to GDDR6X increases the total memory bandwidth from 448 GB/s to 608 GB/s. This boost allows assets to load and display faster; however, with GDDR6 already being quite fast, you might need a keen eye to spot the improvement in normal gameplay. The bigger concern is that 8GB just doesn\u2019t feel like enough for a card of this caliber. AMD\u2019s best competitors, the RX 6800 and RX 6700 XT, ship with 16GB and 12GB, and considering that there are already games that push the 3070 Ti to its limit at 4K with ray tracing enabled, they feel significantly more forward thinking in this department. The rated Boost Clock also received a jolt and is now guaranteed for 1.77 GHz. The original RTX 3070 was just slightly less at 1.73 GHz. It\u2019s on par with the 2070 Super\u2019s clock speed \u2013 but since so much has changed this generation, that means less than it might seem. Regardless, thanks to Nvidia\u2019s GPU Boost technology, you\u2019ll likely blow right past these rated speeds anyway. When gaming, the Ti ramped up to 1920 MHz and would occasionally tip over to 1950 MHz. Under load, the card never actually dropped to the rated speeds. The card tends to run hot, however. Compared to the RTX 3070, the 3070 Ti uses more electricity (290 watts versus the former\u2019s 220 watts), which in turn means more heat. My office was rather warm at 26C and the card peaked at 82C in an open case. The fans had to work harder to keep up, which generated more noise than the original RTX 3070. It still wasn\u2019t enough to be distracting while gaming but it would have been nice to see it run a bit cooler, even if it meant a slightly larger card overall.Like the rest of the RTX 30-series, the RTX 3070 Ti is built on Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture. It offers big performance gains over Team Green\u2019s last-generation GPUs while still following the same three-tiered approach to the core architecture. In short, RTX GPUs are composed of three parts: the programmable shader (rasterization), the RT core (ray tracing), and the tensor core (AI). Each of these carries a portion of the rendering weight and is measured in TFLOPS. Here\u2019s how the RTX 3070 Ti breaks down in comparison to the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 3070:22 Shader-TFLOPS (+144% FROM RTX 2070 Super, +8.4% from RTX 3070, -26.7% from RTX 3080)42 RT-TFLOPS (+75% from RTX 2070 Super, +5.8% from RTX 3070, -27.6% from RTX 3080)174 Tensor-TFLOPS (+142% from RTX 2070 Super, +7%, -26.9% from RTX 3080) The gains from the RTX 2070 Super are large, so the generational leap is absolutely noteworthy. If you\u2019re coming from ever farther back, like the GTX 1070 Ti, Nvidia says its new card offers \u201c2x the performance.\u201d Compared against the RTX 3070, the gains are marginal, however, which plays out in actual benchmark testing.I won\u2019t spend too long going over the \u201cextras\u201d that come with an RTX GPU, but they\u2019re worth mentioning briefly as a reminder. The hallmark feature is, of course, DLSS. Nvidia\u2019s intelligent upscaling technology has a significant lead on AMD\u2019s upcoming FidelityFX Super Resolution and looks to remain an impactful feature for the foreseeable future, especially for users running 4K monitors. Streamers will enjoy Nvidia Broadcast, a suite of AI-enhanced tools that use RTX to effectively remove background noise or virtual greenscreen background removal. For esports, Nvidia Reflex is an excellent feature to reduce input lag and increase responsiveness with only a minor impact on overall performance. If you\u2019re a cryptocurrency miner, it\u2019s also important to note that this card follows the RTX 3080 Ti and limits the hash rate when mining Ethereum. This is part of Nvidia\u2019s effort to make the card less appealing to cryptocurrency miners. As the price of GPUs soars ever higher with the current worldwide shortage, this also means you\u2019ll be less able to recoup the cost of your investment if you had been planning on dabbling in mining yourself. It\u2019s a difficult and complex situation, and there are open questions about whether this is an effective way to dissuade crypto miners, but is definitely something to be aware of had you been planning on doing so yourself.Finally, when it comes to outputs, the RTX 3070 Ti offers one HDMI 2.1 output for the latest and highest performance gaming monitors out there, and three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs for a total resolution of 7680x4320 (8K) split across all outputs. For video streaming, the card supports AV1 decoding. For creating your own content, it is compatible with Nvidia\u2019s proprietary encoder for streaming and video work.Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition \u2013 PerformanceTest system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply.Our video cards are benchmarked using a series of synthetic tests and real world gaming benchmarks. Unless otherwise noted, all games are set to Ultra settings with ray tracing and DLSS on (set to Ultra) wherever possible. We strive to use Founders Edition or reference cards wherever possible but with older generation GPUs, this wasn\u2019t always possible, so be aware that factory overclocks can account for minor performance increases on those cards. Let\u2019s begin with synthetics.The first two synthetic tests I ran the card through were 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra and Unigine Heaven. In Fire Strike Ultra, the card offered a boost over both the standard RTX 3070 and the RTX 2070 Super of 6% and 41% respectively. I also included the RTX 2080 Ti results since the original RTX 3070 was compared directly to it, as well as the RX 6800 XT which has an MSRP of only $50 more. While the 3070 Ti beats the 2080 Ti handily, it doesn\u2019t come close to the RX 6800 XT. Likewise, the RTX 3080 maintains a 15% advantage.In Heaven, the results are much closer between the 3070 Ti, 3070, and 2080 Ti. Again, however, the RX 6800 XT dominates the charts.Moving onto ray tracing specific benchmarks, the RTX 3070 Ti performs well but couldn\u2019t top the RTX 2080 Ti in 3DMark Port Royal. It did top the RTX 3070 by 7% and the RTX 2070 Super by 41%, however. In the FPS-based tests, the RTX 3070 Ti bests the 3070 by 16% in Boundary and 3% in 3DMark\u2019s ray tracing test. Against the RTX 2070 Super it leads by 52% and 77%. Stepping up to the RTX 3080 nets a 28% and 40% performance boost in these two tests. Enough with synthetics, let\u2019s see how it performed in games.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Gaming Benchmarks5 ImagesBeginning with our standard stable of benchmark titles, the differences between the different cards in real-world gameplay begin to become apparent. Compared to the RTX 2070 Super, the RTX 3070 Ti represents a solid upgrade by offering an average of 42% more FPS at 4K, 38% at 1440p, and 29% at 1080p. Against the standard RTX 3070, the results are much more narrow, averaging on 4% faster at 4K, 3% faster at 1440p, and 2% faster at 1080p. It\u2019s also worth noting that the differences ranged from less than 1% to 9% in favor of the RTX 3070 Ti, so performance is close.But what about if you wanted to step up? In that case, the RTX 3080 offers substantial improvements for the added $100 on MSRP. At 4K the 3070 Ti ran 80% slower on average, 18% slower at 1440p, and 15% slower at 1080p. Against the RX 6800 XT (with Metro Exodus removed due to the DLSS advantage), the 3070 Ti averaged 16% slower at 4K, 19% slower at 1440p, and 17% slower at 4K. Of course, the performance of the card will depend on the games you\u2019re playing, and this is a limited sampling, so I conducted some expanded tests at 4K. Here\u2019s how it averaged there. In this expanding testing, the RTX 3070 Ti averaged 43% faster than the RTX 2070 Super and 13% faster than the RTX 3070. Against the RTX 3080, it was 21% slower. When pitted against the RX 6800 XT and can benefit from DLSS in ray traced titles, the 3070 Ti averages 11% faster but with those titles removed comes in 15% slower.As these results demonstrate, the RTX 3070 Ti is a good card on its own merits but offers only marginal improvements from the original RTX 3070. So who is this card for? If you\u2019re coming from the GTX 1070 or RTX 2070 Super, there are major gains to be had, but that same thing holds true with the standard RTX 3070, and remember, that card was compared against the RTX 2080 Ti. The 3070 Ti edges it out in performance but it\u2019s not huge. Instead, this card seems intended to compete with the  RX 6800 XT, filling in a gap in Nvidia's catalog for this price point, but it just doesn't seem worth it when the RTX 3070 exists for less. Then there\u2019s the matter of the card only featuring 8GB of VRAM, which could lead to an earlier upgrade and more money spent than if you just bought an RTX 3080 in the first place. As it stands, this card really only seems to fit for gamers who want to do a straight \u201cgen-to-gen\u201d jump or those who have a hard budget and want the fastest card under a certain price. Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition \u2013 Purchasing GuideThe RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition will be available from retailers worldwide on June 10th for $599. Aftermarket variants will follow with independent pricing. VerdictThe RTX 3070 Ti is a solidly-performing card but its price to performance ratio seems out of whack.  Unless you fall into several narrow camps, you\u2019re best suited going with the original RTX 3070 or saving for an RTX 3080.In This ArticleGeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIAJun 10, 2021Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition Review6Review scoringokayThe RTX 3070 Ti is a solid card but offers only marginal improvements over the RTX 3070.Chris CokeMore Reviews by Chris Coke9Haworth Fern Review9The Low-Profile Chilkey ND75 LP Is a Top-Tier Gaming Keyboard for Less7Steelcase Karman High Back ReviewIGN LogoReviews\u2022Editor Columns\u2022News\u2022Guides\u2022How to Watch Guides\u2022Elden Ring DLC Interactive Map\u2022GTA 5 Cheats\u2022IGN Store\u2022HowLongToBeat\u2022Deals\u2022Contact Us\u2022IGN YouTube\u2022IGN TikTok\u2022IGN Twitter\u2022Map Genie"

It also demonstrates that users continue to embrace the combination of NVIDIA AI, accelerated computing and networking technologies to run their scientific and commercial workloads.\nFor example, the number of systems on the list using InfiniBand jumped 21 percent from last year, increasing its position as the network of choice for handling a rising tide of AI, HPC and simulation data with low latency and acceleration.\nThe number of systems using InfiniBand networking rose 20 percent from a year ago.\nIn addition, two new systems on the list are what we call superclouds \u2014 emerging styles of shared supercomputers with new capabilities at the intersection of AI, high performance computing and the cloud.\nHere Comes a Supercloud\nMicrosoft Azure took public cloud services to a new level, demonstrating work on systems that took four consecutive spots from No. 26 to No. 29 on the TOP500 list. They are parts of a global AI supercomputer called the ND A100 v4 cluster, available on demand in four global regions today.\nEach of the systems delivered 16.59 petaflops on the HPL benchmark also known as Linpack, a traditional measure of HPC performance on 64-bit floating point math that\u2019s the basis for the TOP500 rankings.\nAn Industrial HPC Era Begins\nAzure is an example of what NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang calls \u201can industrial HPC revolution,\u201d the confluence of AI with high performance and accelerated computing that\u2019s advancing every field of science and industry.\nUnder the hood, eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs power each virtual instance of the Azure cluster. Each chip has its own HDR 200G InfiniBand link that can create fast connections to thousands of GPUs in Azure.\nUK Researchers Go Cloud-Native\nThe University of Cambridge debuted the fastest academic system in the U.K., a supercomputer that hit No. 3 on the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient systems. It\u2019s another sort of supercloud.\nCalled Wilkes-3, it\u2019s the world\u2019s first cloud-native supercomputer, letting researchers share virtual resources with privacy and security while not compromising performance. It does this thanks to NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, optimized to execute security, virtualization and other data-processing tasks.\nThe system uses 320 A100 GPUs linked on an HDR 200G InfiniBand network to accelerate simulations, AI and data analytics for academic research as well as commercial partners exploring the frontiers of science and medicine.\nNew TOP500 Systems Embrace AI\u00a0\nMany of the new NVIDIA-powered systems on the list show the rising importance of AI in high performance computing for both scientific and commercial users.\nPerlmutter, at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), hit No. 5 on the TOP500 with 64.59 Linpack petaflops, thanks in part to its 6,144 A100 GPUs.\nThe system delivered more than half an exaflops of performance on the latest version of HPL-AI. It\u2019s an emerging benchmark of converged HPC and AI workloads that uses mixed-precision math \u2014 the basis of deep learning and many scientific and commercial jobs \u2014 while still delivering the full accuracy of double-precision math.\nAI performance is increasingly important because AI is \u201ca growth area in the U.S. Department of Energy, where proof of concepts are moving into production use,\u201d said Wahid Bhimji, acting lead for NERSC\u2019s data and analytics services group.\nHiPerGator AI took No. 22 with 17.20 petaflops and ranked No. 2 on the Green500, making it the world\u2019s most energy-efficient academic supercomputer. It missed the top spot on the Green500 by a whisker \u2014 just 0.18 Gflops/watt.\nLike 12 others on the latest list, the system uses the modular architecture of the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, a recipe that let the University of Florida rapidly deploy one of the world\u2019s most powerful academic AI supercomputers. The system also made it a leading AI university with a stated goal of creating 30,000 AI-enabled graduates by 2030.\nMeluXina, in Luxembourg, ranked No. 37 with 10.5 Linpack petaflops. It\u2019s among the first systems to debut on the list from a network of European national supercomputers that will apply AI and data analytics across scientific and commercial applications.\nCambridge-1 ranked No. 42 on the TOP500, hitting 9.68 petaflops, becoming the most powerful system in the U.K. It will serve U.K. healthcare researchers in academic and commercial organizations including AstraZeneca, GSK and Oxford Nanopore.\nBerzeLiUs hit No. 83 with 5.25 petaflops, making it Sweden\u2019s fastest system. It runs HPC, AI and data analytics for academic and commercial research on a 200G InfiniBand network linking 60 NVIDIA DGX systems. It\u2019s one of 15 systems on the list based on NVIDIA DGX systems.\nEleven Systems Fuel HPL-AI Momentum\nIn another sign of the increasing importance of AI workloads, 11 systems on the list reported their scores on HPL-AI, more than 5x the number from last June. Most used a major optimization of the code released in March, the first upgrade since the benchmark was released by researchers at the University of Tennessee in late 2018.\nThe new software streamlines communications, enabling GPU-to-GPU links that eliminate waiting for a host CPU. It also implements communications as 16-bit code rather than the slower 32-bit code that is the default on Linpack.\n\u201cWe cut time spent on chip-to-chip communications in half and enabled some other workloads to run in parallel, so the average improvement of the new versus the original code is about 2.7x,\u201d said Azzam Haidar Ahmad, who helped define the benchmark and is now a senior engineer at NVIDIA.\nWhile focused on mixed-precision math, the benchmark still delivers the same 64-bit accuracy of Linpack, thanks to a looping technique in HPL-AI that rapidly refines some calculations.\nSummit Hits 1+ Exaflops on HPL-AI\nWith the optimizations, scores rose significantly over benchmarks reported last year using the early version of the code.\nFor example, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab, the first to embrace HPL-AI, announced a score of 445 petaflops on the first version of the code in 2019. Summit\u2019s test this year using the latest version of HPL-AI hit 1.15 exaflops.\nOthers adopting the benchmark include Japan\u2019s Fugaku supercomputer, the world\u2019s fastest system, NVIDIA\u2019s Selene, the world\u2019s fastest commercial system, and Juwels, Germany\u2019s most powerful supercomputer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using the HPL-AI benchmark because it\u2019s a good measure of the mixed-precision work in a growing number of our AI and scientific workloads \u2014 and it reflects accurate 64-bit floating point results, too,\u201d said Thomas Lippert, director of the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Center.\nGPUs Lead the Green500 Pack\nOn the Green500 that measures energy efficiency on Linpack, 35 of the top 40 systems run on NVIDIA technologies, including nine of the top 10. Supercomputers on the list that use NVIDIA GPUs are 3.5x more energy efficient than ones that don\u2019t, a consistent and growing trend.\nTo learn more, tune into the NVIDIA ISC 2021 Special Address Monday, June 28, at 9:30 a.m. PT.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti story should be familiar ground. Halfway through the regular product cycle, release a higher-spec, higher-performance variant of the existing x80-series part with a price that makes for a compelling upgrade. The GTX 1080 was a great card back in the day, and the GTX 1080 Ti upped the ante and basically redefined what we came to expect from a mid-cycle update. But anything even remotely competitive from our GPU benchmarks hierarchy, along with all the best graphics cards, are in a bad place right now with virtually no availability at retail and exorbitant prices on places like eBay. As a result, the RTX 3080 Ti ends up looking a lot more like the RTX 2080 Ti than the GTX 1080 Ti: Fast but expensive.\n\nFundamentally, nothing has changed with the Nvidia Ampere architecture. More games support ray tracing and DLSS, and driver improvements over the previous nine months have altered performance a bit since launch. Otherwise, the RTX 3080 Ti takes the same GA102 GPU found in the GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080, disables two more SMs compared to the 3090, and slashes the VRAM capacity in half compared to the 3090. That's not actually that big of a deal in most games, and performance should generally be quite similar between the two.\n\nThe real question will be retail pricing and availability, which will undoubtedly be awful. Officially, the RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition has a $1,199 price tag \u2014 $300 less than the 3090, but $500 more than the 3080. In practice, the RTX 3080 already sells for close to $2,000 on eBay, and even in the Newegg Shuffle, it routinely goes for over $1,200. Meanwhile, the RTX 3090 pushes closer to $3,000 on eBay and costs more than $2,000 in the Newegg Shuffles we've tracked \u2014 and your odds of getting picked in the Shuffle are extremely low, based on our experience.\n\nHere's a quick overview of the specifications for the RTX 3080 Ti, along with similar Nvidia GPUs:Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 3090RTX 3080 TiRTX 3080RTX 2080 TiArchitectureGA102GA102GA102TU102Process TechnologySamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)28.328.328.318.6Die size (mm^2)628.4628.4628.4754SMs / CUs82806868GPU Cores104961024087044352Tensor Cores328320272544RT Cores82806868Base Clock (MHz)1395137014401515Boost Clock (MHz)1695166517101545VRAM Speed (Gbps)19.5191914VRAM (GB)24121011VRAM Bus Width384384320352ROPs1121129688TMUs328320272272TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)35.634.129.813.4TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)142 (285)136 (273)119 (238)108RT TFLOPS69675843Bandwidth (GBps)936912760616TDP (watts)350350320260Launch DateSep 2020Jun 2021Sep 2020Sep 2018Launch Price$1,499 $1,199 $699 $1,199 In terms of theoretical performance, the RTX 3080 Ti lands 3\u20134% behind the RTX 3090 and 14\u201320% ahead of the RTX 3080. Memory bandwidth shows the biggest gains, thanks to the addition of two memory channels, though clocks are slightly lower on the GPU side of things. Power consumption is rated at 350W, the same as the 3090 and 30W more than the 3080, which could be a problem given the 3080 Ti Founders Edition uses the same cooler design as the 3080 rather than the triple-slot monstrosity that is the 3090 Founders Edition.\n\nLooking at generational improvements, the RTX 3080 Ti is potentially more than double the compute performance of the 2080 Ti, with nearly 50% more memory bandwidth. In practice, we expect performance will be about 40\u201350% faster than the 2080 Ti, but that will mostly be at 4K and 1440p. Buying a GPU like this for 1080p gaming (unless you're playing games with lots of ray tracing effects) would be a waste of money.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)One final item of note before we continue is that the RTX 3080 Ti implements Nvidia's Ethereum hashrate limiter. The limiter works as expected for the time being, and we saw average hash rates of 55\u201365 MHps at stock settings, depending on the software used. That's basically half the performance we'd expect from the hardware and similar to what we saw with the launch of the GeForce RTX 3060. Hopefully, Nvidia doesn't accidentally circumvent its own lock this time, though we expect pricing will remain higher than the official starting point, even with the limiter.\u00a0GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Design: Unchanged From RTX 3080Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)For better or worse, Nvidia hasn't altered the card design relative to the RTX 3080 Founders Edition. The cooler mostly worked well before and ran reasonably quiet\u2026 except when the GDDR6X memory got hot and the fans had to kick up to full speed. We hoped Nvidia would use better thermal pads for the GDDR6X memory this round, especially with the addition of two more GDDR6X chips, but that doesn't appear to have happened.\n\nIn testing, games generally didn't have major problems, with memory temperatures peaking at anywhere from 94C\u2013104C. The higher end of that range is a concern, however, as we're dealing with a brand-new card. How will it perform after a year or two of use? We've been there, countless times, and the answer will inevitably be higher temperatures and fan speeds over time.\n\nTesting mining algorithms was a different story, with multiple algorithms pushing the GDDR6X temps to 110C, max fan speeds, and throttling of GPU clocks to try to compensate. Some future game, or game that we haven't tested, might behave in a similar fashion, but we haven't encountered any specific games that match the intensity of mining. That's the good news. The bad news is that a $10 thermal pad upgrade for the Founders Edition is still a good idea, but it would void your warranty. Nvidia should have done the 'upgrade' itself and used higher-quality pads.\n\nOne thing that has changed since the launch of the RTX 30-series last year is support for the RGB lighting on the cards. We've verified that multiple RGB utilities, including Corsair's iCue, can now control the LEDs on the 3080 and 3090 Founders Edition cards, and that applies to the 3080 Ti Founders Edition as well. Do you want your Nvidia GPU to dress up in AMD red? Now it can! And there was much rejoicing.\n\nWe'll be looking at some third party cards in the coming days as well, and hopefully those will pay more attention to memory cooling. This has been a sore spot on RTX 3080 and 3090 cards since launch, with only about 25% of the cards we've looked at using better GDDR6X cooling methods. Considering the extreme nature of these parts, we expect manufacturers to pay more attention to this important aspect of cooling going forward.GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Gaming PerformanceTOM'S HARDWARE GPU TEST PCIntel Core i9-9900K\nMSI MEG Z390 Ace\nCorsair 2x16GB DDR4-3200 CL16\nXPG SX8200 Pro 2TB\nSeasonic Focus 850 Platinum\nCorsair Hydro H150i Pro RGB\nOpenBenchTable\nPhanteks Enthoo Pro M\u00a0Our test setup remains unchanged from previous reviews, though we'll be doing additional testing with ray tracing and DLSS \u2014 using the same tests as our AMD vs. Nvidia: Ray Tracing Showdown. We're using the test equipment shown above, which consists of a Core i9-9900K, 32GB DDR4-3600 memory, 2TB M.2 SSD, and the various GPUs being tested \u2014 all of which are reference models here.\n\nThat gives us two sets of results. First is the traditional rendering performance, using thirteen games at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K with ultra/maximum quality settings. Then we have ten more games with RT (and sometimes DLSS, where applicable). We'll start with 4K since this is a top-tier GPU more likely to be used at that resolution, plus it's where the card does best relative to the other GPUs \u2014 CPU bottlenecks are almost completely eliminated at 4K but more prevalent at 1080p.Image 1 of 28(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Overall, 4K ultra gaming puts the RTX 3080 Ti right behind the RTX 3090, just as expected. The difference between 24GB and 12GB VRAM generally doesn't show up in our standard test suite in any meaningful way, with the largest gains topping out at around 5%. Basically, it comes down to clock speeds and core counts.\n\nOne clear impetus for the RTX 3080 Ti can be seen in the standings. Previously, the RTX 3090 claimed the top spot, but the RTX 3080 traded blows with the RX 6800 XT and often fell behind the RX 6900 XT. The RTX 3080 Ti 'corrects' things and puts Nvidia back in first and second place. AMD still has its strong points, like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Borderlands 3, and Forza Horizon 4, but at least the two most expensive (based on MSRP) GPUs take the top two spots at 4K ultra \u2014 and as we'll see later, ray tracing definitely favors Nvidia by a larger margin.Image 1 of 28(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Dropping down to 1440p, the gaps between the fastest cards narrow slightly, and AMD's Infinity Cache starts to play a bigger role. Where the RTX 3080 Ti placed second overall at 4K, just behind the 3090, it now drops behind the RX 6900 XT and lands in third place, with the RX 6800 XT nipping at its heels.\n\nAssuming any of these GPUs were even available at MSRP, AMD makes a very strong case for its RDNA2 cards. Considering the 3080 already costs more (on eBay) than the 6900 XT, the 3080 Ti will likely be even worse \u2014 though the limited Ethereum mining performance might affect eBay prices.\n\nThe individual games tell a similar story as above, but AMD has even more wins relative to Nvidia. Valhalla remains the major outlier, with its optimized-for-AMD performance, but Borderlands 3, Forza Horizon 4, and Horizon Zero Dawn all put the RX 6800 XT ahead of the 3080 Ti. Nvidia counters with significant wins in The Division 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Metro Exodus, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Strange Brigade \u2014 with the remaining games being basically tied.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 28(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Remember when we said that buying a card like this for 1080p gaming was overkill? This is what we were talking about. The top five cards are relatively tightly packed, partly due to CPU bottlenecks, with AMD's RX 6900 XT now sitting in the pole position, followed by the RTX 3090, RX 6800 XT, and RTX 3080 Ti, and RTX 3080. If you're after ultra-high framerates (e.g., on a 1080p 360Hz monitor), you'll definitely want to get the fastest CPU for gaming possible \u2014 possibly the Core i9-11900K if you can handle the power and cooling, though the Ryzen 9 5900X is arguably the better pick overall.\n\nThe rather questionable results in certain AMD promoted games \u2014 particularly Assassin's Creed Valhalla \u2014 become even more apparent. That game either really loves AMD's Infinity Cache, or contains heavy AMD optimizations, or both, as its 45% lead for the 6900 XT over the 3080 Ti is an extreme outlier. The Infinity Cache definitely helps at 1080p more than higher resolutions, however, and AMD's cards have a strong showing in general. Of course, everything from the RX 6800 and up averages more than 144 fps in our test suite at 1080p, which frankly should satisfy all but the most demanding esports competitors.GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Ray Tracing and DLSS Gaming PerformanceSo far, we've focused on gaming performance using traditional rasterization graphics. We've also excluded using Nvidia's DLSS technology in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. Let's change things up for a moment and look at ray tracing performance, with and without DLSS 2.0, where applicable. We're only showing DLSS results on the 3080 Ti, and we used the Quality mode (2x upscaling) in the six games where it was supported. AMD's FSR will provide an alternative to DLSS in the coming months, though we don't yet have hands-on experience with it, so we can't comment on the image quality. We'll also confine testing to 1440p and 1080p here since native 4K with ray tracing tends to push even the fastest GPUs beyond their reasonable limits. This is the same testing we used in our recent AMD vs. Nvidia Ray Tracing Battle.Image 1 of 11(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)While AMD was competitive in games that use traditional rendering techniques, ray tracing continues to strongly favor Nvidia. We even included two AMD games (Dirt 5 and Godfall) that don't actually benefit all that much from ray tracing. Games that use more effects, like Bright Memory Infinite, Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, and Minecraft really benefit from Nvidia's second-generation RT cores, not to mention DLSS 2.0. (Note that we're still using the original Metro Exodus and not the Enhanced version, which also adds more RT effects and DLSS 2.0.)\n\nWe're not going to say ray tracing is required to enjoy most games, but it can make a difference. Given a few more years of work and hardware improvements, we'll hopefully see games that push visuals to new levels of fidelity. We're just not there yet.Image 1 of 11(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Even 1080p can be taxing with all the ray tracing effects enabled. The RTX 3080 Ti continues to come in just behind the RTX 3090, beating the closest AMD card by more than 20%. Dirt 5 and Godfall are the outliers again, with RT only used for shadows \u2014 what we'd argue is generally the least impressive use of ray tracing.\n\nWhile the various games are all promoted either by Nvidia or AMD, we'd say Fortnite is probably the best 'neutral' look at how the cards stack up with RT enabled \u2014 mostly because Epic has a vested interest in optimizing Unreal Engine to run as good as possible on all GPUs. If you agree with that way of looking at things, the RTX 3080 Ti beats the RX 6900 XT by over 30% in Fortnite, even at 1080p.GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Power, Clocks, Temperatures, and Fan SpeedsOkay, we said 'power' but we actually don't have power results yet. Jarred recently moved halfway across the US, and in the process, his power testing equipment partially failed. The RTX 3080 Ti does appear to peak at around 350\u2013360W, and we'll update this page with proper power testing using our Powenetics equipment as soon as we're able to replace the failed bricklet. In the meantime, here's a look at clock speeds, temperatures, and fan speeds.\n\nWe use Metro Exodus running at 1440p ultra (without RT or DLSS) and FurMark running at 1600x900 in stress test mode. Each test runs for about 10 minutes and we log the result to generate the charts. For the bar charts, we only average data where the GPU load is above 90% (to avoid skewing things in Metro when the benchmark restarts).Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)While the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti technically beat its rated boost clock of 1665MHz in Metro, averaging 1800MHz, it also delivered the lowest average GPU clocks out of any of the latest-gen GPUs. In FurMark, all of the GPUs clock much lower to avoid blowing past their TDP. Again, the RTX 3080 Ti exceeds the base clock of 1370MHz, but not by much.\n\nAMD's RDNA2 cards are tuned for much higher clocks, but we would have liked to see the 3080 Ti land a bit closer to the 3090 here. A large part of the deficit likely comes thanks to the unmodified RTX 3080 cooler, which certainly doesn't appear to be coping all that well with the added power and heat, as we'll see in a moment.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Interestingly, temperatures don't look too bad in FurMark, but the 3080 Ti was one of the hottest running cards in our gaming workload. 73 degrees Celsius (C) on the GPU core isn't particularly worrisome, though we did see GDDR6X temperatures well above 100C when gaming at 4K in multiple games. Again, we really wish Nvidia would have done a bit more to improve the RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition design \u2014 better GDDR6X thermal pads might have sufficed.\n\nAs we stated earlier, it's not the GPU thermals alone that are important. We've seen numerous instances over the past nine months where cards with GDDR6X run hot on the memory. Fresh from the box hardware represents the best-case scenario for the hardware, outside of modding the card yourself. If the RTX 3080 Ti already hits peak temperatures of 104C on the memory in some games, we expect that to get worse over time.\n\nWe've seen this on lots of previous generation cards, like the RTX 2080 Ti, where one Founders Edition card we tested ended up having to spike fan speeds to 100% every 60 seconds or so while gaming just to keep thermals in check. If you have any RTX 30-series card with GDDR6X memory, we recommend keeping an eye on temperatures and keeping the heatsink and fans clear of dust with regular cleanings. Not that we don't recommend that as a general rule regardless, but it will likely prove even more important on the current generation of cards with 300W and higher TDPs.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The corollary to the relatively weak thermal performance of the RTX 3080 Ti is that it also had far and away the worst fan speeds. We're used to seeing 2000+ RPM only when overclocking or using cards with lackluster coolers. Which we suppose applies to the 3080 Ti Founders Edition. The average fan speed during our Metro test was 'only' 1935 rpm, but each loop of the benchmark only lasts about two minutes. Running any taxing game for an hour or two will easily push the fan speed into the 2250 rpm range, unless you have a case that provides a lot of airflow (and probably even then).GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Skip the Founders Edition(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nine months after Ampere first appeared in the form of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, Nvidia is back with a mid-cycle refresh it's calling \"the ultimate Ti.\" Nvidia makes reference to the GTX 1080 Ti, which admittedly was a great card back in the day. It was priced $150 above the GTX 1080 at launch and actually inherited the GTX 1080 Founders Edition launch price, all while delivering about 30% better performance. Even today, gamers with GTX 1080 Ti cards can still run every game out there \u2014 just not at maxed-out settings. That's a pretty high bar to clear, and frankly, the RTX 3080 Ti doesn't come close.\n\nThe RTX 3080 Ti isn't awful, but if you're willing to plunk down $1,200 for a graphics card \u2014 in theory, because we all know these are going to end up selling for closer to $2,000 or more for the foreseeable future \u2014 spending $300 more to double your VRAM and get a better cooler with the RTX 3090 seems like a better plan. Instead of a marginally higher price than the RTX 3080, the MSRP is 70% higher and the RTX 3080 Ti is only about 10\u201312% faster on average. Plus, as we mentioned above, the Founders Edition cooler can't keep up with the additional GPU cores and GDDR6X memory.\n\nThe RTX 3080 Ti is far more similar to the RTX 2080 Ti than the 1080 Ti \u2014 except it's nine months late to the party, which is probably just as well since GPU shortages will likely continue throughout the rest of the year. By the time we're able to stroll into a retail shop or check out of an online store without battling bots and shortages, we might be looking at the next generation Hopper and RDNA3 architectures.\n\nThere's potential for far more promising third party cards, but then we still have the price conundrum. It's been an incredibly bleak year for graphics cards so far. This card was probably originally slated to be a $999 competitor to the RX 6900 XT, but in the current market, Nvidia has bumped the price to reap some of the profits that the AIBs and suppliers have been enjoying. Since everything we'd like to recommend ends up costing twice as much as it \"should,\" and much of the price gouging doesn't end up going to Nvidia (or AMD), this is what we get. If you thought the RTX 3090 was too expensive when it launched at $1,500, be prepared for slightly lower performance, half the VRAM, and higher street prices on the RTX 3080 Ti. Well, higher than the 3090 launch price, at least, since the RTX 3090 now basically sells at Titan RTX and Titan V levels these days.\n\nFundamentally, there's nothing wrong with the RTX 3080 Ti on paper. Even the price might be tolerable for those with deeper pockets. But unless we see a dramatic increase in supply \u2014 or a massive decrease in demand (which might happen, as mining profitability has dropped quite a bit during the past month) \u2014 finding one in stock at a reasonable price will be an exercise in frustration. Anyone still hoping to pick up a 3080 Ti should also opt for a third party card with higher factory clocks and a beefier cooler.

I expected it to be there after the initial chart listed the specs of the 2080ti against the 3000 cards. As a 2080ti owner, I agree with the author that this is the first upgrade path made available to existing 2080ti owners and its inclusion in the data would have made sense. Plus, I personally would have like to see it there on the charts so I could see my current card vs all the potential upgrade paths into the newest generation of cards from AMD and NVIDIA ;-P\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspongiemaster\n\n\nthepersonwithaface45 said:I mean it was obvious for current 3080 owners to not even try for this 'upgrade' but really? $1200? 200 less than a 3090?\nLike why would I settle for a 3080ti if it's only 200 more dollars separating me from a 3090?

AWS Or NVIDIA?ByKarl FreundFollowShareSaveInnovationEnterprise TechWho Won The Latest AI Drag Race? AWS Or NVIDIA?ByKarl Freund, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorJun 08, 2021, 12:00pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Of course the answer depends on who you ask.\nThere is a quiet drama simmering over AI chip benchmarks. This isn\u2019t the first time, and will certainly not be the last. Keeps me busy. This time, it is between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA. It is always NVIDIA. Not because NVIDIA is squirrelly with benchmarks, quite the contrary, but because they are the target. Beat NVIDIA, and you win big, right?\n\n\nAWS and NVIDIA posted inference benchmarks running the same model, BERT Base, which is a popular, small-ish, natural language model. AWS said they beat NVIDIA. NVIDIA published data quite to the contrary. Could both somehow be right? This tug of war has played out quietly, below most users and investors radars. After all, NVIDIA does not want to confront one of its largest customers.\n\nBut we\u2019ve got the analysis here so let\u2019s dive in and see who really is faster and more affordable. The stakes are significant for bragging rights, but we all know that users make infrastructure decisions based on a wide range of criteria; benchmarks are only a small but important part of the calculus.\n\n\nThe Setup\nIn the recent blog, AWS claimed the home-grown Inferentia chip is up to 12 time faster than the NVIDIA T4 GPU AWS instances, and costs up to 70% less. NVIDIA responded politely and a bit obliquely without making any comparisons, posting a blog showing AWS users how to get the best performance from GPU instances by running the model through and on NVIDIA software. AWS used same open-source HuggingFace PyTorch\u00a0model on both, while NVIDIA used the model that is optimized for GPUs, and ran the inference processing with NVIDIA tools.\n\nThe Data\nAWS ran benchmarks for both batch and real time (BS=1) inference processing. The results show that Inferentia beat the NVIDIA T4 across the board, at lower cost. By design, this was an \u201cout of the box\u201d comparison, running the benchmarks through the PyTorch framework without any optimizations for either platform using open source models. There is some optimization here that is transparent to the user, in which the Neuron compiler converts 32-bit floating-point to Bfloat16 to preserve precision while improving performance under TensorFlow and PyTorch.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nIn contrast, NVIDIA engineers used the NVIDIA version of BERT and TensorRT to quantize the model to 8-bit integer math (instead of Bfloat16 as AWS used), and ran the code on the Triton Inference Server to dynamically optimize batch sizes to a desired response time goal (5- and 10-milliseconds). These techniques effectively turned the economics around 180 degrees in NVIDIA\u2019s favor. Instead of costing 88 cents to run a million low-latency sentence inferences, NVIDIA says they can do that under 5 milliseconds for only 8 cents, and can run offline batch inference requests for the same price.\n\nOur Analysis\nHere\u2019s our depiction of the results. As you can see, the improvement using Triton and TensorRT was significant. Looking at the raw data on the blog, NVIDIA outperformed all but two Inferentia configurations by a factor 4X to over 6X in raw bandwidth. The Inferentia Inf1.6xlarge with four Inferentia chips, crossed the line with throughput similar to the optimized T4, but at a 4X price premium for BS=1.\n\n Batch and Real-time performance per $ for BERT Base was dramatically improved using NVIDIA's ... [+] optimization tools and inference server.AWS, NVIDIA, and Cambrian-AI Research\nThe difference between the results and approaches are driven by what each company believes is important to its customers. AWS believes some clients do not want to spend the time to optimize the inference models, in other words, \u201cgood enough\u201d is just that, \u201cgood enough\u201d.\u00a0 Also, AWS believes many clients are not comfortable that 8-bit integer models can deliver adequate accuracy. On the other side, NVIDIA points to customers who are getting great results on Int-8 models for Auto, medical imaging, smart cities, and increasingly conversational AI, including Tu-Simple, Zoox, and Clarify. We would also mention that while the Inferentia chip itself supports 8-bit integer operations, the compiler does not, reflecting AWS\u2019s dismissal of using 8-bit math based on customer input.\nConclusions\nSo, what is one to make of all this?\u00a0If you are willing to optimize your models, and use NVIDIA\u2019s version of the models, NVIDIA appears faster and lower cost. But, if you want to run open-source models \u201cas is\u201d straight from the framework, then AWS appears to win the match-up by a healthy margin.\nComparing NVIDIA performance numbers (using INT + TensorRT + Custom model) against AWS\u2019s (through PyTorch, open source model & Bfloat16) may not be an apples to apples comparison, but running the model on the T4 without optimization is unrealistic. It is like asking NVIDIA to run the race with both legs in a sack.\nIndependent vendor-run benchmarks invariably invite rebuttals. (See our discussion on AI benchmarking pitfalls here.) The MLPerf benchmarks and MLCommons community help avoid such controversy, and we encourage AWS to consider joining MLCommons.\nLarge companies and venture capitalists are investing billions of dollars to develop faster AI chips precisely because performance matters. Using models \u201cout of the box\u201d is fine for early prototyping, but if organizations are comfortable deploying these unoptimized results for production at lower performance and higher costs, we would be surprised.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

But designing a realistic lunar surface required extensive collaboration across different teams throughout the development and production cycles.\nTo handle the massive amount of data and assets needed to build space scenes, and to create detailed, stunning graphics in high resolution, CMG turned to Omniverse, a real-time simulation and collaboration platform.\nCMG used the newly released NVIDIA Omniverse Machinima, an app that simplifies cinematic 3D storytelling, to bring viewers into immersive cosmic environments. NVIDIA RTX real-time ray tracing and AI helped the team enhance content creation workflows and produce photorealistic graphics for the documentary.\nContent Creation That\u2019s Out of This World\nNVIDIA Omniverse lets CMG\u2019s artists and designers easily unite their 3D assets and multiple software applications in a single, virtual collaboration space. There, they could work together and create simultaneously on shared scenes. They could also easily import and export USD files, which saved time spent on model extractions.\nOmniverse Nucleus, the real-time collaboration engine of the platform, helped the team manage the integrity of their 3D assets and accelerated production workflows. Omniverse Connectors for Epic Games Unreal Engine, Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance enabled live-sync collaborative creation, while the Omniverse RTX Renderer provided real-time previews of scenes and images.\nWorking simultaneously across multiple applications, combined with the ability to review content with real-time ray and path-traced realism, helped CMG speed production times.\nCMG also used Omniverse to let its artists create 3D models and high-fidelity renders for their immersive space environments. NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 and NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs provided large video memory for loading massive amounts of data and reducing rendering times.\nUsing multi-GPU rendering, real-time ray tracing and material definition language, CMG created detailed images with realistic lighting and shadows, all in ultra-high 4K resolution.\nThrough technical processes like AI deep learning, logical binding, technical art and live real-time driving, CMG designed realistic \u201cdigital astronauts\u201d in 4K resolution. It also developed a facial action coding system using deep learning running on the NVIDIA graphics cards to recognize the features of actors by time-of-flight cameras, and driving digital twin humans in real time by infrared camera.\n\u201cWe wanted to create a real-time VFX production workflow \u2014 one where visual effects producers, directors, artists and developers can see both progress and effects in the same context, so that what you see is what you get,\u201d said Jay Wang, technical director of the VFX group at CMG. \u201cWe found that Omniverse Kit and Omniverse View help us realize this goal.\u201d\nCMG anticipates gaining a 30-40 percent time savings from pre-, production, and post-production with continued implementation of NVIDIA Omniverse. The company plans to use NVIDIA Omniverse running on NVIDIA RTX to create stunning photorealistic images, enhance production pipelines and build more complex scientific visualizations for film and television in the future.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA RTX.\nWatch the first three episodes for Fly to the Moon:\n\nFly to Moon: Episode 1\nFly to Moon: Episode 2\nFly to Moon: Episode 3\n\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Aerospace | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Offering RTX 2080 Ti levels of power for a (supposed) fraction of the cost, it remains my graphics card of choice for those after high frame rates at 1440p and playing games in ultrawide. Even though graphics card prices and stock levels are all over the shop at the moment, the RTX 3070 comfortably sees off competition from both of its nearest AMD neighbours, the Radeon RX 6700 XT and RX 6800 (at least until AMD's answer to DLSS gets off the ground on June 22nd), and in my eyes it's almost certainly the graphics card you'll want to watch out for if you're currently thinking about replacing your old GTX 1070 or above. \nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti specs:\n\nCUDA Cores: 6144\nBase Clock Speed: 1.58GHz\nBoost Clock Speed: 1.77GHz\nVRAM: 8GB GDDR6X\nPower: 290W\nRecommended PSU: 750W\nPrice: Starting from \u00a3529 / $599\n\nNow, we have the RTX 3070 Ti, slotting in between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 with its alleged starting price of \u00a3529 / $599. I say alleged, because in all likelihood you're going to be paying a lot more than that when it goes on sale tomorrow (June 10th) due to the ongoing graphics card shortage. It's a bad time to be buying a new graphics card, and if you can at all help it, I'd strongly urge you to just keep what you've currently got right now - especially since this whole situation isn't likely to resolve itself until next year, according to AMD and Nvidia. \n\nIf you've currently got one of Nvidia's RTX 20 cards, for example, you're good. There's no need to upgrade to an RTX 30 card - not when you've still got things like Nvidia's DLSS tech to help bump up those frame rates in pretty much all of today's big ray tracing games, and you still get all of the same Nvidia Broadcast gubbins with them as well. And heck, if you don't already have an RTX card of some description, please, please just hang in there. Turn the resolution down on your monitor, turn the quality settings down, anything to prolong that upgrade - because it's just not worth it right now.\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 | Official 4K RTX Launch Trailer\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nEqually, if you're already got an RTX 3070 on pre-order from earlier in the year, either as a standalone graphics card or as part of a pre-built desktop (the latter of which is probably the only decent way of upgrading your PC right now that isn't going to cost you a relative fortune), keep it. There's no need to upgrade or cancel it to get an RTX 3070 Ti, because according to my benchmark figures at least, you're looking at pretty much identical performance across the board between these two cards. It's nowhere near the RTX 3080 as you might traditionally expect from one of Nvidia's Ti GPUs, and in a lot of cases only offers a handle of more frames per second than its vanilla sibling.\nIn fairness, the RTX 3070 Ti has received a much more modest spec bump over the RTX 3070 than what we saw with the RTX 3080 and 3080 Ti last week. For instance, we've still got 8GB of VRAM here, only now it's the faster GDDR6X type rather than plain old GDDR6. It's also only got a fraction more CUDA cores, rising to 6144 from 5888 - an increase of just 4% compared to the 17% CUDA core increase we saw between the RTX 3080 and 3080 Ti. The 3070 Ti has slightly faster clock speeds than its vanilla sibling, but the downside is that it's a lot more power hungry, with a GPU power of 290W, up from 220W. This increase has also forced Nvidia to raise their recommended PSU power for the 3070 Ti as well, with it now joining the same 750W PSU ranks as the rest of Nvidia's higher-end RTX 30 family, as opposed to 'just' 650W for the regular 3070.\n\n\nSpecs\nRTX 3060\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 3070\nRTX 3070 Ti\nRTX 3080\nRTX 3080 Ti\nRTX 3090\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3584\n4864\n5888\n6144\n8704\n10240\n10496\n\n\nBase / Boost Clock\n1.32GHz / 1.78GHz\n1.41GHz / 1.67GHz\n1.50GHz / 1.73GHz\n1.58GHz / 1.77GHz\n1.44GHz / 1.71GHz\n1.37GHz / 1.67GHz\n1.40GHz / 1.70GHz\n\n\nVRAM\n12GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6X\n10GB GDDR6X\n12GB GDDR6X\n24GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Interface Width\n192-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n256-bit\n320-bit\n384-bit\n384-bit\n\n\nPower\n170W\n200W\n220W\n290W\n320W\n350W\n350W\n\n\nRecommended PSU Power\n550W\n600W\n650W\n750W\n750W\n750W\n750W\n\n\nStarting Price\n\u00a3299 / $329\n\u00a3369 / $399\n\u00a3469 / $499\n\u00a3529 / $599\n\u00a3649 / $699\n\u00a31049 / $1199\n\u00a31399 / $1499\n\n\nUnfortunately, all that extra power has resulted in an embarrassingly small boost to the RTX 3070 Ti's overall performance. At 4K, you're still looking at 50-60fps speeds on High settings in pretty much all of today's biggest games, and at 1440p you can expect anywhere between 60-100fps on max settings depending on the game's vintage - just like the original RTX 3070. Seriously, if you want to know what the RTX 3070 offers over its old GTX 1070 predecessor, go and read my original RTX 3070 review. It's all covered in there. In this review, I'm going to focus on what the 3070 Ti offers over its vanilla sibling, which as we'll soon see, is not a lot.\n\n\n \nLike Nvidia's other RTX 30 Founders Edition cards, the RTX 3070 Ti FE comes with a special 12-pin power connector (don't worry, though, an adapter is included in the box). Third party cards, on the other hand, will use a regular 2x 8-pin power connector.\n\nNvidia RTX 3070 Ti: 4K benchmarks\nThe RPS Test PC:\nCPU: Intel Core i5-10600K \nRAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB \nMotherboard: Asus ROG Maximum XIII Hero \nPSU: CoolerMaster MasterWatt 750 TUF Gaming Edition \nTo test the RTX 3070 Ti, I was sent the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition, which will be available alongside other third-party cards when it goes on sale tomorrow. It borrows a very similar design to the vanilla RTX 3070 FE, utilising the same front and rear fan design and two-slot size dimensions. It was a little loud under load, but nothing like the deafening levels of air hangar jet engine fans I saw on the third party RTX 3080 Ti card I tested last week. \nAs per usual, I paired the RTX 3070 Ti with my Intel Core i5-10600K processor and 16GB of RAM with a 750W power supply. Sure, my choice of CPU might not be quite as 'premium' as the card itself, but the aim, as always, is to give an accurate representation of what you can achieve with these cards on an ordinary mid-range gaming PC. After all, you're still GPU bound when playing games at 4K (and 1440p, to a large extent), and I've tested enough CPUs over the years to know that a faster processor isn't going to make a tangible difference to your overall frame rate at these higher resolutions. You might squeeze a few extra frames out at 1080p with a faster CPU, but let's be honest, you shouldn't be buying an RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti for playing games at 1080p. There are much better and (usually) cheaper options for playing games at this resolution, such as Nvidia's own RTX 3060, which can easily deliver 70-80fps on max settings at 1080p, if not higher once you knock the settings down a bit. Really, you should only be considering an RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti if you have a 1440p, 4K or ultrawide gaming monitor. Anything else is overkill. \nAnd frankly, I'm struggling to see the point of the RTX 3070 Ti at all right now, especially at 4K. In Total War: Three Kingdoms, for example, while the RTX 3070 Ti managed a respectable average of 52fps on High in the game's built-in Battle benchmark, this is only a 2fps increase over what I saw on the vanilla 3070 at the end of last year. Dropping down to Medium, the Ti came in with an average of 80fps, which to my eyes is pretty much the same as the regular 3070's average of 78fps.\n\n\n \nAlso like Nvidia's other RTX 30 FE cards, the RTX 3070 Ti has a fan on the front and back of the GPU to supposedly aid air flow inside your case.\n\nIt was a similar situation in Monster Hunter: World, too. While the 3070 Ti's average of 47fps was perhaps a touch smoother on Highest than the vanilla 3070's 45fps average, stick on DLSS and both cards are capable of hitting a smooth 60fps or above - a 65fps average in the case of the regular RTX 3070, and 68fps on the Ti. That's not the kind of difference my eyes are able to appreciate on a high refresh rate monitor, and certainly not the kind of difference I'd expect given the Ti's higher starting price.\n\n\n\n \n\nAre there better RTX 3070 Ti GPUs out there?\nTo get a sense of whether customised third party cards might offer slightly more performance than Nvidia's RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition, we've also been benchmarking Zotac's GeForce RTX 3070 Ti AMP Holo edition this week. Like Zotac's RTX 3080 Ti version of their AMP Holo, this is a large GPU that would have required us to remove some of our case's HDD bays if they hadn't been taken out already. Thankfully, it's much quieter than the 3080 Ti model we tested, although its fans still kick up more of a fuss than Nvidia's FE version under load. It's also got a plentiful supply of RGB lighting, and a top boost clock speed of 1.83GHz - that's up from the FE's max speed of 1.77GHz.\nIn practice, the Zotac AMP Holo was, in fact, a teensy bit faster than Nvidia's Founders Edition card, but on average I only saw an increase of around 1-2fps, both 4K and 1440p, which still doesn't put it anywhere near the RTX 3080. Its 1080p speeds, meanwhile, were much of a muchness. \nSo yes, it's likely that the Nvidia FE version of the RTX 3070 Ti isn't the best one out there, but when third party cards tend to cost a lot more than Nvidia's FE card (which is usually always available at the proper starting price), any increase you're getting isn't going to be proportionate to how much you're actually paying. \n\n\n \n\n\nMetro Exodus saw both cards within a hair's breadth of each other as well, with or without ray tracing and DLSS thrown into the mix. Both cards were most comfortable on High at 4K, with the 3070 finishing its tough internal benchmarking tool with an average of 59fps compared to the Ti's 62fps average. Add Ultra ray tracing and DLSS into the equation, though, and you're looking at an average of 50fps on the vanilla 3070 and 52fps on the Ti, which to me felt nigh-on identical in practice. \nThis 2-3fps lead widened a little bit further in Cyberpunk 2077, but only by a fraction. It's still not really playable at 4K without the aid of DLSS on either of these cards (and ray tracing is out of the question at this resolution), but whereas the vanilla 3070 managed an average of 59fps on Ultra with auto DLSS enabled out on the busy, graphics-intensive streets around V's apartment building, the Ti bumped that up to an average of 66fps. \nIt's still not massive in the grand scheme of things, though, and the only other game I saw a similar 7fps-sized bump in was Shadow Of The Tomb Raider. On Highest with its regular SMAA anti-aliasing setting enabled, for example, the Ti managed an average of 69fps in Tomb Raider's internal benchmarking tool, which on paper looks like a semi-decent bump from the vanilla 3070's 62fps average considering the paltry gains we've seen elsewhere so far. However, when the RTX 3080 can do a whopping 93fps average on those same settings, it still feels intensely underwhelming. Even worse, add its Ultra ray traced shadows and DLSS into the mix and the Ti actually fell behind the regular 3070 in my tests, managing an average of just 49fps versus the vanilla 3070's 52fps. \nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, it was the vanilla model out in front again, too, coming in with an average of 66fps on its Favour Quality setting over the Ti's 65fps average, and 80fps on Original over the Ti's result of 78fps. Indeed, in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the 3070 Ti showed no improvement over the regular 3070 whatsoever, coming in with an identical average of 60fps on Medium, and 50fps on High.\nEven older games such as The Witcher 3 didn't show much of a boost with the Ti. Both cards can easily hit 60fps on Ultra settings here, but to me, the vanilla 3070's average of 63fps felt just as smooth as the Ti's result of 67fps. The same goes for Final Fantasy XV, too. While the RTX 3070 Ti feels a little more agreeable on Highest, averaging 59fps versus 54fps on the normal 3070, all of this is made null and void once you enable DLSS, with both cards hovering around the 70fps mark.\n\n\n \nA close-up of the RTX 3070 Ti's 12-pin power connector adapter.\n\nNvidia RTX 3070 Ti: 1440p benchmarks\nIf you were hoping for a little more good news in the 1440p department, I'm sorry to say the Ti disappoints here as well. As I said earlier, you can still expect speeds of around 70-90fps on max settings at this resolution, but in terms of what the Ti offers over the regular 3070, you're only looking at a similar 2-5fps boost as what we saw at 4K.\nIn Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, for example, the Ti's average of 88fps on Highest with its top SMAA x4 anti-aliasing setting looks and feels lovely and smooth, as does its 83fps average with Ultra ray traced shadows and DLSS switched on. Is it noticeably better than the vanilla 3070's respective speeds of 83fps and 81fps, though? Not really. \nHeck, the gap was even narrower in Total War: Three Kingdoms, with the Ti's average of 72fps on Ultra settings barely scraping ahead of the vanilla 3070's 71fps average. Assassin's Creed Valhalla pushed that gap to a whole 2fps, with the Ti averaging 65fps on Ultra High, but both cards scored an identical average of 72fps on High here.\nFinal Fantasy XV felt much the same, too, with the Ti's average of 96fps on Highest barely registering against the regular 3070's 92fps average. There was another 4fps gap in Monster Hunter: World and Horizon Zero Dawn as well, with the Ti coming out on top in both instances with an average of 87fps in MonHan and 100fps in Horizon, but my eyes aren't nearly sensitive enough (nor are anyone else's, I suspect) to distinguish that from the regular 3070's respective averages of 83fps and 96fps.\nThe RTX 3070 Ti proved no more adept at handling Metro Exodus' demanding ray tracing presets either at 1440p. Both cards scored an identical average of 81fps on Ultra settings in its tough internal benchmark, and both returned equally smooth scores of 68fps with Ultra ray tracing and DLSS thrown in. \n\n\n \n\nOnce again, it was only Cyberpunk 2077 that showed even the vaguest hint of a noteworthy bump in performance, but let's face it, it's still intensely underwhelming. On Ultra settings, for example, the RTX 3070 Ti managed a smooth average of 60fps at 1440p, which only dropped to 53fps on its RT Ultra preset (which has DLSS enabled by default). The regular RTX 3070, meanwhile, managed 54fps and 48fps on the same presets, and when you're in this kind of frame rate zone, sometimes an extra 5-6fps can make a surprising difference. However, when the RTX 3080 can blow through the same scene with averages of 72fps and 62fps, it makes the RTX 3070 Ti's achievements look positively miniscule, firmly cementing its place as a 'marginally better 3070' rather than 'a cheaper 3080'. \nShould I buy an RTX 3070 Ti?\nUltimately, the RTX 3070 Ti is probably one of the most disappointing Ti cards in recent memory. Much like the RTX 3080 Ti, it's still a stonkingly powerful GPU, but it offers so little over its vanilla sibling that it's barely worth bothering with. It might be a different story if this was a 'Super' card coming in at the same price as the regular 3070, like Nvidia did with their RTX 2070 and 2070 Super cards a couple of years ago, but when Ti cards have traditionally been about getting that high-end performance for a little bit less than the card above it, the 3070 Ti just doesn't cut the mustard.\nIf we weren't suffering from a massive graphics card shortage right now, I'd recommend the regular RTX 3070 in a heartbeat, as this still offers more than enough power for 4K, 1440p and ultrawide gaming alike, and would normally be much better value for money than shelling out an extra \u00a3100 / $100 for the Ti. I'd also recommend the regular RTX 3070 over its closest AMD rivals, too, because until AMD's DLSS-alike FidelityFX Super Resolution technology gets off the ground (and has a good number of supported games), there's simply no competition when it comes to those high res gaming speeds - with or without ray tracing. Meanwhile, those after even more power for high-end 4K gaming should look for the RTX 3080, which offers substantially faster speeds than the 3070 and 3070 Ti for $649 / $699 - just \u00a3100 / $100 more than what the 3070 Ti should normally cost.\nOf course, these are far from ordinary circumstances. If you're after a standalone GPU, you're likely looking at very similar prices for the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti at the moment, in which case, sure - if you absolutely must upgrade your GPU right this second and you can't find an RTX 3070 for less, then you might as well go for the Ti. If you can afford to wait, though, then please, please do so. The 3070 Ti just simply isn't worth paying through the roof for, especially if none of the current or future ray tracing games take your fancy right now. \n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

NVIDIA supports the Arm architecture, too. It\u2019s work we want to greatly expand and accelerate by acquiring the company to create a unique combination for our partners and customers.\n\u201cArm\u2019s energy-efficient, flexible architecture is ideal for all types of workloads, including high performance computing, cloud and edge applications. NVIDIA\u2019s efforts to accelerate Arm applications will fuel innovation, strengthen the ecosystem and provide greater choice to customers and end users,\u201d said Rene Haas, president of Arm\u2019s Intellectual Property Group, in a recent talk at GTC.\nSupercomputers Arm for Exascale\nArm\u2019s open architecture gives organizations the flexibility to design CPUs optimized for their workloads. Supercomputing centers around the world are taking advantage of this powerful option.\n\u201cAs the provider of the Arm-based high performance CPU conceived through the European Processor Initiative to power European exascale supercomputing, SiPearl is committed to advancing the Arm ecosystem,\u201d said Philippe Notton, SiPearl founder and CEO.\n\u201cImplementing our CPU in GPU accelerated nodes requires a solid development environment, domain specific libraries, development kits and HPC application tuning. NVIDIA investment and expertise across all of these areas is driving sustained growth of the ecosystem and the market,\u201d he added.\nETRI, a national research institute in South Korea, is developing an Arm-based CPU for their future supercomputer. It will support both double- and mixed-precision math to tackle HPC and AI applications.\nAnd India\u2019s C-DAC is building an Arm-based CPU to power an exascale system for its scientific research and AI initiatives.\nNVIDIA Hands Arm New Tools\nThese are some of many Arm-based HPC initiatives that can take advantage of the NVIDIA HPC software development kit, a comprehensive suite of compilers, libraries and tools that simplify application development and porting to the Arm architecture. The SDK acts as a foundation for an accelerated Arm HPC ecosystem.\nThe NVIDIA HPC SDK helps develop and port HPC applications to Arm.\nThe next version of the software \u2014 HPC SDK 21.7, coming in July \u2014 will deliver more Arm intrinsics, features that compilers can use to tune performance. And it provides customized math functions specifically optimized for Arm CPUs.\nIn addition, NVIDIA plans to support Scalable Vector Extensions in Arm\u2019s Neoverse platform. SVE first debuted in Fujitsu\u2019s A64FX that powers Fugaku, ranked No. 1 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\nAccelerated Arm Kit Coming in July\nWe\u2019re also making it easier to create, evaluate and benchmark HPC and AI applications on accelerated Arm systems with the NVIDIA Arm HPC Developer Kit. It\u2019s a platform available from NVIDIA and GIGABYTE in the form of software loaded on a server powered by an Ampere Altra Arm-based CPU, NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs for accelerated networking.\nDevelopers from over 70 leading organizations, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, have applied for early access to the kit that will ship in July.\n\u201cWe are building some of our key applications along with some AI/ML workflows for the Arm architecture using the NVIDIA HPC SDK,\u201d said Steve Poole, chief architect for next generation systems at Los Alamos. \u201cThe NVIDIA Arm Developer Kits will facilitate the transition of our codes to NVIDIA GPUs and Arm CPUs,\u201d he said.\nArming Researchers with Apps\nNVIDIA also offers versions for the Arm architecture of popular HPC applications in molecular dynamics (NAMD, Tinker-HP), materials modeling (Quantum Espresso) and other fields.\nThe apps are available as containers in NVIDIA NGC, a registry of GPU-optimized software. These containers simplify application deployment on Arm-based systems, so researchers can focus on advancing their science.\nExtending Arm with More Partners\nThe power of Arm-based processors combined with NVIDIA GPUs is addressing high performance computing needs beyond supercomputing centers.\nFor example, NVIDIA GPUs and Ampere Altra CPUs from Ampere Computing are serving markets from data centers to the cloud. In edge computing, NVIDIA is working with Marvell Semiconductor to team its OCTEON Arm-based processors with NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs to speed up AI workloads for network optimization and security.\nOur collaborations include systems providers, too. GIGABYTE has been leading the charge in providing accelerated Arm servers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be part of the Arm ecosystem with a portfolio of Arm servers powered by NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and DPUs and Ampere Altra CPUs,\u201d said Etay Lee, CEO of GIGABYTE.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with NVIDIA to grow the Arm ecosystem, from the hardware to the software development tools to Arm applications, helping our customers accelerate their HPC workloads across industries,\u201d he added.\nMore on the Horizon\nWe\u2019re also expanding the NVIDIA-Certified program of nearly 40 systems from a dozen OEMs to include Arm-powered systems, so organizations have more choice in the kinds of pretested systems they can confidently deploy.\nGIGABYTE and Wiwynn plan to offer servers featuring Arm Neoverse-based CPUs with NVIDIA Ampere GPUs, BlueField-2 DPUs or both. The servers are expected to be available next year and will be submitted for NVIDIA certification as they come to market.\nWe\u2019re just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible with accelerated, energy-efficient computing fueled by the combination of Arm, NVIDIA and our partners.\nTo learn more, tune into the NVIDIA ISC 2021 Special Address Monday, June 28, at 9:30 a.m. PT to get an in-depth overview of the latest news from NVIDIA\u2019s Marc Hamilton, followed by a live Q&A panel with NVIDIA HPC experts.\n\n\nCategories: Networking | SupercomputingTags: Customer Stories | GPU | High-Performance Computing | NGC | NVIDIA BlueField \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This architecture, built on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, is what Volvo Cars is using for its next generation fleet\nWith a software-defined architecture, cars will no longer be at their best when they leave the factory, but rather constantly improving through over-the-air updates. This flexibility will even allow automakers to develop vehicles and experiences that are customizable for each customer.\n\u201cVolvo Cars is one of our first partners with the vision to put a high-performance computer in their entire vehicle lineup,\u201d Kani said. \u201cThey believe that the car will get better after the day you buy it. With a software-defined architecture, we can continue to provide new services, new applications over the life of the car.\u201d\nComputer on Wheels\nVolvo Cars is rebuilding its vehicle compute architecture from the ground up to support this software-defined vision.\nCars on the road today are powered by tens of electronic control units (ECUs) distributed throughout the vehicle. Each ECU controls a specific function such as power windows or the infotainment system. This structure requires long development cycles and can be incredibly complicated to update as new technology emerges.\nVolvo Cars is aiming to create a \u201ccomputer on wheels\u201d for its next generation of vehicles, consolidating these ECUs into one centralized architecture. This system will be built on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, the industry\u2019s most advanced, functionally safe and secure, software-defined autonomous vehicle computing platform.\nVolvo Cars\u2019 next-generation core compute system will be powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin.\nThe core computing system, which will be introduced on a model to be unveiled in 2022, is made up of three main computers. These support each other in operating vision processing and artificial intelligence, general computing and infotainment respectively.\n\u201cTo really have a good computer vision system, you need good computing power,\u201d said H\u00e5kan Samuelsson, CEO of Volvo Cars. \u201cWhen it comes to the whole experience in the car \u2014 which we rely on to differentiate our vehicles \u2014 with centralized compute you can develop that much more flexibly and faster.\u201d\nWith NVIDIA DRIVE Orin at the core of Volvo Cars\u2019 vehicles, the aim is to continue be safer and more personal over time via over-the-air updates, while maintaining enough compute headroom to power vision and sensor processing.\nSafety and Security\nVolvo Cars is known for its heritage of safety, and that legacy is extending to its future intelligent fleets.\n\u201cThe core system is a computing powerhouse developed with our guiding star of safety first,\u201d said Patrik Bengtsson, vice president of vehicle software and electronics at Volvo Cars. \u201cWe believe in partnering with technology leaders, which is why we\u2019re collaborating with NVIDIA.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE platform is architected for redundancy and diversity to deliver the highest level of safety. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin maintains this safety architecture and is designed to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in software-defined vehicles. It accomplishes this industry-leading performance while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nBy building its next generation core computer on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, Volvo Cars\u2019 aims at safer and more personal vehicles, becoming better and smarter every day.\n\u201cBy developing software in-house we can boost development speeds and improve your Volvo faster than we can today,\u201d said Henrik Green, chief technology officer. \u201cJust like on your smartphone or computer, new software and features can be rolled out swiftly through over-the-air updates, making your Volvo better and even more enjoyable over time.\u201d\nWatch the full interview.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cards are due to go on sale tomorrow, but we\u2019ve been able to put a GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition through its paces and have everything laid out for you on the pages ahead.\n\r\nAs its branding suggests, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is an update / upgrade over the original RTX 3070 which launched about seven months ago. NVIDIA didn\u2019t just goose the clocks and call it day, however. Though its performance isn\u2019t otherworldly versus the original standard card, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti does have a number of significant and meaningful differences. Let\u2019s look at its specs, a quick video tour and a couple of comparisons to previous-gen cards first, then we\u2019ll dig in and get down to the nitty gritty...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n\n\n\nSpecifications & Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Cards @ Amazon\n\r\nNVIDIA is positioning the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti as the logical upgrade to the Turing-based GeForce RTX 2070 Super (and older / lower-end cards). As you can see in the table above, save for the similar boost clocks and memory capacity, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti blows the RTX 2070 Super out of the water. The Ampere-based RTX 3070 Ti has significantly more memory bandwidth, much higher fillrate, and more capable compute performance.\u00a0\n\n\n\r\nBut what about versus the original GeForce RTX 3070, you ask? Well, here above is a condensed comparison between the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, with the RTX 3070 added in. Although the 3070 Ti is built around the same GA104 GPU as the original 3070, it has a couple of additional Streaming Multiprocessors enabled, which boosts its core counts and cache. As a reminder, the GA104 is fabricated on Samsung\u2019s 8nm NVIDIA custom process and is comprised of approximately 17.4 billion transistors, with a die size of 392.5mm2. In the GeForce RTX 3070, 46 SMs are enabled, but\u00a0the GA104 has 48 total SMs, and they're all flipped on with the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.\n\r\nThere are 128 CUDA cores per SM, for a total of 6,144, 4 Third-Gen Tensor cores per SM (192 total), and 48 Second-Gen RT cores. Complementing all of those cores are 96 ROPs, 192 Texture Unit, 5,888K of L1 cache / shared memory, and 4,096K of L2 cache. The GPU has a typical Boost clock of 1,770MHz and it is linked to 8GB of GDDR6X memory running at an effective speed of 9.5GHz via a 256-bit memory interface. That equates to over 600GB/s of peak bandwidth, which is a big jump over the original 3070's 448GB/s. The original GeForce RTX 3070 also uses standard GDDR6, not the faster GDDR6X of the Ti.\n\r\nBefore we dive any deeper into the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti though, we should direct your attention to a few previous HotHardware articles. We have already covered much of the underlying technology at the heart of this card, so we won\u2019t be doing so again here. If you'd like a refresher on the backstory, however, we recommend checking out our coverage of NVIDIA\u2019s initial\u00a0GeForce RTX 30 series\u00a0announcement, the deeper dive on its new features and\u00a0the Ampere architecture\u00a0as a whole, and our October coverage of the original GeForce RTX 3070 launch. Once you\u2019ve got that all in your pocket, you\u2019ll understand much of what makes the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti tick.\nMeet NVIDIA's New GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\r\nThe cooling setup on the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is different than the original\u2019s. In fact, the RTX 3070 Ti\u2019s cooler is more akin to the RTX 3080\u2019s \u2013 just slightly smaller. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is about 3/4 of an inch shorter than the RTX 3080, but a little longer than the original RTX 3070.\n\r\nLike the GeForce RTX 3080, the cooler on the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition features dual axial fans, and a split heatsink design. One end of the heatsink array sits directly atop a vapor chamber that is affixed to the GPU and memory, with a fan on top. That fan directs air through the heatsink and immediately funnels it out of the chassis through vents in the case bracket. The heatsink on the back half of the card, however, which is linked to the front vapor chamber via heat-pipes, allows air from the second fan to pass all the way through the card, where it is meant to rise to the top of the chassis and then expelled from the system, assuming the chassis has adequate ventilation.\n\r\nThe pass-through style cooler works in conjunction with a dense, short PCB design. Like earlier GeForce RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards, the new 3070 Ti also features a miniaturized 12-pin power connector, though most partner boards will continue to use the traditional PCIe connectors that are more common today. NVIDIA includes an adapter with the RTX 3070 Ti that converts a pair of 8-pin PCIe connectors to the new mini-12-pin design, and a number of PSU manufacturers offer modular cables with the new connector as well. This is another difference between the original RTX 3070 and the RTX 3070 Ti. The adapter included with the original card only required a single 8-pin feed.\n\n\r\nLike most of the other members of the Ampere family, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti has triple full-sized DisplayPorts and a single HDMI output on its case bracket. That HDMI port is HDMI 2.1-compliant, which enables 4K120P with G-Sync on some of the latest OLED TVs and allows for 8K resolution over a single cable.\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GPU, PC gaming, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 3070 ti\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti Review: Supercharged Midrange Gaming \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadeon Pro W6800 Review: AMD RDNA 2-Infused Workstation Muscle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Review: Amped-Up Ampere For Gamers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 6800M Rips Benchmarks In Powerful All-AMD ASUS Gaming Laptop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhison E18 With Micron B47R Preview: Future Of PCIe 4 SSDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti Review: Supercharged...\nRadeon Pro W6800 Review: AMD RDNA...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Review:...\nAMD Radeon RX 6800M Rips Benchmarks In...\nPhison E18 With Micron B47R Preview:...\nIntel Optane Memory H20 Review:...\nHow Many CPU Cores Do You Need For Great...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial is built for intelligent video analytics, optical inspection, robotics, computer vision, autonomy and AI in the toughest environments.\nIt comes in a compact, power-efficient design and reliably delivers up to 30 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of AI performance. Built with components tested to demanding industrial standards and including new functional safety capabilities, it\u2019s able to withstand severe shock and vibration and extreme temperature ranges. And it\u2019s pin-, software- and form-factor compatible with the existing Jetson AGX Xavier module, so upgrading is easy.\n\nBuilt for the Most Demanding Industrial Use Cases\nThe Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial is targeted for applications in industrial, aerospace, defense, construction, agriculture, logistics, inventory management, delivery, inspection and healthcare. Applications enabled across these sectors include worker and site safety, site access and monitoring, and inspection in hazardous and harsh environments, among others.\nIn the oil and gas industry, the Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial streamlines anomaly and failure predictions at the edge by providing real-time insights based on monitoring or inspection of pipelines, valves, equipment and maintenance work. The extended reliability of the module allows it to be used in safety, predictive maintenance and compliance and where equipment remains always-on in changing environmental conditions.\nIn automobile manufacturing facilities, a factory producing more than 1,000 vehicles a day needs to inspect over 6 million welding points on the fly. Using AI and computer vision on the Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial, it can analyze process and quality data directly from weld guns, which reduces inspection time, improves quality prediction and ultimately helps deliver safer cars to consumers.\nAnother example was presented at GTC21, where AI-driven anomaly detection in die-casting processes enables early prediction of product quality, avoiding further process costs by up to 30 percent and decreasing defect rates by up to 40 percent. The result is more efficient and safer processes, improving productivity and return on investment.\nSimilarly, construction sites employ heavy equipment that must operate reliably in various climates. Farms require tractors that can carry fertilizers and herbicide sprayers, and harvest thousands of acres of crops on various terrains. Unmanned aerial vehicles and drones can experience extreme shock and vibration while flying in harsh environments. Point-of-care ultrasounds and patient monitors require consistent operation over long lifetimes.\nJetson AGX Xavier Industrial provides the features necessary to bring autonomy to all of these machines.\nDesigned for Reliability, Safety and Security \nJetson AGX Xavier Industrial combines the supercomputing capabilities of the Jetson AGX Xavier system-on-module with new reliability, availability and serviceability features required to deploy AI in tough environments. These include error correction codes, single error correction, double error detection and parity protection to deliver internal RAM resilience, address and data bus error detection and correction and IP resiliency in industrial applications.\nThe module comes with functional safety capabilities supervised by the Safety Cluster Engine (SCE), making it suitable for safety-certified industrial-grade products. In addition, it has the same key accelerators and high-speed I/Os included with Jetson AGX Xavier.\nJetson AGX Xavier Industrial features a 512-core NVIDIA Volta GPU with 64 Tensor Cores, two NVIDIA deep learning accelerators, two vision accelerators, an eight-core NVIDIA Carmel Arm\u00a0 CPU, an encoder and decoder, and more. The new SCE contains dual Arm Cortex-R5 processors that can be used for integrated fault-detection mechanisms, lock-step subsystems and enables built-in-system test. The Cortex-R5, which is in an always-on domain, can be used for safety and error correction functions.\nIt also includes hardware-verified secure boot, hardware-accelerated cryptography, support for encrypted storage, memory, and other security features to protect customer software.\nCheck out the full specifications.\nSoftware Support to Easily Build and Manage Industrial AI Deployments\u00a0\nPowered by the NVIDIA CUDA-X accelerated computing stack and JetPack SDK support, Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial is a fully software-defined platform enabling cloud-native capabilities. NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA-X acceleration, free production-ready pretrained models on NGC and NVIDIA TAO Toolkit give developers the fastest path to build and deploy deep learning and AI training and inference systems.\nWith the use of Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial and JetPack, customers can easily maintain and update ruggedized and safety critical systems in the field using cloud-native technologies for orchestration and management.\nGetting Started and Availability \nThe new Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial module is available to order now and will be available in late July. Developers can start building the smartest edge and embedded systems for their industrial applications today using the Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit, downloading JetPack and designing with all the documentation available on the NVIDIA Jetson site.\n\n\nCategories: Hardware | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Kepler GPUs will still continue to get critical security updates up until September 2024, but their final Game Ready driver will arrive on August 31st 2021. \n\n\n\nIntroducing the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti | The Ultimate Play\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nHere's a full list of the affected Nvidia Kepler GPUs:\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX Titan Z \nNvidia GeForce GTX Titan Black \nNvidia GeForce GTX Titan \nNvidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti \nNvidia GeForce GTX 780 \nNvidia GeForce GTX 770 \nNvidia GeForce GTX 760 Ti \nNvidia GeForce GTX 760\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760 (192-bit)\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760 Ti OEM \nNvidia GeForce GT 740 \nNvidia GeForce GT 730 \nNvidia GeForce GT 720 \nNvidia GeForce GT 710\nNvidia GeForce GTX 690\nNvidia GeForce GTX 680\nNvidia GeForce GTX 670\nNvidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti\nNvidia GeForce GTX 660\nNvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost\nNvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti\nNvidia GeForce GTX 650\nNvidia GeForce GTX 645\nNvidia GeForce GT 640\nNvidia GeForce GT 635\n\nIn a new FAQ page on Nvidia's Support site, the reason they've given for ending Kepler support is as follows:\n\"Kepler-based desktop GPUs initially launched in March of 2012. Since then, gaming technology has evolved dramatically with technologies like DirectX 12 Ultimate and Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Moving forward, Nvidia's software QA team will be focusing on hardware that supports newer technologies.\"\nSome of the eagle-eyed among you will notice that not all GTX 700 cards are actually present in this list. The GTX 750, GTX 750 Ti and GTX 745 are all absent, and that's because these cards technically belong to Nvidia's Maxwell family, despite sharing the same 700-series name. As such, it's likely these three cards will continue to receive Game Ready drivers for a little bit longer, until Nvidia axes support for their Maxwell GPUs as well, that is.\nWhile it's always a shame when support for old hardware gets discontinued, the move (hopefully) shouldn't affect too many people. According to Steam's latest hardware survey, the first Kepler GPU to appear on their Video Card Description section is the GT 730, which accounts for just 0.47% of all Steam users right now. The next is the GT 710, which stands at just 0.36%, followed by the GTX 760 at 0.30%.  \nOrdinarily, this might be a sign for existing Kepler owners to upgrade their GPUs, but that's easier said than done right now due to the ongoing graphics card shortage. Buying one of today's best graphics cards is nigh on impossible at the moment, and any GPUs that are fleetingly available almost always cost much more than they should do due to the high demand. Unfortunately, the situation isn't likely to resolve itself until next year either, according to Nvidia and AMD, so it's going to be a while before things return to normal. \nThat said, there should hopefully be more chances to try and buy some new, more budget-focused cards over the coming months, as we still haven't seen Nvidia's inevitable RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti cards make their way onto desktops yet (they're currently only available in laptops), and AMD haven't announced the lower-end of their new RX 6000 family yet either. Back in January, AMD promised two new GPUs in the first half of 2021, and so far we've only seen one, the 1440p mega card, the RX 6700 XT. There hasn't been anything in this batch of next-gen cards targeting the 1080p end of the gaming scale just yet, so fingers crossed we won't have to wait too long before they finally make an appearance.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

This ecosystem includes every aspect of the autonomous vehicle industry \u2015 from sensors to software to mobility services \u2015 all using the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE platform to turn science fiction into reality.\nIn July, electric vehicle maker Faraday Future\u00a0became a publicly listed company, raising $1 billion. A month earlier, global mobility technology company DiDi held its IPO, listing 316.8 million shares and raising a whopping $4.4 billion under the ticker DIDI. The ride-hailing giant, which counts nearly 500 million active users worldwide, is developing its upcoming robotaxi platform on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus.\nDiDi \u2014 which operates ride-hailing services in 71 countries and about 10,000 cities \u2014 is one of the largest in a wave of such public listings, which began in August 2020 with electric automaker Xpeng. That EV company, whose P7 sports sedan uses NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier for AI-assisted driving, raised $1.5 billion in its offering.\nThe Xpeng P7 sports sedan, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier.\nThese listings are a milestone in the development of autonomous vehicles, signaling the maturing of self-driving technology from research and development to production vehicles.\nSensing Opportunities\nA key component of any autonomous driving platform, sensors have advanced rapidly in recent years. Now, many members of the NVIDIA DRIVE sensor ecosystem are counting dozens of customers and heading to the public markets.\nKickstarting the listing momentum, lidar maker Velodyne went public in September via a SPAC, or special acquisition company, raising about $150 million. This method of going public involves a company already listed on a stock exchange acquiring a private company, rather than the private company undergoing an initial public offering.\nA 3D point cloud generated by a Velodyne lidar sensor.\nIn September, lidar supplier Luminar followed suit with a similar SPAC reverse merger. The listing took off at light speed, shooting up 39 percent the day of the acquisition \u2014 under the ticker LAZR \u2014 and the company received about $500 million in the deal.\nThe SPACs have kept coming in 2021, with sensor makers Aeva, Innoviz,\u00a0Ouster and AEye all listing in March, April and August. The companies received a combined $1.1 billion through their respective acquisitions.\nTrucking Ahead\nWith skyrocketing shipping demand in recent years, autonomous trucks have become an increasingly vital part of the self-driving ecosystem.\nAutonomous trucking company TuSimple has been accelerating the development of this technology, using the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX AI compute platform to power its self-driving software.

Raised on an Eastern European organic tomato farm, he saw labor shortages, pesticide problems and rising energy costs. Years later, studying at MIT in 2014, it dawned on him that AI could help address these issues for farmers.\nA few years later, he founded Ztractor, an autonomous electric tractor startup based in Palo Alto, Calif.\nZtractor offers tractors that can be configured to work on 135 different types of crops. They rely on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform for computer vision tasks to help farms improve plant conditions, increase crop yields and achieve higher efficiency.\nGoing electric means Ztractor machines also don\u2019t belch out plumes of black diesel exhaust.\nThe company is among a growing field of agriculture companies like Bilberry, FarmWise, SeeTree, Smart Ag and John Deere-owned Blue River adopting NVIDIA GPUs for training and inference. These companies are leading the way in reducing the use of herbicides and supporting organic farms.\n\u2018Tesla Moment\u2019 for Tractors\nKvezereli said that one of the insights he had while studying for an MBA at MIT was that industrial agricultural machines were poised for their own electric revolution.\nThe same dynamics that affect autos \u2014 pollution reduction mandates and clean vehicle purchase rebates \u2014 are facing agricultural equipment makers and their customers, he said.\n\u201cI realized that the tractor industry is on the cusp of its own Tesla moment, with a transition to electric machines and AI,\u201d said Kvezereli. \u201cThe tractor companies will be shifting to electric.\u201d\nThe worldwide tractor market was valued at just under $150 billion in 2020, according to market researcher Mordor Intelligence.\nAI Supports Organic Farms\nIn many countries, farm labor is limited. A survey by the California Farm Bureau Federation reported that 56 percent of more than 1,000 farmers were unable to hire adequate labor.\nZTractor offers three different models to help assist farmers. Each sports 67 sensors, six cameras and GPS. The tractors collect field data that\u2019s fed into models run on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform to provide insights about crop conditions.\nPests can be identified in milliseconds with convolutional neural networks, quantified and mapped to a particular zone, enabling faster treatment. If aphids are invading, and it\u2019s an organic farm, it might be time to release the ladybugs to gobble them up. The alternative of relying on periodic boots on the ground for inspections might otherwise lead to crop yield losses.\n\u201cYou need to hire 30 percent more people to achieve the same competitive quality of organic tomatoes as non-organic\u201d said Kvezereli. \u201cThat\u2019s where Ztractor comes in.\u201d\nZtractor machines can also handle soil preparation tasks like tilling and disking. It can work with seeding and precision weed control equipment \u2014 like smart sprayers with AI-driven cameras \u2014\u00a0 to help make up for labor shortages for these tasks.\nThe machines can run eight to 12 hours on a charge, depending on the unit.\nJetson-Driven Tractor Autonomy\u00a0\nFarmers can set coordinates for the tractor\u2019s path using satellite data or aerial images and the onboard GPS for geofencing the machines.\nThe tractors run the TrailNet model, processed on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, for real-time path planning. The neural network \u2014 trained on a custom dataset of about 500 images \u2014 was run on cloud instances of NVIDIA GPUs.\nIts plug-in electric system offers a 75 percent reduction in energy costs compared with diesel tractors, according to Kvezereli.\n\u201cThere is a demand for zero-emission farming from both a public policy and customer perspective,\u201d said Kvezereli.\nPilot tests of Ztractor\u2019s system are underway at several organic garlic family farms based in Gilroy, Calif., just southeast of Silicon Valley.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Canada-based company is working with the Ontario government as well as Canadian Tire on a two-year pilot project to accelerate the commercial deployment of this technology.\nWith the rapid rise of ecommerce and next-day delivery around the world, demand for trucking has skyrocketed, and Canada is no exception. The Canadian trucking industry delivers 66.5 million shipments a year, generating more than $32 billion in revenue.\nAt the same time, driver shortages continue to increase, with more than 60,000 trucking positions unfilled in 2019.\nBy developing autonomous trucking with the high-performance compute of NVIDIA DRIVE, NuPort can help address this gap with safer, more efficient technology.\nOne Solution\nSelf-driving semis require centralized compute capable of processing an array of deep neural networks (DNNs) to navigate any type of delivery route.\nNVIDIA DRIVE is architected for redundancy and safety to power DNNs running simultaneously in the vehicle. The platform is scalable, capable of enabling level 4 and level 5 autonomous systems, such as NuPort\u2019s autonomous trucking solution.\nNuPort plans to develop upcoming generations of its platform on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, which is capable of more than 250 trillion operations per second (TOPS) while achieving systemic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Orin\nNuPort is also leveraging NVIDIA DRIVE OS and DriveWorks software for open and easily scalable self-driving development.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to get everything we need in one solution,\u201d said NuPort CEO Raghavender Sahdev. \u201cBy using NVIDIA, we have a base we can build off of, significantly reducing our development time as opposed to starting from scratch.\u201d\nNo Longer Stuck in the Middle Mile\nNuPort is working to provide an autonomous driving solution for the middle mile \u2014 the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-trucks make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals.\nThe pilot with the Ontario government through Ontario\u2019s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and automotive and recreation retailer Canadian Tire involves\u00a0two semi-tractor trailers retrofitted with NuPort\u2019s autonomous driving platform in addition to high-resolution sensors. The human-supervised trucks are transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution center in the Toronto area and nearby rail terminals.\nWith the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE at the core of NuPort\u2019s system, Sahdev expects to significantly improve both safety and efficiency on these middle mile routes.\n\u201cNVIDIA DRIVE is very powerful and allows us to run our algorithms efficiently,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a proper, consolidated platform rather than trying out different GPUs and sensors has accelerated this process.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But, as time went on, it became clear that while it could deliver excellent frame rates, gaming was really a side-line to its prosumer and creation design leanings. So, it was only a matter of time before Nvidia unveiled its RTX 3080 Ti, a new card to become king of the PC gaming hill. The wait is finally over. I\u2019ve spent the last week putting this exciting new GPU through its paces to see if it delivers on its promise of being the \u201cnew gaming flagship\u201d PC gamers have been waiting for. Coming in at $1,199, it\u2019s an expensive card, so let\u2019s take a closer look and see how it stacks up. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti9 ImagesNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition \u2013 Design and FeaturesThe RTX 3080 Ti is a powerful GPU that gives the RTX 3090 a run for its money, but you wouldn\u2019t know it based on its 11x4-inch size. Scrub the \u201cTi\u201d from the logo, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and the basic RTX 3080. That\u2019s a very good thing, because with the exception of video memory, this card is much closer to the RTX 3090 in specs while having a footprint that is much more accommodating to compact PCs. Inside that frame, the RTX 3080 Ti uses Nvidia\u2019s GA102 chip \u2013 and it packs some impressive specifications. It features 10,240 CUDA cores, an 18% improvement from the RTX 3080, a whopping 2.4-times more than last generation\u2019s RTX 2080 Ti, and only 2% less than the RTX 3090. The GPU features a rated boost clock of 1665 MHz but easily spins past thanks to Nvidia GPU Boost, which automatically overclocks the card based on the available power and thermal headroom. While gaming, my card peaked at 1935 MHz before any manual overclocking. It also features 12GB of GDDR6X memory, the same, ultra-fast memory type found on the RTX 3080 and 3090, but it still feels light compared to the 16GB shipping on AMD\u2019s top-tier GPUs. 12GB is enough for most games today, but will that be the case in three years? Five?The card is built on Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture, which is the second major iteration of its RTX core system. RTX evolves that traditional GPU rendering paradigm by breaking it into three parts, the programmable shader, the ray-tracing core, and the tensor core. Together, these cores sub-divide processing duties into rasterization, ray tracing, and AI, allowing each to work more efficiently and deliver innovative technologies like DLSS or Nvidia Broadcast. The RTX 3080 Ti is a step forward in capability across the board. Here\u2019s how it compares to the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 3080, and the step-up that is the RTX 3090.34 Shader-TFLOPS (+143% from RTX 2080 Ti, +13% from RTX 3080, -4.5% from RTX 3090)67 RT-TFLOPS (+56% from RTX 2080 Ti, +16% from RTX 3080, -2.9% from RTX 3090)273 Tensor TFLORS (+140% from RTX 2080 Ti, +15% from RTX 3080, -4.1% from RTX 3090)10,240 CUDA Cores (+135% from RTX 2080 Ti, +18% from RTX 3080, -2% from RTX 3090)Compared to the RTX 2080 Ti, these are drastic leaps such that Nvidia expects the RTX 3080 Ti to run 50% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti on average. Coming from the RTX 3080, they\u2019re more iterative, as you would expect from a standard-to-Ti level jump. What\u2019s most interesting here is just how close each of these figures are to the RTX 3090. Like RTX 3080, the 3080 Ti features Nvidia\u2019s dual-axial cooler design and it remains just as excellent here. Featuring one fan on each side and a shrunk-down PCB, the cooler is able to draw heat through the fin-stack and provide excellent cooling performance without generating excess noise. Even after a full afternoon of benchmark testing, the card peaked at 67C and blended in well enough with my case fans that it was never distracting. This is actually two degrees cooler than the RTX 3080 in the same scenario, which is impressive, though was ever-so-slightly louder. The added performance does come at a cost of slightly higher power draw, however. While the RTX 3080 was rated for 320 watts of power draw, the RTX 3080 Ti ups the ante at 350 watts, though there is no mention of requiring a larger power supply as of this writing, so a 750-watt PSU should be sufficient. The card again makes use of Nvidia\u2019s proprietary 12-pin adapter to connect two 8-pin leads from your PSU. It\u2019s admittedly easier to connect, but if you\u2019re using custom PSU cables, it\u2019s an unsightly little pigtail.Like all Nvidia RTX 30-Series GPUs, the RTX 3080 Ti comes with an array of additional features to benefit gamers. The biggest of these is DLSS, Nvidia\u2019s intelligent upscaling technology which allows games to render at a lower resolution and thus run at a higher FPS without a major impact to visual quality. The RTX 3080 Ti is perfectly capable of running games at native 4K resolution above 60 FPS but DLSS can provide a major bump in the increasing number of games that feature it. If you\u2019re running a high refresh rate monitor, this feature alone can make the difference between hitting triple digit frame rates or not and should be a key consideration for anyone buying a GPU today.That\u2019s not all, however. Competitive gamers will appreciate Nvidia Reflex, which can instantly cut input latency and increase responsiveness in first-person shooters. This isn\u2019t a global toggle, which means games need to incorporate Reflex, but many esports titles like Rainbow Six: Siege, Fortnite, Valorant, and Overwatch already feature it and Nvidia promises more to come. Streamers will also be able to take advantage of Nvidia Broadcast for a virtual green screen, AI noise removal, and intelligent face tracking with your webcam. If you\u2019re streaming in a noisy or space-constrained environment where setting up an actual green screen isn\u2019t possible, these features can offer impressive improvements to the quality of your stream.The RTX 3080 Ti also comes equipped for the highest end monitors with HDMI 2.1 support. Compared to HDMI 2.0b, HDMI 2.1 more than doubles the bandwidth from 18Gbps to 48Gbps with support for 4K120Hz and HDR. If you don\u2019t have a monitor capable of those specs, it also supports 3 DisplayPort 1.4 connections for a total resolution output of 7680x4320 split across a maximum of four monitors. For content creation and consumption, it also supports AV1 decoding and Nvidia\u2019s proprietary encoder for streaming and video work.Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition \u2013 PerformanceTest system: Z390 Asus ROG Maximus XI Extreme Motherboard, Intel Core i9-9900K CPU (stock), Corsair H115i PRO RGB 280mm AIO CPU Cooler, 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4-3200, 1TB Samsung EVO Plus NVMe SSD, Corsair HX1200 1200-watt power supply.To assess video cards, we use a mix of synthetic and real-world gaming benchmarks. These tests mix traditional rasterization with games offering ray tracing capability. Games are set to Ultra settings unless otherwise noted and DLSS is enabled on the \u201cQuality\u201d preset where available. One important thing to note is that the RTX 2080 Ti I had on-hand for testing is a factory overclocked model. On average it runs approximately 4-7% faster than an RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition. Comparing FE to FE, the RTX 3080 Ti would likely pull ahead several percentage points higher than what I found in my own testing.  Let\u2019s begin with synthetic benchmarks.When it comes to synthetic tests, the RTX 3080 Ti is out to impress. In Fire Strike Ultra, it outperformed the original RTX 3080 by 12% and even managed to eek out a win over the RTX 3090. The class leading card in our testing remained the RX 6800 XT for this test, however. In Unigine Heaven, the 3080 Ti topped the original 3080 by 17% but fell behind the 3090. Compared to last generation\u2019s RTX 2080 Ti, it offered a substantial lead of 43% in Fire Strike and 38% in Heaven.Looking at synthetics specific to ray tracing, we again see very impressive performance from the RTX 3080 Ti. In 3DMark Port Royal, it\u2019s only a hair\u2019s breadth away from the RTX 3090 and beats the RTX 3080 by 12%. Pitted against the RTX 2080 Ti, it scored 44% higher. In the FPS-based synthetic tests, the tale is much the same with RTX 3090 levels of performance.  But, synthetics are only one part of the equation. Let\u2019s take a look at how it performed in our standard selection of five games and some expanding 4K gaming tests. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Gaming Benchmarks5 ImagesGame tests are where we really get an eye on a card\u2019s real world performance. Though this card is clearly overkill for 1080p, I\u2019ve included those figures here for context. At 4K, the RTX 3080 Ti averaged 11% faster than the RTX 3080, 40% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and 15% faster than the RX 6800 XT with Metro Exodus excluded due to DLSS.  At 1440p, it was 10% faster than the RTX 3080, 36% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and 8% faster than the RX 6800 XT. Finally, at 1080p it was 4% faster, 22% faster, and less than 1% faster respectively. Against the RTX 3090, the 3080 Ti was only slightly slower with 2% fewer FPS at 4K and 3% fewer at 1440p and 1080p.As a 4K card, I performed some expanded testing specifically at that resolution. Here\u2019s how it performed in a wider selection of ten games. With this larger sample size, the results become even clearer. On average, the RTX 3080 Ti was 12% faster than the RTX 3080, 48% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, and 16% faster than the RX 6800 XT in rasterization (56% overall when the 3080 Ti is given the benefit of DLSS). Across all of these titles, the RTX 3080 Ti averaged only 2% slower than the RTX 3090.So what do we make of all this? First off, for gamers, there is little reason to consider the RTX 3090 anymore. While it might remain the \u201cUltimate Gaming GPU\u201d its advantage over the RTX 3080 Ti is so narrow that the additional $300 on the asking price just doesn\u2019t make sense on gaming alone. Second, it\u2019s that the standard RTX 3080 is still going to be the best choice for most gamers \u2013 at least until we can see what the performance of the RTX 3070 Ti comes in at. While the 3080 Ti is indeed faster, whether it\u2019s worth a $500 premium over the basic model will depend entirely on the user.  Which brings us to the question of availability. Though Nvidia plans to make this GPU available at more than just its own GeForce store, the ongoing GPU shortage is expected to continue into the second half of the year, making it likely this GPU and the third-party variants will sell out quickly only to be listed at higher prices than Nvidia suggests. To help counteract this, the RTX 3080 Ti will feature a limited hash rate on Ethereum mining in the hopes of discouraging cryptocurrency miners.Purchasing GuideThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition will be available at major retailers around the world for $1,199 starting on June 3. Aftermarket variants from major brands like ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte will also be available for purchase. VerdictIn more ways than one, the RTX 3080 Ti makes the RTX 3090 obsolete for PC gamers. It\u2019s smaller, nearly as fast, and is more cost effective if all you care about is gaming. Compared to the RTX 3080, the differences are much narrower, even if the price is not.In This ArticleGeForce RTX 3080 TiJun 3, 20218Review scoringgreatThe Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti is the true gaming flagship we\u2019ve been waiting for.

Coupling 10,752 CUDA processing cores with its 84 next-generation RT cores, the new GPU offers top-class performance in both real-time ray-tracing and professional final frame ray-tracing output. Though NVIDIA considers the RTX A6000 as a successor to the RTX 6000, it is essentially a direct replacement of the RTX 8000. \nThe NVIDIA RTX A6000 is the company\u2019s newest release that leverages second-generation RTX architecture. Coupling 10,752 CUDA processing cores with its 84 next-generation RT cores, the new GPU offers top-class performance in both real-time ray-tracing and professional final frame ray-tracing output. Though NVIDIA considers the RTX A6000 as a successor to the RTX 6000, it is essentially a direct replacement of the RTX 8000.\nThe RTX 8000 is roughly 3 years old as of this review, so it\u2019s certainly nice to finally see a replacement to NVIDIA\u2019s former best-of-class workstation GPU. The company recently stopped using the Quadro name to identify their professional solutions; however, the RTX A6000 still features all the same professional features, hardware and software certifications, certified drivers as the Quadro line.\n\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 vs. RTX 6000 vs. RTX 8000\nThe RTX A6000 is a huge upgrade no matter which last-gen card you compare it to, offering a more realistic output of moving objects and support for hardware-accelerated motion blur (the latter which is used to improve the final image\u2019s overall realism when rendering moving objects). It also features accelerated AI denoising, which means higher quality output using fewer rendering passes and thus faster render times.\u00a0 Moreover, the A6000 is NVIDIA\u2019s first professional graphics card that supports the PCIe Gen4 standard.\nThe new NVIDIA card doubles the memory size of the RTX 6000 to 48GB of GDDR6 (the same as the RTX 8000), allowing it to work with larger 3D datasets. This also means creative professionals can render large 3D scenes without having to reduce scene complexity. For professionals that have larger budgets and workloads that require more than 48GB of memory, two A6000 cards can be connected via the NVIDIA NVLink for 96GB of combined GPU memory.\n\nPerhaps the most significant upgrade with the RTX A6000 is NVIDIA Ampere, a new architecture that uses Samsung\u2019s 8nm NVIDIA custom process featuring 28 billion transistors. As you will see in the performance charts below, this new architecture will blow the RTX 6000 out of the water in most of our tests.\nOther Ampere highlights include:\n\nan improved streaming multiprocessor\nsecond-generation Ray Tracing cores, which improve ray tracing hardware acceleration\nthird-generation Tensor Cores, which improve AI inference performance and DLSS resulting in better performance at higher resolutions\n\nThe Ampere architecture also increases CUDA cores by up to double the single-precision floating-point compared to last-gen models. This means noticeable performance improvements in areas such as 3D model development and compute like desktop simulation for computer-aided engineering.\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 vs. RTX 3090\nYes, the RTX A6000 is a direct replacement of the RTX 8000 and technically the successor to the RTX 6000, but it is actually more in line with the RTX 3090 in many ways, as far as specifications and potential performance output go. Both cards leverage the new Ampere (8nm) architecture and feature a similar CUDA and RT core count.\nAny difference in performance between the two cards is likely due to the RTX 3090\u2019s improved driver optimization and newer RAM (3090\u2019s GDDR6X vs the A6000\u2019s GDDR6). Nonetheless, the RTX A6000 is a massive release by NVIDIA and will outperform pretty much anything else available on the market in certain areas, so deciding on which card is best for you really comes down to your specific use case as our review benchmarks will show.\n\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 Specifications\n\n\n\nGPU\nRTX A6000\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\n\n\nFoundry\nSamsung\n\n\nProcess Size\n8nm\n\n\nTransistors\n28.3 billion\n\n\nDie Size\n628.4 mm2\n\n\nCUDA Parallel Processing Cores\n10,752\n\n\nNVIDIA Tensor Cores\n336\n\n\nNVIDIA RT Cores\n84\n\n\nGPU Memory\n48 GB GDDR6 with ECC\n\n\nMemory Interface\n384-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n768 GB/s\n\n\nMax Power Consumption\n300W\n\n\nGraphics Bus\nPCI Express 4.0 x16\n\n\nDisplay Connectors\nDP 1.4 (4)\n\n\nForm Factor\n4.4\u201d H x 10.5\u201d L Dual Slot\n\n\nProduct Weight\n1.179 kg\n\n\nThermal Solution\nActive\n\n\nvGPU Software Support\nNVIDIA GRID, NVIDIA Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation, NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server\n\n\nvGPU Profiles Supported\n1 GB, 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB, 6 GB, 8 GB,\n12 GB, 16 GB, 24 GB, 48 GB\n\n\nNVIDIA\u00ae 3D Vision\u00ae and 3D Vision Pro\nSupport via 3 pin mini DIN\n\n\nFrame lock\nCompatible (with Quadro Sync II)\n\n\nNVLink\n2-way low profile (2-slot and 3-slot bridges)\nConnect 2x RTX A6000\n\n\nNVLink Interconnect\n112.5 GB/s (bidirectional)\n\n\nPower Connector\n1x 8-pin CPU\n\n\nNVENC | NVDEC\n1x | 2x (+AV1 decode)\n\n\n\nPerformance\nTo gauge its performance, we put the RTX A6000 through a series of resource-intensive tests and compared it to the RTX 8000 and the RTX 3090 FE. We installed the RTX A6000 in both the HP ZCentral 4R and the P620 workstations, which the RTX 8000 also used in some of our benchmarks:\nHP ZCentral 4R:\n\nIntel Xeon 2295 (3.0 GHz base frequency, up to 4.6 GHz with Intel vPro Technology)\n64GB of DDR4-2933 ECC SDRAM\n1TB M.2 SSD\n\nLenovo ThinkStation P620:\n\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX Processor (2.70 GHz, up to 4.20 GHz Max Boost, 64 Cores, 128 Threads, 32 MB Cache)\n64GB of DDR4 RAM\n1TB PM981 SSD\n\nWe installed the RTX 8000 and RTX 3090 in a custom consumer-build for our Blender and LuxMark tests:\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n4x8GB (32GB) G.Skill TridentZ Neo 3600MHz CL16\n2TB Samsung 970 Pro\nASRock X570 Taichi (BIOS v4.00, PCIe Gen4)\n\nSPECviewperf 2020\nFirst up is the SPECviewperf 2020 benchmark, the worldwide standard for measuring graphics performance of professional applications running under the OpenGL and Direct X application programming interfaces. The viewsets (or benchmarks) represent graphics content and behavior from actual applications, without having to install the applications themselves. These viewsets include 3D Max, CATIA, Creo, Energy, Maya, Medical, Siemens NX, and Solidworks.\nNote: we used a 4K resolution (3800 x 2120) for this test and both were installed in the HP ZCentral 4R.\n\n\n\nViewsets\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\nLenovo ThinkStation P620\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\nHP ZCentral 4R\nNVIDIA\u00a0RTX 8000\nLenovo ThinkStation P620\n\n\n3dsmax-07\n131.96\n127.89\n110.01\n\n\nCatia-06\n90.99\n75.32\n69.37\n\n\nCreo-03\n125.88\n99.54\n108.11\n\n\nEnergy-03\n42.22\n38.83\n27.11\n\n\nMaya-06\n314.82\n273.01\n238.84\n\n\nMedical-03\n34.87\n30.58\n27.67\n\n\nSnx-04\n450.72\n422.01\n375.83\n\n\nSw-05\n161.4\n152.19\n136.5\n\n\n\nFor this benchmark, the RTX A6000 showed a dramatic improvement over the last-gen model inside both workstations, especially in the Siemens NX category. As we stated earlier, the Ampere architecture is a huge leap forward in performance, so this was certainly expected and you will see this performance trend continue in the rest of our benchmarks.\nNext, we ran SPECworkstation3, a test that specializes in benchmarks designed for testing all key aspects of workstation performance; it uses over 30 workloads to test CPU, graphics, I/O, and memory bandwidth. The workloads fall into broader categories such as Media and Entertainment, Financial Services, Product Development, Energy, Life Sciences, and General Operations. We are going to list the broad-category results for each, as opposed to the individual workloads. The results are an average of all the individual workloads in each category.\nSPECworkstation3\n\n\n\nCategory\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\nLenovo ThinkStation P620\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\nHP ZCentral 4R\nNVIDIA RTX 8000\nLenovo ThinkStation P620\n\n\nM&E\n6.04\n3.49\n3.82\n\n\nProdDev\n5.49\n3.63\n3.97\n\n\nLifeSci\n4.61\n3.76\n4.07\n\n\nEnergy\n5.58\n2.79\ndid not complete\n\n\nFSI\n9.49\n3.38\n4.08\n\n\nGeneralOps\n2.14\n1.63\n2.1\n\n\nGPU Compute\n7.44\n7.22\n5.88\n\n\n\nOverall, we saw another significant leap in performance with most of the categories when installed inside the P620, sometimes more than doubling the result over the RTX 8000. When populated inside the HP ZCentral workstation, it showed lower numbers with the exception of the GPU Compute.\nEnvironmental Systems Research Institute (Esri)\nNext up is the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) benchmark. Esri is a supplier of Geographic Information System (GIS) software while their Performance Team designed their PerfTool add-in scripts to automatically launch the ArcGIS Pro.\nThis application uses a \u201cZoomToBookmarks\u201d function to browse various predefined bookmarks and create a log file with all the key data points required to predict the user experience. The script automatically loops the bookmarks three times to account for caching (memory and disk cache). In other words, this benchmark simulates heavy graphical use that one might see through Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Pro software.\nThe tests consist of three main datasets. Two are 3-D city views of Philadelphia, PA, and Montreal, QC. These city views contain textured 3-D multipatch buildings draped on a terrain model and draped aerial images. The third dataset is a 2-D map view of the Portland, OR region. This data contains detailed information for roads, land use parcels, parks and schools, rivers, lakes, and hill shaded terrain.\nFirst up is Montreal.

This benchmark was run using the Blender Benchmark utility. NVIDIA OptiX was the chosen render method, as opposed to CUDA, as the A6000 and its comparables can utilize RTX. In this benchmark measured in seconds, lower is better.\nThe A6000 showed huge gains in all categories (except Koro) over the RTX 8000 in both the HP and Lenovo workstation. Though it trailed the RTX 3090 in all categories, the RTX A6000 gave the gaming-behemoth GPU a run for its money.\n\nLuxMark\nLuxMark is an OpenCL cross-platform benchmarking tool from those who maintain the open-source 3D rending engine, LuxRender. This tool looks at GPU performance in the areas of 3D modeling, lighting, and video work. For this review, we used the newest version, v4alpha0. In LuxMark, higher is better when it comes to the score.\nIn the food rendering category, the RTX A6000 scored 8,088 when inside the Lenovo P620, which more than doubled that of the RTX 8000 (which posted 3,337) and slightly trailed the RTX 3090 (which posted 8,929). In the Hallbench rendering category, the new NVIDIA card again more than double the last-gen card with 20,983 (vs. 9,794), while trailing the RTX 3090\u2019s 23,555. Inside an HP ZCentral 4R, the RTX A6000 posted a score of 7,123 and 20,246 for the food and Hallbench categories, respectively.\n\nOctaneBench\nLastly, we look at OctaneBench. This is a benchmarking utility for OctaneRender and another 3D renderer with RTX support (similar to V-Ray).\n\n\n\nRTX A6000 Total Score: 664.40\n\n\nLenovo ThinkStation P620\n\n\nScene\nKernel\nMs/s\nRatio\nWeight\nScore\n\n\nInterior\ninfo channels\n386.4874\n7.502\n10\n18.75424\n\n\nInterior\ndirect lighting\n120.6423\n6.778\n40\n67.77658\n\n\nInterior\npath tracing\n60.07888\n7.035\n50\n87.93748\n\n\nIdea\ninfo channels\n403.6568\n4.694\n10\n11.73557\n\n\nIdea\ndirect lighting\n112.0406\n5.323\n40\n53.22593\n\n\nIdea\npath tracing\n101.651\n5.245\n50\n65.56436\n\n\nATV\ninfo channels\n369.6832\n11.777\n10\n29.44275\n\n\nATV\ndirect lighting\n114.5929\n7.534\n40\n75.34053\n\n\nATV\npath tracing\n97.79354\n7.569\n50\n94.61449\n\n\nBox\ninfo channels\n423.7369\n6.445\n10\n16.11167\n\n\nBox\ndirect lighting\n93.5092\n6.756\n40\n67.56445\n\n\nBox\npath tracing\n82.13356\n6.107\n50\n76.33231\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nRTX A6000 Total Score: Total score: 651.2823\n\n\nHP ZCentral 4R\n\n\nScene\nKernel\nMs/s\nRatio\nWeight\nScore\n\n\nInterior\ninfo channels\n381.9805\n7.414\n10\n18.53555\n\n\nInterior\ndirect lighting\n119.4807\n6.712\n40\n67.12399\n\n\nInterior\npath tracing\n58.97741\n6.906\n50\n86.32525\n\n\nIdea\ninfo channels\n393.9745\n4.582\n10\n11.45408\n\n\nIdea\ndirect lighting\n109.6025\n5.207\n40\n52.06769\n\n\nIdea\npath tracing\n99.80163\n5.15\n50\n64.37154\n\n\nATV\ninfo channels\n363.1271\n11.568\n10\n28.92061\n\n\nATV\ndirect lighting\n112.0573\n7.367\n40\n73.67342\n\n\nATV\npath tracing\n95.76828\n7.412\n50\n92.65507\n\n\nBox\ninfo channels\n414.6209\n6.306\n10\n15.76505\n\n\nBox\ndirect lighting\n91.09318\n6.582\n40\n65.81877\n\n\nBox\npath tracing\n80.23866\n5.966\n50\n74.57125\n\n\n\nHere, we see an overall score of 664.40 and 651.28 when used inside the HP and Lenovo workstations, respectively, which was very similar to the RTX 3090 (which had an overall score of 671.02). In addition, this more than doubled the score of the RTX 8000 (which had an overall score of 315.02).\nConclusion\nThe RTX A6000 is an impressive release by NVIDIA, to say the least. This new professional graphics card features 10,752 CUDA processing cores, 84 next-generation RT cores, 48GB of GDDR6 RAM, and supports the PCI Express 4.0 x16 interface. The new NVIDIA card doubles the GPU memory size of the RTX 6000 to 48GB GDDR6, allowing it to work with larger and more complex 3D datasets. Professionals who have bigger pockets and need more than 48GB of memory can install two A6000 cards via the NVIDIA NVLink for a combined 96GB of DDR6 RAM.\nWhile the RTX A6000 is technically the successor to the RTX 6000, it\u2019s more of a direct replacement of the RTX 8000\u2013NVIDIA\u2019s former top workstation GPU. And even then, it\u2019s exponentially more than just an iterative upgrade vs this last-gen model: it\u2019s a monumental leap in performance.\nSo how is the possible? The most important factor is NVIDIA Ampere. This architecture uses Samsung\u2019s 8nm NVIDIA custom process (featuring 28 billion transistors), an improved streaming multiprocessor, second-generation Ray Tracing cores, and greatly improved ray tracing hardware acceleration. It also uses third-generation Tensor Cores, which helps to improve AI inference performance and DLSS resulting in better performance at higher resolutions. These are just a few of the highlights Ampere brings to the table and thus allows the RTX A8000 to offer a huge leap forward, which was certainly evident in our performance tests.\nAnother interesting feature for those who have the means to do it (and necessity) is the RTX A6000\u2019s support for the Quadro Sync II add-in card. This allows the GPU to synchronize both the display and image output from various compatible GPUs within a single system (or a cluster of systems), as each Quadro Sync II card can synchronize the output of up to four RTX A6000 cards. That is, users can install up to two Quadro Sync II cards on a single system, which means a workstation with eight GPUs (each with four active independent display outputs) has the ability to support up to 32 synchronized video displays.\nEven though the RTX A6000 is a replacement to the RTX 8000, it is actually more comparable to the RTX 3090, where it trailed ever so slightly in our benchmark tests. As we mentioned earlier, this minor performance difference is likely because of Quadro driver optimizations and newer RAM.\n\nSo, who is the RTX A6000 meant for and should I buy an RTX 3090 instead? Well, it depends. Deciding which GPU to get should be based on whatever your workflow is or what it might be in the short-term future. It\u2019s incredibly hard to get a hold of any RTX card these days, but if you are in a position to do so, the RTX A6000 best suits those who work primarily in CAD (more specifically, in scientific fields with applications like Creo and CATIA), as the RTX 3090 doesn\u2019t provide the necessary driver optimizations that come with the Quadro line of cards. Though we did not test the RTX A6000 in any game experience benchmarks, the RTX 3090 is certainly the best gaming GPU money can buy, especially with games that leverage ray-tracing and DLSS 2.0.\nWith all this said, the Ampere-based RTX A6000 will greatly outperform pretty much anything else available on the market in certain areas, so if you\u2019re a professional that needs a powerful visual-computing GPU for your desktop workstation, the RTX A6000 is the best card available right now.\nNVIDIA GPUs\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0|\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook | TikTok |\u00a0RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nLyle Smith\nLyle is a long-time staff writer for StorageReview, covering a broad set of end user and enterprise IT topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious post\n\n\n\nDell OptiPlex 7090 Ultra Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext post\n\n\n\nSimply NUC Ruby R8 (CBM1r8RB) AMD NUC Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUSTED VENDORS\nProducts and solutions from our affiliate partners:\n\n\n\n\n        Ubiquiti\n      \n\n\n\n\n        Newegg\n      \n\n\n\n Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletterSubscribe to the StorageReview newsletter to stay up to date on the latest news and reviews.
