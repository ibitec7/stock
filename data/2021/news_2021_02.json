(From InvestorPlace) (Ad)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) On The Verge Of A Major Breakout\nWritten by MarketBeat StaffFebruary 9, 2021 ShareLink copied to clipboard.\n\nRemove Ads\n\n\r\n                    \r\n                    A 6% jump in Monday\u2019s session was enough to make shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) among the best performing of US equities on the day. In what was a great start to the week for markets overall with the major indices all setting fresh all-time highs, Nvidia\u2019s stock came within a few bucks of retaking its own all-time high which has been dogging it since last year.\n\nCiti Expects Big Things From NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA at CES 2021\n\nWhile shares are still up more than 300% in the past two years, they\u2019ve been range-bound since Q3. It\u2019s not unreasonable for Wall Street to ask if they\u2019ve been taking a well-deserved breather before the next leg up, or if we\u2019re starting to see the momentum swing against them.Get NVIDIA alerts:Sign Up\nAt the close of last week, shares were essentially flat since the middle of October, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index had notched more than a 16% return over the same period. This kind of underperformance can be frustrating for investors but isn\u2019t that unusual at all. During periods of outperformance, the gap widens considerably before we get these cooling-off periods. This is where gains are consolidated and investors wait for the fundamentals to catch up so the next leg of the rally can begin. In answer to Wall Street\u2019s question, based on Monday\u2019s jump it\u2019s starting to look like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\nBitcoin As The Catalyst\n\nMKM Partners: Watch Out For NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA and AMD NASDAQ: AMD\n\nThe catalyst this time, Bitcoin, might come as a surprise to some. The best-known cryptocurrency has been back in the headlines in recent weeks as it sets price records of its own. Elon Musk\u2019s announcement yesterday that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and will be accepting it as payment going forward has only added to the hype. Similar to the electric vehicle space, it doesn\u2019t take much to ignite shares that are in any way related. So the news yesterday that Chinese crypto miners are dealing with a shortage of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 30 desktop graphics cards by turning to GeForce RTX 30-powered laptops only served to set the cat amongst the pigeons.Remove Ads\nEven though Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang has said in the past that cryptocurrency \u201cis not our business\u201d, this fresh and surprising demand could be the push that Nvidia shares needed to break out of their multi-month range.\n\nJuniper Networks NASDAQ: JNPR Is A Sleep-Well-At-Night Stock For High-Yield Investors\n\nThey closed Monday\u2019s session at their highest level since November with the higher lows they\u2019ve been setting since September helping to underpin the move. It means we\u2019re now looking at a very attractive technical set up, with a tightening pennant forming quickly. September\u2019s and November\u2019s prints in the high $580s make for a perfect near term target for investors to aim for with this month\u2019s Q4 earnings providing a textbook catalyst for shares to run up into.\nLooking Ahead\nQ3\u2019s topline number was 57% higher year on year but considering how shares have traded sideways since, there\u2019s a ton of potential for hype to start flowing in again now. Citi added the stock to its Catalyst watch list last month and are bullish on the company\u2019s prospects for 2021.\nIn a note at the time they said; \"we expect hyperscale-led data center demand recovery in 1H21 and sustained PC gaming demand despite tight supply to drive upside to near-term Street estimates. Our Jan/Apr-Q EPS estimates are 2% / 5% above Street.\"\nWith the bears having been unable to take the stock down in recent months despite their best efforts, the fresh fundamental and technical factors that are starting to align make for a strong bull case in the short and medium-term.\nShould You Invest $1,000 in NVIDIA Right Now?Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Upcoming GPUs will have their Ethereum (ETH -2.74%) hash rates cut in half, and the company is also launching a separate series of chips specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining.\nGraphics card prices have skyrocketed in recent months, driven partly by high demand from cryptocurrency miners amid rising currency prices. On top of that, the third-party manufacturers that turn NVIDIA's designs into physical products are running their manufacturing lines at full speed but still have to leave many orders on the table. This problem has triggered shortages across the semiconductor industry as a whole, including NVIDIA. Diverting more GPUs into the gaming market may alter the supply-and-demand balance and lower consumer-level prices.\nWhen the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU hits retail outlets on Feb. 25, the associated software drivers will detect processes attempting to mine Ethereum shares, intentionally halving the effective hash rate for these programs. The idea is to make GPUs less interesting for cryptocurrency miners, thereby leaving a larger number of cards available for gamers.\nThe stunted mining performance will not apply to existing NVIDIA products, so someone could always work around this move by using older drivers without the intentional hash rate limitation.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAt the same time, NVIDIA wants to capture the demand for cryptocurrency mining hardware and is launching a professional mining series known as the NVIDIA CMP (for Cryptocurrency Mining Processor). These chips don't do graphics and won't support display outputs at all, allowing miners to pack more of these chips into a limited space.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also run at lower voltages and frequencies, making them more cost-effective for large-scale mining operations. These products will hit the market over the next several quarters. CMP pricing and retail channels remain to be seen. NVIDIA says that the production of CMP chips won't cut into the production rates of GPUs.\n\n\n\nAnders Bylund owns shares of Ethereum. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends NVIDIA.

Source: Getty   Bioterrorism is the next threat facing humanity, billionaire Bill Gates has revealed in an interview with science YouTuber Derek Muller on his channel, Veritasium. Gates, who predicted the pandemic in 2015, told Muller that bioterrorism, which is when someone who wants to cause damage engineers a virus, is likely the next \u201cdisaster\u201d that humans aren\u2019t prepared for.  \u201cSo it means the chance of running into this [virus] is more than just the naturally caused epidemics like the current one,\u201d Gates said. And it\u2019s not the first time Gates has flagged bioterrorism as a huge threat - one bigger than a nuclear war. In 2017, Gates took to Reddit to field questions from fans, and said: \u201cI am concerned about biological tools that could be used by a bioterrorist.\u201d That same year, the billionaire told The Telegraph it would be \u201crelatively easy\u201d to engineer a new flu strain. Unlike a nuclear war though, the disease wouldn\u2019t stop killing once it was released.  Climate change The next disaster that humans aren\u2019t prepared for is climate change, Gates said. \u201cThat would be a death toll even greater than we\u2019ve had in this pandemic,\u201d he said. Last year, Gates wrote in his blog GatesNotes that by 2060, climate change could be just as deadly as the pandemic, and by 2100, it could be five times as deadly. \u201cIn the next decade or two, the economic damage caused by climate change will likely be as bad as having a COVID-sized pandemic every ten years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the end of the century, it will be much worse if the world remains on its current emissions path.\u201d Facing another pandemic Gates told Muller that much like COVID, another pandemic could still wreak havoc on the world, despite any lessons learned in this one. \u201cWe could increase our preparedness so we never have a death toll anywhere near what we have today,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWe were lucky that the fatality here is not not super high, but we can nip it in the bud. It'll still get to a lot of countries, but the number of deaths...with the right system should be a tenth of what we've seen here.\u201d    Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

From 9am PT (5pm GMT) on Thursday 25th February, retailers will be allowed to sell the newest Ampere consumer graphics card.\n\nOf course there is the thorny issue of stock being available when the RTX 3060 12GB is released. Already, at the pre-launch stage, you can see online listings featuring AIB partner cards based off this GPU being listed from \u20ac499 to \u20ac699 in Europe, and currently being sold in Pakistan for the equivalent of approx US$750. As a reminder, the official\u00a0 RRP is US$329.\nThere will not be any Founder's Edition of the RTX 3060 12GB graphics card, Nvidia told The Verge, so you will have to take your pick from AIB offerings, where available.\n\nTo recap, the RTX 3060 12GB is being touted by the Green Team as the successor to the GTX 1060 and RTX 2060 (non-Super). Compared to these earlier generations the new consumer Ampere graphics card pretty much guarantees 60fps+ performance in modern AA games \u2013 and it does so with the dual delights of real-time ray tracing and DLSS turned on, where available.\nGeForce RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti supply boost confirmed\nTo alleviate demand for PC gaming graphics cards, Nvidia has confirmed the rumours that it will be 'reviving' some older GPUs.\nIn an email to PC World, Nvidia said it had never EOLed the GeForce RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti, so 'reviving' was not perhaps the correct terminology. Instead, Nvidia said it preferred to say that it was meeting the \"ebb and flow\" of market demand which is currently very high.\n\nThe Pascal card's stock could potentially ramp up supply very quickly if the rumours that GDDR6 shortages are another reason behind shortages of the newest GeForce and Radeon graphics cards. Moreover, its 4GB GDDR5 VRAM, insufficient for ETH mining, means stocks won't be plundered, and it can run in systems which might not have a spare PCI power connector, as well as there being various LP designs ready for otherwise constrained systems. It looks like we still need some time for the ebb to turn into a flow of these 'revived' GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 19 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The median monthly household income from work fell by 2.5 per cent in nominal terms to S$9,189 last year from S$9,425 in 2019, the Department of Statistics (DOS) said on Monday (8 February) in its yearly \u201cKey Household Income Trends, 2020\u201d report.  After adjusting for inflation, this works out to a 2.4 per cent drop in real terms. The last decline, which was also 2.4 per cent, happened in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, median monthly household income from work of resident employed households \u2013comprising citizens and permanent residents with at least one working person \u2013 rose over the last five years by 5.2 per cent cumulatively, or 1.0 per cent per annum in real terms. Median monthly household income from work per household member dropped to S$2,886 last year from S$2,925 in 2019. This marks a decline of 1.3 per cent in nominal terms or 1.2 per cent in real terms. From 2015 to 2020, the median income per household member grew by 14.6 per cent cumulatively, or 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms. The report found that lower income households were the hardest hit, with those in the bottom 10 per cent seeing a 6.1 per cent real decline in income. In contrast, households in the top 90 per cent income groups recorded real income declines of 1.4 to 3.2 per cent.  Government transfers and taxes significantly reduced the Gini coefficient to 0.375 from 0.452 in 2020, larger than the reduction to 0.398 from 0.452 in 2019. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality from 0 to 1, with 0 being most equal. The reduction arose from the significant amount of government support provided during the COVID-19 crisis last year, especially for households staying in the smaller HDB flats, the DOS said. Resident households, including those with no working persons, received S$6,308 per household member on average from various government schemes last year, higher than the S$4,684 received in 2019, the DOS added. In particular, resident households in HDB 1-room and 2-room flats received S$13,670 per household member on average, almost double the transfers received by resident households in HDB 3-room flats.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorFeb 18, 2021, 09:41am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA's Endeavor HQ BuildingNVIDIA\nNVIDIA is set to launch a new mainstream gaming graphics card on February 25th but with the introduction of its new $329 GeForce RTX 3060, the Silicon Valley GPU giant is also making bold moves to address critical shortage and supply/demand dynamics that are keeping its products from getting into the hands of more PC gamers around the world.\n\n\nAs HotHardware detailed earlier this month, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 will be officially launched next week and at a price point more palatable for the average PC gamer on a budget. The new GeForce card will also bring 50% more on-board GDDR6 frame buffer memory than the higher-end GeForce RTX 3060 Ti card that slots in just above it in NVIDIA\u2019s product stack. Though the new RTX 3060 has fewer CUDA cores (3584 vs 4864 in the Ti variant) and a narrower 192-bit memory interface (256-bit for the Ti), in a move targeted towards delivering more value competitively, NVIDIA is equipping this new midrange GeForce RTX 3060 with a full 12GB of GDDR6, where the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is outfitted with only 8GB. However, beyond just this strategic design decision, NVIDIA is also stepping out with a couple of other major announcements, in concert with this new GeForce product launch, that could have even more market impact.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti CardHotHardware\n\nOf Hash Rates And Outputs: Addressing Market Dynamics And Demand\nWhat gamers may also find special about the new GeForce RTX 3060 is that the card will actually be limited by NVIDIA in such a way that it will be of much less value to cryptocurrency miners. Specifically, the NVIDIA\u2019s drivers for the new card will actively detect the \u201cattributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm\u201d and lop the card\u2019s hash rate in half, making it much less efficient to use for mining. These drivers will presumably be tied to the card in such a way that this software \u201cgovernor\u201d of sorts will not easily be hackable. In short, this rather bold move by NVIDIA should alleviate nearly all of the demand of crypto-miners for the new RTX 3060, leaving its supply mostly unscathed for gamers looking to get ahold of NVIDIA\u2019s new, lower-cost gaming GPU. However, NVIDIA is throwing cryptocurrency miners a major bone as well that should further alleviate mining industry demand pressure on its GeForce gaming product stack.\n\nToday, the company is also announcing a new line of products dubbed NVIDIA CMP, or Cryptocurrency Mining Processors. However, before gamers get up in arms that NVIDIA is in some way peeling off silicon supplies to specifically cater to miners, the reality of this move is actually squarely aligned with the interests of gamers as well as market demand.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nNVIDIA notes, \u201cCMP products \u2014 which don\u2019t do graphics \u2014 are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. They don\u2019t meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and, thus, don\u2019t impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA CMP products also won\u2019t have display outputs since they\u2019re not required for mining and also as a result will have been airflow out of their rear brackets, making them more efficient as well for densely packed, multi-GPU installations. The cards will also have optimized power characteristics will make them significantly more efficient for cryptocurrency mining. But is this really a proverbial win-win for all parties involved? Afterall, NVIDIA has been down this path before.\n\n\nMy quick-take analysis of these major announcements by NVIDIA is that yes, out of the gate at least, it\u2019s a notable win for gamers, miners and of course NVIDIA itself. What NVIDIA is obviously doing here is not only targeted at alleviating the crushing demand from miners on its GPUs that results in fewer PC gamers getting access to its GeForce products, but also this is a sort of yield loss mitigation strategy. In this case, the company is making better use of GPUs that otherwise don\u2019t make the cut as GeForce gaming graphics cards but are perfectly suitable for cryptocurrency mining with a little bit of optimization. Sure, this is going to take qualification and other resources of NVIDIA to bring CMP products to market, but the company is not resource-limited in these areas, and this should result in less overall strain on supply chain partners for materials and silicon resources that are destined for PC gaming graphics cards. After all, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce 60-series cards have historically been the company\u2019s biggest volume movers.\nMy only reservation is that we\u2019ll have to see how the market and community reacts to these changes and announcements by NVIDIA. The company is once again blazing a trail that has not been traveled, by limiting the hash rate of its new GeForce RTX 3060, and I applaud them for the move in conjunction with its CMP products announcement. How the market and ecosystem reacts from here will be interesting to watch for sure.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Plus, Unreal Engine 4 DLSS Plugin Released\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                     By Andrew Burnes on February 23, 2021\n                \n\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFeatured Stories\nGeForce RTX GPUs\nNVIDIA DLSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach month we\u2019re working with developers to bring NVIDIA DLSS and other technologies to the latest and greatest games, and this month\u2019s no different, with DLSS coming to Nioh 2 - The Complete Edition and Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.\nOnly GeForce RTX GPUs feature Tensor Cores, dedicated AI processors that power revolutionary technologies such as NVIDIA DLSS, which greatly accelerates frame rates. With faster performance you can enjoy smoother gameplay, or reinvest those frames in higher detail levels, higher rendering resolutions, and higher ray tracing settings, giving you the most immersive experience possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNioh 2 - The Complete Edition Adds NVIDIA DLSS\nNioh 2, Koei Tecmo\u2019s popular masocore action RPG, recently launched on the PC as Nioh 2 - The Complete Edition. The beautifully crafted, challenging game received excellent reviews on console, and on PC everything\u2019s enhanced and all DLC is included.\nWith a new update available now, you can enjoy Nioh 2 at 4K with maxed out settings at even faster frame rates thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the most performance-intensive moments of the game, NVIDIA DLSS can accelerate frame rates by up to 58%, enabling all GeForce RTX gamers to enjoy Nioh 2 at over 60 FPS at all times. And during less intensive moments, NVIDIA DLSS will enable you to play at 120 FPS, Nioh 2\u2019s max frame rate, for the smoothest, most responsive, most enjoyable experience possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord Available Now with NVIDIA DLSS\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord added NVIDIA DLSS support this month, accelerating performance by up to 50% at 4K, allowing gamers to hit 60+ FPS across all GeForce RTX GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate how NVIDIA DLSS makes gameplay faster, smoother and more enjoyable in the action-packed title, check out our new Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord DLSS video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Unreal Engine 4 Marketplace Plugin\nUnreal Engine 4 is the gaming industry\u2019s most used engine, powering hundreds of titles and thousands of indie projects. The tools are simple enough that virtually anyone can make something cool, there are free examples and assets to use, and the documentation is extensive. Unreal Engine is also supported with a massive catalogue of plugins that bring new capabilities to the engine, making development even easier.\nTo bring DLSS to more games and gamers, we have recently released NVIDIA DLSS as a free plugin via the Unreal Engine marketplace. Once enabled, your players can enjoy great scaling across all GeForce RTX GPUs and resolutions, including the new ultra performance mode for 8K gaming.\nFor further documentation, new upcoming versions of DLSS, and direct contact with NVIDIA, please join the free NVIDIA DLSS Developer Access Program, and maybe one day we\u2019ll see your name in lights on our site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Arrives For Creative Apps\nDLSS\u2019s ability to boost FPS comes in handy for more than just video games. In fact, over a dozen content creation app developers have integrated DLSS to accelerate their creative workflows. 1 World, D5 Render, Goodbye Kansas Studios, Hyundai Motors, Lucasfilm\u2019s Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Orca Studios, and Surreal Film Productions are all using DLSS in apps for architecture, virtual production, product design, and more, to improve productivity.\nLearn more in our dedicated article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Always, There\u2019s More To Come\nWith today\u2019s addition of Nioh 2 - The Complete Edition and Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, there are nearly 40 titles with NVIDIA DLSS available to play. Plus many more games with ray tracing and NVIDIA Reflex. And of course, there are many more waiting in the wings to be announced and released in the coming weeks and months.\nFor details, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So, cloud gaming servers need to process information and render frames in real time. Unlike movies or TV shows that can provide a buffer \u2014 a few extra seconds of information that gets sent to your device before it\u2019s time to be displayed \u2014 games are dependent on the user\u2019s next keystroke or button press.\nIntroducing GeForce NOW\nWe started our journey to cloud gaming over 10 years ago, spending that time to optimize every millisecond of the pipeline that we manage, from the graphics cards in the data centers to the software on your local device.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\nGeForce NOW is a service that takes a GeForce gaming PC\u2019s power and flexibility and makes it accessible through the cloud. This gives you an always-on gaming rig that never needs upgrading, patching or updating \u2014 across all of your devices.\nOne of the things that makes GeForce NOW unique is that it connects to popular PC games stores \u2014 Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect and more \u2014 so gamers can play the same PC version of games their friends are playing.\nIt also means, if they already own a bunch of games, they can log in and start playing them. And if they have, or upgrade to, a gaming rig, they have access to download and play those games on that local PC.\nGeForce NOW empowers you to take your PC games with you, wherever you go.\nGamers get an immersive PC gaming experience, instant access to the world\u2019s most popular games and gaming communities, and the freedom to play on any device, at any time.\nIt\u2019s PC gaming for those whose PCs have integrated graphics, for Macs and Chromebooks that don\u2019t have access to the latest games, or for internet-connected mobile devices where PC gaming is only a dream.\nOver 80 percent of GeForce NOW members are playing on devices that don\u2019t meet the min spec for the games they\u2019re playing.\nTo start, sign up for the service, download the app and begin your cloud gaming journey.\nPowering PC Gaming from the Cloud\nCloud data centers with NVIDIA GPUs power the world\u2019s most computationally complex tasks, from AI to data analytics and research. Combined with advanced GeForce PC gaming technologies, GeForce NOW delivers high-end PC gaming to passionate gamers.\nNVIDIA RTX servers provide the backbone for GeForce NOW.\nGeForce NOW data centers include NVIDIA RTX servers that feature RTX GPUs. These GPUs enable the holy grail of modern graphics: real-time ray tracing, and DLSS, NVIDIA\u2019s groundbreaking AI rendering that boosts frame rates for uncompromised image quality. The hardware is supported with NVIDIA Game Ready Driver performance improvements.\nPatented capture and encoding technology \u2014 along with hardware acceleration in both video encoding and decoding, pioneered by NVIDIA more than a decade ago \u2014 allows for gameplay to be streamed at high frame rates, with low enough latency that most games will feel like the game is being played locally. Gameplay rendered in GeForce NOW data centers is converted into high-definition H.265 and H.264 video and streamed back to the gamer instantaneously.\nThe total time it takes from button press or keystroke to the action appearing on the screen is less than one-tenth of a second, faster than the blink of an eye.\nGrowing Cloud Gaming Around the World\nWith the ambition to deliver quality cloud gaming to all gamers, NVIDIA works with partners around the world including telecommunications and service providers to put GeForce NOW servers to work in their own data centers, ensuring lightning-fast connections.\nPartners that have already deployed RTX cloud gaming servers include SoftBank and KDDI in Japan, LG Uplus in Korea, GFN.RU in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, Zain in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan Mobile in Taiwan.\nTogether with partners from around the globe, we\u2019re scaling GeForce NOW to enable millions of gamers to play their favorite games, when and where they want.\nGet started with your gaming adventures on GeForce NOW.\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the first in a series on the GeForce NOW game-streaming service, how it works, ways you can make the most of it, and where it\u2019s going next.\u00a0\nIn our next blog, we\u2019ll talk about how we bring your games to GeForce NOW.\nFollow GeForce NOW on Facebook and Twitter and stay up to date on the latest features and game launches.\u00a0\nLearn more about gaming technology on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s the always-on gaming rig that never needs upgrading or patching and can instantly play your library of games.\nWe\u2019ve been blown away by the passion and fandom of its members. Over 175 million hours have been streamed and more than 130 million moments have been captured with NVIDIA Highlights. It is the gamers who continue to push GeForce NOW forward.\n\nOver the past year, we onboarded hundreds of games and are now supporting more than 800 titles, including 80 of the most-played free-to-play games, from over 300 publishers. Games like Cyberpunk 2077, Control and The Medium turned RTX ON to deliver real-time ray tracing and cinematic-quality graphics.\nA glimpse into year one for GeForce NOW\nWe added new platforms, including Chromebook, iPhone and iPad, over the past few months. Today, GeForce NOW extends to even more PCs and Macs with Chrome browser support in beta. Additionally, Mac support expands to include new Apple M1-based hardware.\nGeForce NOW has grown globally as well, with more than 65 countries now supported by our own service and more being added regularly by our GeForce NOW Alliance.\nNew Games, New Features \u2014 That\u2019s GFN Thursday\nMark your calendars! GFN Thursday is our ongoing commitment to bringing great PC games and service updates to members each week.

The native applications on each platform still provide the best experience and features, but now gaming is even more convenient.\nTo get started, launch Chrome and head over to https://play.geforcenow.com. Then, simply log in and play.\n\nCreate desktop shortcuts by clicking on a game to open the details, and select +SHORTCUT to help launch your favorite games faster.\nMembers can also quickly and easily invite friends to play the same game.

Apple products with the new chip will ask you to install Rosetta, if you haven\u2019t previously, before installing the GeForce NOW app.\nThe Celebration Begins\nAll month long we\u2019ll be celebrating GFN members with a series of rewards and giveaways. In the days ahead, Founders members can look forward to a unique offer in their inbox, while all members will have something special waiting as well.\nAnd on social there will be weekly opportunities to win premium prizes, including Steel Series Arctis Pro wireless headphones, Razer Kishi controllers and more.\nNow is the perfect time to encourage your friends to join you in the cloud by signing up for a free membership.

Transitioning from experimentation into business-impacting models deployed in production can be a real challenge.\nNetApp and NVIDIA are making it simple for enterprises to deploy AI fast, with new ONTAP AI integrated solutions that come in pre-configured sizes and are pre-tested and optimized for the scale of AI resources a business might need. It\u2019s the simplified model of converged infrastructure now applied to AI.\nMore so than talent or even budget, the top inhibitor to deploying AI scale is often concerns around platforms. For those in this infrastructure dilemma, common challenges include:\n\nThe complexity of designing AI infrastructure, including optimizing the balance of compute, storage and networking in support of the unique demands of data analytics, model training and production model-serving.\nDeploying a platform involves a multilayered stack of hardware and software (much of it open source), followed by an intense amount of troubleshooting as data science teams find themselves taking on the role of systems integrators.\nUpskilling IT teams to understand the tools required to operationalize and manage high performance computing, scheduling jobs and pinpointing where in the technology stack lies a performance-impacting problem that might straddle multiple vendors.\n\nA Proven Approach to Infrastructure, Applied to AI\nThe world of AI and machine learning is not the first domain to need a better approach to systemizing IT infrastructure to ease implementation. Just over a decade ago, IT witnessed the rise of integrated infrastructure solutions that offered enterprises an easier alternative to the highly engineered, bespoke systems approach that was so common then.\nNetApp has long been at the forefront of converged infrastructure solutions, offering simpler deployments with pre-integrated, modularized versions of proven reference architectures, packaged in orderable units. These were pre-assembled and tested in a system house before shipping to customers.\nOnsite installation was faster with a single expert team putting it all together, inclusive of compute, storage and networking. And the post-deployment experience was even easier with a single point of contact for all support, and coordinated engagement across all participating vendors.\nIntroducing NetApp ONTAP AI Integrated Solution\n\nNetApp ONTAP AI has proven itself as a valuable platform on which enterprises can scale AI. NVIDIA and NetApp are now making it easier for organizations to adopt this reference architecture that uses NVIDIA DGX A100 systems and NetApp All Flash storage.\nWith this new ONTAP AI integrated solution, NetApp and NVIDIA are bundling DGX A100 with NetApp All Flash Storage and NVIDIA networking in three prescriptive configurations that follow the original ONTAP AI reference architecture. Long-time NVIDIA and NetApp partner Arrow Electronics provides the business, technical and operational services needed to deploy the solution, including:\n\nSingle SKU per configuration\nAssembly and testing at Arrow\u2019s integration center\nPre-installation site survey to capture environment details\nShipment to customer location, with onsite installation by Arrow\u2019s Professional Services engineers\n\nWith ONTAP AI integrated solution, businesses not only benefit from a streamlined ordering and deployment process, but also a simplified, unified support model. NVIDIA provides first-line support that\u2019s coordinated with NetApp to ensure the fastest path to resolution of any issues.\nONTAP AI \u2013 Delivered Two Ways\nOrganizations that need AI infrastructure have two ways to acquire ONTAP AI. They can use the turnkey, integrated solution for fast deployment and simplified support. Or, they can follow the reference architecture on which the integrated offering is based, working with their choice of approved ONTAP AI partner to put it together, customized the way they prefer.\nLearn more about ONTAP AI integrated solution:\n\nRead the NetApp blog\nRead the solution brief\nWatch this video\nReview the reference architecture\nRegister for GTC, where NetApp will offer sessions exploring ONTAP AI integrated solution in more detail\n\nIn the meantime, contact your NetApp reseller to learn more about ONTAP AI integrated solution, which is currently available in North America.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI on the Menu: Yum!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorFeb 17, 2021, 06:00am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA is the 800 lb. gorilla in the AI hardware space. The company invests heavily in silicon, systems, and software to maintain that leadership position. This blog is an excerpt from the AI Competitive Landscape Report which is available to subscribers on my site. \n\nEarly researchers in AI's deep neural networks realized that NVIDIA GPUs, which process matrices to create 3D graphics, could be used to accelerate the matrix (tensor) operations needed for AI. NVIDIA quickly appreciated the potential and extended its CUDA software stack to include specific linear algebra libraries required for AI.\u00a0The result was that the Pascal architecture became the primary platform people were using for AI training as the market initially developed. Fast-forward three generations, and we see that, in the most recent quarter, NVIDIA data center revenue was $1.9B. That is an increase of 160% over the same period last year, reflecting both organic GPU growth and the Mellanox acquisition.\n\nNVIDIA Revenue by segment and quarter. Source:NVIDIA\nLast year, the company launched the Ampere-based A100 TensorCore GPU, which replaced the V100 as the fastest chip for deep learning and AI for most models and benchmarks. While many startups will claim performance superior to the A100, I have yet to see any credible benchmarks that support such assertions in chip-to-chip comparisons. NVIDIA delivered the A100 immediately, and it was adopted by most cloud service providers, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft, and Google. NVIDIA has also built Top 50 supercomputers using NVIDIA's DGX and HGX platforms with A100s and Mellanox networking.\n\n\nAs expected by many, NVIDIA updated the product just a few months later with twice the HBM memory (80GB), using the new HBM2E chips.\u00a0Big models and tables such as we see in Transformers and DLRM tend to be memory starved on GPUs, so this enhancement significantly improves large model performance (See Figure 9).\nThe 80GB version of the A100 can triple the performance of training large models such as the DLRM ... [+] model for recommendation engines.

By offering a scalable family of Drive platforms, NVIDIA spans the range from a 5W windshield ADAS module at 10 TOPS to the Drive AGX Pegasus for fully autonomous robot-taxis powered by two Orin SoCs and two Ampere GPUs, totaling 2,000 TOPS (!!!) and consuming 800 watts. As a result, NVIDIA now counts Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Volvo, and VW as partners. We believe the fear, uncertainty, and doubt concerning NVIDIA's automotive efforts, instigated in large part by Tesla's decision to build a chip, are mostly unfounded.\n\nNVIDIA now offers a wide range of platforms for autonomous vehicles. Source: NVIDIA\n\n\nNVIDIA remains the primary platform for AI in the data center because it delivers high business value. Given the comprehensive and free software stack it supports and the fast time-to-solution it provides, the economics are typically quite favorable. Unlike most alternative platforms, the GPU has excellent single- and double-precision floating-point performance and software stack, making it the go-to-choice for HPC acceleration and cloud services.\nThe ecosystem and optimized DNN models for GPUs have widened and deepened the CUDA defensive moat protecting NVIDIA GPUs. The software challenges to enable and optimize code for a novel architecture are perhaps the most significant barrier of entry for all contenders entering this market. It can take two to three years to develop the optimized \"kernels\" (math algorithms) for TensorFlow, Pytorch, etc., for a new chip. Conversely, the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) offers hundreds of applications with support for containers and certified EGX and HGX platforms.\nEvery startup will need to undertake this work since the hand-tuned kernels for convolution, pooling, etc., are highly dependent on the specific architecture on which it will execute. And since neural network innovation continues unabated, this effort will be continuous; it is not a one-and-done effort.\nBeyond software, we believe that NVIDIA is spending some $250M each year building and supporting its Saturn V, Selene, and other internal supercomputers to enable AI research and chip development. NVIDIA's clients have also implemented similar internal supercomputing-class AI systems using the NVIDIA DGX/HGX/SuperPod platforms. So, when we think of NVIDIA's competitive moat, we see it extending far wider and deeper than chips and CUDA.\nNVIDIA has repeatedly submitted the highest performance results running the MLPerf benchmark suite for training and inference processing on currently available hardware. However, other chipmakers, notably Google, submitted better results in the \"Research\" category. MLCommons, the organization that manages the MLPerf process, requires all such members to make these devices available within one year of the research submission or withdraw the results.\nIn a world full of half-truths, NVIDIA is the pinnacle of transparency regarding performance and has been a strong advocate for MLPerf. Detailed specifications of NVIDIA product performance are here.NVIDIA A100 is the fastest production chip in the market for AI today and continues to increase ... [+] performance dramatically. Source:NVIDIA\nSome observers question NVIDIA's ability to compete in inference processing, presumably based on a belief that the GPU is not optimal for running a particular model. However, NVIDIA has repeatedly demonstrated excellent benchmark performance on a wide variety of inference tasks. Furthermore, the new Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) increases the A100's ability to be dynamically sized to meet model needs most efficiently.NVIDIA MLPerf benchmarks for inference blow away all competitors. However, there are dozens of ... [+] startups and major semiconductor providers eyeing this space. Source:NVIDIA\nAll startups and potential investors must internalize NVIDIA's consistent ability to improve performance, both in software and new chips, when projecting expected performance advantages versus the leader. NVIDIA shared a graph with us that shows that the company's AI silicon platforms and software have increased performance by a factor of four in just 1.5 years. Failing to anticipate this, Nervana had promised to deliver 10X NVIDIA's performance about the time Intel acquired the startup. However, by the time Intel canceled the project in 2019, Nervana's performance lead was less than 2X. Now that the A100 is out, the Nervana chip would not be compelling, if even competitive. Software alone improved the V100 performance by anywhere from 10 to 120%.NVIDIA has demonstrated its ability to increase performance year over year with both new hardware ... [+] and optimized software. Source:NVIDIA\nOf course, we must note that NVIDIA intends to acquire Arm, which would provide Jensen a route to market to monetize IP he does not care to productize. This acquisition could establish NVIDIA as a broad-based supplier of high-performance data centers, platforms, silicon, and IP if approved. The acquisition raises objections, especially from Arm partners who compete with NVIDIA, and closing this deal will be problematic. However, we believe NVIDIA will be just fine even if the deal fails.\nStrengths: NVIDIA has built a significant lead in hardware, software, and ecosystem for AI acceleration. Its size and share make them a formidable, if not unbeatable, competitor. There are four reasons why NVIDIA continues to be the leader for #AI in the data center.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA has high-speed hardware and optimized software that accelerates a wide variety of workloads, not just AI, which increases data center utilization.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA builds optimized platforms (DGX, HGX, Jetson, Drive) that are easy to deploy and include AMD or Intel CPUs and Mellanox networking.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA nurtures and benefits from a massive ecosystem of cloud service providers, software, and researchers worldwide\nFinally, note that cloud service providers prefer the NVIDIA GPU, as it accelerates Deep Neural Networks, HPC, and Machine Learning, improving the CSP's utilization rates and profitability.\nWeaknesses: NVIDIA has decided to stay with its single architecture strategy while adding specific features for important markets like gaming, HPC, and AI. We believe it is true that a chip that only supports a few workloads could be theoretically faster. However, it is essential to note that while this thesis from most AI startup venture pitches is intriguing, it indeed has been belied by NVIDIA's actual performance and results.\nDisclosures: My firm, Cambrian AI Research, is fortunate to have many, if not most, semiconductor firms as our clients, including NVIDIA, Intel, IBM, Qualcomm, Blaize Graphcore, Synopsys and Tenstorrent . We have no investment positions in any of the companies mentioned in this article.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

With 10x the ray tracing performance of the GeForce GTX 1060, and double the rasterized performance, the new GeForce RTX 3060 offers previous-gen gamers a massive upgrade that\u2019ll get them playing the latest and greatest games with fast frame rates, high fidelity graphics, and game-changing features like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 has the power to dazzle you with immersive ray-traced effects in Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Watch Dogs: Legion, and many other titles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe venerable GeForce GTX 1060 is the most popular graphics card on Steam, having offered users years of high quality 1080p gaming. Now, however, it\u2019s starting to show its age as the production values of the latest and greatest games continue to improve, demanding more and more from your GPU.\nFor example, gamers were playing Watch Dogs 2 with high settings at 60 frames per second on the GeForce GTX 1060, but with Watch Dogs: Legion, released last October, they only get 24 frames per second. And an even bigger change is underway: turn ray tracing on and these games become unplayable on the GeForce GTX 1060. Furthermore, the GeForce GTX 1060 lacks the latest enhancements and features of the newest GPUs; features that can improve your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the GeForce RTX 3060, which brings the power of Ampere, our 2nd Generation RTX architecture, to every gamer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the GeForce RTX 3060, which brings the power of Ampere, our 2nd Generation RTX architecture, to every gamer. Here\u2019s what the press think about this new entry into the GeForce RTX 30 Series family:\n\nReview\nReview\nReview\nReview\nReview\nReview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Features and Benefits\nHaving been built using the same NVIDIA Ampere Architecture as the rest of the GeForce RTX 30 Series, the new GeForce RTX 3060 offers all the same advancements, benefits and features, improving your gaming, live streaming, content creation, and work.\n2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores give you the hardware to run the latest ray-traced titles with solid performance. 3rd Generation Tensor Cores power NVIDIA DLSS to boost frame rates in ray-traced and rasterized games.\n NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency in competitive multiplayer games, helping get shots off faster, which can make all the difference between success and defeat. NVIDIA Broadcast uses Tensor Cores and AI to enhance your live streaming and conference calls with near-magical noise removal, virtual green screens, and more features that transform your space into a home studio. And the GeForce RTX 3060 also includes our initial support for Resizable BAR on desktop GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the complete lowdown on the GeForce RTX 3060\u2019s capabilities, head here.

[\u2026] RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent.\nSimply put, Nvidia will try to detect the code you\u2019re running, and purposefully \u2013 but not secretly, given its public announcement \u2013 take out what amounts to \u201cdenial of service\u201d (DoS) actions against software it thinks is trying to do Ethereum calculations on the GPU.\nIf you want to do cryptomining, says Nvidia, you need to buy a different product:\nTo address the specific needs of Ethereum mining, we\u2019re announcing the NVIDIA CMP [Cryptocurrency Mining Processor] product line for professional mining. CMP products, which don\u2019t do graphics, are [\u2026 ]optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. They don\u2019t meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and thus don\u2019t impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.\nWhat about Bitcoin?\nIf you\u2019re a cryptocoin enthusiast, you might be wondering why Nvidia is focused here on Ethereum (and its associated cryptocurrency Ether, or ETH) instead of the current media darling of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC).\nAfter all, BTC calculations can be accelerated enormously with GPUs, just like ETH calculations.\nHowever, Bitcoin mining can be accelerated even more dramatically by using special-purpose chips built for the sole purpose of mining, so many BTC mining consortiums splash out on custom mining hardware instead of buying in general-purpose GPUs.\nThat\u2019s because BTC depends almost entirely on computing SHA-256 cryptographic hashes over and over again, starting with a randomly chosen value each time.\nEthereum calculations, however, currently use a weird mix of several different hashes, some cryptographic and others simply basic bit-stirring hashes, based on inputs drawn pseudo-randomly from a enormous pseudo-randomly generated pool of data known as the dataset.\nThis dataset needs recomputing every few days, takes up gigabytes of memory, and needs to be directly accessible in RAM throughout all your mining calculations.\nThat\u2019s because the ETH algorithm, currently known as Ethash but often referred to by its original and much cooler name of Dagger-Hashimoto, was specifically designed to make it difficult to compute quickly on special-purpose hardware.\nAny dedicated Ethereum mining hardware would not only need to include customised and accelerated hash calculating chips that could outperform your GPU, but also need to be based on a better performing motherboard with better memory management hardware and faster RAM than your gaming rig.\nWhat about cryptojacking?\nReports we\u2019ve seen suggest that Nvidia\u2019s anti-crypto drivers work by detecting memory usage that looks like a Dagger-Hashimoto computation, which needs to follow unusual but unavoidable memory access patterns, and cutting the speed of ETH hashing in half.\nSadly, this isn\u2019t likely to discourage cryptojackers \u2013 the name given to cybercriminals who implant malware that uses your computer to mine cryptocoins for them without permission.\nEven though these new Nvidia drivers will halve the earning rate of the cybercriminals, the crooks aren\u2019t paying for the electricity (you are!), so any unlawfully mined cryptcoins are still essentially \u201cfree money\u201d for them.\nWe\u2019re also wondering just how long it will take for unofficial patches to appear for Nvidia\u2019s drivers in order to bypass the \u201cDagger-detector\u201d slowdown code.\nHacking the Nvidia drivers would break their digital signatures, but on your own Windows computer you can load modified and unsigned drivers easily enough.\n\nShare this:MastodonBlueskyRedditLinkedInMoreTumblrPocketPrintEmail \n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout the Author\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nPaul Ducklin \n\nPaul Ducklin is a passionate security proselytiser.

Maybe they\u2019ll decide to release a line of neural network accelerators and then update their video drivers to block use of a GPU for that as well.\nIt\u2019s just another example of big tech deciding that they will have the final say of what software you are allowed to run on the hardware you bought from them, and it should bother everybody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllureana\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n22 February 2021 at 10:09 pm\n\n\nDid you READ the article?

Comments here so far, however, seem to suggest that quite a lot of keen gamers will be happy to forego the mining in return for gaming cards that are easier and cheaper to get hold of\u2026\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnonymous\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n24 February 2021 at 2:03 am\n\n\nIt does give a good return even in California pricing.

We\u2019re now ~6 months past the release of the RTX 30XX cards and it\u2019s still near impossible to find one at MSRP.\nNo, what they did is ensure that these mining-specific cards are going in the trash when they are no longer useful for the miners since they can\u2019t be re-sold on the 2nd hand market, which is what happens now when miners use Gaming cards.  Patient gamers can wait a bit and score a really good deal on a used card, and any miners who know their stuff typically undervolt their cards to lower heat generation and power usage, so those cards typically are still very good.   \nTrust me, Nvidia is not that altruistic, they don\u2019t give a shit about gamers, they only care about their stock price and now all they\u2019ve done is destroy the 2nd hand GPU market, forcing gamers to buy new cards instead of getting used ones.  They saw what happened when crypto crashed a few years back and miners dumped their cards to the 2nd hand market and everyone bought high end GTX 10XX series cards cheap instead of buying the shiny new RTX 20XX series cards that were priced stupidly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllureana\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n22 February 2021 at 10:06 pm\n\n\nThey are caring FOR the gamers by blocking the cryptominers from sucking up all the gaming cards and offering cryptominers DIFFERENT cards for their uses.

Those are extraordinarily hard to come up with, yet some jailbreaks, once perfected, can be deployed at will even by people who aren\u2019t technical at all.\nAnyway, for all we know, the cryptomining community, and perhaps the machine learning scene, may warm (if you will pardon the pun) to these new CMPs that Nvidia is talking about. If Nvidia is to be believed, the CMPs will needed fewer components, because they won\u2019t need any circuitry specific to graphics and graphical displays, and therefore they will be more compact and cooler to run.\nOf course, if Ethereum\u2019s move away from proof of work (\u201cdo lots of pointless competitive calculations while approving transactions to make the blockchain secure\u201d) to proof of stake (\u201cput up cryptocurrency of your own and be prepared to get fined if you make a mistake or cheat, in order to keep the blockchain honest\u201d) should succeed, then the use of Dagger-Hashimoto will subside anyway, and Ethereum miners won\u2019t be the ones that Nvidia need to guard against.\nHowever, even if what is known as Ethereum 2.0 works out entirely smoothly, the shift from competitive miners who mine when they want to, to staked-up validators who are paid to provide high availability and accuracy, seems unlikely to be less than two or three years away\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIslam Ghunym\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n22 February 2021 at 11:49 am\n\n\nNvidia thinks that we are stupid and trying to troll us with this announcement.\nNvidia said: \u201cThey don\u2019t meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and thus don\u2019t impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.\u201d EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE BOTH SILICON PRODUCTS\nHow could these products be different than RTX 3000 gaming card!!!. Each silicon has a potential to be a gaming card or anything else. We are suffering from WW shortages in silicon products that even car manufacturing effected and Nvidia is trying to troll us saying that by releasing CMP mining cards which are made from \u201csilicon\u201d that the world suffer from shortages in it instead of making more RTX 3000 stock is not going to effect GPU availability. HOW THE F*** COULD THAT NOT EFFECT GPU AVAILABILITY.\nThis announcement could be in no way beneficial for either gamers or miners. This announcement only helps Nvidia to earn more from the situations of shortages and high demands.\nThe new lineup is going to replace a huge amount of gaming cards availability by the time Nvidia get enough stock. they want to make sure that miners won\u2019t be able to sell their used mining cards to gamers so that gamers still suffer being unable to buy a card unless there are a brand new stock GPUs which goes to Nvidia being the only one who earn from selling not miners who will be forced to throw away their CMP mining cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul Ducklin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n22 February 2021 at 12:50 pm\n\n\nErrr, you seem to feel very strongly about this\u2026 but as to your suggestion that CMP cards and RTX gaming cards must be the same \u201cbecause they\u2019re silicon\u201d, isn\u2019t that a bit like saying all laptops and servers must be the same because they have CPUs and RAM?\nFor one, CMP cards don\u2019t need to be able to generate display output, which cuts out a bunch of components to start with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJ, Riley Castine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n22 February 2021 at 12:16 pm\n\n\nSo, a company using software to cripple the safe usability of the hardware?

However, if I need to purchase separate hardware for Folding@Home, I will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul Ducklin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n28 February 2021 at 5:24 pm\n\n\nAccording to Nvidia, these changes are not retrospective, so existing cards and drivers won\u2019t change their behaviour anyway, even if the behaviour of the Folding@Home algorithms were misidentified as \u201cEthereum-like\u201d by the cryptomining detector.

Wired headsets require high-powered graphics workstations, and a solution to prevent you from tripping over the wires. Many room-scale headsets require two external peripherals (or \u2018light towers\u2019) to be installed so the headset can position itself in a room. These setups can take days to tune, and need resetting if the light towers are moved.\nWith the release of the Oculus Quest, users of virtual reality were delighted with a wireless, room-scale headset with dual hand tracking. They could enjoy VR without worrying about light towers or a high-powered graphics workstation. However, because the Quest was battery powered, it used an inherently low-powered central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU). As a result, VR content had to be simplified to run on the Quest. This prevented customers from using the Quest for the most demanding graphics experiences, such as Computer Aided Design (CAD) review, or playing games such as Half-Life: Alyx.\nCustomers were faced with a difficult choice: expensive, complicated setups, or reduced-fidelity experiences.\nIn this blog post, we show you how to stream a full-fidelity VR experience from a computer on AWS to a wireless headset such as the Quest.\nOverview of architecture\nArchitecture diagram updated March 12, 2021\nNVIDIA CloudXR takes NVIDIA\u2019s experience in GPU encoding and decoding, and streams pixels to a remotely connected VR headset. By doing this, the rendering and compute requirements of visually intensive applications take place on a remote server instead of a local headset. This makes mobile headsets work with any application, regardless of their visual complexity and density.\n\nTo provide global scalability,\u00a0 NVIDIA announced the CloudXR platform will be available on G4 and P3 EC2 instances. It provides the following benefits:\n\nAt a global scale, customers can stream remote AR/VR experiences from Regions that are close them.\nIt enables centrally managed and deployed software experiences on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Previously these required physical transportation and implementation of devices and server hardware.\nLastly, IT administrators can now centrally manage content that may be sensitive or require frequent changes.\n\nWalkthrough\nUsing CloudXR on AWS requires EC2 instances with NVIDIA GPUs (that is, the P3 or G4 instance types) running within your virtual private cloud (VPC). The instance must be network accessible to a remote CloudXR client running on a VR headset. Connections are 1:1, meaning that each CloudXR client is connected to a dedicated EC2 instance. If needs require multiple CloudXR clients, you can deploy multiple EC2 instances.\nNote that the process outlined is accurate as of January 2021. CloudXR, and X Reality (XR) overall, is rapidly changing. Consult the latest information about CloudXR from NVIDIA. Using CloudXR within your AWS account requires you setup P3 or G4 EC2 instances, as you would within an Amazon VPC. You must also add a security group that allows the ports required for CloudXR communication. These specific ports can be found in the CloudXR documentation, available from NVIDIA.\nWe have created a CloudFormation template that deploys an EC2 instance with CloudXR configured for reference, linked in the prerequisites. Because it makes reference to a private AMI, it must be shared with your account in order to deploy successfully. If you\u2019re interested in using this template, contact your AWS Account team.\nPrerequisites\nThe following steps describe how to configure the EC2 instance manually. CloudXR streaming requires using a connection other than Windows RDP to connect to the remote EC2 instance. We use NICE DCV, which is provided at no cost to EC2 instances for remote connectivity.\nFor this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites:\n\nAn AWS account\nThe NVIDIA CloudXR SDK from NVIDIA\nPermissions to create G4 or P3 EC2 instances\nA VR headset\n\nDeploy CloudXR Server onto Amazon EC2\nIt\u2019s important to note the steps outlined are for configuring a G4 instance. If you\u2019d prefer to use a P3 instance, manually deploy your P3 instance and install NICE DCV as described in the documentation.\n\nLog into your AWS Account and navigate to the AWS Marketplace to install an EC2 instance with NICE DCV configured.\nCreate a new security group during deployment that matches the CloudXR port settings and apply it to your instance. Consult the CloudXR documentation for the latest port settings.\nWait 5 minutes for everything to initialize properly. Make note of the issues public IP address (or attach an Elastic IP address to the instance).\nNavigate to https://<IP-OF-INSTANCE>:8443 to connect to NICE DCV web-browser client. b.Use the credentials created during EC2 initialization to Log in\n\n\nNICE DCV login screen on Web Browser Client\n5. Once logged into your EC2 instance, install SteamVR and CloudXR onto the remote EC2 instance. SteamVR is used as an OpenVR/XR proxy between your VR application and CloudXR. CloudXR is used to stream the SteamVR experience to a remote CloudXR Client.\n\nInstall SteamVR\u00a0\nInstall CloudXR\n\n6. Verify installation of the CloudXR plugin into SteamVR by navigating to the Manage Add-ons page within the Advanced Settings option. Make sure it lists CloudXRRemoteHMD as an addon and is set to ON.\n\nVerification of CloudXR Installation\n7. Add an allow entry to the Windows Firewall Entry for VRServer.exe. This allows SteamVR to use the CloudXR to stream properly. By default this file is located at %ProgramFiles% (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\bin\\win64\\vrserver.exe\\\n\n\u00a0\n8. Install a CloudXR client onto your VR headset. If using an android-powered headset (that is, the Oculus Quest), you can use the sample APK within the CloudXR SDK\n9. Select Finish.\nConnect to your CloudXR Server and start streaming\n1. Launch SteamVR on your remote EC2 instance by logging into your Steam account or configuring a no-login link following the Installation/use of SteamVR in an environment without internet access instructions.\n2. When loaded, it will report a headset cannot be detected. This is OK.\n\nSteamVR will display Headset not Detected\u2014this is OK.\n3. Within your Client headset, load the CloudXR Client application you recently installed.\n4. Once connected, the headset will start display the SteamVR \u201cvoid\u201d. You also should see a view of your headset if SteamVR mirroring is enabled. The status box on the SteamVR server application will show a headset and 2 controllers attached as well.\n\n\nSteamVR \u201cVoid\u201d and Headset Connected icons\n\n5. Congratulations. You\u2019re now connected to an AWS EC2 instance using NVIDIA CloudXR! Any VR application you now run on the EC2 server that uses OpenVR will be streamed to your VR headset!\nCleaning up\nEC2 instances are billed only when they\u2019re being used. You\u2019ll want to make sure to stop your instance or shut it down when you are finished with your session. Terminating your instance is not necessary. You will also want to review your specific network requirements to connect to AWS and discuss this with relevant internal stake-owners or teams. Even though the EC2 instance has an AWS security group applied to it, production networks are complex and unique.\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we showed how to stream a full-fidelity VR experience from a computer on AWS to a wireless headset. Having the ability to remotely connect to GPU-powered servers to run graphic workloads is not necessarily new, but connecting to a remote server with a VR headset and having full interactivity certainly is. With this architecture, you realize the benefits of CloudXR combined with the agility and scalability available on AWS. It becomes less challenging to manage content played on VR headsets because content doesn\u2019t reside on the VR headset\u2014it lives on the EC2 server.\nDeploying to any AWS region where GPU instances are available allows you to offer CloudXR to your users at global scale. \u00a0As networks get faster and closer through services like AWS Outposts and AWS Wavelength, remote VR work will become possible for more customers. We\u2019re excited to see what new workloads come next as this way of working grows.\nField Notes provides hands-on technical guidance from AWS Solutions Architects, consultants, and technical account managers, based on their experiences in the field solving real-world business problems for customers.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLeo Chan\nLeo Chan is the Worldwide Tech Lead for Spatial Computing at AWS.

And it\u2019s certainly been worth the wait, writes Greg Corke.\n\nNvidia first announced its new Nvidia RTX A6000 workstation GPU back in October 2020. But with delays, we\u2019ve been eagerly awaiting its arrival.\nAnd now it\u2019s finally here \u2013 well, nearly. UK firm Scan is taking pre-orders for the PNY Nvidia RTX A6000 from 3 March and sent us a sample to review inside its new 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T AMD Ryzen Threadripper workstation, which we review in full here.\nTuned for visualisation workflows, the Nvidia RTX A6000 (A for Ampere) is Nvidia\u2019s second generation RTX GPU. With an emphasis on hardware-based ray tracing, it promises to deliver more than double the GPU rendering performance of its predecessor, the Turing-based Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000. And, of course, it also offers a significant boost for 3D graphics, VR, and AI workflows. And all for \u00a33,730 + VAT.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 is the first workstation GPU to be built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture, and also the first to support PCIe Gen 4. With double the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 3, it should mean data can move in and out of the GPU quicker, but it won\u2019t benefit all workflows. PCIe Gen 4 is currently only available in workstations with the latest AMD CPUs.\nWhat no Quadro?\nThe observant among you will have noticed that the Nvidia RTX A6000 is missing something. Yes, after 17 years, it appears that Nvidia is retiring its Quadro brand.\nFor someone who has written about Nvidia professional GPUs since the early 2000s, it\u2019s hard to get used to this change. And, it would seem, Nvidia is struggling too. For the October launch, product photos were sent out with \u2018Nvidia Quadro RTX A6000\u2019 in the file name, which suggests a last minute re-branding.\nBut the Nvidia RTX A6000 is certainly a Quadro card in everything but name. It has certified drivers for pro applications, renowned reliability, ECC memory and plenty of niche features for pro visualisation, such as stereo and Frame Lock for viz clusters. There\u2019s also support for Nvidia virtual GPU (vGPU) software, which allows a workstation to be repurposed into multiple high-performance virtual workstation instances.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nWith 48 GB of VRAM, the Nvidia RTX A6000 has the most memory of any professional GPU \u2013 on par with the Quadro RTX 8000, and double that of the Quadro RTX 6000.\nThis is particularly relevant for those working with high poly count models and very high resolution textures in GPU renderers or real time visualisation / VR. But more on this later.\nWhat\u2019s more, two Nvidia RTX A6000s can be bridged together with an NVLink adapter to create a memory pool of 96 GB. However, sharing geometry between two GPUs can come with a significant performance hit.\nBeauty and the beast\nNvidia\u2019s product design team has really gone to town on the Nvidia RTX A6000 and the card is a thing of beauty, with a minimal angular design and black mirror finish. NVLink, Stereo and Sync connectors are all hidden away behind discrete panels.\nThe board is rated at 300W, so you\u2019ll need a fairly hefty PSU in your workstation. It gets its power from a special 8-pin connector, that is connected to two standard 8-pin PSU connectors via an adapter. It is cooled by two fans, top and bottom. There are four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors nestled below a heat sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFour DisplayPorts\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHidden connectors\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTop fan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBottom fan\n\t\t\t\t\n\nTesting the Nvidia RTX A6000\nAEC Magazine put the PNY Nvidia RTX A6000 through a series of real-world application benchmarks, both GPU rendering and real time visualisation.\nThe GPU is simply overkill for current generation CAD and BIM software, so we didn\u2019t do any testing in that regard. However, it\u2019s important to note that it will still be certified for the likes of Revit and ArchiCAD, which is useful if you plan to use those kinds of applications alongside more viz focused tools like Enscape, V-Ray and Lumion.\nThe full spec of the Scan 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T test machine can be seen below.\nYou can read a full review here.\nScan 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T\n\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X (32C/64T) (3.7GHz \u2013 4.5GHz)\nGraphics card: Nvidia RTX A6000 (48 GB) (461.09 driver)\nMemory: 128 GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600MHz DDR4\nSystem drive: 2TB WD Black SN850 PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD\nStorage drive:\u00a0 4TB Samsung 860 EVO SSD\nMotherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX TRX40-E\nCase: Fractal Design Define 7\nCPU cooler: Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360\nPower supply: Corsair RM1000i \u2013 80PLUS Gold\nOperating system: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit\nPrice \u00a37,500 + VAT \n\nFor comparison, we used historic data from the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 GPU (457.09 driver), tested in a Lenovo ThinkStation P620 workstation with AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX CPU and 128GB RAM, as well as a Quadro RTX 4000.\n\n\u00a0\nRendering with the Nvidia RTX A6000\n\nGPU rendering has now reached a stage where it is becoming ubiquitous. While renderers built into CAD and BIM applications still tend to rely on the CPU, most of the major design viz focused renderers now offer a GPU rendering capability.\nThis includes traditional ray trace renderers such as Chaos Group V-Ray, Luxion KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize, all of which can take full advantage of Nvidia RTX technology, including the dedicated Ray Tracing cores and Tensor cores for AI denoising.\nThen there\u2019s real time ray tracing tools like Unreal Engine and the new Chaos Vantage (formerly Project Lavina), which works with V-Ray scenes. (N.B. you can currently pick up a free one year licence if you register before June 2021).\nAs a side note, it\u2019s important to check that your chosen GPU rendering tool supports the new Nvidia RTX A6000. Users of Solidworks Visualize 2021, for example, will have to wait until Service Pack 3 in April 2021 before they can take advantage of any \u2018Ampere\u2019 GPU.\nChaos Group V-Ray\n\nV-Ray is arguably the No. 1 physically-based rendering tool for architectural visualisation. We put the Nvidia RTX A6000 through its paces using the new, freely downloadable, V-Ray 5 benchmark, which has dedicated tests for Nvidia CUDA GPUs, Nvidia RTX GPUs, as well as CPUs.\nThe results were extremely compelling, with the Nvidia RTX A6000 showing itself to be 2.32 faster than the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 in the CUDA test and 1.85 times faster in the RTX test. Considering this is just a generation on generation comparison, it\u2019s a phenomenal leap in performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nLuxion KeyShot\nKeyShot, a CPU rendering stalwart, is a relative newcomer to the world of GPU rendering. But it\u2019s one of the slickest implementations we\u2019ve seen, allowing users to switch between CPU and GPU rendering at the click of a button.\nIn the Keyshot 10 benchmark, part of the free KeyShot Viewer, we saw similar results to V-Ray. The Nvidia RTX A6000 outperformed the Quadro RTX 6000 by a factor of 1.97.\n\n\n\nGPU memory \u2013 why 48 GB?\nOne aspect of technology that has long held back GPU rendering is the limited amount of GPU memory available on each card. When a scene, including geometry, materials and lighting, doesn\u2019t fit entirely into GPU memory, the render can fail, slow down (if it runs \u2018out of core\u2019 using system memory), or simply fall back to the CPU.\nThere are many established workarounds to help users ensure a dataset fits entirely within GPU memory \u2013 such as resizing or optimising textures, simplifying or stripping out geometry, or rendering in separate passes \u2013 but all of this takes time to prep. What the user really wants is not to have to worry about GPU memory at all.\nWith 48 GB, the Nvidia RTX A6000 is arguably the GPU that will enable this. And while it\u2019s not the first to offer that much memory (the Quadro RTX 8000 also came with 48 GB) it\u2019s the first to do so at a sub \u00a34,000 price point.\nOf course, for some workflows 48 GB will be overkill. However, for those pushing the boundaries of realism, using very hi-fidelity textures (such as those captured from real-life scans) or colossal engineering accurate datasets, it should open up a wealth of opportunities.\nLuxion, for example, has in the past reported ray tracing a KeyShot scene with 1.37 billion unique triangles using two Quadro RTX 5000 cards and NVLink for a combined 32 GB of memory.\nIndeed, despite its designer-friendly workflows, KeyShot is doing a lot to break new ground. A new feature in KeyShot 10 called RealCloth 2.0 allows users to generate visually accurate woven materials using thread geometry. However, this can be incredibly memory hungry when using the option to represent each individual thread as a geometric entity, even with relatively small scenes.\nPreviously, we\u2019ve explored this feature in our sister publication DEVELOP3D. Using a 16 GB Quadro RTX 5000, however, we quickly ran out of memory, with the scene falling back to the CPU to render. However, things were entirely different with the Nvidia RTX A6000.\nWith 48 GB to play with we were able to much better match the scale of the weave in KeyShot to that of the physical fabric. As you will see from the images below, the difference in accuracy, in terms of how the material is represented, is quite incredible.\nOf course, RealCloth 2.0 is quite a niche example. However, there will certainly be some architectural or automotive visualisers out there that would benefit from 48 GB (or even 96 GB with two RTX A6000s over NVlink) now or in the future. You\u2019ll know who you are.\nKeyShot 10 \u2013 RealCloth 2.0 with coarse weave (uses 6.8 GB / 48 GB VRAM)\nKeyShot 10 \u2013 RealCloth 2.0 with much finer weave (uses 38.2 GB / 48 GB VRAM)\n\nReal time 3D with the Nvidia RTX A6000\n\nWhile GPU rendering is a major play for the Nvidia RTX A6000, real time 3D using OpenGL and DirectX continues to be a very important part of architectural visualisation, with applications including TwinMotion, Lumion, Enscape, Unreal Engine and others. And, of course, the boundaries between real time 3D and ray tracing continue to blur.\nTo test frame rates we used FRAPS in combination with a 3DConnexion SpaceMouse to ensure the models moved in a consistent way every time. We only tested at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution. At FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution this level of GPU simply isn\u2019t stressed enough.\nEnscape\n\nEnscape is a real-time viz and VR tool for architects that uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality graphics in the viewport. Enscape has used elements of ray tracing in its software for some time. Newer versions of the software are RTX-enabled, so full ray tracing can be toggled on and off.\nFor our tests, Enscape provided a large architectural scene of a museum and its surrounding area. At 7.5GB, the GPU memory requirements of this model are relatively high, but Enscape models can take up much more and this is a drop in the ocean for the Quadro RTX A6000.\nIn terms of performance, the Nvidia RTX A6000 delivered a phenomenal 53 frames per second (FPS) for an incredibly smooth experience. This is around 1.39 times faster than the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 and 2.79 times faster than the Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000.\n\n\n\nAutodesk VRED Professional \n\nAutodesk VRED Professional is an automotive-focused 3D visualisation, virtual prototyping and VR tool. It uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality visuals in the viewport. It offers several levels of real time anti-aliasing (AA), which is important for automotive styling, as it smooths the edges of body panels. However, AA calculations use a lot of GPU resources, both in terms of processing and memory. We tested our automotive model with AA set to \u2018off\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018ultra-high\u2019.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 was significantly faster than the Quadro RTX 6000 delivering between 1.46 and 1.50 more frames per second in all of our tests. Most notably, the card delivered a very smooth 25.15 FPS when AA set to \u2018ultra high\u2019, which is unheard for a model of this complexity. This is 2.97 times faster than a Quadro RTX 4000.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nNvidia has put a huge effort into developing its hardware-based ray tracing technology and it\u2019s now really starting to see the fruits.\nIt\u2019s quite incredible to think it has managed to double the GPU rendering performance, generation on generation (Turing to Ampere). And, with a 1.4 to 1.5 boost, it\u2019s hardly dragging its heels in real time 3D.\nRendering has become the big battleground for hardware manufacturers and, with the 64-core AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU, competition between GPU and CPU has never been so fierce.\nCPUs have always had the lead when it comes to addressable memory and there\u2019s an ongoing debate about rendering performance vs accuracy. But with 48 GB per GPU, and the ability to scale up cards as and when required (the new Supermicro SuperWorkstation 5014A-TT can support up to four Nvidia RTX A6000s), the argument for GPU rendering has never been more compelling.\nIn many ways the biggest competition for the Nvidia RTX A6000 is from Nvidia itself. The consumer-focused Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 should offer roughly the same performance for one third of the price. It does have half the memory (24GB) but with support for NVLink, two can be linked together to create a virtual 48 GB render resource. The downside is \u2013 it\u2019s currently nigh on impossible to get hold of a board and prices are inflated.\nOf course, for some firms it will always need to be Quadro all the way. Or should we say Quadro in features, warranty, reliability and certification, but not in name. It\u2019s going to take some time to get used to the rebranding.\nRelated articles:Matching workstations to real-world workflowsEnscape 2.6Nvidia Omniverse expands with better rendering, Teams integration and moreIgloo enhances Shared VR CylinderREVIEW: MSI WS60 mobile workstationVideo: NXT BLD 2019 \u2013 Cobus Bothma, Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF)Review: concept collaboration with ArkioQ&A: IMSCAD talks virtual workstations\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Nvidia and AMD have seen fit to ensure members of the press have access to new graphics cards ahead of their retail launches, which has placed us in a comfy position to praise each of their latest-gen offerings: good prices, tons of power.\nThen we see our comment sections explode with unsatisfied customers wondering how the heck to actually buy them. I've since softened my tune on these pre-launch previews.\nI say all of this up front about the Nvidia RTX 3060, going on sale today, February 25 (at 12pm ET, if you're interested in entering the day-one sales fray) because it's the first Nvidia GPU I've tested in a while to make my cautious stance easier. The company has been on a tear with its RTX 3000-series of cards in terms of sheer consumer value, particularly compared to equivalent prior-gen cards (the $1,499 RTX 3090 notwithstanding), but the $329 RTX 3060 (not to be confused with December's 3060 Ti) doesn't quite pull the same weight. It's a good 1080p card with 1440p room to flex, but it's not the next-gen jump in its Nvidia price category we've grown accustomed to.\nPlus, unlike other modern Nvidia cards, this one lacks one particular backup reason to invest as heavily: cryptomining potential. (And that's intentional on Nvidia's part.)\nHopefully your plate's better than mine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The EVGA RTX 3060, as posed next to the larger RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition.\n              \n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe EVGA RTX 3060, as posed next to the larger RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      RTX 3060 glamour shot.\n              \n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 3060 glamour shot.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      EVGA's version opts for a flat, square back, as opposed to some sort of fancy cooling routing through a more carved or styled board.\n              \n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVGA's version opts for a flat, square back, as opposed to some sort of fancy cooling routing through a more carved or styled board.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 3060 glamour shot.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nEVGA's version opts for a flat, square back, as opposed to some sort of fancy cooling routing through a more carved or styled board.\n\n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      In order to install my review GPU into my testing rig, I had to remove this mounting plate.\n              \n                      Sam Machkovech\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      A sampling of other RTX 3060 cards being sold by OEMs starting today.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Little 3060.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      White 3060.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Larger white 3060.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Garish 3060.\n              \n                      Nvidia\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of today's review, Nvidia provided Ars Technica with an EVGA version of the RTX 3060, since this model won't receive an Nvidia \"Founders Edition\" label (the first for any mainline RTX card). This 3060 variant keeps things simple in terms of construction, with two traditional, bottom-mounted fans and none of the \"passthrough\" fan construction found in Nvidia's FEs, and it isn't advertised with any particular supercharged cooling options. Despite the lack of clever fan construction, this model runs cool and quiet at stock clocks, never topping out above 65\u00b0C at full load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for my testing rig, however, I had to take the unusual step of unscrewing EVGA's mounting plate so that it wouldn't block my ability to insert the GPU into my case. In my anecdotal case, this was the first time I've ever had to do this with a GPU I've reviewed or tested in my seven years at Ars (though admittedly, that has mostly been with Nvidia's and AMD's stock models, as opposed to a wide variety of OEMs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Spec table for various 2060- and 3060-branded Nvidia options.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Spec table for various 2060- and 3060-branded Nvidia options.\n\n          \n\n\n\nThankfully, I was still able to stably situate the EVGA GPU into my machine for testing purposes, at which point I began comparing it to the nearest-performance GPU I had in my possession: the RTX 2060 Super, released in July 2019 for $399. That model was a much-needed upgrade to the tepid RTX 2060, and it arrived as a good enough option for gamers who wanted robust 1080p performance across the board, along with plenty of 1440p options\u00a0and\u00a0a reasonable way to dip toes into the worlds of ray tracing and Nvidia's proprietary deep-learning super sampling (DLSS).\nIn my testing, I found that the \"$70 cheaper\" GPU (as priced in a magical, scalper-free marketplace) generally landed neck and neck with the July 2019 card, as opposed to blowing away the older model. This appears to boil down to the give-and-take nature of the two cards' spec tables. The RTX 3060 has over 150 percent of the 2060 Super's CUDA cores, along with 150 percent of the GDDR6 VRAM and a slight lead in core clocks. But its VRAM is definitely not the same kind, downgraded from a 256-bit bus to a 192-bit one with lower memory bandwidth. Plus, comparing each card's proprietary \"RTX\" potential by counting tensor cores and RT cores is tricky, since the RTX 3060 has fewer cores than the RTX 2060 Super in both counts, albeit \"newer\" generations of each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The RTX 3060 and the older RTX 2060 Super are neck and neck throughout this benchmark collection.\n          \n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 3060 and the older RTX 2060 Super are neck and neck throughout this benchmark collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This is a particularly punishing benchmark, meant to show percentage differences between models.

The older card enjoyed a performance lead as high as 6.5 percent in a straightforward GPU muscle test (\"Fire Strike Ultra\"), and it even bested the newer card, however marginally, in a head-to-head 3DMark ray-tracing showdown.\nWith this knowledge in hand, I grabbed an Nvidia benchmark table provided to members of the press, which aligned with most of my other tests\u2014albeit with results that were a bit more charitable to the newer RTX 3060 than my own. Where Nvidia found that The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 (ray tracing disabled) were \"dead even\" between the 3060 and the 2060 Super as tested in 4K resolution, my personal, repeatable benchmarks gave the older card a lead. Grand Theft Auto V, which runs a scant 2.9 percent faster on the 2060 Super in 4K, doesn't appear in Nvidia's provided benchmark table.\nBut the rest of my tests did show that the RTX 3060 generally clawed ahead in gaming performance. Many of the best results came when a given benchmark included ray-tracing effects, yet even as a pure, old-school rasterization card, it often enjoyed a noticeable 9 percent lead on non-RT tests.\n\nResolving resolution, with the help of DLSS\nAs a reminder, Ars Technica focuses its tests on 4K performance, since GPU benchmarks that dip below 4K resolutions do less to clarify the sheer power a GPU will provide to\u00a0your system. Sure enough, those gains will all likely look even better as you drop raw resolution counts on your preferred PC into 1440p territory. Still, as my benchmarks demonstrate, this isn't necessarily the card you want to throw at 4K resolutions, unless you're content with capping frame rates at 30fps (or playing settings whack-a-mole to get to roughly 45fps, which will look steady enough on variable refresh rate monitors on which 45fps is generally a cutoff for smoothness).\nThat processing reality makes this GPU's emphasis on 12GB of VRAM a bit fishy. So much VRAM makes sense if you're interested in 4K games with beefy add-on texture packs, meant to show off so many pixels, and I would have loved 12GB of VRAM on the bigger RTX 3000-series cards. But this is the case where a downgrade to 8GB, barely noticeable in 1440p games, would have made more sense on paper\u2014and makes us wonder whether Nvidia was forced into the 12GB fray due to COVID-19 production complications. (We've heard rumblings about smaller RAM capacities being harder to find at scale these days.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest build of Minecraft with ray tracing and DLSS upscaling to 4K enabled. This test ran at roughly 32fps; with the RTX 3060, you can enjoy similarly clean DLSS upscales to 1440p with ray tracing on and enjoy performance closer to 60fps.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The latest build of Minecraft with ray tracing and DLSS upscaling to 4K enabled. This test ran at roughly 32fps; with the RTX 3060, you can enjoy similarly clean DLSS upscales to 1440p with ray tracing on and enjoy performance closer to 60fps.\n\n          \n\n\n\nThe RTX 3060 also invites players to enjoy the incredible ecosystem that is DLSS, which has since proven a must-toggle option when pushing a game's graphics options to their limits. DLSS'\u00a0implementation across dozens of games has since sold us on Nvidia's sales pitch: that native signals can upscale from 1080p to 1440p with a remarkable amount of preserved clarity. It's not perfect, but DLSS'\u00a0balance between smudgy moments and surprisingly crisp details is almost always superior to a game's built-in temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) option, which usually comes with its own ghosting artifacts by default.\nThe exception remains Death Stranding, whose custom coding of the DLSS standard continues to poorly render \"organic\" visual elements like rain, foliage, and visible beads of water. At this point, we're convinced Kojima Productions has seen none of Ars' repeated complaints and will leave this issue unresolved\u2014which is a shame, because the game's PC version is otherwise a great example of how DLSS can neatly lift a game into a stable 60fps range.\nAdditionally, DLSS has yet to become a true industry standard, in spite of Nvidia's apparent \"go ahead and use it\" liberation of the tech for anyone who's interested. It's a welcome rendering bonus in compatible games, particularly the eye-opening RT implementation in Minecraft, and it's practically required to get Cyberpunk 2077 running at a certain threshold. But some of the PC industry's most demanding fare, particularly Ubisoft's open-world offerings, have yet to join the party; perhaps they're holding out for whatever upscaling mechanism AMD eventually rolls out for its RDNA 2 line of GPUs (which we're still waiting to hear news about).\nI point all of this out because it's easy for me to shrug my shoulders at DLSS after years of testing and scrutinizing it. You, on the other hand, may still be newly charmed. Anyone who has held off on upgrading their PC GPU until Nvidia's Ampere line got down to the sub-$400 level should look at the list Nvidia provides of compatible DLSS games and think about whether that sweetens the 1440p deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnproven mining pickaxe\nNvidia's last twist for the RTX 3060 comes with a rare performance downgrade (or \"nerf,\" if you will) for a particular use case: the mining of cryptocurrencies. Or, at least, one of them.\n\"RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent,\" the company announced in a blog post last week. This came alongside the announcement of an entirely new product line, the Nvidia\u00a0Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP), slated to launch in \"Q1 2021.\" Nvidia has thus far revealed specs for four discrete SKUs, but not prices, along with clarification that these devices will be designed with performance-minded engineering tricks, particularly the removal of video-out ports to make way for a different cooling airflow path.\nArs Technica covers a fair amount of cryptocurrency news, but as of this review, we have deliberately opted not to create content that teaches people how to get into cryptomining themselves. Among other things, the trend is not great for the environment. Still, since Nvidia has loudly acknowledged the practice by building a nerf into the GPU that we're holding in our hands, I thought I'd give the feature a quick test. After all, the drivers in question were only described as effective against Ethereum. What about other currencies?\nIn my case, I settled on vertcoin for two reasons: it has a convenient one-click mining app on multiple OSes, which includes a clear \"hashing rate\" figure that I can easily compare amongst GPUs; and for now, it's seemingly worthless. I mined for approximately 40 minutes in all while testing on four GPUs, and I have already deleted my digital \"haul,\" so if I've just trashed the next millions-strong dogecoin, so be it.\nMy findings were as follows, measured as vertcoins mined per hour:\n\nRTX 3080: 9.21 (1.55 MH/sec)\nRTX 3060 Ti: 7.21 (1.21 MH/sec)\nRTX 3060: 2.21 (372.13 kH/sec)\nRTX 2060 Super: 3.44 (623.16 kH/sec)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these tests included GPU downclocks, VRAM upclocks, and power-level adjustments (as tweaked within MSI Afterburner) to keep the GPUs in question operating at roughly 65\u00b0C, as I'm not trying to fry this hardware to make a few fake bucks. The exception came from the lowest performer on my list, the apparently nerfed RTX 3060, which I couldn't tweak to run any higher than 55\u00b0C, try as I might.\nTo be clear, this is a\u00a0painfully anecdotal example of how the brand-new RTX 3060 slots into the cryptomining ecosystem. What are the 3060's Ethereum rates? What about other cryptomining solutions that use wildly different algorithms\u2014and reportedly skirt Nvidia's driver-side solution? And how easy might it be to edit Nvidia's drivers (or repurpose older ones) to make the RTX 3060 pump out a few more vertcoin per hour? We can't say. But\u00a0something is going on with the RTX 3060 and its default Nvidia drivers, and based on specs, it stands to reason that this rate is half the GPU's actual mining capabilities.\nVerdict: It's fine! But...\nReally, the worst thing I can say about the RTX 3060 is that it's not as tantalizing a jump from the 2060 as other \"plus-1,000\" RTX cards have proven over the past six months. The powerful $799 RTX 3080 rendered the famously expensive RTX 2080 Ti moot, while the RTX 3070 showed up at a fair $499 price with a serious leg up on the 2070 Super (and was honestly comparable to the RTX 2080 Ti). Heck, the RTX 3060 Ti already compared well to the RTX 2060 Super, leaving this latest card in a funky comparison position.\nInstead, you have to peck through benchmarks and lists to find ideal examples of games where the newer card beats its 2060 Super predecessor... or make your peace with a less-astounding performance jump and a\u00a0possible\u00a0price savings, should we get a belated Christmas miracle in the form of stable GPU stock. We're not holding our breath, but if fewer drool-worthy specs and limited crypto performance change the scalping market for this GPU, that may be its own Christmas in February.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    EVGA / Nvidia\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    138 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

We obsess about new gaming features, new architectures, new games and tech. We designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamoring for more.\nYet NVIDIA GPUs are programmable. And users are constantly discovering new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.\nWith the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on Feb. 25, we\u2019re taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers.\nHalving Hash Rate\nRTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent.\nThat only makes sense. Our GeForce RTX GPUs introduce cutting-edge technologies \u2014 such as RTX real-time ray-tracing, DLSS AI-accelerated image upscaling technology, Reflex super-fast response rendering for the best system latency, and many more \u2014 tailored to meet the needs of gamers and those who create digital experiences.\nTo address the specific needs of Ethereum mining, we\u2019re announcing the NVIDIA CMP, or, Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, product line for professional mining.\nCMP products \u2014 which don\u2019t do graphics \u2014 are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. They don\u2019t meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and, thus, don\u2019t impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.\nFor instance, CMP lacks display outputs, enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed. CMPs also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency, which improves mining power efficiency.\nCreating tailored products for customers with specific needs delivers the best value for customers.

SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Woods Square has become the new landmark of Woodlands Regional Centre. It boasts of the first Grade A-like offices, latest F&B and retail offerings, connectivity to the neighbouring buildings and the Woodlands MRT station. The 99-year leasehold integrated, commercial development at Woodlands Central was completed last February and is jointly developed by property giant Far East Organization, its listed entity Far East Orchard, and Japanese developer Sekisui House.    The completion of Woods Square is a milestone in the development of Woodlands Regional Centre. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) It sits on a 199,874 sq ft plot of land and comprises four commercial towers that have a gross floor area of 699,557 sq ft, including about 53,820 sq ft of retail space. Grade A-like office units take up 90% of the available space while retail shops make up the remaining area. The retail mix includes a Superland Pre-school, an Anytime Fitness gym, and a variety of F&B options. Northern regional hub Woods Square is part of an overall plan to revitalise Woodlands Regional Centre. In December 2018, the government released a 2.75ha white site at Woodlands Avenue 2 for sale under the Reserve List. The white site at Woodlands Avenue is also located within Woodlands Central, the commercial node of Woodlands Regional Centre. The upcoming Woodlands North Coast, a mixed-use waterfront precinct that will include residential, industrial and business park spaces, also sits within the Woodlands Regional Centre.    Woods Square is well-positioned to offer Grade-A office spaces to companies seeking to open branch offices outside the CBD. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) In the future, Woodlands Regional Centre will form part of the Northern Agri-Tech and Food Corridor, running from Lim Chu Kang to Senoko in Sembawang. The area will include high-tech farms and food processing companies.  Woods Square is linked to two existing commercial developments, Woodlands Civic Centre and Causeway Point shopping mall. The developer says that by the end of 2Q2021, an underground pedestrian linkway will connect all three commercial developments to Woodlands MRT Interchange on the North-South Line and the Thomson-East Coast Line. Woods Square will also benefit from increased cross-border travel between Malaysia and Singapore when the Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) commences passenger service in five years. The 4km cross-border RTS link will connect passengers between the Singapore terminus in Woodlands North and Johor\u2019s Bukit Chagar station.   Story continues   The Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System is expected to facilitate more cross-border exchanges when passenger service commences in end-2026. The Singapore terminus is close to Woods Square at Woodlands North. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)The 2019 Master Plan laid down plans to turn Woodlands Regional Centre into a walkable, pedestrian-centric zone. The August 2020 Build-To-Order (BTO) exercise included a new 1,785-unit BTO development opposite Woodlands station called UrbanVilla @ Woodlands. The development comprises eight residential blocks ranging from 14 to 32 storeys.Existing residential neighbourhoods around Woods Square include the HDB towns at Admiralty, Woodgrove, Marsiling, and Woodlands.SOLO officeThe developers expect most companies taking up office space at Woods Square will utilise it as branch offices for employees living around Woodlands. There could also be some Malaysian companies that want prime office space that is closer to the Causeway.\"The future development of an agriculture-tech corridor in Woodlands could also see some of these businesses open front-facing offices for client servicing and sales teams, while remaining close to their factories,\" says Cheryl Huan, chief operating officer, sales & leasing group, Far East Organization.In response to these office demands, Woods Square features a new type of office layout called the Small Office Loft Office (SOLO) concept. There are 101 SOLO units that range from 495 sq ft to 1,800 sq ft and come with a furniture platform and a 5m-high ceiling.  The Small Office Loft Office (SOLO) concept is offered at Woods Square and targets smaller-sized enterprises. Units range from 495\u20131,800 sq ft. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)SOLO units are located in two office towers called SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 that are the only two blocks connected by a sky deck with amenities. All four office blocks are also connected by a linkway on the second floor.Grade-A office demandTypical office units are also available at the other two office towers which are called Tower 1 and Tower 2. Tower 1 comprises 365 office units that range in size from 549 sq ft to 5,339 sq ft, and it is the only block where non-SOLO office units can be purchased since office units in Tower 2 are only available for lease.According to the developer, 75% of the available office space at Tower 2 is currently occupied. Units in this building range from 1,378 sq ft to 9,849 sq ft and the average floor plate is about 22,000 sq ft. The average monthly rent starts from $5.90 psf.The office blocks for sale comprise Tower 1, SOLO 1, and SOLO 2 with 466 office units. But only 208 of these units have been launched for sale so far, with units ranging in size from 549 sq ft to 5,339 sq ft. Prices start from $1.04 million.  Most office tenants at Woods Square began to move into their new offices at the end of 2020 due to disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic. This is almost nine months after the development was completed in February 2020. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Overall, Woods Square has received relatively strong office demand and about 70% of the total available units in Tower 1, SOLO 1, and SOLO 2 have been sold, according to figures provided by the developer.\"Most office tenants were only able to start moving into their new office spaces at Woods Square at the end of 2020 due to disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic. These included the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d period and difficulties caused by split-team arrangements, while some of the retail shops are expected to finish fitting out their units by the end of 1Q2021,\" says Huan.  The roof deck over the top of SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 features a swimming pool, open-air pavilions and meeting spaces. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Far East Organization is one of the anchor tenants at Woods Square, and the property developer has taken up 73,200 sq ft across three floors in Tower 2. The company says it will be used as a satellite office, something the company says it had already been looking into before remote working became the default in Singapore.\"The company is making available some of its meeting rooms and the boardroom to tenants at Wood Square for a nominal fee. Booking these rooms can be done through the Woods Square mobile application, which also doubles up as the security pass to access the office tower,\" says Huan.Other anchor tenants at Woods Square include Qiren Organisation, an authorised representative of AIA Singapore, who has taken up the top two office floors in Tower 2, with total office space of about 36,000 sq ft. UOB Commercial Banking and Mitsubishi Materials Japan have also taken up office space at Woods Square.Green Mark Gold PlusWoods Square was designed by local architecture firm DP Architects. The glass exterior of the commercial blocks is broken up with regular pockets of greenery and landscaping, inspired by Woodland\u2019s past as a heavily forested area.A small grove of young rubber trees has also been planted in the garden at Tower 1 as a link to Woodlands\u2019 past as a rubber plantation estate.The architecture injects pockets of greenery throughout the office space and the public areas, such as landscaped terraces and corridors. The roof deck of the two SOLO office blocks also features an outdoor Sky Deck Bridge that connects both buildings. Facilities on the Sky Deck Bridge include meeting rooms, open-air pavilions, a gym, a swimming pool, and two lookout points.  The abundant greenery throughout the development, as well as sustainably conscious construction techniques, earned Woods Square the Green Mark Gold Plus award. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)The other two high-rise office towers also feature roof deck amenities including more open-air pavilions and gardens.The amount of greenery and landscaping on all the roof areas was one reason the building was conferred the Green Mark Gold Plus award in the non-residential building category in 2018 by the Building and Construction Authority.Other green features of the development that were commended included relatively high energy and water savings and sustainably sourced construction materials during its development.First-moverWoods Square stands to benefit from its first-mover advantage as the newest Grade-A office development in central Woodlands, catering to businesses who want a branch office in the northern region of Singapore.The overall take-up rate at Woods Square suggests that companies are willing to establish themselves early in a growth area. Far East Organization, for one, has reaped the benefits of being a first-mover in new areas.Being the first integrated commercial development with Grade-A quality office space in Woodlands Regional Centre bodes well for Woods Square, as more companies move to the area, creating more employment opportunities and resulting in more people moving north to live.Check out the latest listings near Woods Square, Woodlands Civic Centre, Woodlands MRT stationSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Investing in Tiong Bahru privatised flats: The allure and the pitfalls 999-year leasehold residential site in Kovan going for $18 mil Lavender Street shophouses on the market for $60 mil En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

For big organizations who produce chess tools,\u00a0tweaking the\u00a0features\u00a0for visually impaired players becomes financially unviable. This is the reason why Soundarya Pradhan, who is 100% visually impaired, decided to take things in his own hands. He has built up his own website, which solves a very specific problem for blind chess players. What is it? Know more about it in the article. Soundarya\u00a0also\u00a0received Rs.33,000\u00a0from ChessBase\u00a0India and its viewers for his efforts and to develop his website\u00a0further.\u00a0\n\n\nChess is not just a sport, it's a social tool\u00a0Chess\u00a0is not just a\u00a0sport, it is a fantastic social tool. It binds\u00a0people together and empowers them. If you think about it\u00a0deeply, it is the only\u00a0sport where the visually impaired can fight on\u00a0equal terms with sighted people.\u00a0When a visually impaired player faces a sighted individual in chess, no change in rules are required. Only the equipment needs to be changed a bit. A\u00a0visually impaired chess player needs a braille board,\u00a0everything else remains the same. It does not come as a surprise that\u00a0visually impaired players who have succeeded at chess, have also seen a surge in their confidence levels in other areas of life. A Braille Chess Board\u00a0is designed differently. It has pieces\u00a0that can be placed into the holes when you move them | Photo: Amruta MokalTake the example of Mr. Charudatta Jadhav - the current President of AICFB (All India Chess Federation for the Blind)\u00a0and IBCA (International Braille Chess Association). Charudatta\u00a0Jadhav was born with\u00a0normal vision but when he grew up he slowly started to lose his\u00a0sight.\u00a0This affected his confidence tremendously and he could no longer feel at ease when interacting with sighted people. Because he had experienced\u00a0the life of being sighted,\u00a0when blindness befell\u00a0upon him, it affected his confidence. That's when Charudatta turned to chess. The man\u00a0who has transformed blind chess in India -\u00a0Dr. Charudatta\u00a0Jadhav | Photo: Amruta MokalWorking on the game and improving\u00a0at it, he was able to find a medium to gain back his confidence. Every victory at chess against sighted players made Charudatta\u00a0believe that disability would not\u00a0come between him and his goals in life. Very soon, he achieved his FIDE rating, the first Indian visually impaired player\u00a0to do so.\u00a0In 1997 he formed the All India Chess Federation of the Blind and has been\u00a0responsible for the growth of blind chess in India over the years. Things\u00a0did not end there. Charudatta's confidence\u00a0which had risen thanks to chess helped him to\u00a0become the head of Accessibility Centre of Excellence in TCS. He also has a Ph.D in computer science and also the current president of IBCA (equivalent of\u00a0FIDE in blind chess!) It's amazing how\u00a0chess managed to instill confidence and belief in a young boy who had seemingly lost hope in life.Know more about the amazing story of Charudatta JadhavThe problem faced by\u00a0visually impaired chess players\u00a0Once we understand why chess is such an important tool of self\u00a0improvement for\u00a0visually impaired chess players, you realize how critical it is to\u00a0ensure that the right tools are given to them\u00a0to get better at the sport.\u00a0One wonders - how\u00a0do chess players improve at chess? How do they\u00a0work on the sport when they cannot read the books, nor see what is on the computer screen?\u00a0This is where a screen reading software comes to the rescue. A screen reading software like\u00a0JAWS or NVDA helps the\u00a0visually impaired to\u00a0move the cursor via their keyboard and read out the words that are\u00a0touched upon on the screen.\u00a0With regular training and repetition, you can see the blind chess players becoming more and\u00a0more comfortable with the\u00a0sound of the screen reading software. Here's a video that\u00a0gives you an\u00a0idea as to how the blind chess players navigate the information on a computer or a mobile screen. Sit tight, their speed\u00a0might just blow you away!Aryan Joshi and Soundarya Pradhan show how they are able to read at an astonishing speed using the screen\u00a0reading softwareWhile the screen reader does a wonderful job of\u00a0empowering the visually impaired people, there is a very specific problem that chess players\u00a0face. Let's have a look at\u00a0the ChessBase screen:A normal screen of ChessBase 16 with the chess board\u00a0on the left and notation on the rightThe screen reader would\u00a0do a good job of reading through the menus at the top and also the tabs at the right as well as the\u00a0notations. What it fails to do is to tell you exactly where the pieces are on the chess board. It does not read out that the\u00a0white king is on g1 and the\u00a0queen is on b3. Because of this, visually impaired chess players always face\u00a0difficulties when a new position is given to them. It's true that in the above case, the game starts from the\u00a0initial position, and hence they can play over the moves one by one to reach the current board position. But sometimes, these moves are not available. It would help if the\u00a0screen reading software\u00a0would read out position of the pieces on the board. While this is a problem right now, Soundarya Kumar Pradhan, one of\u00a0India's top visually impaired chess players (Elo-1746), decided to find a solution to it.A\u00a0look at the website Soundarya\u00a0has developed. It is quite simple, but very effective. You need\u00a0the FEN of the position and you need to paste it in the box! What is FEN, you may ask?There is a feature in the \"home\" tab of ChessBase\u00a0software that allows you to copy the positionWhen you click on Copy Position button, it copies the FEN (Forsyth\u2013Edwards Notation). The FEN of the above position is  r5k1/3q1pp1/pp2rnnp/4p3/P2P4/1QP1BN1P/5PP1/3RR1K1 b - - 0 21. Now all you have to do is paste the FEN in the dialogue box of Soundarya's website and this is what happens!The entire position is written down and the screen\u00a0reader is able to read it out to you along with who is to move!\n\n\n\nThis eases the life of\u00a0a visually impaired chess player considerably and he can continue his chess practice without any impediments.Soundarya Pradhan explains his website to the viewersSoundarya Pradhan is 100% visually impaired. He hails from the\u00a0small town of Boden, Odisha. He has won a silver medal at the World Junior Championships in Poland in 2018 and also a silver medal at the Asian Paragames 2018, thanks to which he got the chance to meet the Prime Minister of India (in the picture above). He\u00a0is an excellent student\u00a0and is currently pursuing his engineering in Computer Science from NIT in\u00a0Jamshedpur.In a stream where Nihal Sarin\u00a0received the best game\u00a0nomination for Gazprom Brilliancy prize for the World Youth Championships, Soundarya was invited along with his brother Prachurya (who is also 100%\u00a0visually impaired). Soundarya was awarded Rs.15,000 by Nihal\u00a0Sarin. This amount was\u00a0what FIDE\u00a0was paying ChessBase India for the work done on the Gazprom Brilliancy Prize!In the above stream Nihal Sarin analyzes his best game against Francesco Sonis. At the 50-minute mark\u00a0we have Soundarya and\u00a0Prachurya coming in!\u00a0Don't miss out on Prachurya's amazing singing skills!For building something valuable Soundarya not only\u00a0received Rs.15,000 from the ChessBase India\u00a0Foundation, he also received Rs.15,000 from Ayushi Sharma and Rs.3,000 from Sanjeevan Pathak. Both Ayushi and Sanjeevan are\u00a0viewers of ChessBase\u00a0India YouTube channel and they were impressed by Soundarya's work. At the same time they wanted him to use the funds to improve his website further.\u00a0Speaking to ChessBase India,\u00a0Soundarya said, \"I would like to thank ChessBase India Foundation, FIDE and Nihal Sarin for\u00a0their generosity. I would also like to thank Ayushi\u00a0Sharma and Sanjeevan Pathak for their contribution. With this fund of Rs.33,000 I intend to improve the quality of my website. These are the plans I have:1. I will get a domain of my own and shift the website to it.2. I want to make it easier for blind chess players to watch games from the ChessBase software. \n\n\n\nIt is not much of an issue if the game\u00a0has just one main line from beginning to end, but it turns out that for now, there is no perfect solution to watch the games with a jungle of variations full of comments.\n\n\n\n3. The only screen reader that interacts with any ChessBase software to a reasonable extent is JAWS, which costs as much as a good computer. I want all major screen readers, including the open sourced NVDA to be able to interact with the software. This may require the development of some addon for the screen reader, or, if the situation is more complicated than that, which I am not able to estimate with my current knowledge, I would like to speak and assist ChessBase programmers to carry out some changes in their code for their next release.4. I would like to make chess materials like books and videos accessible for the blind. This may require me to buy the books or obtain certain permissions to make changes. And the amount of work needed for this is something that I cannot completely do on my own.5. I would like to create features like puzzle rush or Tactics Sprint. It is actually not possible for a blind person to solve puzzles in a couple of seconds like sighted people can on the internet, but at least\u00a0I would like to make it as accessible as possible.\"Soundarya has\u00a0far-sighted vision for his website! | Photo: Amruta MokalWe wish Soundarya the best in his endeavour to improve the current\u00a0state of chess world. We, at ChessBase India, will support and help him in order to bring about a change!

Pooja Khandelwal   1 February 2021 8 min read            Which Chinese Zodiac Has the Best Financial Outlook for 2021?   As legend has it, the Jade Emperor (Emperor in Heaven in Chinese folklore) wanted 12 animals to serve as his guards. To determine their ranking, he sent an immortal being to earth to spread the message about a race, where each animal\u2019s rank would be determined by the order in which they passed through the Heavenly Gate.  On the day of the race, Rat woke up early but encountered a river with a swift current. To overcome this obstacle, Rat jumped onto Ox\u2019s back. Ox did not mind and helped Rat cross the river. After crossing the river, Rat jumped off Ox and dashed towards the feet of the Emperor. Rat finished first place in the race, Ox came in second, and the rest of the animals followed\u2014 that\u2019s how the Chinese zodiac began. On 12 February 2021, we will be welcoming the Year of the Ox. Apart from hosting reunion dinners, enjoying pineapple tarts, and receiving red packets, what\u2019s Chinese New Year without reading your Chinese horoscope predictions?

Your Chinese Zodiac Financial Outlook for 2021 Here is a breakdown of your Chinese zodiac\u2019s financial prediction for 2021, and the investments you should consider making. Rat   CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Rat   CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Rat Your financial prospects will greatly improve, compared to the previous year. Your work at hand will reap huge profits, especially during the 5th and 10th month. With Rat being your zodiac animal, you\u2019re naturally smart when it comes to money matters. If you have spare money, consider making an investment in your field of expertise.   Story continues Ox  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Ox  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - OxThe financial horoscope of the Ox can be improved. You should avoid high-risk investments and maintain caution towards spending beyond your means. Wealth is predicted to dip during the 3rd, 6th, and 8th months. As family expenditure will be particularly large during 2021, remember to create a budget and plan to increase your monthly savings. Consider opening a savings account, as a low-risk way to earn more with your money.Tiger  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Tiger  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - TigerWhen it comes to your finances, wealth projection is flat, and money can be easily lost, especially during the 7th month. On the bright side, the 4th and 8th month will bring you the highest financial luck. As you gain more financial independence, remember to  save throughout the year  to avoid financial hardships.Rabbit  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Rabbit  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - RabbitYour financial luck in 2021 is relatively flat, with extra financial success during the  9th month. Although you\u2019re a natural saver, this year's income is set to be far less than expected. Everytime you\u2019re able to save a sum of money, it is destined to be spent for various necessities. This may cause you to feel challenged when managing money from home. With the finance industry becoming increasingly digitised, there are many new  financial management tools  that can help you manage your money in an easier, smarter way.Dragon  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Dragon  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - DragonYou will be presented with  investment opportunities  where waves of profit will come crashing in. Be content with your financial abundance and avoid the temptation of going overboard, which may put you at risk of losing more than you gained. Your financial outlook for 2021 is stable and you will not need to worry about covering household expenses. You will be especially financially lucky during the  10th  month.Snake  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Snake  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - SnakeYour performance in the workplace will yield double the financial return. You will also earn money from unexpected areas. However, your financial consumption will also increase. Remain open to an opportunity that will let you strike rich during the 4th month. If you\u2019re used to being cautious with spending, seek guidance from a friend or mentor born in the Year of the Ox.As the Snake is a fire sign, it clashes with metal \u2013 an element that represents money. According to Chinese Ba Zi readings, the Ox is nicknamed, \u201cThe Storeroom of the Metal\u201d, which means they can safeguard the wealth of animal signs who have trouble achieving monetary abundance. To increase your financial luck in 2021, look through your contact list and contact an Ox benefactor.Horse  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Horse  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - HorseYou\u2019ll experience smooth progress in your career, which will be tied to good income. Expect to receive the highest financial luck during the 11th month. If you find yourself faced with unexpected events, learn to plan monthly expenditure as opposed to spending money on meaningless things. Consider applying the  50-30-20 rule  when to divide your income into three categories:50% should be spent on your essential needs; 30% should be used for discretionary spending; 20% should go towards your savings, investments, and emergency expenses. Suppose you earn S$6,000 a month, after all taxes and deductions. According to the rule, S$3,000 should be spent on your needs, S$1,800 should be used for your wants, and the remaining S$1,200 must be used for your savings and investments.Goat  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Goat  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - GoatYour financial income may be greatly reduced, especially during the 3rd month. However, with hard work, you can expect financial success during the 6th month. Approach financial matters with increased caution. If you\u2019re intrigued by the idea of making money through investing, you should first understand what investing is all about. Start by understanding the basics of investment, including the risks and portfolio diversification.Monkey  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Monkey  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - MonkeyYour financial luck looks quite bright. You\u2019ll enjoy increased wealth and bonuses during the first half of the year. Also, you\u2019ll earn rewards from your side investments. While you will be most financially lucky during the 4th month, you\u2019re expected to face great loss during the 12th month. To avoid financial hardship towards the end of the year, consider planning ahead with a robo advisor, a low-cost alternative to traditional wealth management advisors.Rooster  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Rooster  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - RoosterYour wealth projection is quite positive and you will encounter many good opportunities in 2021 to obtain high returns. However, as you tend to be more materialistic by nature, your expenses will also be relatively high. Remember to minimise spending, even if you have a comfortable monthly income. Be especially careful during the 2nd and 6th months and welcome good fortune during the 5th and 11th months.Dog  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - Dog  CNY financial horoscope prediction 2021 - DogYour financial outlook is relatively flat.

The price of the relatively new bungalow, sitting on a freehold land area of 16,598 sq ft, translates to $2,893 psf.  In terms of price psf, it is the highest since 2019, when billionaire James Dyson, the richest man in the UK, paid $50 million ($3,311 psf) for a new GCB at Cluny Road designed by Guz Wilkinson of Singapore- based Guz Architects. The GCB at Swettenham Close had been discreetly placed on the market for $50 million a year ago. The GCB is located at the end of a cul-de-sac on Swettenham Close. \u201cThis house is probably at the furthest point along Swettenham Road and it commands sweeping views of the surrounding GCB estate,\u201d says Bruce Lye, managing partner of SRI.    The $48 million sale of the relatively new GCB at Swettenham Close translates to $2,893 psf on the land area. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) This GCB area is a short drive to the Botanic Gardens, an attribute that appeals to many GCB homeowners and buyers, says Lye. SRI closed the sale of another GCB at nearby Pierce Hill for $28.8 million ($1,668 psf) on Feb 2, 2021. The price achieved for the GCB at Swettenham Close is likely to have set a new benchmark for the estate. \u201cIt could cause an upward shift in the asking price of the GCBs that are still on the market today,\u201d reckons Lye.  Bloomberg reported in November 2020 that Chng sold a majority stake in Viz Branz to Bahrain-based investment firm Investcorp Holdings. The private equity and alternative asset manager is the biggest private equity company in the Middle East, and the deal valued the company at up to $500 million at the time, according to the Bloomberg report.

(Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) Since moving into their two-bedroom unit at South Beach Residences two years ago, Mr Teoh Teik Kee, private investor and his wife, Dr Hwang Yee Cheau, CEO of TP Dental Surgeons and adjunct associate professor at NUS Faculty of Dentistry, have spent most of the major public holidays in the comfort of their home.  Their living room faces the Marina Bay, offering views of Singapore\u2019s iconic skyline, from Esplanade, to Marina Bay Sands and the CBD, while the rooms offer views of St Andrew\u2019s Cathedral, Raffles Hotel and Chijmes. \u201cWhether it\u2019s fireworks during New Year\u2019s Eve or the National Day Parade, we have front-row seats,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cSince Padang is in front of us, we are ensured of a completely unobstructed view of all these beautiful historical buildings.\u201d The 1,625 sq ft apartment is the ideal entertainment pad to showcase Singapore, adds Teoh. Apart from the stupendous 270-degree panoramic views of the city from day to night, the integrated development also has world-class restaurants on the basement of South Beach Avenue. The restaurants include cafe Wild Honey, Japanese shabu shabu & sukiyaki restaurant Black Cow and Michelin-guide restaurant Akira Back. Recently, Japanese fine-dining omakase restaurant Sushi Masaaki also opened its doors at South Beach Avenue.    The evening view of Marina Bay from Teoh and Hwang\u2019s unit. (Photo: Albert Chua/The Edge Singapore) Hwang\u2019s favourite is Madame Fan at The NCO Club, a beautiful restaurant that specialises in modern Cantonese cuisine. \u201cHow often can you find a restaurant in a historical building like this? Furthermore, we\u2019re just within walking distance from it,\u201d says Hwang. Madame Fan is housed in the former Non-Commissioned Officers\u2019 (NCO) Club, now a pre-war heritage building gazetted for conservation by the URA. It is one of the four historical buildings that are part of the integrated development of South Beach.  \u201cFor my birthday celebration later this year, I intended to book rooms for friends at JW Marriott Hotel, which is within the same tower as South Beach Residences. Then, we would go to Madame Fan at The NCO Club for the party together,\u201d Hwang shares. As residents of South Beach Residences, the couple enjoys privilege rates at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, which occupies the first to 21st storeys of the South Tower. Designed to impress  Teoh and Hwang were among the first early-bird buyers at South Beach Residences. The development caught their attention as early as 2015, when it was still being built. \u201cWe identified that South Beach Residences offered the only residential units in such a unique location,\u201d says Teoh.   Story continues Thus, they jumped on the chance to view and purchase their unit as soon as the project was launched in September 2018. They also appreciated that the residential units were already built at their launch, so they could go into the actual units to see which ones they liked before committing.  A two-bedroom unit on the 44th floor of South Beach Residences, one of the few available units at South Beach Residences. (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)\u201cI think many disregarded the property when it was launched because it was a 99-year leasehold property. But the million-dollar views are hard to come by. Some of our friends who visited and experienced the views and convenience of living here now regret not buying a unit here,\u201d says Teoh.The award-winning design of the South Beach integrated development, designed by renowned architectural firm Foster + Partners, was another big draw for the couple. The South Tower\u2014 comprising residential units on levels 23 to 45 and the 634 guest rooms of JW Marriott Singapore South Beach\u2014 and the North Tower, are connected via South Beach Avenue, covered by its iconic canopy. The North Tower comprises Grade-A office spaces and counts Facebook, LEGO and Sanofi among its anchor tenants. The canopy also has photovoltaic cells that generate solar energy and the wave-like structure provides natural ventilation that cools the building in Singapore\u2019s hot climate.The design of South Beach mixed development blends environmentally conscious design and green technologies in an innovative way. It has won two BCA Green Mark Platinum awards (residential and commercial) and the prestigious FIABCI Singapore Awards, topping the Sustainable Development category and also the Singapore Good Design Mark (SG Mark) Platinum Award.Foster + Partners also designed several iconic buildings in Singapore, such as the Supreme Court and more recently, the floating spherical Apple Store at Marina Bay Sands.  The unit is designed with an \u201ceast meets west\u201d theme by Maria Warner Wong of WOW Architects. (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)The interior of Teoh and Hwang\u2019s unit is designed with an \u201ceast meets west\u201d theme by Maria Warner Wong, design director and co-founder of WOW Architects. The living room, which has modular furniture that makes it easy for entertaining, has striking teal blue walls. Hwang shares: \u201cThis was my idea, because this blue makes it feel like the night sky is brought indoors.\u201d\u201cWe also love the two balconies and the full-length windows. They make the unit windy and breezy and are hard to come by in this area,\u201d says Teoh. \u201cYou can have breakfast or just relax on whichever balcony, depending on whether you want a sunset view or a sunrise view.\u201dThe couple knocked down the wardrobe in the master bedroom and placed a daybed in its stead. They also gave the room sliding doors so it can be used to entertain, as a study, or as a guest bedroom when required. There is another room with an attached bathroom and a sizeable balcony. The kitchen is fitted with Miele appliances.  The bedroom of another two-bedder unit in the property, which comes with a spacious attached balcony where one can relax on. (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Teoh and Hwang are also full of praise for the Signature Residential Service in South Beach Residences. A team of well-trained hosts attend to residents\u2019 requests and needs, such as making reservations and sending up deliveries, raising the bar of luxury.Hwang says: \u201cWhen I was entertaining at home for the first time, I didn\u2019t realise that the unit uses an induction cooker. I called the concierge and they helped me to cook my food at the barbecue pit on level 32. They really went the extra mile for us.\u201dThere is also concierge staff stationed at the lobby in Basement Two, who serve welcome drinks and also carry out health protocols. \u201cOur guests are always wowed when they step into the basement lobby from the carpark,\u201d says Hwang.Connected yet exclusive  The integrated development also has world-class restaurants on the basement of South Beach Avenue, such as cafe Wild Honey, Japanese shabu shabu & sukiyaki restaurant Black Cow and Michelin-guide restaurant Akira Back. (Photo: South Beach Consortium Pte Ltd)Being directly connected to Esplanade MRT Station and linked via underground walkways to Raffles City Shopping Centre and City Hall MRT Station, the development offers easy accessibility. \u201cWhen there is no traffic, I can reach my office at Ngee Ann City in 15 minutes,\u201d says Hwang.For an integrated development that has residential, hospitality, office, retail and F&B elements, as well as four historical buildings, Teoh notes that the space planning is very thoughtful, with spacious car parks and well-delineated spaces. \u201cOn our level, there are two lifts for four units only. The four-bedroom units have their own private lift, so there is a great sense of exclusivity and peace,\u201d he adds.Since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, Teoh is currently working from home. \u201cIt\u2019s so convenient to hold meetings here with my business associates because of the accessible location,\u201d he notes.At the same time, given the ongoing worldwide travel restrictions, Teoh says he is taking the time to explore Singapore. \u201cI take walks to Kampong Glam, Bugis, and around the bay. It\u2019s so well-connected that if I wanted to, I could cycle from here to Gardens by the Bay, and all the way to Changi,\u201d he adds.

He frequents the infinity pool on level 22 of South Beach Residences, where he exercises while enjoying the views of Marina Bay Sands, Fullerton Hotel and Singapore\u2019s CBD. On the same floor, there are function rooms, an indoor and outdoor gym, as well as outdoor lounge chairs. The sky garden on level 32 is equipped with a kids\u2019 pool, a floor chess area, a reading room and an outdoor dining area.South Beach Residences is developed by City Developments Limited and IOI Properties. Units here range from 940 sq ft two-bedders to 6,400 sq ft five-bedroom penthouses. The four-bedroom units are fully sold, with two-bedroom, three-bedroom and penthouse units still available.  The two-bedroom unit has a layout spacious enough to accommodate a study for working from home. (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)In the remaining available two-bedroom units\u2014some of which face a partial sea view towards eastern Singapore\u2014the layout is spacious enough to accommodate a study for working from home. The owner also can choose to have a workstation in the balcony for breezy, good views.  One of the available newly renovated two-bedroom-plus-study units at South Beach Residences.

Hence, China\u2019s entertainment business is in a way, a proxy to Covid recovery play. And not just any kind of entertainment business, such as sitting for a couple of hours in a cinema, but a totally immersive experience where people can pretend to be the Black Widow, or Spiderman or Iron Man. Currently unlisted, Cityneon holds the intellectual property (IP) rights to run these immersive exhibitions in China, and other jurisdictions.  Sources close to Cityneon indicate that its exhibitions in China are going great guns. \u201cChina\u2019s numbers are a record since last July,\u201d the source says. As at Oct 2020, it has accumulated a portfolio of IP rights for Marvel\u2019s Avengers, Hasbro\u2019s Transformers, Lionsgate\u2019s Hunger Games, Universal\u2019s Jurassic World and 20th Century\u2019s Avatar. Cityneon\u2019s IP portfolio includes artifact IPs and has signed contracts with the governments of Egypt, Peru and China. Most recently in Dec 2020, Cityneon announced it had clinched the Original Artefacts IP Exhibition \u2013 Machu Picchu And The Golden Empires Of Peru. A partnership with the Egyptian government could be announced soon, for an exhibition on Ramses II. Altogether, Cityneon owns and operates nine exhibition sets based on exclusive movie IP rights. The company\u2019s growth strategy involves adding more move IPs such as Fast & Furious and Harry Potter. Executive chairman and CEO of Cityneon, Ron Tan has said in past interviews that two criteria determine what movie IPs the company can acquire. Box office takings need to be at least US$1 billion, and the movie must have a sequel.  In the wake of Covid-19 and the pandemic, Cityneon\u2019s historic financials are modest. FY2020\u2019s revenue is estimated at US$79 million, gross profit at US$48 million and Ebitda at US$26 million. Net profit for the year is likely to be just US$1 million. However, a big jump is expected for FY2021, with revenue surging to US$215 million; gross profit would more than double to US$123 million, Ebitda is likely to rise to US$88 million, and net income should come in at US$45 million. Fixed terms for licensing & royalty fees should provide revenue and earnings visibility. For instance for the Avengers exhibitions, Cityneon has a fixed fee of US$2 million to US$2.5 million a year, with royalty rate of around 11% to 15%, depending on sales of memorabilia. Similarly, the company has minimum fee guarantees and royalty rates for Transformers, Hunger Games, Avatar and Jurassic World exhibitions.   Story continues A term sheet seen by The Edge Singapore shows the company plans to raise $135 million through an issue of new shares in a private placement, with a further $40 million from vendor shares. According to the term sheet, pre-financing valuation is $850 million, translating into $3.03 per share. The company has announced it plans an IPO not later than 2Q2023, an a valuation of not less than $1,320 million.The current shareholders of Cityneon are West Knighton with 86.6%, Citic Capital with 10.36%, EDB Investments with 2.28% and Pavilion Capital (a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings) with 0.76%. West Knighton is 20% held by Tan, and 80% held bu Hong Kong businessman Johnson Ko.Cityneon was privatised by then largest shareholder Ron Tan in 2019, valuing the company at $318 million. Tan in partnership with Ko offered shareholders $1.30 a share - a record for the stock at that point. This month though, the company is likely to raise $175 million, an amount that could be upsized to $200 million from the private placement taking the company\u2019s value to $1 billion.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore  Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

But nobody handed this success out to her on a platter. She recognised and seized the opportunities by always being prepared to go an extra mile, or in her case, many miles.  In a recent interview, Priyanka Chopra said, 'I\u2019m not someone who rests on my laurels'. This is, in fact, the secret sauce to success as has been traditionally proven by many successful entrepreneurs and achievers. Scientific studies too, show that successful people always have a common set of habits that empowers them to achieve their goals for the world to marvel after. While she may be a star and celebrity to the world, her stardom rests on fact that she is an astute businesswoman who has built an empire of her own by assimilating a set of qualities and habits and consistently following after. Here are ten business qualities you must learn from Priyanka Chopra Jonas: Take risks: Despite having a full-fledged career in India. She went to the U.S to chase her dream of becoming pursuing acting in Hollywood. She is good at evaluating the consequences and making the right decisions at the right time. Trust the Process: Priyanka has always been vocal about how the process is more meaningful to her than the outcome. She enjoys the journey. Of course, there will be ups and downs, but that is all the fun part of it. You must always trust the process. It is okay to reject a few offers: You cannot say yes to everything. It is better to under-promise instead of delivering below expected standards. One must learn to say no. Learn to balance between risk and comfort: Priyanka preaches taking risks. But at the same time, she focuses on finding the right balance between risk and staying where you are comfortable. Taking a lot of risks can play on your mind. Learn to choose both comfort and risk at the same time. Be accountable: If you are a part of the deal, good or bad. Hold yourself accountable. Running away from reality can make you delusional. Accept your mistakes and move on. Do not put a cap on your dreams: Priyanka has always backed the idea of dreaming big. The bigger your goals are, the more you achieve. She is a living example of how much one can be successful despite starting from scratch. Be vocal about your achievements more often: Priyanka has been very vocal about how proud she is of her achievements. Talking about your accomplishments makes you feel confident and gives you the energy to push yourself farther. Be willing to sacrifice anything to achieve your goals: The one and the only most crucial thing in life are your goals. There is no limit to what you can let go of to achieve what you want to. Always have something to fall back on: Before venturing into Hollywood, Priyanka Chopra rested assured that she has both her feet dug deep into Bollywood. She ensured that she had something to fall back upon in case she happens to crossroads with failures. Don\u2019t be scared to learn about unchartered territories: Priyanka started her journey as a model, she took up acting later, and now she is writing books, investing in startups, she owns a production company, and so much more. You don\u2019t have to stop at one thing that you like to do. She is an example of the fact that we can do it all.

As Metro contemplates the potential closure of its two remaining outlets in Singapore, DBS Group Research analysts Geraldine Wong and Derek Tan weigh the implications its closure will have on SPH REIT and Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT).  There are several years left on the lease at Metro Causeway Point under FCT and at SPH REIT\u2019s Paragon, where Metro stands as an anchor tenant. The department store is one of the top 10 tenants by gross rental income (GRI) for both SPH REIT and FCT based on its latest annual report. For the former, exposure appears to be \u201cmaterial\u201d for Paragon Mall, according to Wong and Tan. Metro has been at Paragon for many years and occupies a corner of the mall where there is less traffic.  For more stories about where the money flows, click here for our Capital section  Should Metro decide to close its stores, SPH REIT will have to find another anchor tenant to \u201cpull\u201d traffic to the mall. For FCT, Wong and Lai see the income risk may be minimised with the contribution from the PGIM portfolio. Furthermore, Metro\u2019s space in Causeway Point is in a \u201crelatively desirable\u201d location with good frontage, which means that a new anchor can easily be found in the event of Metro\u2019s closure. On the retail scene, Wong and Lai view the remaining department store tenants such as Isetan, BHG, Takashimaya, Tangs and OG as battling the same pressures due to the pandemic.  However, most are not refreshed or up to date in terms of refurbishments and store formats as compared to single-brand stores. Citing the example of Raffles City\u2019s concept department store with BHG, Wong and Lai view the new store as putting a futuristic spin on traditional department stores. This, they say is vital, as department stores take \u201ca last lap of reimagination\u201d despite being late to the game. The key question, they ask, is if the new concept will capture the \u201ceyes, hearts and wallets of consumers\u201d and carve out a new path of survival for other stores to emulate.  SEE: Metro Holdings' student accommodation fund acquires property in Bristol, UK for $54.8 mil  Despite the pressures facing retail stores, not all is doom and gloom, note the analysts. \u201cCorresponding to this jump in trade sector classification from department stores to beauty and health, landlords would also be able to reap higher rents on smaller retail plots in comparison to rents on anchor space,\u201d they write. \u201cWe think that this can neutralise some of the rental pressure, should landlords be able to slice up anchor space to release as smaller retail plots. Demand and interest should stay high for these dominant malls and it is only going to be a matter of price,\u201d they add.   Story continues To this end, Wong and Lai have rated SPH REIT at \u201chold\u201d with a target price of 80 cents, and \u201cbuy\u201d on FCT with a target price of $3.Units in SPH REIT and FCT closed flat at 83 cents and 1 cent higher or 0.4% up at $2.62 respectively, on Feb 3.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Shares in Straits Trading Company up by over 10% after DBS initiates 'buy' on the counter DBS ups Keppel Infra Trust's TP to 61 cents on better-than-expected cash flows Analysts mostly positive on Ascendas REIT 'diversified, resilient' portfolio Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

It quarterly revenue growth from gaming and data centre during its Q4 FY21 were encouragingly up 67 and 97 per cent year-on-year, respectively. In contrast, automotive, professional visualisation, and Nvidia's OEM & other market segments were basically flat or down a few per cent.\n\nAfter the results were announced the markets responded positively by the pleasant surprise which saw a record fourth quarter revenue figure of US$5.0 billion reported, an improvement of 61 per cent compared to last year's total (analysts had expected approx a 55 per cent uplift). However, the after-hours rally was quite short-lived as in an investor call, as you can see from my chart screen grab \u2013 as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the assembled analysts that he does not expect the company\u2019s business of selling processors to cryptocurrency miners to \"grow extremely large,\" reports CNBC. That statement effectively flipped a quick three per cent gain into a two per cent loss \u2013 at the time of writing.\n\nIt is interesting to hear the Nvidia CEO indirectly pour cold water on the crypto-boom we are currently in the second major wave of \u2013 perhaps he thinks it is another bubble. Not all tech titans are bullish about the long term value of cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Additionally, the 'crypto hangover' of 2019 might be why Nvidia is more wary this time around.\nMost HEXUS readers will be looking at the Nvidia gaming segments for grains of interesting information. In this segment revenue was up 67 per cent from a year ago and up 10 per cent sequentially. Full year gaming revenue was up by 41 per cent. These increases were precipitated by higher sales across desktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs, noted Nvidia's CFO.\n\nIt is observed that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series of graphics cards was ramped up over recent months and this more than covered the decrease in sales of game console SoCs. Noted successes for the gaming division include; 70+ Ampere laptop design wins, RTX technologies now available in 36 gaming titles, developers starting to adopt Nvidia Reflex low latency technology, and GeForce Now expanding to iOS Safari.\nThough Nvidia crowed about the sales volumes of Ampere GPUs we all know that GeForce RTX 30 consumer graphics cards, or even laptops, aren't getting to consumers in enough numbers. Hopefully, the latest driver/firmware crypto-mining throttle implemented with the GeForce RTX 3060 12GB graphics cards, launched later today, will help remedy this.\n\nThe remarkable growth of the Nvidia data centre business (up 97 per cent from a year ago and comparable to last Quarter), was largely driven by the Mellanox acquisition and the ramp of the Ampere GPU architecture, says the Nvidia CFO.\nNvidia's outlook is for continued revenue growth, with $5.30 billion, plus or minus 2 per cent predicted for Q1 FY22. I didn't see any business segment specific outlook statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

The beefiest chassis it has is the UP10 fanless case which is advertised as being capable of handling up to EATX motherboards, CPUs up to 140W, and GPUs up to 160W, as well as your choice of ATX or SFX power.\nYesterday Fanless Tech spotted the Turemetal founder pushing the UP10 a fair bit beyond those advertised limits. It reports that \"Turemetal's mastermind Mical Wong managed to passively-cool the high-octane GeForce RTX 3080,\" passively in the chassis which is packed with thick aluminium fins and heatpipes.\n\nYou can see more images from the thermal limits-stretching venture on Wong's Twitter account. He shows that the full system is pulling about 410W from the mains socket. That's somewhat more than the combined numbers above, suggesting the TU10 is capable of cooling a 300W system. Actually the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition is rated at 320W alone.\nWong ran the Furmark stress test to show what the UP10 was capable of with the RTX 3080 / R5 5600X inside. However, as many Twitter responses have noted the graph shows that the test was ended a little prematurely, in just a few minutes, before the temperature curve stabilised. The GPU had started the test at 18\u00b0C and reached a toasty 87\u00b0C and while the curve was almost flattening but wasn't quite there.\n\nOther observations are that the room temperature was low, at just 13.6\u00b0C, and the CPU in the system was not under any pressure (10 per cent load at screenshot time). With a more normal room temperature levels and a balanced load stressing CPU and GPU the system might start throttling quite quickly. On the other hand, Wong could have underclocked, reduced the power limit, and/or undervolted the GPU to run it at up to 100W less but retaining a worthwhile chunk of its performance in a stable passive system.\nAt the time of writing RTX 3080 GPUs are pretty hard to find unless you are willing to stump up scalper friendly prices. Add onto this the approximate US$800 UP10 price and this kind of system is going to cost you a pretty penny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nNZXT unveils all-matte-white cooling series products\n\n                    Introduces the Kraken X and Z AiO CPU coolers, and Aer RBG 2 fans, in bright matte white. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n10\nSilverStone SETA Q1 mid-tower focuses on silence\n\n                    A minimal mid-tower (E-ATX) design with 'sound maze' dampening tech, priced at US$220. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n29\nFractal Design Torrent\n\n                    All-in on airflow. \n                \n\n\n\nWin one of three be quiet! upgrade bundles\nInWin 309 GE case front panel becomes a 'gaming platform'\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 12 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The Netherlands entered its toughest phase of anti-coronavirus restrictions to date, imposing a nationwide night-time curfew from 9 p.m. until 4:30 a.m. in a bid to control the COVID-19 infection rate. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong) \u00b7 Associated Press \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS  Associated Press  Updated 16 February 2021 2 min read          THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 A Dutch court ordered the government on Tuesday to end the curfew it imposed last month to rein in the spread of coronavirus, saying the ruling coalition was not entitled to use emergency powers to enforce the restrictive measure. In a written statement, The Hague District Court called the curfew a \u201cfar-reaching violation of the right to freedom of movement and privacy\u201d that also indirectly curtails the rights of freedom of assembly and demonstration.  \u201cThis requires a very careful decision-making process,\u201d the court ruled. The government extended the 9 p.m.-to-4:30 a.m. curfew into March last week. It used a law allowing it to bypass the usual legislative process in emergencies. However, the court said the introduction of the curfew did not require the use of the fast-track process as it had been discussed at length during the coronavirus crisis. The justice ministry said it was studying the ruling. A group called Virus Truth that is deeply skeptical of the government's approach to slowing the spread of the virus had asked the court to outlaw the curfew, which sparked rioting in the first days of its imposition but is widely adhered to by the vast majority of the country. In a video interview tweeted by the group, its leader Willem Engel thanked the judge and said, \u201cI'm happy that there is still such a thing as jurisprudence.\u201d Infections have for weeks been slowly declining in the Netherlands amid a tough lockdown. The 7-day rolling average of daily new cases declined over the past two weeks from 24.27 new cases per 100,000 people on Feb. 1 to 20.36 new cases per 100,000 people on Feb. 15. The country has seen nearly 15,000 confirmed deaths in the pandemic. ___ Follow all of AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic, https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

People who had resorted to eating at home during the height of the pandemic have cut purchases of frozen foods and ready-to-eat snacks and returned to ordering in.  While demand for packaged foods has stayed elevated into the current quarter, they are below the levels seen during the panic-buying stage. Additionally, higher costs have been weighing on packaged food companies. Breakfast cereal maker Kellogg earned 85 cents per share, below estimates of 89 cents, hurt by higher spending on advertising and promotions, as well as COVID-related costs. Kellogg's shares, which declined about 10% in 2020, were marginally down in morning trading. Packaged foods makers have been pouring millions into their supply chains to meet heightened demand from grocers as they look to become bigger players in a competitive food space, while also spending more on hygiene and sanitation measures. Kellogg, which makes Pringles, Cheez-Its and Pop-Tarts, reported a 10% jump in its selling, general and administrative expenses to $800 million in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 2 . Net sales in North America, which accounts for about 60% of Kellogg's revenue, rose by less than 1% on an organic basis, as a resurgence in coronavirus cases hurt its business that sells its cereals, snacks and frozen foods to convenience stores, universities and schools. Net sales rose to $3.46 billion from $3.22 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting sales of $3.50 billion, according to IBES Refinitiv. Kellogg, which also makes Pringles, Cheez-Its and Pop-Tarts, forecast organic net sales to fall by about 1% in 2021, compared with a growth of 6% in 2020.

For thirty years, Zambia has been celebrated as an investment proposition for those looking for quality assets in the extractive industry, but for those without local knowledge, accessing the market has been challenging.  Also Read | Onon, Amazing Cuckoo Covers 26,000 Kms From Zambia to Mongolia Under a Year, Surprises Scientists With Its Mammoth Migratory Journey Zuneid Yousuf is one man changing all that. The founder and CEO of Zumran Mining and Exploration, Yousuf presents himself as international capital\u2019s natural resources partner in Zambia and beyond. A seasoned global entrepreneur with a strong track record in natural resources, Yousuf is one of Africa\u2019s leading businessmen. Based in the UAE with strong roots in Zambia, he has led Zumran to become the most exciting producer in Zambia\u2019s famed copper belt. Yousuf started his business career in the textiles industry, honing his entrepreneurial skills through the import and export of clothes from a base in the United Kingdom. After his family returned to Zambia in the mid-1990s, Yousuf spearheaded the development of the extractive industry in the country through his family business, eventually reaching the position Zumran holds today in the extractive sector. Zumran is constantly unveiling new projects in copper, gold, manganese and associated metals, with the potential to become the region\u2019s leading producer.

Terrifying Footage Gives Peak at Life Into the Wild Yousuf\u2019s business interests are varied, and have encompassed everything from fast moving consumer goods to farming and agricultural services. African Green Resources, Yousuf\u2019s agri-tech venture, is meeting the twin challenges of food security and economic development with a bottom-up approach. His entrepreneurial spirit is evident in each venture, placing the highest value on upholding integrity and a core belief that African businesses can shine brightly in an international context. Business has always been Yousuf\u2019s first priority, but as a global leader he is also highly respected for his philanthropy and his thought leadership. In 2020, he was among the first to recognise that the next head of the WTO must be an African, in an article for the Africa Report. An expert on the geopolitics of international trade, in his message of congratulations to Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, appointed WTO Director General in February 2021, Yousuf wrote of the need for the trade to deliver on the promise of growth and prosperity for Africa.   Story continues Yousuf\u2019s vision is for African business, working hand in hand with international partners, to fuel global growth. He has spent the past 30 years building the relationships, knowledge and experience, both local and global, to deliver on that goal. Today, Yousuf and Zumran Mining and Exploration offer unrivalled opportunities for international partners to access Zambia\u2019s rich natural resources.It is in Zambia\u2019s copper belt that Yousuf\u2019s international network has been so important. Investors in the mining sector look to Zambia for its political stability, supportive business environment, and abundance of mineral deposits. Zambia has a vast endowment of metals, gemstones, industrial minerals and potential energy sources. Coal, hydrocarbons and even uranium are produced by the country\u2019s extractive sector.Zambia is the world\u2019s seventh largest producer of copper, which accounts for 70% of the country\u2019s export earnings. But international investors have struggled to find local partners with investable propositions in the sector. Until January, Glencore was the major international player in the copper belt. With the Zambian Government purchasing Glencore\u2019s Zambian assets in a mutually beneficial deal, investors have been searching for companies to bridge the gap between local knowledge and an international approach.Zumran, under the leadership of Zuneid Yousuf, provides exactly that combination of global outlook and local expertise. From his base in the UAE, Yousuf brings together business leaders, financiers and private capital, creating partnerships to address the world\u2019s most pressing challenges. Despite his globetrotting lifestyle, he has never turned his back on his African roots. Zumran\u2019s success has been built on its understanding of the African model and its local relationships in Zambia and beyond.Partnership is the second ingredient in Zumran\u2019s recipe for success. From Zumran\u2019s highly prized copper and cobalt licences to its ventures in gold, manganese, tin and titanium, the company\u2019s projects have been built on bringing together entrepreneurial partners with a shared vision of prosperity and potential. As the company looks to the next stage in its evolution, with acquisition targets focused on some of Zambia\u2019s most iconic licences, Yousuf is assembling partners for a set of deals that commentators suggest could have a transformational impact on global natural resources sector.Yousuf himself, however, remains humble, saying that success and prosperity is savoured best when it is shared \u2013 with partners, through philanthropic projects, and with the people of Zambia.

At the time we heard that the upcoming graphics card model would become available to reviewers and influencers from 19th Feb, before the public launch at the end of the month. Now tech site WCCF Tech asserts that its sources have pinpointed the official date for release of the new graphics card as being 6am PST on Thursday 25th February.\nThe source doesn't have any more information other than that precise time but adds, as you may already expect, that the MSRP pricing isn't likely to be maintained. Moreover, it reports it has spotted various AIB partner cards listed by retailers from \u20ac428 at the cheapest all the way up to \u20ac599 in Europe \u2013 quite a sum for this SKU.\n\nIt is worth a recap on the RTX 3060's tech specs and first-party touted performance. For this info, please check the charts / slides reproduced above. In brief, you will see that the RTX 3060 12GB possesses 3594 CUDA cores, and runs at base/boost 1.32/1.76GHz. That significant chunk of GDDR6 memory is on a 192-bit bus. The card is expected to pull about 170W when strutting its stuff, and standard models will come with a single 8-pin power connector. Expect performance similar to the GeForce RTX 2060 Super.\n\nGoing back to the WCCFTech report, they link to a Reddit thread by 'he_never-sleeps' about the acquisition of a Gigabyte Eagle GeForce RTX 3060 OC 12GB. The redditor explains that he ordered and paid for a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and when the shop owner accidentally sold it to someone else first he browsed the (physical?) shop and picked up this (one of two available at the store). The thread is concerned with crypto-mining, and it appears to be widely expected the RTX 3060 is capable of approx 50MH/s while the RTX 3060 Ti is capable of a little over 60MH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 16 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The founders editions are definitely still rrp when they come up.That comment at the end re crypto mining potential is worrying. These will get snaffled up quicker than you can blink if that's true.So the 3070 is approx a 2080ti in performancethe 3060ti approx a 2070 super-2080and the 3060 only a 2060 super but with 1.5x the RAM buffer.  That's not amazing really.  It's a good budget card, but they should just have given the whole 30xx stack more memory, 12GB certainly up to 3070 where they're still using GDDR6 and without the heat issues of the GDDR6x in the 3080 upwards.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Tue 09 Feb 2021 17:43\n                \n\n\n\n\nDeletedNot everywhere. cough https://forums.hexus.net/graphics-cards/423275-3000-founders-edition-cards-uk-7.html#post4283696  I managed to preorder a 3070 today at what I think (hope) is/was rrp.

This was announced by Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in the Budget on Feb 16, and is part of the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package.  Companies in these hardest-hit sectors - known as Tier 1 companies - will see the government subsidise 30% of workers\u2019 wages of the first $4,600 dollars until June 2021, and 10% up to September 2021. This extension is the fourth in the JSS, and will cost the government an additional $700 million. For the so-called Tier 2 companies - such as those in retail, food services, arts and culture, and marine and offshore \u2013 they will get wage support of 10% for three more months, covering wages paid up to June 2021. \u201cSo far, we have committed over $25 billion to the JSS, and supported over 155,000 employers for up to 17 months. The current tranche will continue to cover wages up to March 2021 for most sectors,\u201d Heng said. The JSS was probably the most prominent scheme among the various support measures introduced by the government last year to deal with the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong thanks the government for its continued support for the aviation industry.  \u201cThe measures will help to bolster the SIA Group\u2019s plans to navigate the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, while remaining nimble and flexible to seize all opportunities as international routes re-open and travel sentiments improve,\u201d he said. \u201cThe initiatives will also help our employees to retain their knowledge and competencies, and acquire new skills if necessary, ensuring that they are future-ready during this critical period,\u201d said Goh. $5.4 billion boost The Covid-19 Resilience Package will also include a $5.4 billion boost to the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package to support the hiring of 200,000 locals. Heng announced this will also provide up to 35,000 traineeship and training opportunities, and this comes on top of the $3 billion allocated to the jobs and skills package last year.  SEE: Analysts maintain 'overweight' on S-REITs as sector remains a 'stable yield investment'  The support package was first launched in May last year to create 100,000 opportunities to help Singaporean workers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As at end-December, nearly 76,000 people have been placed into jobs, traineeships, attachments and skills training opportunities, Heng said during his Budget speech.   Story continues Of the $5.4 billion, $5.2 billion will go to extending the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) for seven months.Currently, under the JGI, firms that hire local workers from September 2020 to February 2021 will receive a subsidy of 25% of the first $5,000 of their gross monthly salaries.With the scheme now extended up to end-September this year, companies will be getting up to 12 months of wage support.Furthermore, companies who hire mature workers, persons with disabilities and ex-offenders will get more help of up to 18 months of enhanced wage support, Heng added.To groom leaders in innovation and enterprise, as Singapore heads into a more technologically-intensive and innovation-driven economy, there will be a new Innovation and Enterprise Fellowship programme, with the National Research Foundation (NRF) supporting about 500 fellowships over the next five years, said Heng.This aims to meet the needs in areas such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and health technology. It will work with a range of partners, including accelerators, venture capital firms and deep-tech start-ups.  jobs growth - THE EDGE SINGAPORE  See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Government support positive for aviation, tourism, consumer and retail sectors, less positive for healthcare: analysts Singapore signals return to balanced budgets post Covid-19 crisis: Bloomberg Winners and losers from Singapore\u2019s Budget 2021 Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

The new \"Ampere for every gamer\" cards were launched at CES 2021 in January, and we know to expect them sometime in \"late February\". At CES, Nvidia provided a decent amount of detail on the new GeForce RTX 3060 but limited its internal comparison tests to six AAA games titles to show the new SKU in a favourable light \u2013 pitted against the RTX 2060 and GTX 1060.\nWhile we patiently wait for the official RTX 3060 12GB release, or even some meaty benchmark comparison leaks to tide us over, VideoCardz has shared a little fresh Ampere meat in the form of a purported GA106 die shot.\n\nThe picture above shows the GA106 flanked by six memory modules of 2GB each, adding up to the 12GB total. These K4ZAF3258M-HC16 memory chips are said to be clocked at 16Gbps. It is observed that the GA106 (RTX 3060) and GA104 (RTX 3060 Ti / RTX 3070) GPUs are expected to be pin compatible \u2013 and you can see the overall chip size is the same in the comparison below. However, the new GA104 is quite a lot smaller - it is estimated to be 276mm2 compared to 392mm2. Using the same package size should help AIBs reduce development costs and the smaller die should help minimise the per chip costs from Samsung. VideoCardz reckons that the upcoming RTX 3050 Ti might also use GA106 and the same socket.\n\nRemember that the GeForce RTX 3060 12GB is supposed to be released at US$329.99.

SpaceX raised the funds at $419.99 a share and the latest funding round represents a jump of about 60% in the company's valuation from its previous raise, which valued it at $46 billion, the report https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html said.  SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company had raised $1.9 billion in August in its largest single fundraising round, according to PitchBook data. A prototype of SpaceX's Starship rocket, the SN9, exploded earlier this month during a landing attempt after a high-altitude test launch in a repeat of an accident that destroyed a previous test rocket. The Starship SN9 prototype was a test model of the heavy-lift rocket being developed by the company to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars. Earlier in February, Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla revealed that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for its cars. A well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, Musk has weighed in regularly on the recent frenzy in retail trading, driving up prices of meme-based digital currency dogecoin and shares of U.S. video game chain GameStop.

Online retail company ASOS, confirmed Monday Feb. 1, 2021, it has sealed the takeover of Topshop and three other brands from the collapse of the Arcadia retail empire, buying the brand names but not the high street retail space. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham, FILE) \u00b7 Associated Press \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS  Associated Press  Updated 1 February 2021 1 min read          LONDON (AP) \u2014 Online fashion seller Asos says it has bought Topshop, which once boasted designs by Kate Moss and Beyonce, along with three other brands for 265 million pounds ($363 million) as rivals scoop up bargains after the collapse of Britain\u2019s Arcadia retail group. The deal, announced Monday, puts thousands of jobs at risk because Asos acquired the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge\u2019s and HIIT brands but none of their stores.  Asos said it plans to keep only about 300 of the brands\u2019 employees. In addition to the purchase price, Asos said it also planned an additional cost to build stock. Arcadia, built by controversial retail tycoon Philip Green, went into bankruptcy on Nov. 30 as the COVID-19 pandemic closed stores and accelerated the shift to online shopping, compounding troubles for a group that was slow to embrace the internet. Arcadia is arguably the biggest British retailing casualty of the pandemic. Others such as Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Oasis Warehouse also slid into insolvency after lockdown measures were first imposed last year. Arcadia struggled to respond to increased competition from low-cost rivals like Primark, as well as from online disrupters such as Asos and Boohoo. The four brands acquired in Monday\u2019s deal posted sales of 1 billion pounds, Asos said. Boohoo, said last week it was in exclusive talks to buy three other Arcadia brands \u2014 Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton \u2014 in a deal that also won\u2019t include any stores.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

In terms of the engine, suspension, brakes and chassis, the bike is identical, but there are some other changes that set it apart. Honda CB350RS gets more youthful style Smaller rear wheel with fatter tyre Based on the base H'ness DLX model  Honda CB350RS style The biggest differences are in the styling, where the RS takes a more youthful stance. The bike gets black treatment replacing much of the chrome on the H'ness and it looks better because of it. The CB350RS is currently available in two colour options, a solid red or a very nice looking yellow and black combo. Adding to the bike's scrambler design theme is a small metal skid plate attached to the bottom of the frame, just ahead of the engine. The headlamp itself is the same, but it uses a matt black ring instead of chrome. However, the tail lamp is a new, smart looking rectangular LED unit and the RS also gets modern LED indicators as seen on Honda's bigger bikes. Honda CB350RS mechanical changes Another big visual change is in the use of sleeker fenders at the front and rear. Since these are now made from plastic and are smaller than the ones on the H'ness, they have helped to shave off 2 kilos from the kerb weight of the motorcycle, taking the total to 179kg. Perhaps the only significant mechanical change on this motorcycle is the switch from an 18-inch rear wheel to a 17-inch unit. The front tyre size is the same, but the rear is now a fatter 150 section unit. Honda has also switched over to chunky looking MRF Nylogrip Zapper Kurve tyres that were previously seen on the Bajaj V15. Thanks to the bigger, more rounded rear tyre, the ground clearance has actually gone up by 2mm, even though there has been no change made to the suspension travel. Honda CB350RS riding position The rider ergonomics have changed a little as well with a slightly lower and fatter handlebar, while the footpegs are a little more rear set. The RS no longer gets the heel gear shifter that was seen on the H'ness. The bike gets a new seat that is slightly wider for the rider, but seat height and seat length are both unchanged. Honda CB350RS features and price The CB350RS is priced at Rs 1.96 lakh for the Red colour variant and Rs 1.98 lakh for the dual tone option. That puts it nearly 10,000 rupees higher than the base CB 350 H'ness. The RS is also based on the standard H'ness model, which means it doesn't get the voice-controlled Bluetooth feature, the USB charger, or the dual horns that come with the DLX Pro variant of the H'ness.

And some of the greatest investors of all times stand proof of that. Here's a look at the journeys of some of the greatest investors of all times who have not shied away from taking risks, but have rather manipulated it to work in their best advantage such that the world has the wealth of knowledge to dip into.  1. Warren Buffett Warren Buffett started with his humble savings to become the most successful investor in the world. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, holds a stake in prominent companies like Apple, Coca Cola, American Express and Bank of America. The Oracle of Omaha recently surprised many by investing in a gold mining company. 2. George Soros A master of hedge fund investments, Soros is noted for his speculative investment strategies. He famously shorted the British Pound to make $1 billion on a single day in 1992. Soros's foundation helps companies formed by migrants and refugees.   Carl Icahn \u00b7 CNBC via Getty Images 3. Carl Icahn Remembered for his hostile takeover of TWA in the mid-80s, Carl Icahn started as a Wall Street stockbroker. His firm owns stakes in companies like Texaco, Western Union, Gulf & Western, Revlon and Marvel Comics. 4. John Clifton 'Jack' Bogle Jack Bogle was the founder of the Vanguard group that is acclaimed as a low-cost mutual fund company. Preaching a simple investment mantra, Bogle wrote the famous book, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing. 5. John Templeton Known as the pioneer of mutual funds, John Templeton was a successful bargain buyer. He invested in hidden gems in the stock market with astounding success. He was named as the Greatest Stock Picker of the Century by the Money magazine.   Rakesh Jhunjhunwala  \u00b7 Shailesh Andrade / reuters 6. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala The most-watched name in the Indian investing scene, Jhunjhunwala is a qualified chartered accountant who owns stakes across industries. He made his early fortune in companies like Tata Power and Sesa Goa. 7. Guo Guangchang The face of Shanghai-based Fosun International, Guo Guangchang is often referred to as China's Warren Buffett. He has stakes in real estate major Shanghai Forte Land, and Nanjing Iron and Steel. 8. Suleyman Kerimov His inspiring journey from an economist to one of Russia's most successful investors is peppered with some high profile trades. This includes Russian entities like Gazprom and Nafta Moskva and investments in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. 9. Peter Lynch Lynch is known for his Fidelity Magellan Fund management, which outperformed the S&P 500 Index in 11 of the 13 years he was in charge. Under him, the fund rose from $20 million to $14 billion!   Story continues 10. Benjamin GrahamMentor to Warren Buffett and John Templeton is a massive tag in itself. Graham averaged an annual return of 21% between 1936 and 1956 while keeping the margin of safety as a key investment priority.Often rising from humble origins, these investor's modus operandi ranged from safe play to bravado, and from an eye for detail to pure gut feeling. However, despite varying styles, the result in each case was an overwhelming success.Sourcehttps://www.rankred.com/most-successful-investors/https://groww.in/blog/meet-10-richest-investors/https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/06/top-10-greatest-investors-of-all-time/https://thecollegeinvestor.com/972/the-top-10-investors-of-all-time/https://trendlyne.com/portfolio/superstar-shareholders/53781/Q3-2020/rakesh-jhunjhunwala/  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorFeb 25, 2021, 09:00am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.Zotac's RTX 3060 Twin Edge graphics cardAntony Leather\nToday I'm reviewing Nvidia's (Nasdaq:NVDA)\u00a0(GeForce RTX 3060 - Nvidia's cheapest RTX 3000-series Ampere graphics card to date. Of course, with stock levels, crypto mining and general pandemic issues all causing chaos in terms of prices, the MSRP of $329 is perhaps optimistic seeing as every other card in Nvidia's Ampere range has been selling for vastly higher prices because of these issues, or hasn't been available at all.\n\n\nBut seeing as this is the case for everything out there right now, we can only make comparisons with what we've got and today that means seeing how the new card compares to the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 2060, its predecessor, and a card that Nvidia is reintroducing in the wake of dire stock levels and pricing.\nZotac's RTX 3060 Twin EdgeAntony Leather\n\nThere is one glimmer of hope, though, which is that Nvidia has curtailed the mining performance of the RTX 3060 on purpose to make it less appealing to would-be miners. In fact, the company is implementing a tamper-proof lockdown of the driver, RTX 3060 core and BIOS to halve mining performance. For those that are interested, I performed a quick test and saw a return of around 27MH/s mining Ethereum, which less than half what miners have reported from the RTX 3060 Ti. This means that other cards such as the AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT will likely be just as much if not more profitable and cheaper. It's not going to stop people using it for mining, but it's certainly less attractive than it might have been, especially compared to its predecessors.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nThis is a significantly less powerful card than the RTX 3060 Ti, with far fewer CUDA cores, Tensor cores and RT cores as well as a narrower 192-bit memory interface, compared to 256-bit for the RTX 3060 Ti. At first glance, the inclusion of 12GB memory seems overzealous given the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 all have less. However, this is down to the 192-bit memory interface. Each 32-bit chunk is tied to either 1GB or 2GB of GDDR6 memory. With the RTX 3060 Ti, the logical thing to do was to have 8GB, with 32 dividing into its 256-bit bus eight times. With a 192-bit memory interface, Nvidia had two choices - go with 6GB or 12GB and with AMD reportedly readying lower-end Radeon 6000-series cards with sizeable amounts of RAM, a 6GB RTX 3060 would have looked a little lacking. That's my theory anyway.\n\nRTX 3060 versus RTX 2060 (FE)Nvidia\n\n\nTest system and benchmarksMy water-cooled test system includes an Intel Core i9-10900K, 16GB of RAM, an MSI MEG Z490 Ace ... [+] motherboard and Barrow Rhopilema test benchAntony Leather\nNvidia doesn't make a Founders Edition model of the RTX 3060 so I used a Zotac RTX 3060 Twin Edge graphics card.\nI used Nvidia's 461.64 release driver for the RTX 3060 testing along with a fully up-to-date version of Windows 10. The benchmarks focus on 1080p and 1440p as these are the resolutions potential customers of the RTX 3060 will be focussing on. However, I have performed additional testing at 4K in specific titles for comparison when using DLSS. The test system used an MSI MEG Z490 Ace, Intel Core i9-10900K, 16GB 3466MHz Corsair memory and an Intel 760p SSD along with a custom watercooling system.\nFar Cry New Dawn\nAt 1080p the RTX 3060 sat evenly between the RTX 2060 and RTX 3060 Ti, with the latter offering significantly more performance - around a 23 percent boost, while the new card was 21 percent quicker on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate than the aging RTX 2060. Stepping up to 1440p and it was a similar story - the RTX 3060 Ti offered 32 percent more performance while the RTX 3060 was 27 percent quicker than the RTX 3060.\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWith ray tracing and DLSS disabled, the minimum 99th percentile frame rate was 25 percent higher than the RTX 2060 at 1080p, but the RTX 3060 was much closer to the RTX 3060 Ti here with a deficit of just 15 percent. Enabling DLSS and ray tracing saw the performance advantage over the older card reduce to nine percent, but it was a similar situation with the RTX 3060 Ti, which was just eight percent faster.\nWith RTX features enabled at 1440p, the gap leaped up to a 21 percent boost over the RTX 2060 on the minimum 99th percentile frame rate, but the RTX 3060 Ti offered 29 percent more grunt here. Switching RTX features off, saw a 27 percent higher minimum 99th percentile than the RTX 2060, with the RTX 3060 Ti offering a 17 percent lead.\n\nBorderlands 3\nAt 1080p it was another RTX 3060 sandwich, placed evenly between the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 2060. The new card is a compelling upgrade over the 2060, but the RTX 3060 Ti gives you a lot more grunt for your cash. The same was true at 1440p, with the RTX 3060 being the card with the lowest original retail price to top 50fps (53fps) on the minimum 99th percentile, while then RTX 2060 could only manage 44fps.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nWith RTX features off, at 1080p it was yet another evenly placed position for the RTX 3060, sitting squarely between the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 2060, albeit with the RTX 3060 Ti offering less of a lead on the average frame rate. At 1440p the RTX 3060 was a huge amount faster than the RTX 2060 with over 50% more performance and the RTX 3060 coming close to matching the mighty RTX 2080 too.\nThe really impressive result, though, was enabling ray tracing and DLSS, where at 4K, the RTX 3060 managed a playable 99th percentile of 28fps and average of 37fps, completely out gunning the RTX 2060 and even matching the Radeon RX 6800.\n\nMetro Exodus\nWith ray tracing enabled, the RTX 3060 offered a massive lead over the RTX 2060 at 1080p in Metro Exodus, with a 99th percentile minimum frame rate of 34fps versus 26fps - a difference of 31 percent, sitting evenly between it and the RTX 3060 Ti. At 1440p it was less impressive with less than 10 percent between the cards and both falling back from the RTX 3060 Ti by some margin, with a similar story playing out if we disable RTX features at 1440p too.\nLoad system power consumption\nThe RTX 3060 saw a 40W lower peak system power draw than the RTX 3060 Ti and drew barely 20W more than the RTX 2060 for a whole lot more gaming performance. It should be noted that the Zotax RTX 3060 Twin Edge card I was using was barely audible throughout the tests too.\nConclusion\nIt's tricky to draw any conclusions from a graphics card launch at the moment as prices and stock levels are all over the place. Cutting the mining performance for the RTX 3060 was a good move as it's potentially turned the RTX 3060 from being a mining king into something mediocre, but given crypto prices right now, it's anyone's guess as to whether this will be enough to deter miners completely.Zotac's RTX 3060 Twin EdgeAntony Leather\nActual performance is roughly where I expected it to be, offering a compelling. bordering on excellent upgrade from an RTX 2060 in most tests, with one or two exceptions, but with the RTX 3060 Ti offering noticeably more grunt, especially for 1440p gaming. The RTX 3060's ability to offer playable frame rates at 4K with DLSS enabled in some titles is also a handy feather to have in its cap, although again, if you'll be dabbling with 4K/DLSS then the RTX 3060 Ti is probably worth paying extra for.\nNormally at this time we'd be saying goodbye to previous generations of cards and ushering in the RTX 3060 as the new low-mid range king, at least until we've seen AMD's equivalent in early March, but with the reintroduction of the RTX 2060 to appease gamers, these are strange times. Ultimately, it could be a very good card indeed and a particularly good upgrade for GTX 1060 and RTX 2060 owners. We can only hope prices sit at near normal levels and that you can actually buy one. If you do decide to go for it, Zotac's RTX 3060 Twin Edge is fantastic. It's compact, cool and extremely quiet.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday we get the first new graphics card of 2021, namely the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060. This is the fifth consumer graphics card to use Nvidia's Ampere architecture, following on from the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, RTX 3090 and most recently the RTX 3060 Ti. Unlike the cards that have come before it though, there is no Founders Edition of this card, it's purely down to the likes of Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and Zotac et al. to see what they can do with this latest Ampere GPU. The cards will go on sale at 9am PT (12pm ET / 5pm UK). As ever, make sure you're ready to go when the sales embargo drops because once again we're expecting these new cards to see out in minutes, if not seconds.\u00a0RTX 3060 Stock CheckFind GeForce RTX 3060s in the US:\nBest Buy\nAmazon US\nNewegg\nB&H Photo \nMicro Centre\nNvidia.com (partner directory)Find GeForce RTX 3060s in the UK:\nOverclockers UK\nScan\nEbuyer\nNovatech\nCCL Online\nNvidia.com (partner directory)Nvidia has yet again upped the performance over the previous generation, and if you've been holding off for a few years, then there's a nice performance jump on offer if you can actually get your hands on one. Pricing starts at $329 (\u00a3299), which is very tempting, although it's worth noting that the RTX 3060 Ti offers a significant performance boost for what is only $70 more.\u00a0There is an obvious problem here of course, and that is no one can get their hands on the RTX 3060 Ti either, so your options are either try and pick up one of these new cards or wait until the others cards come back in stock. And we don't expect that to happen in any serious volume until April or even May at this point.\u00a0So if you are interested in picking up a GeForce RTX 3060, what is the best way of actually getting your virtual hands on one? Start by setting up accounts for any of the major retailers that you want to buy from. Doing this at the time of purchase pretty much guarantees that your card will disappear out of your virtual basket by the time you get to the checkout. Newegg recommends using its mobile app for faster checkout. Some retailers have also warned against refreshing\u00a0too\u00a0often, as we're all wont to do during this time, as that may cause the server to put you in a brief timeout.Check the boxout to the side of this article for links to retailers we expect to have stock today, and as ever keep an eye out for our live blog below, where we'll be watching over stock levels from across the web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh \n\n2021-02-25T15:16:52.781Z\nThe RTX 3060 review embargo has already lifted, so be sure to check out our review of the Zotac GeForce RTX 3060 12GB Twin Edge. You can't buy the cards just yet, that embargo lifts at 9am PT (12pm ET / 5pm UK).Note that there is no Founders Edition for the GeForce RTX 3060, so you won't be able to buy these cards directly from Nvidia or from a site that it's set up to look after such things.\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:03:25.918Z\nThese RTX 3060s are coming in a bit more expensive than the recommended retail price would suggest. The cheapest we've seen so far on Best Buy is this EVGA card that will set you back $389:\u00a0(Image credit: Best Buy)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:07:23.193Z\nIf you like to add a bit more luck to proceedings, you can always try your hand at the Newegg shuffle (what a time to be alive)(Image credit: Newegg)\n\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:10:18.215Z\nIt looks like the pressure is getting to the Ebuyer hamster.\u00a0(Image credit: Ebuyer)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:14:39.940Z\nThe cards that were briefly out were rocking some alarming price tags. We know graphics cards are in high demand right now, but \u00a3399.99 for this card doesn't make a lot of sense. Well they wouldn't make sense if it wasn't for the fact that you can't get anything else right now.(Image credit: Zotac)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:20:39.001Z\nScan looks like they have three different models in stock, but once you click through on them, you end up searching for the buy button in vain.\u00a0(Image credit: Scan)\n\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:27:06.817Z\nMicro Center seems to have stock, but only for in-store customers. We've just called through to see what the deal is and it's purely on a first-come, first-served basis. \u00a0\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:28:49.192Z\nAmazon US more or less telling us what you're going to expect trying to track down an RTX 3060 this afternoon.(Image credit: Amazon)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:31:58.565Z\nHas anyone had any luck getting an RTX 3060 for themselves? We've seen precious few out there. Here we are 30 mins after the official launch and I'm guessing that if you don't have one by now, you probably won't find one now.\n\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:34:09.624Z\nCan we just take a moment to appreciate how brilliant this Overclockers screen is? I mean it's not a page you want to find yourself on when trying to buy a graphics card, but we couldn't help but smile a little.(Image credit: Overclockers)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:37:06.575Z\nIt's a waiting game at B&H Photo as more and more GPUs are slowly becoming available for sale (selling out) throughout the hour. Here's the list of RTX 3060s currently available on the site.(Image credit: B&H)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:42:45.545Z\nThere's a load of RTX 3060s listed over on Box.co.uk but the pricing for all of them is down as \u00a3TBC now, which probably means you're out of luck for grabbing one.(Image credit: Box.co.uk)\n\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:48:00.531Z\nThere's no Founders Edition of the RTX 3060, so the Nvidia shop is just linking through to online retailers that may have had stock at some point. There's something about the Nvidia green on those Check Availability buttons that gives you a sense of hope that maybe, just maybe, there is stock.(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:50:25.489Z\nAs Jorge rightly asks, why are some of these cards so expensive? The RTX 3060 should be a 'budget' offering, if $329 can really be considered budget.\u00a0\n\n\n2021-02-25T17:59:06.990Z\nWell, much like every other graphics card launch we've seen recently, this looks like another disappointing moment for anyone looking to upgrade or build a new gaming PC. I'd recommend picking up lesser alternatives, but there are next to no cards out there no matter how low you are prepared to go.\u00a0One option would be to go for a pre-built system, although here we'd definitely recommend upgrading to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which simply has a bit more oomph behind it.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n2021-02-25T18:17:59.941Z\nIf you're still dead set on securing an RTX 3060, Origin is one of the few system builders taking orders on systems that can be customized with the hard to get GPU. Keep in mind that these PCs are looking at about a three-week lead time for deliveries.\u00a0(Image credit: ORIGIN)\n\n\n2021-02-25T18:29:51.787Z\nFinally, on the mobile gaming front, Best Buy and Newegg have inventory on a handful of gaming laptops ranging from $1000-$2000 with RTX 3060 GPUs.\u00a0We will keep you posted on RTX 3060 availability throughout the week.(Image credit: Best Buy)\n\n\n\nMore about graphics cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus appears to have quietly changed the design of its Q-Release PCIe slot after claims of potential GPU pin damage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree lucky folks in India can win the dubious honour of buying an RTX 5080 GPU at Nvidia MSRP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's Wordle answer for Sunday, March 16\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE BUYING GUIDESLATEST GAME REVIEWS1Best Steam Deck accessories in Australia for 2025: Our favorite docks, powerbanks and gamepads2Best graphics card for laptops in 2025: the mobile GPUs I'd want in my next gaming laptop3Best mini PCs in 2025: The compact computers I love the most 4Best 14-inch gaming laptop in 2025: The top compact gaming laptops I've held in these hands5Best Mini-ITX motherboards in 2025: My pick from all the mini mobo marvels I've tested 1Fragpunk review: A radical reshaping of the first-person shooter2Rise of the Ronin review: An ambitious ARPG totally wrecked by poor PC optimisation 3Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro earbud review4SteelSeries QcK Performance mouse pad review5Alienware 27 AW2725Q QD-OLED gaming monitor review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The reports spread from one French source and so far I haven't seen any announcements from AIBs or retailers about the RTX 2060 / Super situation. So that could still happen, but it is very much a rumour.\nA few hours ago a more solid report about the re-introduction of old GPUs to fulfil the yearning gap for PC graphics cards was shared by TechTuber TechYesCity. However, the market situation seems to be dictating even more desperate measures to fill the PC DIY store shelves \u2013 namely the re-introduction of the venerable GeForce GTX 1050 Ti.\n\nIf you are in the market for a new graphics card, it hardly needs saying that these essential gaming PC components are pretty thin on the ground right now. Having a quick look over online retailers in the UK like Amazon and Scan I could only find a single GeForce XX60 card that was purchasable at the time of writing: a PNY GeForce RTX 2060 Dual at \u00a3360 with a due date of 30th March\u2026 Stock only started to re-appear when I scrolled down the Nvidia offerings as far as the GT710 \u2013 gulp.\nSo there is definitely a void to be addressed and if Nvidia and partners can push out significant quantities of GTX 1050 Ti cards they will likely be welcome to people building a 1080p gaming PC or just making do until the stock of their ideal GPU eventually arrives. Apparently graphics cards with 4GB of less VRAM aren't useful for mining Ethereum anymore, so if such cards are snapped up it is quite definite that they will be used by consumers.\nAustralia-based TechYesCity says that at least one retailer hasn't seen stocks of GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards for two years or so, yet they have recently become available again. Indeed, back in January 2019 Nvidia talked to investors about efforts to sell off old GTX 10 family GPUs, so it could move forward with Turing.\n\nSome Googling by VideoCardz reveals that US site Newegg has multiple RTX 1050 Ti samples in stock and available to purchase right now. The problem is that rather than even selling them at the 2016 MSRP many samples are listed at over US$350 up to $439 for new (not used) models. The UK Scan stock it uncovered is now gone, but I can still see some Palit and MSI models listed at Overclockers, starting from \u00a3189.\n\nIf you are interested in the performance of these old Pascal cards, HEXUS reviewed two Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards back in 2016, the MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Gaming X, and the EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti SC Gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Something REALLY needs to be done now, you literally can not buy a \u2018high end\u2019 gpu\u2026.I've seen people on forums who are still waiting since release last year (September) for their card\u2026 it's not all down to the pandemic after nearly 5 months that's for sure.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Thu 11 Feb 2021 16:40\n                \n\n\n\n\n            Noise is that the GTX1050TI is being released because of it's use of GDDR5 meaning it isn't great at mining. However,the GTX1650 and GTX1660 were the same,so why not re-release them too??\n            \n            \n            \n\n\nSEE NEWER \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin |\n                Register\n\nA\nA\nA\n\nFull HEXUS Site\n\nAbout Us -\n                Contact Us -\n                Advertise -\n                T&Cs \n\n\n\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, got a lift from the recently sold-off technology and communications sectors; stocks such as Facebook (FB, +1.2%), Nvidia (NVDA, +3.1%) and Microsoft (MSFT, +1.5%) helped lead a modest 0.6% rebound in the tech-heavy index.Warren Buffett Stocks Ranked: The Berkshire Hathaway PortfolioDespite the rebound, the Nasdaq remained down 4.9% for the week, the result of interest-rate fears, versus 1.8% and 2.4% losses for the Dow and S&P 500, respectively.\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\n\"Many market participants have referenced the infamous 'Taper Tantrum' in 2013 as a similar playbook to today as a reason why we're seeing equity market weakness,\" says Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network. But he also points out that \"the notable difference today ... is that the Fed seems very committed to letting the economy run a little hotter than normal and will tolerate higher inflation.\"Other action in the stock market today:The small-cap Russell 2000 eked out a marginal gain to 2,201.U.S. crude oil futures sank 3.2% to $61.50 per barrel, but still finished February up 18%.Gold futures sank, too, dropping 2.6% to $1,728.80 per ounce, plumbing nine-month lows.Bitcoin prices, at $48,870 on Thursday, dropped 5.1% to $46,381. (Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day; prices reported here are as of 4 p.m. each trading day.)The 21 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2021Earnings Estimates Are Looking Up!Whatever the market faces in the short term, analysts see better times further on in the year.Economic expectations are improving as more Americans are inoculated against COVID-19; nearly 14% of the population has received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That has analysts quickly scaling up their earnings estimates. Current-quarter profit expectations have improved by 5% over the first two months of Q1. According to FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters, that's \"the second-highest increase in the bottom-up EPS estimate during the first two months of a quarter since FactSet began tracking this metric in Q2 2002,\" trailing only Q1 2018's 5.7% increase.That augurs well for much of the market \u2013 including a number of dividend-rich sectors and industries. Many real estate investment trusts (REITs), especially in the retail and hospitality industries, are poised for better results as foot traffic picks up. And an economic recovery bodes well for business development companies (BDCs), as well as the small and midsized businesses in which they invest.Investors will find plenty of attractive income opportunities across the equity board \u2013 though if you're looking for somewhere to start, we suggest you begin with our list of 21 high-quality (and high-yielding) stocks that are suitable for those looking to retirement (or even in it). These names offer an appealing blend of payout potential and income stability that just about any long-term buy-and-holder can appreciate.DisclaimerKyle Woodley was long NVDA and Bitcoin as of this writing.25 Dividend Stocks the Analysts Love Most for 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Kiplinger Today newsletter \u2014 freeProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

AMD has designed Smart Access Memory to get the best of its own hardware, and as such it only works with the newer Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs when paired with AMD Ryzen 5000 series CPUs on AMD 500 series motherboards.The best GPU for AMD Smart Access Memory: MSI AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT 16G ($1000 at Best Buy)The best CPU for AMD Smart Access Memory: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X ($800 at Best Buy)What is AMD Smart Access Memory?AMD Smart Access Memory is a part of the feature set for the new Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards. It leverages the power of the latest AMD hardware to give you a performance boost in games. Smart Access Memory is basically a fully open data channel between the CPU and GPU, which means the GPUs VRAM can be fully used, rather than being limited to 256 MB, which is usually the case.AMD Smart Access Memory only runs on an all-AMD setup. You will need a Radeon RX 6000 series GPU paired with a Ryzen 5000 series CPU, running on an AMD 500 series chipset motherboard. It does not support Intel CPUs or NVIDIA GPUs. It's nothing new, but just AMD's rebranding of the \"resizable Base Address Register (BAR) support\" feature that has existed since PCIe 3.0 came around. However, this implementation is exclusive to the new AMD GPUs and doesn't work with NVIDIA graphics cards.AMD claims that it can boost performance by up to 16%. In our AMD Smart Access Memory benchmarks, we concluded that's not going to be as much of a game-changer as NVIDIA's DLSS, but it's a nice boost to have if you pick AMD.AMD Smart Access Memory system requirements and setupAMD Smart Access Memory has a few hardware and software requirements to work. Basically, you need the latest AMD hardware and software to get Windows to use that promised performance boost. Here are the requirements:An AMD 500 series motherboardAn AMD Ryzen 5000 series CPUAn AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPUAMD Radeon Software Driver 20.11.2 or newerLatest AMD AGESA 1.1.0.0 Motherboard BIOSEnabling AMD Smart Access Memory isn't very hard, but it requires a visit to your system BIOS. You can access it by pressing the Delete or F12 key when your system is starting up. Once you're in, navigate to the Advanced Settings or Advanced menu, and enable \"Above 4G Decoding\" and \"Re-Size BAR Support.\" That's all!If you have to, you can disable Smart Access Memory by disabling the same options in the BIOS. The performance change varies by system, and as we found out in our testing, some games may see a decrease in performance. We recommend that you check the performance in the games you play before enabling Smart Access Memory and again after you enable it. If it works for your games and you see a performance boost, you can keep it on.\n\n\n\nBest GPU with Smart Access Memory support\nMSI AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT 16G\n\n\n $1000 at Best Buy\nTeam Red gaming championThe MSI AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT 16G is a solid purchase if you're looking to buy AMD's best GPU without having to pay more than the base price.

NVIDIA first announced its newest mainstream graphics cards in early January, and it will officially launch on February 25th.\r\n\n\nHowever, one thing that many people have wondered is just how hard will it be to obtain a GeForce RTX 3060. After all, given its $329 price tag, it's sure to be a hot ticket item. Well, NVIDIA is trying to alleviate at least some demand to make sure that the GeForce RTX 3060 gets into the hands of enthusiasts and not\u00a0cryptocurrency miners\u00a0looking to make big bucks on the side.\n\n\nIn this case, NVIDIA is altering the drivers for the GeForce RTX 3060 to \"detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm\" when miners attempt to use the cards. When the drivers detect these patterns being utilized, the software will automatically limit the hash rate by roughly 50 percent, negating any usefulness of deploying the card for mining.\n\n\nNVIDIA hopes that with this information out in the open, it will dissuade miners from trying to gobble up the value-priced cards, hence leaving precious inventory available to enthusiasts who will use the cards for their intended purpose: gaming.\n\r\nThe\u00a0GeForce RTX 3060\u00a0will slot in under the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti in NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere lineup. With a price tag of $329, it is also $70 cheaper than its faster sibling, although it does come with the advantage of 12GB of GDDR6 instead of 8GB, as found on the\u00a0GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.\nNVIDIA CMP HX GPU\n\n\nHowever, NVIDIA isn't completely slamming the door on cryptocurrency mining, as it sees a potential market to tap there. So, the company is also announcing the new Crypto Mining Processor (CMP HX), a brand-new product line strictly aimed at the \"professional mining\" market.\n\n\nThese will be barebones cards that come without display outputs and only include the necessary components to perform one simple job: mine for cryptocurrency quickly and efficiently. This is helped in part by lower peak core voltages and frequencies, which helps to improve overall mining efficiency.\u00a0\n\n\nNVIDIA's little detour with the CMP will also allow it to generate revenue from GPUs that couldn't pass muster in garden variety GeForce RTX graphics cards.\u00a0As NVIDIA puts it, \u201cThey don\u2019t meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU and, thus, don\u2019t impact the availability of GeForce GPUs to gamers.\u201d\nNVIDIA says that cards will be available from its partners like ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, and Palit starting in Q1 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, bitcoin, cryptocurrency, (nasdaq:nvda), ethereum, geforce rtx 3060, nvidia cmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Cards like those bring the new GeForce RTX 3060 (tested here in the $329.99 EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G) into some pretty tough company.  Our test card, focused squarely on the needs of gamers playing at either 1080p or 1440p, is a better successor to the GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition. It does the job, but it doesn't wow us as much as the rest of the Ampere line. For PC builders obsessed with keeping their desktops compact, the compact profile of EVGA's card is its primary selling point. Most other shoppers will be better served in gaming with a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or even an RTX 2060 (on discount, if you can find one) instead. Sure, 2020 was a crazy year, but with the Patriots failing to make the Super Bowl and Nvidia releasing its first ho-hum RTX 30 Series card, could this be a harbinger of an even more topsy-turvy 2021?The Design: Filling a Founders Edition-Size HoleThus far in the GeForce RTX 30 Series, Nvidia has spearheaded each of its GPUs' debuts with an Nvidia-designed Founders Edition card to represent the pack. Those cards have been complete with a revolutionary new PCB up to 50% smaller than the boards on previous-gen RTX cards and a push-pull cooling system unlike anything we've seen before.\u00a0Unfortunately the GeForce RTX 3060 is the first GPU in the RTX 30 Series not to get the same treatment. No Founders Edition RTX 3060s will be made available as a part of this launch, which leaves it up to third-party manufacturers to deliver the RTX 3060 goods with more-recognizable designs of their own.EVGA's GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G is a dual-slot, two-fan graphics card that measures barely shy of 8 inches long (7.94 inches, to be exact), just over 1.5 inches shorter than Nvidia's Founders Edition design of the RTX 3060 Ti. For anyone who values a compact installation profile over nearly anything else, this card might be the better choice over the chunkier RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition.\u00a0The card uses a single traditional eight-pin power connector on the top of the card. Moving to the backplane of the card, it's all standard fare for the RTX 30 Series, with three DisplayPort 1.4b ports, plus one HDMI 2.1 output. The oft-seen VirtualLink from the RTX 20-Series \"Turing\" cards looks to be long in the dust for Nvidia at this point, so anyone still holding out for one of those would be better served going with a RTX 20 Series card instead. (Not that it's useful for much more than as a USB-C port.)GeForce RTX 3060 Specs: An RTX 3050 by Any Other Name...Let's look at some specs first. We'll see how the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G stacks up against the two GeForce cards it's meant to succeed, the RTX 2060 and 2060 Super, as well as AMD's closest competition, in the Radeon RX 5700 XT and Radeon RX 5700...First, the obvious: aren't these two cards issued out of order? Save for a fringe case or two over the years, Nvidia releases the \"Ti\" variant of its various GPUs in their stack after the original model goes on sale, not the other way around. But the RTX 3060 Ti indeed debuted first, at the end of 2020. Second, there's the difference in underlying GPU dies. While the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is based on the GA106 die, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is based on GA104 (the same die in the\u00a0RTX 3070\u00a0and RTX 3080). Why has Nvidia decided to split a card tier in half by using different dies? We can't say, but regardless of the reasoning, the end result is two very different RTX 3060s, one Ti and one not, that might as well have been released years apart, as far as benchmarks go.The RTX 3060 GPU comes with twice the available VRAM of its predecessor, doubling the 6GB from the RTX 2060 Founders Edition to 12GB in the newer card. That's also 4GB more than the RTX 3060 Ti, and, on the drawing board, this should give the RTX 3060 a viable lead over its predecessors in more intensive titles running at resolutions of 1440p or higher. But, as we'll get into in the benchmarks, all the extra VRAM in the world may not be enough to obscure the RTX 3060's own misbranding.Next, there's the price gap. The EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G, along with many other models of RTX 3060, will retail starting at $329, just $70 less than the MSRP of the RTX 3060 Ti ($399). And while that card did wow us with higher-than-expected results in almost every test we ran, it still doesn't account for the significant gap in price-to-performance between itself and its non-Ti variant.The performance makes perfect sense, though, when you consider the differences between GA106 and GA104. So the big question is why this GPU is called an \"RTX 3060\" at all.It's likely this card would have gotten higher marks if it were marketed (and priced) more in line with its performance. Say, for example, if the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti had launched as the RTX 3060 back in December, and this current RTX 3060 we're reviewing today had been bumped down to a new entry-level ray-tracing card (and I'm just spitballing here): the \"RTX 3050.\" But as an \"RTX 3060,\" the named successor to the RTX 2060 and the RTX 2060 Super (both great cards in their own right), the GA106 die just isn't up to the role.\u00a0Let's Talk About Stock, BabyAnd then there's the stock situation. By this point, it's no secret that graphics cards of all shapes, stripes, sizes, and brands are experiencing a stock squeeze at levels not seen since the first cryptocurrency mining boom a few years back, and the problem only looks to be getting worse as the months go on.\u00a0This time around it's a double-header, with COVID-related delays and cryptocurrency price surges hitting Nvidia and AMD from both sides. As people find themselves spending more time indoors, the demand for PC components (especially gaming-focused ones) has risen across the board. Desktop GPUs and CPUs are already selling out minutes after they launch, and when you add cryptocurrency's second renaissance on top of it\u2014as of this writing, Bitcoin was trading above $45,000, a several-hundred-percent increase from the same time last year\u2014you've got the perfect recipe for scalpers, high prices, and buying battles with bots.\u00a0As a response, Nvidia announced that the GeForce RTX 3060 will be the first graphics card in the RTX 30 Series to be released with a hash limitation baked into the hardware-level instructions of the GPU. The company claims this limiter will be \"uncrackable,\" and should, at least in theory, discourage cryptocurrency mining operations from using bots to sweep up the stock before anyone else has a chance to reserve their spot in the checkout line. (Scalpers, on the other hand, may well still try to gouge gamers.)In case that's not enough to deter them, though, the company also announced an entirely separate line of crypto-mining-specific cards under the \"Nvidia CMP HX\" brand. (CMP is for \"Cryptocurrency Mining Processor.\") These CMP cards will specifically focus their efforts on mining coins like Ethereum more efficiently than standard GPUs, while also (hopefully) freeing up the rest of the supply chain to gamers instead.It's unlikely that the introduction of Nvidia CMP HX cards at an undetermined point somewhere \"during Q1 and Q2\" will affect the stock of RTX 3060 cards that are launching today, but we applaud the company for making an effort, at the least, to meet both markets' ravenous demand for cards.Testing the RTX 3060: Nvidia's First RTX 30-Series Folly?PC Labs ran the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G through a series of DirectX 11- and 12-based synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our PC Labs test rig is Intel-based and employs a PCI Express 3.0, not 4.0, motherboard. It's equipped with an Intel Core i9-10900K processor, 16GB of G.Skill DDR4 memory, a solid-state boot drive, and an Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero (Wi-Fi) motherboard. Given our tests with the Core i9-10900K and recent Ryzen 9 CPUs, this rig is the best reasonable configuration of the moment in 2021 to cut the CPU out of the equation for frame rates. (Read more about how we test graphics cards.)For our testing, we focused some of the effort on the esports aspect of the RTX 3060 with games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and Rainbow Six: Siege. We also ran the card through the rest of our standard benchmark regimen, which tests a card's abilities to handle AAA games at the highest possible quality settings, as well as how it performs in synthetic benchmarks that stress the card in a variety of ways.Recommended by Our EditorsNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition - ReviewAMD Radeon RX 6800 - ReviewAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT - ReviewAlso remember that almost every test we run (aside from the esports titles) is done at the highest possible quality preset or settings. If you have a higher-hertz gaming monitor and you're worried your card might not make the frame-rate grade, it could still be possible with the right card and a combination of lower settings. Not only that, but many of these titles (including Death Stranding, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and F1 2020) have both DLSS and FidelityFX CAS with Upscaling integrated directly into the game. This can mean boosts of up to 40% more performance on top, depending on the setting and the card you're playing with.And so, onward to our test results. Note: If you want to narrow down our results below to a specific resolution (say, the resolution of the monitor you plan to game on), click the other resolution dots in the chart legends below to suppress them and see fewer results. Our list of AAA titles includes a mix of recent AAA titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 and F1 2020, as well as some older-but-still-reliable pillars of the benchmarker's toolkit, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Far Cry 5.Testing Results: Synthetic BenchmarksSynthetic benchmarks can be good predictors of real-world gaming performance. UL's circa-2013 Fire Strike Ultra is still a go-to as an approximation of the load levied by mainstream 4K gaming. We're looking only at the test's Graphics Subscore, not the Overall Score, to isolate the card performance. Meanwhile, we also ran 3DMark's Time Spy Extreme test, which is a good test of how well a card will do specifically in DirectX 12 games at 4K resolution. Finally, there's Port Royal, which is strictly a test for RTX cards right now, measuring how well they handle ray-tracing tasks. (Thus why blank results for the AMD cards on that one.) Also here are a handful of GPU-acceleration tests (Furmark and LuxMark); more details on those at the \"how we test\" link above.In runs like 3DMark, the RTX 3060 XC Black looked to hit driver-level ceilings in both our Fire Strike Ultra and Port Royal runs, a result that proved anomalous from the rest of our synthetic testing, but not by much. These results signal the start of a long road for the RTX 3060 XC Black, where it almost always finds itself trailing the RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition by a margin that make it hard to put them in the same class.Testing Results: Recent AAA GamesNow, on to the real-world games that you can play. We typically used in each case (for these AAA games) the highest in-game preset and, if available, DirectX 12. In contrast, the multiplayer-focused and esports titles (such as CS:GO and Rainbow Six: Siege) coming up in the next chart group were set slightly below top detail settings to maximize frame rates.The RTX 3060 XC Black (like the RTX 2060 and 2060 Super before it) proves to be a contested consideration for anyone who wants to play AAA games at either 1440p or 1080p, however 4K gamers will want to lean more heavily into the performance of cards like the RTX 3070 to get them over the smooth 60-frame-per-second (fps) finish line. That said, it's still behind where it should be, and it doesn't justify its position enough with these results to stand out in the way Nvidia might have intended.Testing Results: Multiplayer GamesThough most of PC Labs' game tests are maxed out in graphical fidelity to push the cards to their limit, multiplayer gaming is all about maintaining the best balance between graphical fidelity and frame rate. With that in mind, we've kept CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Final Fantasy XIV tuned to the best combination of necessary improvements in settings (higher anti-aliasing and lower shadows, for example), while still trying to keep frame rates for 1080p games above 144fps.Why 144fps? That's a coveted target for highly competitive esports gamers who have high-refresh-rate 144Hz or higher gaming monitors. For more casual players with ordinary 60Hz monitors, a solid 80fps or 90fps at your target resolution, with some overhead to prevent dips under 60fps, is fine.This is an important category of games for the RTX 3060 to nail; the card is priced to straddle the line between midrange AAA gamers and ultra-high refresh multiplayer esports obsessives. In these tests, the RTX 3060 handles its job just fine. (Few cards except those at the low end struggle here.) However, it was still 27% slower than the RTX 3060 Ti in Rainbow Six at 4K, a common result as we've seen from the rest of the tests above.If you're looking for a good budget card to power reliably fast frame rates in most multiplayer games, your best bet continues to be (even in 2021), midrange cards like those based on the GeForce RTX 1660 Ti (we reviewed an MSI GeForce RTX 1660 Ti Gaming X 6G) or the AMD Radeon RX 5600XT. (For that one, we tested a Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 5600XT.)Testing Results: Legacy AAA TitlesNext, let's see how the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 does with some past-their-prime AAA titles. We ran some quick tests on some oldies-but-goodies that still offer the AAA gaming experience. These legacy tests include runs of Hitman: Absolution, Sleeping Dogs, Tomb Raider (2013), and Bioshock: Infinite, the last being a game that has no business still being as well optimized as it is here in 2020.To round us out, the legacy tests tell more of the same story we've already seen in previous benchmarks. The RTX 3060 is regularly slower than the RTX 3060 Ti by a ratio that outstretches the price gap between the two, and its gains over the RTX 2060 (10% overall) aren't enough to sell us on the idea that the two cards are supposed to be a generation apart from one another.Overclocking and Thermals: A Choice for Compact BuildersWe ran a 10-minute stress test in 3DMark Port Royal on the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G, and found that the card was hovering around a max of 68 degrees C, a full 8 degrees hotter than the RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition, which hit a max of just 60 degrees C in the same run.In testing the overclocking capacity of the RTX 3060, I was able to achieve a stable OC profile of +225MHz on the boost clock speed, while adding 300MHz to the memory clock. This amounted to just over a 12% boost in clock, which translated to roughly 4% more performance across games like Far Cry 5, and some synthetic 3DMark runs. Not huge, but not nothin'.Verdict: Suffering From SuccessIn nearly every test we ran, synthetic or otherwise, the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G was anywhere between 20% to 50% slower than the RTX 3060 Ti, while only costing roughly 20% less. The card was also slower than the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Radeon RX 5700 XT in several runs, and it just barely manages to outpace the GeForce RTX 2060 Super by a few percentage points, in most cases.\u00a0The underwhelming launch of the RTX 3060 seems more a result of expectations set by Nvidia's classic card-marketing names than the fault of the engineers at the company, who until now have issued great RTX 30-Series GPUs at prices that reflect the generational gap between 20 Series and 30 Series.Prior to the GeForce RTX 3060, Nvidia was three for three on Editors' Choice awards from PCMag on its Founders Edition cards in the RTX 30 Series. And while there's nothing wrong with EVGA's design here, the GPU engine powering the works underneath the shroud is ultimately the cause for concern.For the first time since last September, a new GPU entering into the RTX 30 Series line won't be receiving an Editors' Choice award from us. If you can find one, the GeForce RTX 2060 Super will do the job nearly as well as the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming 12G, and perhaps for a lower cost depending on the source. Meanwhile, AMD-faithful shoppers can rest easy that both the RX 5700 XT and RX 5700 still provide viable alternatives to the RTX 3060, though their position in the marketplace is shaky with the stellar RTX 3060 Ti hanging around in the rafters.We know the video-card stock situation is brutal out there, and that you'll be lucky to find any of the alternatives to this card anywhere close to their launch prices at the moment. But skip the eBay gougers on this one and, if you simply have to pay too much money for a video card, let it be an RTX 3060 Ti instead.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PCMag Middle East newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Chris Stobing\n\n\n\n\nI'm a senior analyst charged with testing and reviewing VPNs and other security apps for PCMag.

We now have an official press release for this upcoming GPU, as well as confirmation of the $329 USD price and a release date: February 25. Oh, and it\u2019s a partner-only launch, so no Founders Edition card.\nThe new GPU will have significantly more memory than the previous entry in the 3060 family with 12GB of GDDR6, compared to 8GB with the RTX 3060 Ti. This makes more sense when the 192-bit memory interface is taken into account (the RTX 3060 Ti has a 256-bit bus), as NVIDIA\u2019s options were essentially to release the card with 6GB, or 12GB. I\u2019m sure buyers will be happy for the larger number.\n \n\n\nFrom the above screenshot (an excerpt of the specs available here) we see a CUDA core count of 3584, which would place the SM count at 28. Base Clock is slightly lower than the RTX 3060 Ti at 1.32 GHz (vs. 1.41 GHz), but Boost Clock is higher than the Ti \u2013 1.78 GHz vs. 1.67 GHz.\nNVIDIA lists GPU power at 13 shader TFLOPs, 25 RT (ray tracing) TFLOPs, and 101 tensor TFLOPs for DLSS. And those figures, coupled with the 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, make the RTX 3060 a very big upgrade for people still on the venerable GTX 1060, which is the product NVIDIA is targeting in their marketing for this new GPU as they remind us that the GTX 1060 has been \u201clong at the top of the GPU gaming charts since its introduction in 2016\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith newer gaming titles come bigger worlds with cinematic graphics and real-time ray tracing \u2014 these are gaming workloads that only RTX-powered platforms are suited to handle. The GeForce RTX 3060 has twice the raster performance and 10x the ray-tracing performance of the GTX 1060, making it a formidable upgrade opportunity and the foundation of a gaming PC platform powerful enough to handle cutting-edge titles such as\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0and\u00a0Fortnite\u00a0with RTX On at 60 frames per second.\u201d\n\nAll of this looks very good, though enthusiasm for this new GPU from prospective buyers will hinge on availability. At least having more members of the RTX 30 Series family could theoretically spell better overall availability, but who knows.\nOne more area of technical interest: this will not be another GA104 product like the RTX 3070 and 3060 Ti before it (it\u2019s listed as GA106 over at AnandTech and at everyone\u2019s favorite source for news about video cards with a Z), so we are not looking at a \u201ccut down\u201d variant of an existing GPU.\nRegardless, availability is all speculative until the cards hit the shelves \u2013 virtually or physically. Maybe I\u2019ll actually be able to walk into my local Best Buy and snag one!

The company has just confirmed it will indeed be releasing stock of the Turing GPU, along with the Pascal-based GTX 1050 Ti GPU, to board partners. \nPCWorld's Brad Chacos spoke to an Nvidia spokesperson via email about the rumors that it would be reviving GPUs from older generations and releasing them to AIBs.\n\"The products referenced below were never EOLed [end-of-lifed---ed]. So 'reviving' seems like the wrong terminology to use here,\" Nvidia said. \"More of an ebb and flow really. We're just meeting market demand, which remains extremely high as you noted.\"\nDespite launching back in 2016 for $140, the GTX 1050 Ti is the second-most-popular card on Steam's hardware survey, used by almost 7 percent of participants. The RTX 2060, released in 2019 for $349, is in fifth spot with a 3.5 percent share.\n\nUsing the older process nodes means the manufacturing costs for these cards aren't going to be too high. And in the case of the GTX 1050 Ti, which uses GDDR5 memory, it could be produced without the rumored GDDR6 shortages complicating matters.\nWhat could also make the GTX 1050 Ti more freely available is its unsuitability for Ethereum mining, which requires a GPU with more than 4GB of memory. Miners of the crypto have been so desperate recently that they're bulk-buying Ampere-powered laptops direct from manufacturers. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\nThe previous rumors suggested both the RTX 2060 and RTX 2060 Super would be revived, but there's no mention of the latter card. It could be due to the Super variant's extra 2GB of GDDR6, which might pose a problem further down the line if the memory is in short supply.\n\nRight now, both these products are experiencing the same inflated prices as every other card on the market. Most GTX 1050 Ti cards sell for over $250, while the few RTX 2060 models available start at $700. Some retailers have them in stock, suggesting the resupplying has begun. Whether their prices drop might also depend on President Biden removing the 25 percent tariff graphics cards are subject to.\n\n\n\n\n 27 comments\n \n606 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Now in their latest exclusive on the RTX 3060 retail availability, Coreteks has leaked out pictures of several custom models along with their final retail pricing which is more expensive than the RTX 3060 Ti's MSRP of $399 US.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB Graphics Card Custom Models From ASUS, MSI & ZOTAC Leak Out Along With Their Prices, Huge Mark Up Over MSRP\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was supposed to launch at $329 US which is a pretty decent price for a graphics card of this caliber. However, it looks like every major retailer is going to throw the MSRP in the trash can and go with their own prices. Do note that both retailers and manufacturers play in to set final prices for these cards based on supply and demand.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nComing to the prices, the cheapest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 custom model that was spotted was the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ventus 2X which features a dual-fan design. This model has a price tag of $484.99 US. This is followed by the ASUS GeForce RTX 3060 TUF Gaming which costs $489.99 US, the ASUS GeForce RTX 3060 ROG STRIX & ZOTAC GeForce RTX 3060 Gaming, both of which would cost $499.99 US and finally, we have the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Gaming X Trio which is the most expensive variant with a price tag of $514.99 US.\n\nMSI RTX 3060 Gaming X Trio $514.99\nMSI RTX 3060 VentusX2 $484.99\nZotac RTX 3060 Gaming $499.99\nAsus RTX 3060 ROG Strix $499.99\nAsus RTX 3060 TUF Gaming $489.99\n\nConsidering the prices are in USD, this is most likely a major US-based retailer though the name is not disclosed. It should also be pointed that there is plenty of stock for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 custom models as seen in the pictures so availability should not be that much of an issue as was the case with the higher-end offerings. Considering that the GeForce RTX 3060 relies on the GA106 GPU which is a more mainstream offering, it should be easier to produce than the GA104 and GA102 GPUs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Card Specifications - GA106 GPU & 12 GB GDDR6 Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card lies the GA106 GPU. The GA106 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA106 GPU is the third gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced.\nThe new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster, the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3060, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 28 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 3584 CUDA cores, 112 TMUs. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The graphics card has a TDP of 170W.\n\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3060 comes packed with 12 GB of GDDR6 memory. The memory runs across a 192-bit bus wide interface and features an effective clock speed of 15.00 Gbps which delivers a cumulative bandwidth of 360 GB/s which is slightly higher bandwidth than the RTX 2060 6 GB model & you also end up with twice the memory while Ampere's brand new compression architecture makes sure that the GPU isn't bandwidth starved.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB graphics card launches on the 25th of February at 6 AM Pacific Time.

As of this writing in February of 2021, stock of new GPUs is still extremely scarce and isn\u2019t expected to return to normal until at least Q3 of this year. But are you really missing out on that much if you can\u2019t get your hands on a new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 for your workstation? There are, of course, a lot of factors to know if you need to upgrade.\n\nThe new Ampere-based GPUs from NVIDIA are here and if you\u2019re lucky, you might actually get to buy one. As of this writing in February of 2021, stock of new GPUs is still extremely scarce and isn\u2019t expected to return to normal until at least Q3 of this year. But are you really missing out on that much if you can\u2019t get your hands on a new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 for your workstation? There are, of course, a lot of factors to know if you need to upgrade.\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at a range of use-cases to shed some light on if the wait will be worth it. We\u2019ll be looking at creative professional use-cases, things like Blender, Davinci Resolve, and LuxMark, but we\u2019ll also look at a machine learning benchmark based on the open-source TensorFlow library in Python, and a bit of gaming for good measure. We\u2019ll be comparing an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Founder\u2019s Edition to the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000, the (former) king of NVIDIA\u2019s workstation line. While a more apt comparison would be to the Quadro RTX 6000, as both cards have 24GB of VRAM, the results would be nearly identical, as the actual compute capabilities of the 8000 and 6000 are the same and none of these benchmarks used more than 24GB of VRAM. We also have a couple of OEM workstations for comparison, including a Lenovo P920 we previously reviewed with dual RTX 8000s and a new Lenovo P620 packed with AMD\u2019s latest Threadripper PRO.\nWhy are we comparing a workstation Quadro card with a consumer GeForce card? Because never before has NVIDIA put out a consumer card this powerful, and the value proposition of spending a third of the money versus the Quadro line has become very enticing. Particularly because as of writing this article, there is no official word on a true TITAN RTX successor, which has traditionally filled the niche for work and play GPUs. It\u2019s also impossible to ignore the state of the world right now, with work-from-home solutions being a top priority for a lot of people, and having one extremely powerful GPU for CAD by day and gaming by night sounds better than ever. We know, we can hear you through the screen about the differences for a \u201ctrue\u201d workstation card! We\u2019ll get there, we promise; keep reading.\nThe main test system and GPU specifications are below, including driver and BIOS versions.\n\n\n\nOS\nWindows 10 Professional (ver 20H2, October 2020)\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n\n\nMemory\n4x8GB (32GB) G.Skill TridentZ Neo 3600MHz CL16\n\n\nTest Drive\n2TB Samsung 970 Pro\n\n\nMotherboard\nASRock X570 Taichi (BIOS v4.00, PCIe Gen4)\n\n\nGPU 1\nNVIDIA RTX 3090 Founder\u2019s Edition (Studio Driver 461.40)\n\n\nGPU 2\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 (Production Branch Driver R460 U3, 461.40)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nQuadro RTX 8000\nRTX 3090 FE\n\n\nArchitecture\nTuring (12nm)\nAmpere (8nm)\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n4,608\n10,496\n\n\nTensor Cores\n576 (2nd Gen)\n328 (3rd Gen)\n\n\nRT Cores\n72 (1st Gen)\n82 (2nd Gen)\n\n\nGPU Memory\n48GB GDDR6 with ECC\n24GB GDDR6X\n\n\nFP32 Performance\n16.3 TFLOPS\n35.6 TFLOPS\n\n\nPower Consumption\n295W\n350W\n\n\nPCIe Interface\nPCIe 3.0 x16\nPCIe 4.0 x16\n\n\nCooler\nBlower-style\nFlow-through\n\n\nNVLink Multi-GPU Support\nYes\nYes\n\n\nSR-IOV Support\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090 vs Quadro RTX 8000 Benchmarks\nLet\u2019s start with gaming. This may seem like a weird thing to include in an article about workstation graphics, but with so many people working from home these days, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect a lot of professionals to finish their work and get to gaming on the same machine. We tested Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Borderlands 3. Borderlands and Tomb Raider have built-in benchmarking tools, and while Cyberpunk doesn\u2019t, we felt we were able to record a good amount of data between the two cards to give an average. All tests were done at 1440p; Borderlands was set to all max settings except motion blur; Tomb Raider was set to all max, RTX Ultra and no DLSS; and Cyberpunk 2077 was set to the RTX Medium Preset, with DLSS set to Quality. Esports titles like League of Legends and CS:GO will easily maintain over 250 FPS with either of these cards so they weren\u2019t tested thoroughly. Anecdotally, we saw well over 150 FPS consistently with both cards in Call of Duty: Warzone but didn\u2019t test it thoroughly enough to consider it a true benchmark to include on this chart.\n\nTo absolutely no one\u2019s surprise, the RTX 3090 is the absolute best gaming GPU on the market right now and while the AMD Radeon 6900XT will go blow for blow with it in certain titles, when it comes to ray-tracing, the 3090 has no competition. Cyberpunk 2077, love it or hate it, is the most demanding title available right now and in all of our testing, the RTX 3090 maintained at least 65 FPS, even in very crowded scenes, and most of the time the FPS was in the high 70s and low 80s with consistently low frame times. It\u2019s safe to say that anything less demanding can easily be run at maximum settings and maintain high framerates. Also keep in mind that these tests were done in February of 2021, before NVIDIA released Resizable BAR support for GeForce cards. This PCIe standard, marketed as Smart Access Memory on AMD\u2019s new cards, will allow CPUs direct access to the entire VRAM at once and improve performance in gaming. Early results show anywhere from a 2%-5% gain in FPS, depending on the game. Resizable BAR will likely not increase performance in compute tasks and as such, will likely not come to the Quadro line any time soon.\nThe more interesting result here is how competent of a gaming card the Quadro RTX 8000 is. While it doesn\u2019t seem like it should be a surprise given its raw power, its design and drivers haven\u2019t been optimized for gaming at all, yet in all but Cyberpunk 2077, it maintains well over 60 FPS. Cyberpunk was choppy at best, but dialing back the ray-tracing and setting DLSS to Performance improved the results greatly, maintaining over 60 FPS in all but the most demanding scenes. It\u2019s worth noting, we did run into a lot of ray-tracing related bugs when running Cyberpunk on the Quadro, particularly an issue where reflections would disappear entirely and the scenes would turn dark. This didn\u2019t happen on the RTX 3090, so we\u2019ll chalk it up to an issue related to the Quadro driver and Cyberpunk\u2019s notorious buginess.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider on the GeForce RTX 3090, 1440p with RTX on and DLSS off.\nNext up is the good stuff; the workstation results you\u2019re expecting to see. This batch of benchmarks will be looking at performance in 3D modeling, lighting, and video work. We\u2019ll begin with LuxMark, an OpenCL GPU benchmarking utility. We\u2019ve used the newest version, v4alpha0, as well as the older v3 with the classic LuxBall.\n\nTo say the RTX 3090 has impressive performance would be an understatement. In applications that are heavily GPU-bound, the new Ampere architecture really flexes its muscles, beating out even the Lenovo P920 and its dual RTX 8000s. In LuxMark v3, the performance was over double, and the v4 benchmarks were approaching 150% performance. Expect to see a lot more charts that look like this, but (spoiler alert) not everything is as clear-cut as it seems.\nNext up, let\u2019s take a look at V-Ray from Chaos Group. This benchmark is for the V-Ray 3D rendering and simulation toolset, which is available as a plugin for a wide range of 3D modeling applications, such as Cinema 4D, Maya, Rhino, and Unreal, among others. This benchmark focuses on CUDA and RTX performance specifically. We used the newest version of the V-Ray benchmark (v5) as well as an older one (v4), just for comparison.\n\nThe story here is very similar to LuxMark with the RTX 3090 vastly outperforming the RTX 8000, and even eeking out above the Lenovo P920 and its dual GPUs. This benchmark specifically lets us see the massive improvements NVIDIA has made to their 2nd generation ray-tracing cores; the CUDA performance is about doubled, while the RTX performance is nearly 150%.\nNext up is the ubiquitous Blender, an open-source 3D modeling application. This benchmark was run using the Blender Benchmark utility. NVIDIA OptiX was the chosen render method, as opposed to CUDA, as all these systems can utilize RTX.\n\nThe story is much the same once again, with the next-gen RTX cores making quick work of the Blender renders, even burning through the BMW render in under 10 seconds. This story continues, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s going to get very interesting soon. Here we look at OctaneBench, a benchmarking utility for OctaneRender, another 3D renderer with RTX support, similar to V-Ray.\n\nYeah. Next, we\u2019ll take a look at video editing applications, specifically Davinci Resolve Studio 16.2.8 and Adobe Premiere Pro 2020. We\u2019ll be using PugetBench for Adobe CC and PugetBench for Resolve, both developed by PugetSystems, a PC manufacturer that makes professional workstations for specific applications. This chart specifically looks at the GPU score of the overall benchmark, scoring performance in GPU accelerated effects.\n\nFinally, we have some use cases where the value proposition drops a bit. Applications like Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve vary wildly in their performance needs depending on the project and effects, and they\u2019re often CPU bottlenecked. There is an improvement, especially in Resolve which has much better GPU optimization, but users of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite will find more value in lower-end GeForce cards like the RTX 3080 where you\u2019ll get ostensibly 90% of the performance for 46% of the price (based on MSRP of the Founder\u2019s Edition cards). While not reported here, performance in After Effects and Photoshop were similar, where most tests were CPU limited. Also worth noting the Quadro and GeForce cards both use the 7th generation version of NVENC (the NVIDIA Encoder), so H.264 and HEVC render times will be similar. Do keep in mind that the GeForce cards are limited to 3 simultaneous encoding tasks (for things like streaming and recording), where the Quadros have no such limit. We\u2019re aware of bypasses for this limit, but we\u2019ll address that later. The RTX 3090 does use a new generation of the NVDEC (NVIDIA Decoder), so there will be marginal improvements in timeline scrubbing when working with HEVC and H.264 footage.\nLet\u2019s move on from creative application and into something new. We\u2019ll be taking a look at the machine learning performance of these cards using a benchmark aptly named AI-Benchmark. It\u2019s an open-source Python library that runs a series of deep learning tests using the TensorFlow machine learning library. You can find out more about it here as well as which specific testing methodologies it uses.\n\nYour collective gasps have been heard. It\u2019s the same story here as most of the creative benchmarks, with the GeForce card ostensibly doubling the performance of the Quadro. This test was done in Windows 10, but you can expect similar results in your Linux distro of choice. At the time of testing, TensorFlow hasn\u2019t been updated to support the new Ampere cards, but through a bit of hackery, we were able to make it run by mixing and matching components of different CUDA developer kits. We expect that a properly updated version in the future can only improve results.\nLast, but definitely not least, we\u2019ll look at SPECviewperf 2020, the newest revision of the industry-standard benchmarking utility from the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation. This benchmark looks at graphics performance in a variety of professional applications. We\u2019ve also included the Lenovo P620 equipped with an older Quadro P6000 for comparison.\n\nThis is where things get interesting. The 3D modeling results are about what you\u2019d expect, with the RTX 3090 outperforming the RTX 8000 by a healthy margin, but applications like CATIA and Creo, and the Energy and Medical tests, actually have the 3090 underperforming by a small, but significant margin. It even underperformed against the significantly older Quadro P6000 in our Lenovo P620. But what about Siemens NX? This is the crux of the workstation versus consumer, Quadro versus GeForce, predicament. You\u2019re reading that chart correctly; the 3090 scored a 25.37 in Siemens NX. We ran this test seven times and referenced other benchmarking results on the internet and this result is absolutely correct. The RTX 3090 had less than 5% of the performance of the Lenovo P620 with the RTX 8000 in this test. Let\u2019s explore this more in the next section.\nWorkstation versus Consumer GPUs; The Drivers\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 is a very powerful GPU, there\u2019s no denying that, and the Quadro RTX 8000 is also a powerful GPU, but where they differ is important. The RTX 3090 is first and foremost a gaming video card. It was designed, and is marketed, as the absolute best GPU for gaming and the \u201cworld\u2019s first 8K capable\u201d gaming card. The fact that it can outperform the RTX 8000 in a multitude of tasks, with extreme margins in most cases, is a testament to its raw power, essentially brute forcing its way through these tests. The Quadro RTX 8000 is first and foremost a workstation card, designed to be placed in workstations, crammed in rack-mount servers, linked together over NVLink, virtualized, ran hard and put away wet (metaphorically, of course) and survive.\n\nSo that begs the question, why did the GeForce RTX 3090 underperform the 3-year old Quadro RTX 8000 in certain tasks, and even underperform the nearly 6-year old Quadro P6000? Specifically, why does the RTX 8000 see over an order of magnitude more performance in Siemens NX? We\u2019re sure you, savvy reader, already know; it comes down to driver optimizations. NVIDIA is judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to what GPUs get workstation optimizations and it\u2019s clear that they did not want the RTX 3090 to be able to absolutely wipe the floor of their previous Quadro line in every application. A lot of potential buyers will be very disappointed to see their hopes of top-tier workstation performance by day and high-end gaming by night isn\u2019t possible, at least not at the RTX 3090\u2019s $1,499 MSRP. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what the TITAN line is for,\u201d we hear you saying, but there is no TITAN RTX replacement available right now, and the pricing of the 3090 certainly positions it as a TITAN replacement. NVIDIA even boasts the 3090 as having \u201cTITAN class performance\u201d in the first line of their marketing materials, but that Siemens NX result is nowhere near \u201cTITAN class.\u201d Is the 3090 just an overbuilt, overpriced 3080? Well, not quite. It\u2019s still the best GPU available for 3D modelers and video work, especially with its 24GBs of VRAM that allows creatives to work with large models and 8K footage with ease, but that puts it in a pretty small niche, a niche previously served by the TITAN-class cards. If you don\u2019t work with CAD applications like Siemens NX, Creo, or CATIA, the RTX 3090 is still appealing, but it\u2019s an absolute non-starter if those applications are critical to your workflow.\nThere\u2019s other considerations, too. While both the Quadro and the GeForce card offer multi-GPU setups over NVLink, and it\u2019s worth noting that only the 3090 has this capability among the 3000-series cards, only the Quadro can be virtualized with SR-IOV. If your workload involves distributing one GPU, or two NVLinked GPUs, to multiple VMs, the Quadro is still your only choice. While there are ways around this, the point still stands that this feature is artificially limited by NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce driver. The same driver which, by the way, does offer certifications for some creative applications like the Adobe suite and Autodesk, as well as WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) certification in its Studio variant, confounding the point further. While we anticipate a true Ampere-based TITAN replacement to come in the future from NVIDIA, the artificial limitations placed on the GeForce RTX 3090, including the limit to concurrent encodes with NVENC, feel out of touch with what professional users are looking for right now.\nWhile writing this article, NVIDIA also announced their new line of cryptocurrency mining specific GPUs and their intention to half the mining performance of the upcoming RTX 3060. This decrease in crypto mining performance is completely artificial and done entirely through drivers, further driving home the point that we are simply at the mercy of whatever NVIDIA deems our cards worthy of doing. Will this \u201cunhackable\u201d limit on the 3060 be exploited? Without a doubt, much the way the NVENC limit has been beaten. But for now, NVIDIA holds all the cards and for a lot of professional workflows that are highly optimized for CUDA, RTX, TensorFlow, and other NVIDIA specific computing platforms, there\u2019s simply no other choice but NVIDIA.\nConclusion\nLet\u2019s break it down a bit. Should you keep your stock alerts on for the RTX 3090? Brave the lines outside your local MicroCenter for the chance to get one? As with most things the answer is, \u201cit depends.\u201d\n\nDo you work exclusively with large 3D models in applications like Blender and Cinema 4D or regularly edit large 6K and 8K video files? Then yes; the RTX 3090 is the best creative professional GPU on the market for CUDA and RTX accelerated workflows.\nDo you have enough disposable income for an absolutely no-compromises gaming rig? Also yes; the RTX 3090 is the best gaming GPU money can buy, particularly in games with ray-tracing and DLSS 2.0 support, a list that is growing every day.\nDo you work primarily in CAD, particularly in scientific fields with applications like Creo and CATIA? Then no; the RTX 3090 doesn\u2019t provide the necessary driver optimizations that come with the Quadro line of cards, and no amount of brute forced raw power can overcome that. We\u2019re working to get our hands on the new RTX A6000, the RTX 8000s actual replacement, to help inform folks like you.\nDo you work in the machine learning and AI field? This one\u2019s a mixed bag, because it seems like a \u201cyes\u201d as the performance in TensorFlow is excellent, but there are unfortunately not enough standardized tests or data points to make a definitive conclusion versus a newer Quadro card. Also, as of this writing, TensorFlow hasn\u2019t been updated to properly support Ampere cards. Our current answer is a soft yes. We may look at MLCommons and MLperf in the future as a follow-up, specifically for AI and machine learning use cases.\nDo you currently own a TITAN RTX and are looking to upgrade? We recommend you wait for an official announcement from NVIDIA on the Ampere-based TITAN, which is rumored to be coming eventually. If your use cases make good use of the TITAN, the RTX 3090 may end up a downgrade, depending on your workflow.\nDo you do a lot of GPU virtualization? This is a solid no; the RTX 3090 does not natively support SR-IOV.\n\nWith all that considered, we hope this can inform your decision to upgrade or not, and whether you go GeForce or Quadro. If the $1,499 MSRP of the RTX 3090 is too rich for your blood and you don\u2019t need more than 10GB of VRAM, the RTX 3080 is a great option as well. While not explicitly tested here, we found our results were generally 20%-30% better than the RTX 3080 based on results throughout the web, so you can expect it to outperform (and underperform) the Quadro RTX 8000 in similar applications. It may also be worth waiting for the rumored RTX 3080 Ti, whenever that may be coming, for a middle ground. For now, we will keep our eyes peeled for the Ampere-based TITAN to truly fill the gap between a full workstation card and a full gaming card. We will also be keeping an eye on NVIDIA\u2019s driver pipeline to see if they assuage any of the card\u2019s work-related shortcomings in future releases, but we have our doubts. We would love to hear your thoughts on this, and also if there were any benchmarks or use-cases we missed that you\u2019d like to see, especially as it pertains to AI and machine learning. Get in touch with us on our social channels and stay tuned for more creative professional and workstation reviews.\nRead More \u2013 NVIDIA RTX A6000 Review\nNVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 on Amazon\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Founder\u2019s Edition on Amazon\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nVince Carnevale\nVincent Carnevale is a New York-based Digital Imaging Technician and a member IATSE Local 600.

We\u2019ve made a list of the best DLSS-powered games right here, if you\u2019re interested.You may also be wondering: does AMD have an equivalent of DLSS? Not yet, but AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution could arrive in March to up the ante with its RX 6000-series GPUs.Today's best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesCheck out all the best gaming monitorsVia Wccftech\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n4K\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

No, says the company. \nYesterday brought news that the new release drivers for the RTX 3060, which arrives on February 25, can detect \"specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent.\"\nQuestions were raised over whether this supposedly unhackable limiter would also affect other Ampere-based cards running the same driver, but the company has confirmed it is not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold.\n\nWhile some gamers might have welcomed a limiter being placed on all Ampere cards, such a move is both morally and perhaps legally questionable. It's also worth remembering that some gamers are also miners and vice versa, so it's not a black and white question of 'us versus them.'\nRather than nerfing the entire Ampere line, Nvidia hopes to ease the pressure of unprecedented demand by restarting its Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) line---a move that company CFO Colette Kress in January suggested could happen.\n\nThe CMP line lacks display outputs and comes with lower frequency and voltage settings than the gaming equivalents. Nvidia says as they don't meet the specifications of a GeForce GPU, they won't impact the supply of GeForce graphics cards---apparently. It's suspected that all the cards with the possible exception of the the top 90HX are based on Turning chips, helping minimize the impact on new GeForce card production.\nWith so many people sick of waiting for new stock of RTX 3000 cards, crypto mining has become an increasingly contentious subject. Zotac recently incurred the wrath of gamers when it posted a pro-mining tweet. On the other side of the coin, the rising price of crypto has helped some businesses stay afloat during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n 21 comments\n \n582 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Canada aims to become a major player in rare earth mining for chips and batteries \n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

With high demands and slower production cycles, retailers have been taking advantage of the situation and selling GPUs (new and old) at exuberant costs. On top of that, scalpers and mining farms also made it close to impossible to get your hands on a new GPU. \nNVIDIA has now reportedly planned to address the increased demand of its RTX 30-series graphics cards by...releasing stock of its older GPUs to board partners. These include the more affordable GTX 1050 Ti and the mid-range RTX 2060 GPUs. Replying to a query by Brad Chacos, Senior Editor at PCWorld, NVIDIA confirmed, \u201cThe products referenced below (GTX 1050 Ti and RTX 2060) were never EOLed [end-of-life]. So \u2018reviving\u2019 seems like the wrong terminology to use here. More of an ebb and flow really. We\u2019re just meeting market demand which remains extremely high as you noted.\u201d\nNVIDIA currently offers five new GPUs under its new RTX 30-series, including the RTX 3060, RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and the mighty powerful RTX 3090. The company had also quietly launched the GTX 1010, an entry-level graphics card based on the old Pascal architecture back from 2016. The chipset on this GPU is the GP108 which is similar to the one seen on the GT 1030 and some GeForce MX-series GPUs made for laptops.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Restocks: Where and when to purchase your new graphics card\nWhile it sounds like an interesting plan, NVIDIA\u2019s attempt might cover only a small percentage of the demand. The reason for that is because the newer RTX 30-series offer a generational leap in terms of performance but at the same time consume less power at an attractive price point (at least the actual cost quoted by NVIDIA). So unless one is desperate to have a new GPU in their system, buying one of the older cards means that you remain on older hardware thereby compromising on a variety of new technologies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

See our ethics statement.Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The VergeUpdate February 16th, 11:21AM ET: The bullet list at the bottom now reflects that Asus and Gigabyte have updated all of its product pages with the required information about the RTX 30-series graphics chips its laptops use.Nvidia is now requiring, not just encouraging, companies selling laptops with its new RTX 30-series graphics chips to be more transparent about the kind of power people can expect. Nvidia tells The Verge these companies will have to disclose specific clock speed stats and total graphics power on online product pages \u2014 all of which tells people everything they need to know about a laptop\u2019s graphics potential, for better or worse.However, companies won\u2019t have to mention that these chips are Max-Q variants because, according to an Nvidia spokesperson, \u201cMax-Q is no longer part of the GPU name.\u201d Rather, Max-Q is now solely used to communicate that a laptop with an RTX 30-series graphics chip ships with efficiency features like Whisper Mode 2, Dynamic Boost 2, and Advanced Optimus. Previously, seeing Max-Q branding made it easy to determine a laptop\u2019s general performance without having to know its specific clock speeds.It\u2019s encouraging to see Nvidia no longer allows companies to hide this vital information from marketing materials. It should go far enough in helping buyers make an educated purchase without having to wait on reviewers and early adopters to report on the specs.By sharing these specs, companies can make it much easier for consumers to understand how it\u2019s possible that, in some instances, the RTX 3070 in MSI\u2019s GP66 Leopard can outperform an RTX 3080 in the MSI GS66 Stealth, which is something we saw first-hand. Since the Max-Q brand no longer signifies a graphics chip\u2019s power capabilities, being transparent with clock speed and how much power it can consume is more crucial than ever.Nvidia now requires companies share the clock speed and power on laptop product pages Image: Nvidia\u201cWe\u2019re requiring OEMs to update their product pages to the Max-Q technology features for each GeForce laptop, as well as clocks and power \u2014 which communicates the expected GPU performance in that system,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson told The Verge. Nvidia says manufacturers have already begun sharing this info, including Asus and Gigabyte, which we confirmed at the time of publishing. We\u2019re going to keep tabs on some models coming out soon (and those currently on the market) to see how long it takes for these requirements to roll out across the industry.

In addition to the launch, the GeForce RTX 3060 has also been listed by various retailers while some users have got their hands on the graphics card several weeks before launch.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB Launches on 25th February, Listed Online By Retailers Too - First Buyer Posts Unboxing Pictures\nWhen it was announced, the GeForce RTX 3060 was slated to launch in February but NVIDIA never revealed exactly when in February. Now we know that the exact launch date for the RTX 3060 is set for the 25th of February at 6 AM Pacific Time. The graphics card will be available from global retail outlets at a starting price of $329.99 US but as always, the price is just MSRP and actual pricing will differ based on the custom designs and also be largely dependent on the availability of the cards.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Card Specifications - GA106 GPU & 12 GB GDDR6 Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card lies the GA106 GPU. The GA106 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA106 GPU is the third gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced.\nThe new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster, the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3060, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 28 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 3584 CUDA cores, 112 TMUs. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The graphics card has a TDP of 170W.\n\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3060 comes packed with 12 GB of GDDR6 memory. The memory runs across a 192-bit bus wide interface and features an effective clock speed of 15.00 Gbps which delivers a cumulative bandwidth of 360 GB/s which is slightly higher bandwidth than the RTX 2060 6 GB model & you also end up with twice the memory while Ampere's brand new compression architecture makes sure that the GPU isn't bandwidth starved.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBC395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBC17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores358448645888870410496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96272 / 96328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46272 / 68328 / 82\n\n\nBase Clock1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1440 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1710 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute13 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPs25 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPs101 TOPs192 TOPs163 TOPs238 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR610 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed16 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth384 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps760 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP170W175W220W320W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$329 US$399 US$499 US$699 US$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)25th February 20212nd December 202029th October 202017th September 202024th September 2020\n\n\n\n\nAside from the launch date, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 custom models have already landed in the hands of their first customer. Reddit user, he_never_sleeps, posted pictures of the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Eagle OC 12 GB graphics card in the EtherMining subreddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe user is based in Europe and the reason he got his hands on the card so early on was primarily because the shop had run out of stock for the RTX 3060 Ti graphics card and only had the non-Ti variants in stock which they recently received. According to the user, the card has a memory bandwidth of 360.00 GB/s out of the box and a TDP of 170W. It's expected to deliver a mining hash rate of around 50 MH/s.\nAs for the card itself, it is a standard dual-slot and dual-fan design that is powered by a single 8-pin connector. The card features an extended cooler and backplate with a large cut-out at the back to dump hot air out of.\n\nAdditionally, retailers have started listing down custom NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards with preliminary pre-order prices. The most affordable variant, the ZOTAC Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 Twin Edge, is listed for a price of 428 Euros while the top variant is listed for 600 Euros. The prices are severely inflated but that is to be expected till the official launch of these cards & while we don't expect them to be near the MSRP's, they will be better than the ones mentioned above.\nNews Source: Casmodem\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

This is short for Cryptocurrency Mining Processor While AIBs have previously rolled out mining variants of GPUs without display ports, this is the first time we are seeing an official product launch straight from NVIDIA itself. It is accompanied by an action that will likely be very controversial: software limiting the hash rate of NVIDIA's RTX 3060 GPU (which will be launching on the 25th) to just 50% of its actual rate.\nNVIDIA launches Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) series and halves RTX 3060 hash rate\nBefore we go any further, NVIDIA is announcing a total of 4 CMP (GPUs?) out of which two, the NVIDIA CMP 30HX and 40HX will launch in Q1 and CMP 50HX and 90HX will launch in Q2. At this moment it is unclear which HX correlates to which GeForce GPU although you can make some decent guesses using the memory size (which correlates to bus width and can give away the rough model number) we can also use the hash rate and TDP to arrive at similar conclusions. With hash rates of up to 86 MH/s (and these are likely unoptimized considering NVIDIA always underpromises and over-delivers), it is clear that the company has plans to ensure a full lineup.\nHere is the thing though, the RTX 3070 for example has a hash rate between 50-60 MH/s. None of the CMPs in the table match this rate. I have a suspicion [caution: educated speculation] that what we are looking at also contains lower binned dies of the GeForce models with slightly lower core counts. This would allow NVIDIA to retarget some of those wasted dies more efficiently.\nDesigned for professional mining operations\nNVIDIA CMP allows a fully open, airflow-optimized bracket and is configured to allow a greater number of GPUs to be controlled by one CPU.\nOptimized for best mining performance\nNVIDIA GPU architecture allows you to mine more efficiently and recoup your mining investment faster.\nAvailable from authorized partners\nAvailable from authorized partners, including ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, Palit, and PC Partner.\nIt is also unclear at this point how their decision to halve RTX 3060 mining rate will be received. Some would argue that if you are buying the hardware, you reserve the right to use it to its full potential. Another obvious problem could be the fact that software blocks are usually overcome quite easily when the wider internet puts its mind to it.\nhttps://twitter.com/usmanpirzada/status/1362414997368832004\nWe have even seen AMD GPUs get bios flashed to their higher-end siblings so this would be child's play for an enthusiastic coder unless NVIDIA took hardware-based steps to mitigate this. Since a full GeForce GPU offers resale value - which is part of the ROI - a multi-million USD mining operation would likely have enough resources to bypass this block. In other words, this restriction would likely only impact the retail miner and disallow actual gamers from recouping some costs by putting their GPU to mine part-time.\nHere is the full press release about NVIDIA CMP series:\n\n\nWe are gamers, through and through. Yet NVIDIA GPUs are programmable. And users are constantly discovering new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.\nWith the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on Feb. 25, we\u2019re taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers.\nRTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm, and limit the hash rate, or cryptocurrency mining efficiency, by around 50 percent.\nTo address the specific needs of Ethereum mining, we\u2019re announcing the NVIDIA CMP, or, Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, product line for professional mining. CMP products \u2014 which don\u2019t do graphics \u2014 are sold through authorized partners and optimized for the best mining performance and efficiency. CMP lacks display outputs, enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed. CMPs also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency, which improves mining power efficiency.\nTell us what you think of NVIDIA CMP:\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA's CMP HX GPU series annoucement:\n\n\n Love it!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Hate it! Let us mine our GPU to full potential.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Meh, don't think it will make a difference/people will bypass limits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n17\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The first-gen model had a clever idea \u2014 half game console, half streaming box \u2014 but a cumbersome design. The second-gen model corrected a lot of the lingering issues, but still cost an awful lot of money (up to $300) in a market where 4K HDR streamers usually go for $50.With the new Nvidia Shield TV ($150), the company is trying something a little different. And, after having spent some time with the new gadget, I can attest that a little different equals a lot better. Once you accept the Shield TV's strange design (let's not mince words: It's an oversize cigarette lighter), it can do a whole lot.The 63 best Netflix shows and TV seriesHow to watch the Marvel movies in orderNvidia Shield TV vs. Nvidia Shield TV Pro: What's the difference?Nvidia Shield TV (2019) (HDR) at Amazon for $149.99Not only can you stream top-notch PC games from your own collection; you can also enjoy fast-loading 4K HDR content and ambitious AI upscaling for 1080p video.

Rather than a small box or dongle shape, the Shield TV is an odd black cylinder, which rests horizontally somewhere below your TV. On one end, there's a power port and an Ethernet port; on the other, there's a microSD card slot, an HDMI port and a hard reset button. (You probably won't need to use the button, but it's good to have.)Once I got the device set up, though, I thought it looked rather cool. Since it has wires coming out of both ends, it resembles nothing so much as an oversize cable- management tube \u2014 and such a tube certainly doesn't seem out of place beneath a TV. It's also heavy and sturdy enough that the myriad wires won't hoist it up and make it dangle.(I do have one slight quibble: Depending on where your wires come from, the Shield TV's \"Nvidia\" logo might be upside-down. We live in a world of compromises.)Historically minded users may remember that the previous-gen Shield TV also came with two USB ports. It's admittedly a pain to lose these, but a) the microSD card slot works just as well for most purposes, and b) you can still get the old-style Shield TV with new Shield TV features in a product called the Nvidia Shield TV Pro ($200).(Image credit: Gia Sergovich/Tom's Guide)Nvidia Shield TV interface\u00a0Like previous models, the 2019 Shield TV runs on the Android TV OS. If you haven't checked out Android OS recently, though, it's worth pointing out that the interface is a lot better than it used to be. While doing so is a little cumbersome, you can customize your home screen to put the content you want front and center, and get rid of the content that doesn't interest you.In case you haven't used it before, Android TV organizes content into rows. The first row you'll see will be all your favorite apps. Below that, there might be a whole row dedicated to Netflix, and the shows you're watching on that platform. Below that, you might get the same thing for YouTube, or games, and so forth. It's pretty intuitive, and puts very little distance between you and what you want to access.Historically, I've complained about the Google Play Store on Android TV, which is a little abstruse, and doesn't do a good job of organizing content into browsable categories. However, a recent update has made it a lot easier to find what you're looking for \u2014 and, failing that, you can always just perform a text or voice search. It's not as robust as something like the Roku search, or as deep as the Apple TV search, but I didn't have any trouble finding apps that I was looking for.The Shield TV also has one feature that most Android TV systems lack: Nvidia Games. Selecting this will bring you to a variety of Android games, but also to GeForce Now. While GeForce Now has been through a few different iterations, it's now a free game-streaming service. There are a handful of games available absolutely free of charge, such as Batman: Arkham City and Tomb Raider (2013), but these are mostly holdovers from an earlier experiment.For the most part, GeForce Now is a way to stream games that you've already purchased on Steam, UPlay and similar services. The way this works is actually quite clever. You sign into your Steam/UPlay account on a remote server, which then downloads the game and streams it right to your Shield TV. It's not always easy to figure out which games work and which games won't, but the Shield will let you know when you've picked an incompatible title. The service also runs pretty smoothly, as I'll describe later.GeForce Now's current iteration can be a little clunky, but it works extremely well, particularly if you already own a lot of games on Steam. It's come a long way since the experimental hodgepodge of GeForce Now when the Shield TV first launched.(Image credit: Gia Sergovich/Tom's Guide)Nvidia Shield TV 2019 review: RemoteOne of the biggest changes from previous Shield TV models is the new version's remote control. While older Shield TVs had remotes available, they also included controllers, which were the primary way Nvidia expected users to interact with the system.The $150 Shield TV doesn't include a controller anymore. This isn't really a problem, since you can now connect any controller you want \u2014 other Android controllers, Xbox One controllers and even DualShock 4 controllers. Pairing is painless, and I imagine that most people interested in buying a Shield TV in the first place already own at least one compatible peripheral.But the Shield TV does come with a remote control, and it's a complete redesign. The new remote control is a black triangular prism, with two rows of circular buttons down the front. You get circular direction controls, with a confirm button in the middle, in addition to all the standard media controls (play/pause, rewind, fast-forward, etc.). There's also a dedicated button for Netflix at the bottom, which isn't necessary, but doesn't do any harm, either.One cool feature of the remote is that it will automatically illuminate when you pick it up, so it's easy to see in a dark room. But for some reason, the buttons are quite dark themselves until the lighting kicks in, which makes the illumination something of a necessity, even in a moderately bright room. It probably would have been easier to just make lighter-colored buttons. The remote also operates on two AA batteries: a step up from the coin-cell battery in previous Shield TV remotes, but a rechargeable peripheral would still be nice.(Image credit: Gia Sergovich/Tom's Guide)Nvidia Shield TV 2019 review: Content and apps\u00a0Android TV has access to thousands of apps \u2014 although like most app stores, there's a lot more chaff than wheat. At the very least, you'll be able to get just about every major channel, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, Spotify, Pandora, Vudu, YouTube and just about every channel-specific streaming app out there.In fact, Shield TV has a history of getting new apps before they hit the rest of the Android TV ecosystem. That was the case with Amazon Video a few years ago, and it's the case with the discrete Amazon Music app now. The only big thing missing right now is Apple TV, and who knows if that will ever make its way to a Google platform? But if it does, the Shield TV may very well be one of the first systems to get it.It's worth noting that you can also program routines and even control certain smart-home gadgets through the built-in Google Assistant. If you prefer Alexa, you can also set up the Shield TV to work with commands from Amazon's digital assistant, including powering on, selecting content and pausing shows. You can't use every smart-home device \u2014 for Samsung Smart Hub products, you need a USB dongle, for example. But having access to a full-featured Google Assistant is pretty handy all the same.(Image credit: Gia Sergovich/Tom's Guide)Nvidia Shield TV 2019 review: Performance\u00a0The Shield TV is a powerful device, sporting a Tegra X1+ processor, 2 GB RAM, 8 GB storage, and support for Dolby Vision and Atmos. As such, there's no reason to discuss video performance in great detail. The Shield TV loads and buffers 4K HDR content very fast \u2014 much faster than $50 competitors like the Roku Streaming Stick+ or the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. If you've got fast Wi-Fi, the Shield TV offers 802.11 ac support; otherwise, you can plug in an Ethernet cable.What's more interesting is what the Shield TV does with all its extra power. Nvidia has programmed in a proprietary form of AI upscaling. Without going into too much detail about how it works, the Shield TV employs an algorithm to make 1080p pictures look more like 4K images, both in motion and when paused.You can set this upscaling to Low, Medium or High, depending on how aggressive you want to get, or you can turn it off entirely if you don't trust it. In my experience, I found it worked pretty well, although it did occasionally change a picture's color for no real reason (a red sign became orange in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, albeit with sharper text). I also found that I didn't perceive a difference once a movie or TV show had been in progress for a while. Comparing still images was fun, but I'm not sure I would have noticed, had I not already known I was toying with algorithms.What's impressive, though, is how the Shield TV handles games. As stated, the Shield TV streams games you already own from a remote server; you just provide the controller or keyboard. (You can also stream any game you want from a server in your own home, but how well that works is dependent on your own hardware and Internet connection.)When I set up the Shield TV at home, it wasn't situated anywhere near my router, so I had to make due with Wi-Fi, which provides about 40 to 45 Mbps on a good day. I loaded up GreedFall, where I happened to have a save just before the final boss. Without spoiling anything, the last fight in the game is a fairly tough one, which requires a lot of dodging and split-second tactical decisions. If the Shield TV lagged even a little bit, I'd have been fileted well before I could quaff a healing potion.But the Shield TV didn't lag at all. The game streamed at 1080p resolution with a frame rate that seemed far in excess of 30 fps. (The software didn't give me an exact number, but it was almost definitely somewhere between 30 and 60.) I had similar experiences with Tomb Raider, Spec Ops: The Line and The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. It's an incredibly impressive piece of tech, and I was amazed that I could play a full-fledged PC game in my bedroom without having to drag my whole gaming rig in with me.(Image credit: Gia Sergovich/Tom's Guide)Nvidia Shield TV 2019 review: Bottom line\u00a0The Shield TV (2019) looks a lot different than it did a few years ago, and it doesn't come with nearly as much stuff. (Although, again, the Nvidia Shield TV Pro still has all the ports, and you can always buy a controller separately.) And yet, I think it's a stronger product for all that. Asking $150 for a streaming device is much more reasonable than asking $200 or more, and the new Shield TV still does just about everything it did before. Some things, it does even better.From its ambitious AI upscaling to its surprisingly solid game streaming, the Shield TV is definitely aiming for a gaming/streaming audience rather than the everyday binge-watcher. But I think it provides just about everything those gamers and streamers would need, at a much more approachable price than before. Just grab your favorite controller, and you're good to go.Apple TV 4K vs. Nvidia Shield TV: Which streaming device should you buy?Nvidia Shield TV (2019): Price Comparison $149.99View $149.99View $149.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nWhat to Watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nMarshall HonorofSocial Links NavigationMarshall Honorof is a senior editor for Tom's Guide, overseeing the site's coverage of gaming hardware and software.

See how it performs with key DCC applications in Jason Lewis\u2019s real-world tests.\n\nIn this review, I am going to be looking at Nvidia\u2019s recently released GeForce RTX 3090, the current top-of-the-line part in its GeForce line of consumer GPUs, and compare it to the two top-tier GPUs from the firm\u2019s previous generation of cards, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and the prosumer Titan RTX.\nI would have liked to have included another card that uses Nvidia\u2019s current Ampere GPU architecture, the GeForce RTX 3080, but was unable to get my hands on one for this review. Tech news sites report that this is a problem that many people currently share. I am hoping to revisit this review at some point in the future with most, if not all, of the GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs when they become more widely available.\nThe positioning of the cards in the series is pretty standard when it comes to the lower-end and middle-tier cards, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 3070 and 3080, but the GeForce RTX 3090 is something of an anomaly from a gaming standpoint. With a nearly fully unlocked GA102 GPU, and 24GB of GDDR6X memory, its specs are similar to the previous-generation Titan RTX, which begs the question: is this the Titan of Nvidia\u2019s current Ampere generation of GPUs, or will we see an even more powerful Titan card in future?\nBut regardless of its name, the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s specs make it an ideal card for DCC workloads, which is why many are calling it the unofficial workstation GPU of the Ampere line-up. In this review, I am going to put that claim to the test, and see how the RTX 3090 measures up in a slew of real-world content creation tasks.\n\nJump to another part of this review\nTechnology focus: GPU architectures and APIs\nSpecifications and price\nTesting procedure\nBenchmark results\nOther considerations\nVerdict\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology focus: GPU architectures and APIs\nBefore I discuss the card on test, here is a quick recap of some of the technical terms that will crop up in this review. If you\u2019re already familiar with them, you may want to skip ahead.\nBoth Nvidia\u2019s current Ampere GPU architecture and its previous-generation Turing architecture feature three types of processor cores: CUDA cores, designed for general GPU computing; Tensor cores, designed for machine learning operations; and RT cores, intended to accelerate ray tracing calculations. \nIn order to take advantage of the RT cores, software applications have to access them through a graphics API: in the case of the applications featured in this review, either DXR (DirectX Raytracing), used in real-time renderers like Unreal Engine, or Nvidia\u2019s own OptiX API, used by most offline renderers. In most of those renderers, the OptiX rendering backend is provided as an alternative to an older backend based on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA API. The CUDA backends work with a wider range of Nvidia GPUs, but OptiX enables ray tracing accelerated by the RTX cards\u2019 RT cores, often described simply as \u2018RTX acceleration\u2019.\nAs an Ampere card, the GeForce RTX 3090 has the same types of processor cores as the two Turing cards on test, the GeForce RTX 2080 TI and the Titan RTX, but more recent versions of them: it uses the second generation of Nvidia\u2019s RT ray tracing cores and the third generation of its Tensor AI cores.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications and price\nAlthough many of Nvidia\u2019s current board partners make their own GeForce RTX 3090 cards, the one on test is a Founders Edition card direct from Nvidia. Quite a few online reviews, like this one from Tom\u2019s Hardware, dive deeply into the card\u2019s architecture, so I am only going to include a brief overview here. \nThe GeForce RTX 3090 sports the most powerful Ampere GPU, the GA102, with the RTX 3090 using a nearly fully unlocked version sporting 10,496 CUDA cores, 82 second-generation RT ray tracing cores and 328 third-generation Tensor machine learning cores. (The CUDA figure is a bit misleading, as in the past, CUDA core count was measured solely using INT32 cores, of which the RTX 3090 has 5,248, but due to architecture changes to the Ampere GPUs, CUDA core throughput has effectively doubled, so Nvidia now measures CUDA core count based off that double throughput.) \nThe RTX 3090 comes equipped with 24GB of GDDR6X memory on a 384-bit bus. It has a core clock speed of 1,395MHz and a boost clock speed of 1,695MHz.\nOne aspect of the RTX 3090 that sets it apart from the other Ampere GPUs \u2013 and all previous GeForce GPUs \u2013 is its power draw. The RTX 3090 is an extremely power-hungry GPU. It is officially rated at 350W and Nvidia recommends a minimum of 750W for your system\u2019s PSU, but I would personally recommend 1,000W or more, especially if you are running an HEDT CPU and/or lots of system RAM and storage drives. \nThe RTX 3090 is also, to put it bluntly, a massive card. At 12.3 inches long and 5.4 inches wide (31.3 x 13.8cm), and taking up a full three slots, it is over an inch longer and an inch wider than the GeForce RTX 3080 and the top-tier Turing GPUs. It is also a very heavy card. I haven\u2019t actually weighed it, but it is significantly heavier than any of the Turing GPUs I have tested, and internet sources claim that it tips the scales at close to five pounds.\nAt $1,499, the GeForce RTX 3090 is slightly more expensive than its predecessor, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, which had a launch price of $999 \u2013 or $1,199 for its own Founders Edition \u2013 but significantly less expensive than the Titan RTX, which had a launch price of $2,499.\n\n\n\n\nTesting procedure\nFor this review, my test system was a Xidax X-10 workstation powered by an AMD Threadripper 3990X CPU. You can find more details in my review of the Threadripper 3990X.\nCPU: AMD Threadripper 3990X\nMotherboard: MSI Creator TRX40\nRAM: 64GB of 3,600MHz Corsair Dominator DDR4\nStorage: 2TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSD / 1TB WD Black NVMe SSD / 4TB HGST 7200rpm HD\nPSU: 1300W Seasonic Platinum\nCPU cooler: Alphacool 360mm AIO liquid cooler\nOS: Windows 10 Pro for Workstations\nFor testing, I used the following applications:\nViewport and DCC application performance\n3ds Max 2021.2, Blender 2.90, Fusion 360, Maya 2020.1, Modo 13.0v1, SolidWorks 2020 SP0, Substance Painter 2020.2.1, Unreal Engine 4.25\nGPU rendering\nArnold for Maya (using MtoA 4.1.0), Blender 2.90 (using Cycles), Cinema 4D R22 (using Radeon ProRender), D5 Render 1.6.2, KeyShot 9.0, Maverick Studio 2021.1, OctaneBench 2020.1, Redshift 3.0.33, Solidworks 2020 SP0 (using Visualize), V-Ray 5 for 3ds Max (using V-Ray GPU)\nOther benchmarks\nMetashape 1.6.5, Premiere Pro 2020 (14.1), Substance Alchemist 2020.3.0\nSynthetic benchmarks\n3DMark\nIn the viewport and editing benchmarks, the frame rate scores represent the figures attained when manipulating the 3D assets shown, averaged over five testing sessions to eliminate inconsistencies. In all of the rendering benchmarks, the CPU was disabled so only the GPU was used for computing. Testing was performed on a single 32\u201d 4K display running at its native resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels, at 60Hz.\n\nBenchmark results\nViewport and DCC application performance\nThe viewport benchmarks include many of the key DCC applications, including 3ds Max, Blender and Maya, plus CAD package SolidWorks and game engine Unreal Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 takes first place in all of the viewport tests except one \u2013 the single anomaly being the SolidWorks test, in which the previous-generation Titan RTX has a substantial lead. This may be due to the fact that the Titan\u2019s drivers enable features otherwise only available in Nvidia\u2019s professional GPUs, although my tests suggest that for most applications, there is little difference in performance between Nvidia\u2019s Studio and Game Ready drivers: something discussed in more detail later in this article.\nAnother point to note is that many off-the-shelf DCC applications don\u2019t seem to be optimised to fully harness the power of newer GPUs: while the GeForce RTX 3090 takes the lead in the 3ds Max, Maya and Modo tests, that lead is smaller than I would have expected from its specifications alone.\nHowever, the Unreal Engine tests show significant gains in interactive performance over the Titan RTX and the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. The UE4 viewport ray tracing benchmark is especially impressive, with the RTX 3090 hitting almost 90fps at 4K resolution. \nGPU rendering\nI\u2019ve divided the rendering benchmarks into two groups. The first set of applications either don\u2019t use OptiX for ray tracing, or don\u2019t make it possible to turn the OptiX backend on and off, so it isn\u2019t possible to assess the impact of RTX acceleration on performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second set of applications, it is possible to render with OptiX enabled or using CUDA alone, making it possible to measure the increase in performance when RTX acceleration is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GPU rendering benchmarks follow a similar pattern to the viewport tests, with the RTX 3090 taking first place in most cases: this time, by a larger margin. The scores with OptiX enabled are particularly impressive.\nHowever, like the viewport benchmarks, there is an anomaly \u2013 actually, two anomalies. The first is with SolidWorks Visualize, where the RTX 3090 falls behind the Titan RTX and the RTX 2080 Ti. My suspicion is that Visualize simply hasn\u2019t yet been updated to make full use of the RTX 3090\u2019s new GPU architecture. \nThe other anomaly (and the more curious one) is with Blender\u2019s Cycles renderer. In the standard Blender Barber Shop interior scene, the RTX 3090 takes top spot, but enabling RTX acceleration actually makes the render significantly slower than using CUDA alone. This is also true for the Titan RTX and RTX 2080 Ti. I suspect that this may be due to the heavy use of indirect lighting in the scene: one of the few scenarios in which my tests suggest that CPU rendering still outperforms GPU rendering. When rendered on the CPU alone, the Xidax system\u2019s Threadripper 3990X outperformed even the RTX 3090 by a significant margin.\nOther benchmarks\nThe next set of benchmarks make use of the GPU for more specialist tasks. Photogrammetry application Metashape uses the GPU for image processing, Substance Alchemist uses the GPU for texture baking, material processing, and to run certain filters, and Premiere Pro uses the GPU for video encoding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the viewport and rendering benchmarks, the additional tests proved to be a mixed bag. In Metashape, the RTX 3090 comes in first, followed by the Titan RTX and the RTX 2080 Ti, but the margins are very small. \nWith Substance Alchemist, the RTX 3090 takes top spot in the material processing test but comes in last with the AI based de-lighting test. Since Alchemist\u2019s de-lighting filter didn\u2019t even start working with the RTX 3090 until the version of the software used in this review, I imagine that it is still being optimised for the third-generation Tensor cores. Hopefully, we will see performance improve in future releases. \nWith Premiere Pro, the RTX 3090 takes last place, although again, the margins here are relatively small.\nSynthetic benchmarks\nFinally, we have the synthetic benchmark 3DMark. Synthetic benchmarks don\u2019t accurately predict how a GPU will perform in production, but they do provide a way to compare the cards on test with older models, since scores for a wide range of GPUs are available online\n\n\n\nNo surprises here: the RTX 3090 takes first place, followed by the Titan RTX and the RTX 2080 Ti.\n\nOther considerations\nDCC tasks and memory usage\nAs part of the GeForce product line, the RTX 3090 is marketed as a consumer GPU \u2013 that is, a gaming GPU. But for many, it\u2019s the unofficial workstation GPU of the Ampere generation. The reason is its 24GB of VRAM. \nMany DCC tasks, particularly GPU rendering, use more of a GPU\u2019s VRAM than gaming, with the possible exception of 8K gaming, which is barely in its infancy. Although many GPU renderers can work \u2018out of core\u2019 by paging data out to system RAM once the VRAM fills up, in most cases, this incurs a pretty significant performance penalty. Some software simply crashes if a task requires more VRAM than is available.\nFor that reason, my final group of benchmarks test GPU rendering of scenes that require a lot of VRAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of VRAM on GPU rendering is most apparent when comparing the Titan RTX and RTX 2080 Ti. Both cards have almost identical GPUs, but at 24GB, the Titan RTX has almost twice as much GPU memory.\nAnother example is the UE4 test scene. At 13.4GB, loading the entire level into memory \u2013 as many devs do while working \u2013 requires more VRAM than is available on any GeForce GPU bar the RTX 3090. In contrast, when a game is played, only a small part of the game world is loaded. As an example, in my tests, running Red Dead Redemption 2 at 4K Ultra settings uses a maximum of 9.5GB of VRAM, and an average of 8.2GB.\nStudio Drivers\nBefore I get to my verdict, a note on drivers. Nvidia produces two sets of GPU drivers compatible with the GeForce RTX 3090: Studio Drivers, intended for DCC work, and Game Ready Drivers. \nIn my review of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, I compared the performance of a range of applications under Studio and Game Ready Drivers, and found almost no difference in viewport or rendering performance. Studio Drivers are meant to improve software stability, but I have had no real stability issues when using the game drivers. If you also use your GeForce GPU for gaming and experience weird errors with your DCC applications, give the Studio Drivers a try; otherwise, there is no real reason to switch.\n\nVerdict\nThe Titan of the Ampere generation>?\nGiven its specs, and its strong performance in my DCC benchmarks, the GeForce RTX 3090 deserves its reputation as the unofficial workstation card of Nvidia\u2019s Ampere generation of GPUs. In previous generations, that title was held by the Titan cards. So is the RTX 3090 also the unofficial Titan of the Ampere generation? \nIt certainly exhibits the same massive increase in VRAM over the next most powerful consumer card available, the GeForce RTX 3080, that the previous-generation Titan RTX did over the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. But while the Titan RTX featured a fully unlocked GPU, the GPU in the GeForce RTX 3090 \u2013 like the RTX 2080 Ti before it \u2013 is not. A fully unlocked GA102 GPU has 10,752 available CUDA cores, 336 Tensor cores, and 84 RT cores; the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s version has 10,496 available CUDA cores, 328 Tensor cores and 82 RT cores. The Titan RTX\u2019s drivers also featured a subset of pro-level features that the RTX 3090\u2019s do not.\nIf we do see an official Titan of the Ampere generation, my guess is that it will feature a fully unlocked GA-102-400 GPU clocked slightly higher than the RTX 3090, and carry 48GB of VRAM.\nIs the GeForce RTX 3090 worth the money?\nAt $1,499 for the Founders Edition, the GeForce RTX 3090 is pretty expensive for a gaming card. But is it good value for money for DCC work? The previous-generation Titan RTX proved to be popular among content creators, providing the power to tackle gruelling DCC tasks at a much lower price than Nvidia\u2019s equivalent professional card. The GeForce RTX 3090 not only features the same massive 24GB of VRAM as the Titan RTX, but outperforms it in almost all of my tests, and costs $1,000 less.\nIf you are a content creator that needs that kind of GPU power, that seems like a recipe for great value. When you consider that the top-of-the-range Ampere-based workstation card, the RTX A6000, costs $4,650, the GeForce RTX 3090 is \u2013 at least relatively speaking \u2013 a steal.\nSummary\nSo what conclusions can you take away from all the information presented in this review? For one thing, the GeForce RTX 3090 is a beast of a GPU. Even though it\u2019s officially a gaming card, for gaming alone, it\u2019s overkill. But for DCC work, it\u2019s one of the best GPUs that money can buy. With a massive increase in CUDA core count and a new generation of ray tracing and machine learning cores, it significantly outperforms all previous-generation GeForce cards, and even \u2013 SolidWorks aside \u2013 the Titan RTX. Just make sure you have a strong power supply, and a big enough case for it to fit in, if you plan to upgrade!\nLastly, I just want to say thanks for taking the time to stop by here.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia claims that its cryptocurrency hash rate limiter on the upcoming GeForce RTX 3060 12GB graphics card\u2014which is applied in software, not hardware\u2014is unable to be bypassed thanks to a secure handshake between software and hardware.Specifically, Nvidia tells PC Gamer, in an updated statement for further clarity on the limiter, that it believes \"End users cannot remove the hash limiter from the driver. There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.\"Nvidia had originally left it at \"the software cannot be hacked to remove the limiter,\" which had left the door open to a little more speculation as to what savvy miners could do to get around the limiter, many of whom are sure to want to run these cards at an unfettered hash rate.Nvidia is confident that its limiter is up to the challenge, then.This limiter being one intended to prevent miners from zealously chasing down graphics cards for use in blindly chipping away at cryptocurrency for a heady profit. The main cryptocurrency of choice for today's enterprising GPU miner is Ethereum, so that's exactly what Nvidia's block will prevent RTX 3060 graphics cards from mining.\u00a0The new limiter will halve the hash rate of the RTX 3060 when specific parts of the Ethereum mining algorithm are detected.The hope for Nvidia, and mild-mannered gamers everywhere, is that the block will remain in place and see these cards make their way out to gamers. Miners will then perhaps look to the mining-specific CMP, or Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, for their needs. Or the non-blocked high-end RTX 30-series cards.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 3060 will be the only card to come with the limiter in place from its arrival on February 25, Nvidia tells us, as it is \"not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold.\"The RTX 3060 is sure to be a popular card, too, as all Ampere GPUs have been so far, although even more so thanks to its $329 price tag.Cut the cord...(Image credit: Steelseries)Best wireless gaming mouse: ideal cable-free rodents\nBest wireless gaming keyboard: no wires, no worries\nBest wireless gaming headset: top untethered audioWhether we'll see more stock stick around on that day as a result of lowered mining demand, we're not yet sure. There's still incredible demand for PC parts, and undoubtedly the cheapest Ampere GPU of the lot will be the most popular by volume, as we've seen in the past with popular cards such as the GTX 1060. So my guess is that it'll still be a day one scramble like any other launch over the past five months.Any move Nvidia can make to keep as many GPUs as possible in play for gamers will be absolutely welcome by many, although perhaps not those looking to do a little mining on the side. It will likely turn miners off to the first wave of RTX 3060 graphics cards, at least, as any uncertainty as to the hash rate of these cards won't see these cards as prime mining material\u2014even if Nvidia's unhackable limiter goes down like the Titanic later in life.\u00a0We're hoping it's not easily brushed aside, however, and Nvidia's confidence offers a little hope for PC building in the first half of 2021.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCryptocurrency\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

If there is no pop-up box, just continue to the next step.\n- Click \"Log In\" and enter your Nvidia GeForce Now log in details (if it doesn't log you in automatically).\n- Find any of the games you have in your GeForce Now library, click on it, hit play and away you go.\n- The game will ask to go full screen and you may need to input your Steam or other store account details (depending on where the original game is hosted).\n- Natually, you will also need to pair a controller to your PC or Mac if the game requires one.\n- You can also bookmark games to jump straight to your favourites. You can also share URLs to invite friends to play.\nPlease note, as this is a beta version of the feature there may be some issues when running games. It's always best to run them through the dedicated app.\nThe new software version also adds support for Macs running on Apple's M1 silicon.\nYou can see more about the 2.0.27 update here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support Pocket-lint.

This architecture has been satisfying gamer\u2019s graphics needs for some time now and the impressive performance out of these GPUs has been duly noted by the computer world.The Nvidia Turing lineup is quite striking, from the original Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, RTX 2070 and RTX 2060, to the newer Super RTX cards led by the RTX 2080 Super. They\u2019re still among the best graphics cards available to power the next couple years of gaming (especially considering how hard it is to get one of the newer generation Nvidia Ampere GPUs). And, don\u2019t forget the Titan RTX card for the prosumer crowd.Real-time ray tracing has come to the masses thanks to Nvidia Turing, revolutionizing how GPUs render the best PC games. And, considering how games like Metro Exodus and Shadow of the Tomb Raider look with ray tracing turned on, there\u2019s no turning back. You can even enable ray tracing on non-RTX cards (though you will suffer a major performance hit).And, with these graphics cards showcasing their graphics prowess in the desktop arena, it\u2019s no surprise that Nvidia is hitting the mobile sphere as well. Its Turing-based GeForce RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super graphics cards are now available for gaming laptops. You can now find a ton of laptops equipped with Nvidia Turing\u2019s mobile GPUs.\u00a0Of course, there are Nvidia Turing cards out there for people that don\u2019t need as much power: the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, GeForce GTX 1660 and GeForce GTX 1650. They\u2019re not quite as powerful as the RTX 2000 cards, but they\u2019re significantly more affordable. On the other side of the spectrum, there\u2019s the Nvidia Ampere series, Turing\u2019s successor, which are blowing the competition away.Still, the Nvidia Turing cards remain among the best on the market today, and the most influential graphics cards to ever hit the shelves.Cut to the chaseWhat is it? Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics card architectureWhen is it out? Out since September 20What will it cost? $599 (\u00a3569, AU$899) - $10,000 (\u00a37,830, AU$13,751)Image Credit: Nvidia Nvidia Turing release dateAll of the currently-announced Nvidia Turing GPUs are now out in the wild \u2013 from the GTX 1660 and 1660 Ti to the RTX Super cards: RTX 2060 Super, RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.At CES 2019, we didn\u2019t just finally get an RTX 2060 announcement, but also over 40 gaming laptops sporting the mobile version of Nvidia RTX graphics. These days, the best gaming laptops, alongside the ones we saw at CES 2019 like the Alienware Area 51m, are all packing the latest Nvidia Turing graphics.\u00a0On the other hand, the GeForce RTX 2060 Super and GeForce RTX 2070 Super hit the streets in July to compete with AMD Navi. If you were looking for a graphics card that you won\u2019t have to take out a personal loan to afford, these are certainly the more affordable options. The pricier GeForce RTX 2080 Super followed, seeing a release date of July 23rd.\u00a0Thankfully, the RTX-series cards are readily available now after some initial limited availability. And, thanks to the release of the newer cards, you\u2019ll likely find more than a few older models on sale every day.What\u2019s more is users will have these RTX Super cards available on-the-go as well. Nvidia just recently announced that the RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super graphics cards are now going to be available for gaming laptops in April 2020. That\u2019s alongside the GeForce RTX 2060 laptops, which are going to start coming in at $999 (about \u00a3800, AU$1,640).Image Credit: TechRadar Nvidia Turing priceAlthough the Nvidia Turing series started with the Quadro RTX GPUs, we're far more interested in the graphics cards available for consumers. If you wanted to check out these enterprise-leaning parts, we\u2019ve got you covered here. Otherwise, the prices for Nvidia Turing graphics cards are as follows:Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti: $1,199 (\u00a31,099, AU$1,899)\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super: $699 (about \u00a3560, AU$1099)Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080: $799 (\u00a3749, AU$1,199)\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super: $499 (about \u00a3395, AU$720)Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070: $599 (\u00a3569, AU$899)\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super: $399 (about \u00a3315, AU$580)Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060: $349 (\u00a3329, AU$599)Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti: $279 (\u00a3259, AU$469)\u00a0Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660: $219\u00a0 (\u00a3219, AU$389)Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650: $149 (about \u00a3115, AU$210)Overall, the prices for Nvidia's newest graphics cards seem to have risen with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti taking the place of Nvidia\u2019s past Titan cards. This shift up was sadly seen across the entire lineup.\u00a0That is, until the Super RTX cards rolled out. Perhaps in an effort to keep up with the growing popularity of AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 5700 GPUs, Nvidia released the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super, at a lower price \u2013 $100 less, to be exact \u2013 than their predecessors when they were first released. Essentially, anyone looking to upgrade to one of the RTX Turing cards can now pay less for even better performance.Then there\u2019s the Turing GTX cards. These are heralded by the $279 (\u00a3259, AU$469) GTX 1660 Ti, and provide phenomenal value at the low end. The most recent of these cards, the GTX 1650, is priced at $149 (about \u00a3115, AU$210), and is positioned to compete with the AMD Radeon RX 570.Image Credit: TechRadar Nvidia Turing specsThe marquee feature of Nvidia Turing is the inclusion of ray-tracing, which can render more realistic visuals and lighting in real time without having to fall back on programming tricks. Through specialized RT cores, these graphics cards can basically calculate how light and sound travel in a 3D environment at a rate of up to 10 GigaRay/s on the RTX 2080 Ti. These specialized cores also allow Nvidia Turing-based graphics cards to process ray tracing up to 25 times faster than Pascal.When these RT Cores aren\u2019t in use for ray tracing, they essentially switch off, ceasing to draw any power. \u00a0\u00a0In addition to these RT cores, the Turing Architecture also features Tensor Cores, like the ones found in Volta. These specialized cores enable artificial intelligence and neural networking so that Turing cards get better at rendering over time \u2013 something previously exclusive to supercomputers.\u00a0Image 1 of 2Image Credit: Nvidia Image Credit: NvidiaWith the ability to deliver 500 trillion Tensor operations a second, this technology accelerates deep learning training and inferencing. This allows Nvidia to offer Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), which could be a version of super sampling that won\u2019t bring your computer to its knees.\u00a0Even for games that don\u2019t support this new DLSS tech, these AI-fueled cores should deliver traditional anti-aliasing much more efficiently \u2013 up to eight times.As with Volta, Nvidia Turing is adopting GDDR6 memory \u2013 up to 11GB in the RTX 2080 Ti, which can clock in at up to 14Gbps, and up to 8GB in the RTX 2080 Super, clocking in at up to 15.5Gbps. That\u2019s quite the leap over the Pascal-powered Nvidia Titan Xp that clocked in at 11.4Gbps.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is an absolute behemoth of a GPU. With 4,352 CUDA cores, 11GB of GDDR6 VRAM with a 352-bit memory bus and 18 billion transistors, it\u2019s capable of 4K Ultra gaming at high refresh rates for years to come. It\u2019s no wonder it comes with such a high price tag.\u00a0The more mainstream RTX 2080 and RTX 2070, as well as the RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2070 Super, are also quite impressive and absolutely destroy the previous generation of GPUs. The former will feature 2,944 CUDA cores, 8GB of GDDR6 memory and clocks in at a 1.5GHz base frequency. The 2070, though is be a bit weaker, coming with 2,304 CUDA cores 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM and clocked at a 1,410Mhz base frequency.And, while the RTX 2060 is basically just a cut-down RTX 2070, with the same TU106 GPU, but with 1,920 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a boost clock of 1,680 MHz, it\u2019s still a formidable graphics card.Nvidia has also launched some non-RTX cards, starting with the GTX 1660 Ti. This entry-level card features 1,536 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM at 12Gbps, and a base clock of 1,500 MHz. It\u2019s slower than the RTX 2060, but it\u2019s a substantial upgrade over the GTX 1060 it replaces.Team Green\u2019s second non-RTX GPU, the GTX 1660 features 1,480 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR5 video memory and a reference boost clock of 1,785MHz. It might not sound mighty on paper, but between its low price and fantastic 1080p gaming performance, it\u2019s currently the absolutely best entry-level graphics card you can buy.A third non-RTX GPU has been released, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650. This low-end GPU features the TU117 GPU, clocked at 1,485GHz with a boost of 1,665GHz. This budget card features 4GB of GDDR5 VRAM with 128GB/s of memory bandwidth on a 128-bit bus.Nvidia Turing Performance\u00a0As long as you have the high-end specs to back them up, the new Turing RTX cards are able to perform much faster than their Pascal equivalents. These cards will be able to push it even further once DLSS or deep learning super sampling is more widespread. Additionally, due to the AA improvements in the Tensor cores, we\u2019re seeing about a 20-40% increase in games that don't support DLSS.In our benchmarks, the GeForce RTX 2080 outperforms the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \u00a0by about 11% and the Nvidia GTX 1080 by a more impressive 32% in Middle Earth: Shadow of War in 4K. This performance difference is even more massive when you look at the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. It\u2019s not only 20% faster than the RTX 2080 in the same title, but beats out the last-generation 1080 Ti by a massive 30%, destroying the GTX 1080 with a 45% performance delta.\u00a0Then, there\u2019s the RTX 2080 Super, the high-end offering in the Super RTX series. When pitted against its predecessor, we found the RTX 2080 Super is only about 4-5% faster than the RTX 2080 Founders Edition, which may not be worth the upgrade if you\u2019ve already invested in the RTX series. However, if you\u2019re upgrading from a GTX card, and you don\u2019t have the funds to shell out for a $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, the RTX 2080 Super is as close as you\u2019re going to get to robust 4K gaming experience.\u00a0The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 is less impressive, and while it does absolutely wipe the floor with the GTX 1070, it\u2019s essentially neck in neck with the GTX 1080 \u2013 barely hitting a 10% performance increase at 4K in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. At this price point, we expected more, especially after seeing the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti\u2019s impressive performance.On the other hand, we\u2019re very impressed with the price-to-performance ratio of the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2060 Super. This is especially true for the former, which offers a much better performance than the vanilla RTX 2070 at $100 cheaper, and can even breach the RTX 2080\u2019s territory. With boosted specs, the RTX 2060 Super will easily handle 1440p gaming with ray tracing enabled, rivaling the RTX 2070\u2019s performance.\u00a0The RTX 2060 is obviously the weakest of the bunch, but you shouldn\u2019t dismiss it outright. The mid-range Nvidia Turing card far outclasses the GTX 1060, but what\u2019s more surprising is that it surpasses the GTX 1070 Ti \u2013 for a lower asking price. We were able to get 90 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080p, whereas the 1070 Ti lagged behind at 86 fps. That\u2019s not a huge difference, but the 2060 is $100 cheaper at launch.\u00a0In traditional games, there\u2019s no question that Nvidia Turing marks a total upgrade from Pascal. And, over time as drivers mature and users get ready to start overclocking their Turing cards, the difference is only going to grow. That\u2019s not to mention the inclusion of incoming DLSS and ray tracing in games, which should only increase the Nvidia Turing performance gap.When it comes to ray tracing, there was only one title that supported it at the time of writing: Battlefield V. And, in that title, the Nvidia Turing cards use a hybrid rendering technique \u2013 combining both traditional rasterization and ray tracing in order to produce playable frame rates.Nvidia utilizes \u201cBounding Volume Hierarchy,\u201d or BVH to track large portions of the scene being rendered for whether or not a ray is being bounced. The RTX cores will then dig deeper into these large rendering zones until it finds the polygon that\u2019s getting hit by the light ray.\u00a0This method impacts performance far less than tracking each ray live, but it\u2019s still very demanding. In our own testing, you\u2019ll be stuck at 1080p if you\u2019re looking for smooth gameplay with ray tracing turned on. However, with Nvidia\u2019s latest RTX drivers, it\u2019s claiming to increase performance by up to 50% for ray tracing. We\u2019ll be sure to test this and report back, but we have to wait for the new Battlefield V patch to do it.\u00a0As for the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, you can expect a much better performance than the GTX 1060 for less money \u2013 up to 56% faster in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080p in our testing. That makes the 1660 Ti a beast when it comes to value.Meanwhile, this the latest in AMD Vega\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nKevin LeeSocial Links NavigationKevin Lee was a former computing reporter at TechRadar.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorFeb 19, 2021, 04:42pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.GeForce RTX 3060 die shotNVIDIA\nUnless you\u2019ve been snoozing the past six months, you\u2019ve seen that Covid-19 has driven unprecedented demand for personal and work electronics. Consumers who already had PCs (25% Q4 growth1) bought better ones. And for shared PC families, they purchased devices like PCs, Chromebooks (5X Q4 growth1), and tablets (2X Q4 growth1) for everyone in the family for entertainment and school. It was hard to find new business PCs that many were buying on the used market or did their best to convert a consumer PC for commercial use. Covid-19 increased gaming demand as the pandemic limited activities to do outside the house, and we had new consoles, and PC cards announced. All these factors drove to limit the supply of graphics cards, but there was a twist here. It is not just gamers that were snatching up new cards from AMD and NVIDIA; it was Ethereum cryptocurrency miners. I\u2019ve seen market prices 3x of list prices of the highest-end cards. Yesterday, NVIDIA made two significant announcements that I believe will be good for gamers and miners related to this issue over the long-term and in the short-term provide increased gamer supply.\u00a0\n\n\nThe news\n\nThe first announcement NVIDIA made was that with the GeForce RTX 3060, the company is limiting the Ethereum hash rate to 50% of its potential mining performance. The second announcement was that the company was introducing a new line of products dedicated to Ethereum mining, called Cryptocurrency Mining Processor or \u201cCMP\u201d for short. NVIDIA announced four cards, the 30HX, 40HX, 50HX, and 90HX. As you can see from the specifications below, the cards vary in power, pins, memory size, availability, and ultimately, Ethereum hash rate. CMP cards do not have a video out to play games and while the company did not provide details on it, it says that CMP cards have lower peak core voltage and frequency than GeForce cards.\nCryptocurrency Mining Processor \u201cCMP\u201d lineup NVIDIA\n\nWhy it matters\n\nPC gamers have become frustrated with the inability to buy new graphics cards, and NVIDIA never had a mechanism to prioritize supply to gamers versus Ethereum miners. Now the company does. Anyway I slice this, I see more graphics card supply for gamers if NVIDIA manages this closely, which I believe it will. While the company has only committed to the RTX 3060 with a reduced hash rate, I can\u2019t think of why the company would extend it to future cards.\nI have seen a few things on Twitter saying this is a bad move and wanted to provide my two cents.\nFirst, I\u2019ve heard this is bad for miners. Personally, my thought is, \u201cso what.\u201d Gamers are what makes NVIDIA great, not miners who are in and out based on the latest currency variant and ASIC. The lack of gaming card supply creates an enormous amount of gamer bad blood for both AMD and NVIDIA. I believe gamers should be the focus, and miners should be a tertiary market. I haven\u2019t seen anything that says there\u2019s anything wrong with the CMP line for miners.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nI\u2019m also hearing that NVIDIA allows larger mining operations to write its own drivers and BIOS, therefore circumventing NVIDIA\u2019s methods of decreasing the hash rate. NVIDIA\u2019s response to me was that \u201cThere is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.\u201d Even if it is a cat and mouse game, I have to favor the card creator in this battle. And if the CMP line fits the miner\u2019s needs, they won\u2019t have a reason to use GeForce.\n\n\n\nI also read that some are saying these CMP chips are basically yield spill-off and are \u201cdefective\u201d GeForce chips. Again, I say, \u201cso what.\u201d If true, I think it\u2019s a brilliant move by NVIDIA using die that didn\u2019t pass voltage, frequency, or other GeForce gaming tests. In the silicon world, the name of the game is maximizing known good die at the highest price possible. This, again, increases the amount of silicon available to gamers.\u00a0\nAs for the future, as the preferred silicon for mining vacillates between ASIC and GPU, it\u2019s hard to say how long a CMP line will be necessary. For instance, Bitcoin mining is dominated by ASICs, but before that, GPUs. What\u2019s important is that there is now a CMP line, and NVIDIA is doing everything it can, starting with the RTX 3060, to deliver more volumes of cards to gamers versus miners, who get their own line.\u00a0\n1 Source: Canalys\nDISCLOSURE: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including 8x8, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Applied Micro, ARM, Aruba Networks, AT&T, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\u00a0Bitfusion, Blaize, Box, Broadcom, Calix, Cisco Systems, Clear Software, Cloudera,\u00a0Clumio, Cognitive Systems, CompuCom, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics,\u00a0Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Frame (now VMware), Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google (Nest-Revolve), Google Cloud, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Ion VR,\u00a0Inseego, Infosys, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation,\u00a0MapBox, Marvell,\u00a0Mavenir, Marseille Inc, Mayfair Equity, Meraki (Cisco),\u00a0Mesophere, Microsoft, Mojo Networks, National Instruments, NetApp, Nightwatch, NOKIA (Alcatel-Lucent), Nortek,\u00a0Novumind, NVIDIA, Nuvia, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Oracle, Poly, Panasas,\u00a0Peraso, Pexip, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Poly,\u00a0Portworx, Pure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus,\u00a0Rayvolt\u00a0E-Bikes, Red Hat,\u00a0Residio, Samsung Electronics, SAP, SAS, Scale Computing, Schneider Electric, Silver Peak, SONY,\u00a0Springpath, Spirent, Splunk, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, Synopsys, Tanium, TE Connectivity,\u00a0TensTorrent,\u00a0Tobii\u00a0Technology, T-Mobile, Twitter, Unity Technologies, UiPath, Verizon Communications,\u00a0Vidyo, VMware, Wave Computing,\u00a0Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra,\u00a0Zededa, and Zoho which may be cited in blogs and research.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

With Chinese New Year celebrations taking place on February 12, it now looks like these supply issues are bound to get even worse, at least for the remainder of early 2021, as factories close down anywhere from one to two weeks.\nRELATED: Xbox Series X Availability Won't Improve Until June, Confirms Microsoft\nA recent report from Tom\u2019s Hardware highlights these worsening issues, with European retailers disclosing information provided directly by Nvidia, which points to scarcity growing to levels worse than those seen in previous months. So far, the sales numbers demonstrate which cards are the most sought after, showing that the RTX 3080 and 3060 Ti are the most coveted cards; on the other hand, the pricey 3090 ($1,499) and 3070 show a relatively smaller number of orders, at least according to hardware retailer Alternate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces RTX 3060 Ti\n\nAs far as actual stock goes, though there are no specific quantities, Nvidia seems to be shipping a greater number of RTX 3070 GPUs, whereas one could speculate retailers simply receive less stock of the rest of the 3000 series cards. Why is all this happening? The first thing to keep in mind is that -contrary to popular belief- graphics card manufacturers are making more products now than ever; it\u2019s demand that's gone through the roof.\nNevertheless, both Nvidia and AMD face issues with their own providers of raw materials and other parts necessary to manufacture their signature products, such as VRMs, capacitors and PCB components. As far as both companies are concerned, they are already operating at max capacity,\u00a0and are simply unable to meet the growing market demands.\nOn top of that, there is also a rise in demand from cryptocurrency miners, as even the yet to be released 3060 or the 3000 series laptops are proving to be profitable for mining activities in some parts of the world. Both of these topics were addressed by AMD CEO Lisa Su, who touched upon the matter while admitting a very similar situation over at AMD that\u2019ll impact the consoles well into 2021. Overall, buying new gaming hardware is not getting any easier on PCs nor consoles.\nNext: Super Mario 64 Gets Ray-Tracing In Surreal New Mod \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame News\n\n\n\n\nTriple-A Games\n\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBaldur's Gate 3 Custom Campaign Appears On Official Modlist For The First Time Ever\n\t\t\n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\nLarian previously stated that mods which involved map editing and heavy scripting weren't going to be officially supported.\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Players Agree Miri Fajta Is The Most Annoying Quest\n\t\t\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\nThe Voivode is also the most annoying character in the game.\n\n\nPosts\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSuikoden 1 & 2 HD Remasters: 8 Biggest Differences Between The Originals And The Remasters\n\t\t\n\n\nSuikoden I&II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars\n\nHere are the biggest differences between the original and remastered Suikoden 1 & 2!\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Players Think They've Spotted A Witcher In The Game\n\t\t\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\nUnfortunately, nobody in Bohemia knows how to play Gwent.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMonster Hunter Wilds Fan Puts Together Extensive Guide On How To Fix Performance\n\t\t\n\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds\n\nThere are a couple of key mods that help alleviate Monster Hunter Wilds' poor performance on PC.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBaldur's Gate 3 Player Outsmarted Mizora As Origin Wyll, But The Game Didn't Acknowledge It\n\t\t\n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\nLarian hasn't quite accounted for every single scenario.\n\n\nPosts\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tArkveld, Doshaguma, And Rey Dau From Monster Hunter Wilds Already Have Their Own Plushes\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMonster Hunter Wilds' Success Has Nothing To Do With Storytelling\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSakurai Says Japanese Developers Should Make Japanese Games, Not \"Americanised\" Ones\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Team\nOur Audience\nAbout Us\nPress & Events\nContact Us\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nCareers\nTerms\nPrivacy\nPolicies\n\n\nTheGamer is part of the\n                            Valnet Publishing Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Copyright \u00a9 2025 Valnet Inc.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Admittedly, WccfTech don't state their source for this particular date, so it could all be a load of hogwash. However, when taken together with other rumours that have been floating round the internet lately (and the fact that almost all Nvidia's previous RTX 30 cards have launched on a Thursday as well), there might just be a shred of truth to it. \n\n\n\n\n10 Best Free PC Games You Should Play In 2019\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nAt the end of January, for example, Videocardz allegedly obtained Nvidia's embargo schedule for the RTX 3060, which stated that press and influencers would start receiving review samples on February 19th. The schedule didn't list when the embargo for reviews would eventually lift, nor did it reveal an exact release date for the RTX 3060, but if the sample seed date does indeed prove to be true, then it would seem likely that a worldwide release date of Thursday February 25th is probably about right. The RTX 3070, RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 all launched on Thursdays at the end of last year, after all, and it's not unusual to only have a week of testing before the card eventually goes on sale. The only exception to this rule was the RTX 3060 Ti, which launched on December 2nd - a Wednesday.\nAs such, there's still a possibility that February 25th isn't the correct release date after all - although given we're almost halfway through February already and I've heard neither hide nor hair of when review samples are arriving yet, a more general window somewhere between Monday February 22nd and Friday February 26th seems all but certain. Of course, given how quickly the rest of Nvidia's RTX 30 family got snapped up at launch, we can probably also expect stock levels of the RTX 3060 to last all of 20 seconds before it, too, disappears in a puff of smoke for the next several months, but I will, of course, let you know its proper on sale date as soon as Nvidia get round to announcing it.\nThe RTX 3060 is set to be the cheapest RTX 30 card yet out of Nvidia's next-gen Ampere family of ray tracing GPUs, with prices starting at \u00a3299 / $329. It will come with 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM (which is actually more than the 8GB you get on the more powerful RTX 3060 Ti on RTX 3070), 3584 CUDA cores (down from the 4864 on the RTX 3060 Ti), and a base clock speed of 1320MHz (also down from the 1410MHz on the Ti). Unlike the rest of Nvidia's RTX 30 family, though, there will be no Founders Edition of the RTX 3060 available when it eventually launches - so you'll have to pick from one of the many third party models that will be going to on sale if you decide to try and get one.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

The pandemic birthed a global semiconductor shortage, Trump\u2019s trade war didn\u2019t help, and now even four-year-old graphics cards can fetch several hundred dollars on the secondhand market. Into that chaos, Nvidia is launching the $329 GeForce RTX 3060, a card the company insists will actually have a starting price of $329, and I\u2019m reviewing a model of that card that they claimed would actually go on sale for that price today: the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming. \u201cSupply will be limited though,\u201d EVGA tells The Verge. Of course it will. Sure enough, we couldn\u2019t find a $329 RTX 3060 to save our lives during this morning\u2019s launch.Even if it eventually winds up being easy to purchase, though, I\u2019ve got to wonder if the 3060 is the affordable GPU that we\u2019ve been waiting for. 7Verge ScoreEVGA RTX 3060$330$330The GoodSmall, cool, and relatively quietDLSS can bring ray tracing within reachPerhaps you\u2019ll be able to find this oneThe BadNot a great choice for 1440pLittle headroom in the latest gamesHow much will you actually pay?$330 at Newegg$390 at Best Buy$390 at Micro CenterHow we rate and review productsEvery graphics card we\u2019ve reviewed over the past six months had a compelling reason to exist. The GeForce RTX 3080 was the first no-compromise 4K gaming graphics card under $1,000, and the AMD RX 6800 XT gave it a direct competitor. The RTX 3070 and RX 6800 excel at 1440p and invite you to turn your aging desktop into an entry-level 4K rig for the price of a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Meanwhile, the $400 RTX 3060 Ti is the bang-for-the-buck champ, delivering nearly as much 1440p performance as the RTX 3070 for $100 less.The vanilla 3060\u2019s story isn\u2019t quite as inspiring by comparison. Nominally, it\u2019s only a little less expensive than the 3060 Ti, but you sacrifice more than a little bit of performance to get there. The rear ports of EVGA\u2019s RTX 3060. Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeEVGA\u2019s RTX 3060 has a regular eight-pin connector. Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeBefore we dive into benchmarks, let\u2019s spend a moment on the EVGA XC Black Gaming. I kind of dig the design: the twin-fan, dual-heat-pipe card is small and easy to slot into a Mini-ITX case \u2014 and with a tried-and-true eight-pin PCIe power connector instead of the proprietary 12-pin connector featured in Nvidia\u2019s own RTX 3090, 3080, 3070 and 3060 Ti cards. You still get the full array of video outputs, including three DisplayPort 1.4a ports and an HDMI 2.1 port with HDCP 2.3 support.Here\u2019s what it looks like next to my own 3060 Ti Founder\u2019s Edition. It\u2019s notably smaller:EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founder\u2019s Edition. Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeThe eight-inch-long card isn\u2019t even the smallest RTX 3060 you\u2019ll see this year, as Nvidia\u2019s partners have some single-fan designs that should squeeze into practically any case on the market that has room for a dual-slot GPU. This dual-fan XC Gaming cooler is potent enough that EVGA already fit an RTX 3060 Ti into this form factor, too.While I can\u2019t imagine all those embossed \u201cE\u201d symbols exactly help my fan performance, they don\u2019t seem to especially hurt, with a moderately pitched whirring sound at full bore instead of a mini jet engine scream. It\u2019s both a few degrees cooler and a tad quieter than my 3060 Ti FE during a demanding game, hovering around 70 degrees Celsius and 2,200 RPM with my two Noctua A12x15 case fans backing it up and around 80C without.Add the lower 550W power supply requirement (the card draws 170W, versus 200W for the Ti), and that\u2019s a lot of reasons the 3060 should be popular for mini builds.Okay, let\u2019s talk performance. If you\u2019ve read my previous two reviews, you know I\u2019m a bit of a cheapskate. I\u2019m the kind of person who\u2019d definitely buy a $330 graphics card instead of a $600 one, and that means I\u2019m also the kind of person who\u2019d pair it with my existing, plenty-good-enough CPU instead of upgrading my whole rig. I\u2019m running the RTX 3060 with my quad-core 4.2GHz Core i7-7700K, and proud of it. You probably know that CPU power matters less as you raise the resolution; at 4K or 1440p, your frame rate is limited a lot more by your graphics card in all but a handful of games.But at 1440p, the vanilla 3060 doesn\u2019t have quite enough oomph to regularly make it over 60fps in the latest games without tweaking lots of settings in a build like mine \u2014 and yet the 3060 Ti generally hits 60 without a problem. EVGA\u2019s RTX 3060 comes with a lot of embossed \u201cE\u201d symbols.

The 3060 is punching below its weight: a higher boost clock and 12GB of memory can\u2019t hope to make up for 26 percent fewer cores and a narrower 192-bit memory bus.You\u2019ll see in the chart that neither card let me comfortably run the most demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Metro Exodus at ultra spec at 1440p, but the difference between these two cards is the difference between running those games at medium or high levels of detail. High settings tend to look a lot better, and it\u2019s nice to have some additional headroom for future games that\u2019ll push the GPU even harder.That said, these frame rates are still nothing to sneeze at. My four-year-old GTX 1080 couldn\u2019t dream of maxing out Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1440p at a smooth 78fps or Warzone at 87fps. I had to play through a bunch of Cyberpunk 2077 at low spec earlier this year, which I absolutely do not recommend, and I\u2019d honestly been saving Control until I could find a new GPU. It\u2019s also very nice to be able to play Star Wars Squadrons at a full 120fps (even if I could get to 144fps with a 3060 Ti) or the delightful but unoptimized Valheim at around 60fps with the eye candy turned on.EVGA is using a dual heat pipe on its RTX 3060 card. Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeAnd if you\u2019ve got a 1080p monitor instead of 1440p, or if you\u2019re a fan of Nvidia\u2019s resolution-reducing, AI-sharpening DLSS technique \u2014 I hate it, my colleague Tom Warren loves it \u2014 you can genuinely turn on ray tracing with a $329 graphics card and begin to experience the wonder of real-time reflections. A 46fps average in Control may not sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a smooth game north of 45fps if you\u2019ve got a G-Sync or FreeSync monitor actually delivering each of those frames, and that\u2019s what I saw with ray tracing turned on at 1080p. With ray tracing off, Watch Dogs Legion and Metro Exodus look playable at 1080p high spec as well.But even then, 1080p is a resolution where your CPU begins to matter, and my Core i7-7700K or earlier won\u2019t always be enough. The new Microsoft Flight Simulator is famously CPU-limited, and to some degree so is Cyberpunk, where I saw dips below 60fps no matter what level of detail I\u2019d set. Yes, these were all photographed on the lid of my Ncase M1. Photo by Sean Hollister / The VergeIf you\u2019ve specifically been waiting for a $300-ish card to replace an aging GPU, you\u2019ll be satisfied with lower settings over the next couple of years, and you can actually find an RTX 3060 at its retail price, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed. But I\u2019d set aside $500 for an RTX 3070, and though I settled for a $400 RTX 3060 Ti, I can\u2019t imagine settling for a 3060 instead.If you have an extra $70 in the budget for the slightly beefier card, I would absolutely spend it. And if you can\u2019t find what you want, I\u2019d say keep on waiting.

It\u2019s a smart solution for the frustrating graphics card market we\u2019re currently mired in.\n\u201cThere have been a lot of rumors recently about Nvidia releasing more GPUs to AIBs from older generations\u2014the [GeForce] RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti were specifically mentioned,\u201d I asked an Nvidia spokesperson via email. \u201cCan you comment on whether there\u2019s any truth to that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe products referenced below were never EOLed [end-of-lifed\u2014ed]. So \u2018reviving\u2019 seems like the wrong terminology to use here,\u201d Nvidia told me, referencing the use of the word \u201creviving\u201d in my subject line. \u201cMore of an ebb and flow really. We\u2019re just meeting market demand which remains extremely high as you noted.\u201d\nSo there you have it. Yes, Nvidia is also supplying older GPUs to feed the insatiable demand for graphics cards. Again: It\u2019s a smart move, as the GeForce RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti sidestep some of the conditions creating such a volatile market.\n\n\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nWhy reviving older GeForce GPUs makes sense\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition.\n\n\nThe RTX 2060 debuted in January 2019 for $350. It supports Nvidia\u2019s ray-tracing and DLSS ambitions but is built using an older 12nm TSMC manufacturing process, avoiding the hotly in-demand current nodes. (Nvidia\u2019s RTX 30-series GPUs are built on Samsung 8nm, while shortages for AMD products and next-gen consoles stem from a logjam on TSMC\u2019s 7nm node.) Ramping up production of this GPU puts more relatively current graphics cards with modern features on the streets, and creating hardware with firmly established manufacturing nodes tends to be much cheaper than building GPUs on a cutting-edge process.\n Valve \n\nA screenshot of the most popular graphics cards in the Steam Hardware Survey taken on February 11, 2021.\n\n\nThe GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, on the other hand, launched all the way back in 2016 for $140. Before you call it obsolete, consider that the humble GPU remains the second-most-popular graphics card on Steam (with the RTX 2060 at fifth), and deploying it again provides some key strategic advantages. Perhaps most important? It comes with 4GB of GDDR5 memory.\nFor months, rumors have said that there\u2019s a shortage of the GDDR6 memory used with modern GPUs, and if that\u2019s indeed the case, rolling out the GDDR5-equipped 1050 Ti again lets Nvidia build affordable hardware without tapping into its precious GDDR6 reserves. The capacity matters just as much. Part of the reason for the current GPU crunch is due to the Ethereum cryptocoin mining bubble, which is insanely profitable right now. Ethereum gets mined on graphics cards, unlike Bitcoin, but requires a GPU with more than 4GB of onboard memory. Bottom line: the reborn GTX 1050 Ti can\u2019t be used to mine Ethereum so it won\u2019t appeal to those buyers.\nBetter yet, as a 75W card that can slip into any computer\u2019s PCIe slot without the need for extra power connectors, the GTX 1050 Ti is an easy and affordable upgrade for newfound PC gamers who took to the hobby while stuck at home for months. Just slap it in and start playing!\n\nNot all that\u00a0affordable\nThe extra stock for these older cards alleviates all different kinds of pressure for Nvidia and its partners, but the RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti are still subject to today\u2019s market pressures themselves. We can find a single GTX 1050 Ti for $190 on Newegg currently, but most are selling for $400 or more. Again, these cards debuted for $140 in 2016. Only a handful of RTX 2060 models are available on Newegg, starting at $800. Those prices all remain outrageous for what you\u2019re getting as a PC gamer.\nAnd despite Nvidia\u2019s statement that these two GPUs were never formally sent out to pasture, make no mistake: The GTX 1050 Ti was in all but name, at the very least. It has since been replaced by the GTX 1650, and retailers told Tech Yes City (who broke the revival news) that \u201cit feels like two years ago\u201d since they last saw stock of the GTX 1050 Ti.\nThe rebirth of older graphics cards makes you wonder if we\u2019ll see budget-minded next-gen cards anytime soon though. Nvidia is selling every high-margin RTX 30-series GPU it can manufacture right now, and if classic graphics cards are holding down the entry-level market to some degree at least, it makes business sense to focus on products that make you the most money. We\u2019ll see how it goes.

It's destined to swiftly become a best seller\u2026 and then sold out in an instant. I'd bet my bottom dollar on it. But while you might expect a cookie cutter launch from Nvidia's fifth Ampere launch to date, you'd perhaps be surprised that the RTX 3060 12GB is something of a new beast altogether.Perhaps the most newsworthy shake up for the Nvidia RTX 3060 came with the announcement of a hash rate limiter, which will keep the card from operating at its full capability while mining Ethereum, the crypto of choice for GPU mining. Nvidia hopes that'll sway miners towards its new CMP line-up, built from off cut GPUs not fit for gaming consumption, while supposedly leaving more GeForce cards for gamersBut we're not assessing the Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB's mining capability in this review, even if that may have some impact on the eventual availability of these cards. No, we're diving into its gaming prowess. There's a whole new GPU to play with here, alongside a mighty memory loadout, so let's get right to it.Specifications(Image credit: Future)What are the Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB specs?The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 12GB isn't quite what we were first expecting at this price, but that's more down to its engorged memory capacity than its GPU specs.\u00a0That 12GB of GDDR6 memory sticks out like a sore thumb from the crowd of RTX 30-series GPUs before it: The RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti both come with 8GB of the stuff, while the RTX 3080 is fit with 10GB of GDDR6X. The chips denoted with that all-important 'X' are actually quite a bit faster than the standard GDDR6 silicon, though, so don't make for direct comparison.The RTX 3090 is the only RTX 30-series card to top the memory capacity of the RTX 3060, with 24GB of GDDR6X. Again, that's all far quicker in practice. But you can already see why the cheapest Ampere card arriving with the second-highest memory capacity is enough to raise a few eyebrows.RTX 3060 12GB specsGPU: GA106\nLithograpy: Samsung 8nm\nCUDA cores: 3,584\nSMs: 28\nRT Cores: 28\nTensor Cores: 112\nGPU Boost clock: 1,777MHz\nMemory bus: 192-bit\nMemory capacity: 12GB GDDR6\nMemory speed: 15Gbps\nMemory bandwidth: 360GB/s\nTGP: 170W\nMSRP at launch: $329That's still limited to a 192-bit bus, however, and that means six 32-bit memory controllers on the die. Those can be occupied in either 6GB or 12GB configurations with 8Gb or 16Gb GDDR6 modules from the likes of Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix.\u00a0An 8GB configuration would only be possible with a larger bus, such as the one on the GA104 GPU. That very GPU could be pared back to replace GA106, in theory. Nvidia has done something similar in the past, with the RTX 2060 actually incorporating some pared back TU104 GPUs, and perhaps could be a way to use up unsuitable silicon, but we're far from more than tacit mention of any such configuration today.I'm not too certain on the specifics of mixing 8Gb and 16Gb modules on the same package either, for an 8GB GA106 card, but that sounds pretty dicey for more than a handful of reasons. A question I need to follow up with an engineer, no doubt.Let's stick to what we know, and that's 12GB of GDDR6 rated to 15Gbps over a 192-bit bus. That results in slimmer memory bandwidth compared to the other Ampere generation graphics cards at 360GB/s. The RTX 3070 and 3060 Ti manage 448GB/s.Yet 12GB of memory is welcome at a price of $329, especially considering the RTX 2060 launched for $349 and with just 6GB of GDDR6. And there's plenty to like about the card when you get down to the metal, too.The GA106 GPU is at the heart of the RTX 3060. It's a brand new chip, silicon not yet seen in our gaming PCs, and that means that the RTX 3060 is in some ways unlike any other Ampere GPU to date.It touts three GPCs, each one with the potential for up to 10 SMs in total. There's a little redundancy in the actual RTX 3060 chip, though, which comes with two fewer for a total of 28 SMs. Thanks to the advancements in the Ampere architecture, those SMs each carry 128 CUDA Cores, or more precisely 128 potential FP32 units, a piece. Making for an overall CUDA Core count of 3,584.(Image credit: Nvidia)That's significantly higher than the 1,920 CUDA Cores of the RTX 2060, which is our main point of comparison for this review, although it must be said that the way the Ampere generation works doesn't make this a straightforward doubling of performance. It's the FP32 units that are effectively being doubled here, what Nvidia classes as CUDA Cores, while the remaining silicon remains at a close count to its Turing counterpart.\u00a0Even the doubling of FP32 units isn't all that simple\u2014the use of a mixed function path that can jump between either integer or floating point tasks is the key to the new core counts all-round. You can see it the Ampere SM diagram, a fixed FP32 unit besides a FP32/INT32 path within each of the four SM processing blocks. Since gaming workloads can vary wildly the flexibility must be there to offer both data paths in good amount, but there's often a leaning towards greater FP32 operations and therefore a boon to performance by offering more capability to crunch those numbers.So while the RTX 3060 is mightier by CUDA count, it actually has two fewer SMs than the RTX 2060. In terms of ROPs and Texture Units (TMUs), which are both awfully important in building performant graphics cards for today's games, the RTX 3060 comes with 48 and 112, respectively.The RTX 2060 is a match for ROPs but actually makes up a little ground here with 120 TMUs. It's only a slight boon in writing, but it just goes to show that there's not as much of a difference between the two chips in rendering silicon that the core count may suggest at first glance.The RTX 3060 also has two fewer RT Cores than the RTX 2060 as a result, too. But don't be mistaken, that does not make it any less capable in ray tracing workloads. In fact, it's notably faster. That's down to the improvements introduced with the second generation RT Cores and third generation Tensor Cores within the Ampere architecture, which have proven mighty for the high-end 30-series in partially negating the burden of ray tracing on frame times.It's also worth noting that there's no Founders Edition RTX 3060 12GB. The Zotac Twin Edge that we've received for this review is a stock card, though, so you can be sure that you're looking at the jumping off point for all other third-party and factory overclocked cards, of which there are sure to be many.Benchmarks and performance(Image credit: Future)How does the Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB perform?With a few potentially governing factors in play for performance, you only know what to expect from this card across 1080p, 1440p, and 4K when you hit the graphs.\u00a0On the first two counts, 1440p and 1080p, I'm pleased to report that all is well in the green camp. These resolutions are easily within reach for the RTX 3060 across most of our gaming benchmarks, even at highest available graphics settings. We don't expect anything less from even the more entry-level cards nowadays, and so a $329 GPU should absolutely score highly. That it does.1080p gaming performanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)1440p gaming performanceImage 1 of 9(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)4K gaming performanceImage 1 of 10(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Test rigCPU: Intel Core i7 10700K\nMotherboard: MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Carbon WiFi\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro @ 3,200MHz\nCPU cooler: Corsair H110i RGB Pro XT\nPSU: NZXT 850W\nChassis: DimasTech Mini V2Assassin's Creed: Odyssey at ultra high continues to kill off hopes of a stable 60fps on a budget\u2014there's clearly more work to be done to trivialise that game at full whack. That's sure to be even more pronounced on a weaker CPU, which this title can be particularly punishing of.Similarly, Metro Exodus appears a pain point for the RTX 3060, whereas the RTX 3060 Ti manages to retain slightly more optimistic performance at both 1080p and 1440p. In fact, if you look across our results you'll find the RTX 3060 Ti dominating by 20-40%. Another reason why that card is a great buy at $399.With no direct competitor from AMD just yet, it's mostly Nvidia's own Turing generation that we have to pit this card against.The RTX 3060 12GB bounces around 10-15 percent improvement on the RTX 2060 across the board, though that can swing drastically on a per-game basis. In The Division 2 the RTX 3060 can be upwards of 20-40 percent quicker.Ray tracing and DLSS performanceImage 1 of 7(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)How much of an impact that 12GB of VRAM is having on 1080p and 1440p performance is nebulous and tough to track, but it appears to have had some impact at 4K, where frame rates look a little more favourably on the RTX 3060 12GB.Power and thermalsImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)It's at greater resolutions where the memory capacity will be tried and tested the most, and if it's not Nvidia's silicon then it's that 12GB of memory that's making the difference. We're still not seeing a massive upheaval in every game, though, suggesting that gaming demands for memory still aren't creakingly high for even a 6GB card like the RTX 2060.Analysis(Image credit: Future)\u00a0What does the Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB mean today?At first glance the Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB may appear off kilter, even top heavy, with a bulbous memory configuration and a slimline GPU. Yet the card delivers performance upwards of the RTX 2060 by a decent margin, while arriving cheaper, and with enough zeal at 4K to make me believe that 12GB of GDDR6 may have some effect even with limited bandwidth.Questions regarding memory supply will no doubt be raised in response to the generous dollop of GDDR6 with the RTX 3060, but when we know very little of a supply chain that Nvidia has close command over, you can only assume it believes it to be a realistic goal.\u00a0Will the RTX 3060 12GB eventually give way to a 6GB version as the year stumbles on? It's something to keep an eye on, at least.I am sure that a sub-$300 card with less memory would be a welcome addition to the stack, however, even if 6GB does feel a little too meagre for even a mid-range graphics card by today's standards.\u00a0That 12GB of GDDR6 certainly feels more comfortable for the ephemeral concept of future-proofingNvidia has priors in reducing core count alongside alternate memory configurations, though, even when two cards share the same name. Take the 6GB and 3GB GTX 1060 graphics cards, for example, the latter of which you could argue is hardly a GTX 1060 at all.Another question that's burning in the back of my mind is would the RTX 3060 have performed nearly as well with only 6GB of GDDR6? I dare say it probably would, for a while... that could well be underestimating how swiftly the tide may turn on VRAM demands in gaming, and the effect that little digit before 'GB' has on your average consumer's purchasing habits.Few games currently require large memory buffers at anything less than 4K resolution, but that may change rather rapidly. As we're already beginning to experience even today.While relatively few in number, there are some games today that do require more than 6GB of VRAM at high fidelity settings. Wolfenstein: Youngblood struggles to run at Mein Leben! (highest) quality on the RTX 2060's 6GB of GDDR6.\u00a0That's not a problem I remember having in the past with older versions of the game, but it's repeatable, so clearly something's sent this card over the edge and into oblivion.\u00a0That's a bit of a niche case, granted, and you could quite easily crank down the graphics fidelity for just as enjoyable a time. But is even one game rendered unplayable due to a lack of video memory enough to justify a 12GB card? For many, I would imagine it is.It certainly will strike fear into anyone eyeing up a 6GB card in 2021. It's almost impossible to say when and to what extent the shift to greater memory demands will come about, but be sure that memory demand will increase with every new cutting-edge game.\u00a0That 12GB of GDDR6 certainly feels more comfortable for the ephemeral concept of future-proofing.It's those of us rocking GTX 1060 and older graphics cards that Nvidia is hoping to get on board with the RTX 3060, and it certainly makes a lot of sense for those on Pascal or older to make the leap to Ampere.As a short hop for an RTX 2060 owner? Perhaps not. There's just not the upgrade there to warrant the investment. Even with improved performance across both rasterised and ray-traced workloads.\u00a0That is unless you're prepared to sell off your second-hand card to a miner for something close to what you paid for it two years back. Stranger things have happened\u2026 but that all relies on you managing to snag an RTX 3060 first, and I have no doubts that, even with significant stock at hand, these cards will be hard to come by.Nvidia hopes to ease the launch day scramble by taking this particular card off the table for Ethereum, which is by far the most popular cryptocurrency for GPU mining. A three-way handshake between vBIOS, driver, and silicon ensures a halving of the hash rate when an Ethereum mining algorithm is detected, and it is confident that it's not going to be circumvented.That's at least some heat off the RTX 3060's availability, but I fear there's nothing anyone can do to satiate the hungry GPU market today except keep the silicon pumps at full speed and chips flying out to retailers as fast as they can.Verdict(Image credit: Future)ConclusionsThe RTX 3060 delivers a healthy performance gain over the RTX 2060 and a lower asking price on launch day.That is admittedly more of a small hop compared to the generational leap we've come to expect from the Ampere RTX 30-series, and perhaps that's why the RTX 3060 12GB release has not shaken my resolve on the RTX 3060 Ti being a great buy. For $70 more you get that greater memory bandwidth, that bounding performance gain we've come to expect, and all the net benefits of the Ampere architecture.That's also likely $70 that will be chewed up by premium third-party cards and factory overclocked RTX 3060s with a high sticker price.For my money, then, I'm sticking with the RTX 3060 Ti as the mid-range champion. The Nvidia RTX 3060 strays a little too far from the pack of high-end Ampere to have the same impact generation on generation. But in that same breath it must be said that the RTX 3060 a fine upgrade for a 10-series or older card, especially if it stays anywhere close to MSRP, and one that will likely see you confidently through the next few years of major game releases.Zotac RTX 3060 Ti 12GB Twin Edge: Price Comparison No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our review policy \n\n\nZotac RTX 3060 Ti 12GB Twin Edge\n\nA healthy upgrade over the RTX 2060, but a little of the wow factor has worn off for Ampere's cheapest.

NVIDIA thinks it has a simple way to help: make the new card unattractive to the crypto crowd. The company has revealed that it's cutting the hash rate (mining efficiency) of the RTX 3060 in half for Ethereum miners. The driver software can detect the Ethereum mining algorithm and throttle performance in response.The rationale is simple: NVIDIA wants to put GeForce cards \"in the hands of gamers,\" not just those hoping to turn a profit by generating digital money. While the extremely high demand from miners has been good for NVIDIA's bottom line in the short term, it has frustrated gamers, professionals and everyday users who just want better than integrated graphics \u2014 NVIDIA even brought back years-old GPUs just to give customers some options. Scalping and price gouging have been all too common for those GPUs that do become available.It's not leaving miners empty-handed. The firm is launching a new CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor) line of add-in cards that doesn't do graphics, but is fine-tuned for crypto mining performance. The absence of video ports allows for greater airflow and more densely-packed cards, for example. The first CMP designs are the 26 megahash per second 30HX and 36 megahash 40HX, both of which should be available this quarter from vendors like ASUS, EVGA and Gigabyte. More powerful 50X (45MH/s) and 90HX (86MH/s) boards are due in the second quarter.This probably won't please miners who were looking forward to the RTX 3060's February 25th debut with interest, and a similar hash restriction for other NVIDIA GPUs wouldn't alleviate shortages for a while. Still, there might be a chance that you can buy a high-end GPU for your gaming PC without having to set up inventory alerts or pay a premium.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Enabling it can be a bit of a hassle, but it's a free upgrade, so it gets a thumbs up. \nResizable BAR is a feature of the PCIe standard that enables a system's CPU to see the entirety of the GPU's memory subsystem, instead of just a small 256 MB portion. Implementing the feature requires low-level support in the CPU, motherboard, and GPU, which is how AMD, who designs all three, was the first to market with a Resizable BAR implementation called SAM (smart access memory).\nIn our testing, enabling SAM on an RX 6800 could improve a game's average frame rate by up to 20%, or harm it by up to 10%. In most titles, though, enabling the feature did almost nothing, which is reflected by the average improvement: just 3%.\nUnderstandably, then, Nvidia is taking a different route. Their drivers will leave the Resizable BAR disabled by default, and only switch it on in titles where Nvidia's found that it improves performance. As of writing, that's eight titles:\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\nBattlefield V\nBorderlands 3\nForza Horizon 4\nGears 5\nMetro Exodus\nRed Dead Redemption 2\nWatch Dogs: Legion\n\nIn these games, Nvidia says, Resizable BAR can improve performance \"from a few percent, up to 10%.\" In late March, when the rest of the RTX 3000-series receives support for Resizable BAR, more games will be added to the list. Nvidia's selective approach is undoubtedly a good idea (if done right) but unfortunately, it's an advantage that's negated by the complexity of enabling the Resizable BAR.\nIn laptops, the situation is okay but not great: some laptops will come with the Resizable BAR enabled, some won't, and there's nothing you can do about it. Nvidia says to \"check with each laptop manufacturer to discover if Resizable BAR is supported on a particular model.\"\n\nDesktop compatibility is a game of 3D chess. Enabling Resizable BAR, or, equally likely, discovering that your system doesn't support it, is a five-step process. First, you'll need to check if your CPU is compatible: all AMD 5000-series CPUs are, as are all 10th-gen Intel processors, but only the i5, i7, and i9 series from the upcoming 11th-gen will have compatibility. Simple enough...\nStep two: check your motherboard's chipset. AMD 500-series chipsets are compatible (if undesirable, at the moment) and the 400-series chipsets are compatible on motherboards that are also compatible with Ryzen 5000-series CPUs. The 500-series chipsets Intel's announced as of writing are all compatible, and so are all their 400-series chipsets. Still with me? \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Nvidia RTX 50 series supply woes extend to system builders as scalpers drive up prices \n\n\n\nStep three is more troublesome: you'll need to update your motherboard's SBIOS, but you'll just have to hope that an update exists. According to Nvidia, \"the following manufacturers are offering SBIOS updates for select motherboards to enable Resizable BAR with GeForce RTX 30 series desktop graphics cards: Asus, Asrock, Colorful, EVGA, Gigabyte, and MSI.\"\nFourth, you'll need to update your GPU's VBIOS, unless you're one of the lucky few with a new RTX 3060. For Founder's Edition owners, Nvidia will provide the update themselves, but everyone else will need to download the update from their GPU manufacturer's page.\nAnd the home stretch: update your GPU drivers. Afterward, you can check if the Resizable BAR is working correctly in the Nvidia Control Panel, inside the System Information tab.\n\n\n\n\n 21 comments\n \n585 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

See our ethics statement.PCWorld has confirmed that Nvidia is planning on releasing stock of GTX 1050 Ti and RTX 2060 GPUs to its board partners in an attempt to deal with the stock shortages and sky-high prices of its newer 30-series cards. At the moment, it\u2019s not just new cards that people are having trouble getting their hands on \u2014 it\u2019s any modern graphics card at all.While the GPUs that Nvidia is planning on releasing were meant to be affordable when they first launched, they\u2019re certainly not now. The GTX 1050 Ti cost $139 when it launched in October 2016, but when I went looking for them on Newegg and Amazon, I found that Newegg itself only had one model in stock (which it was selling for $189), and third-party sellers were asking for $250, $340, and even $798.$139 when it launched four years ago. Screenshot: The VergeIf the 1050 Ti\u2019s prices scare you, you might not want to look at what I found when I looked for RTX 2060s, which launched in 2019 for $349. Newegg doesn\u2019t currently have any 2060s in stock, but third-party sellers do, and they\u2019re not letting them go for cheap.I cry. Screenshot: The VergeHopefully Nvidia releasing the new stock will help bring the prices down, especially since it seems like new cards won\u2019t be particularly easy to get anytime soon. It also depends on how many of the older chips Nvidia can make. There\u2019s been a global shortage of chips, affecting everything from laptops to trucks, and some chipmakers are saying the industry is even having trouble producing chips that aren\u2019t state-of-the-art (like the ones that would be found in older graphics cards).The situation has gotten to the point that President Biden pledged to do something about it, but it\u2019s hard to tell how effective that will be. If Biden wants to help with GPU prices, specifically, he could start by taking a look at the 25 percent tariff that former President Trump put on graphics cards.RelatedSure enough, EVGA and Zotac have raised prices on the Nvidia RTX 3080 and beyondNvidia and AMD address the great GPU shortageFor now, your best bet is to keep an eye on prices for the GTX 1050 Ti and RTX 2060 to see if they go down, and only grab one if you desperately need a graphics card. Otherwise, it\u2019s probably best to wait for the 30-series to become available again, which we\u2019re always keeping an eye out for here at The Verge.Related:See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMore in this streamSee allBiden administration launches \u201cSection 301\u201d investigation into China\u2019s chip production.Richard LawlerDec 23, 2024CommentsComment Icon BubbleTim Cook: Soon, many Apple silicon chips can be stamped \u201cMade in America.\u201dRichard LawlerDec 6, 2022CommentsComment Icon BubbleSamsung and AMD\u2019s profit slump suggests industry trouble for chipmakersUmar ShakirOct 8, 2022CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

In tweets posted on Wednesday, images show a room filled with \u201cseveral hundred\u201d gaming laptops said to be kitted out with Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics processing units (GPUs). WCCTech, a computer and gaming publication, said the laptops shown in the tweets come from the Chinese manufacturer Hasse and are being used to mine crypto using the in-demand Nvidia cards.   Like something from a gamer\u2019s nightmare, some laptops appear to be stripped of their housing to offer optimal cooling for the hard-at-work GPUs.

While bitcoin mining requires specialized processors called ASICs, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum\u2019s ether can still be mined on GPUs. Gamers desire such top-of-the-range cards, too, however, because they provide a boost to graphics performance and are generally the easiest component in a computer to upgrade in order to to keep up with the latest gaming titles. Typically, tech retailers and distributors place buy limits on the number of highly sought after products in order to distribute evenly. The tweets indicate a deal may have been struck between either retailer, distributor or laptop manufacturer and the mining entity for a bulk order, per WCCTech\u2019s report.

If the images and video are indeed authentic, the value of the newly established mining operation could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars at high street prices. Nvidia recently said it could potentially restart production of dedicated GPUs for cryptocurrency miners, if demand is there. However, it played down the possibility that miners are eating into its general inventory, saying gamers were outstripping its supplies.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Nvidia announced that it's going to be limiting the cryptocurrency mining performance of the RTX 3060 in a bid to diminish miners' demand for the upcoming graphics card. It remains to be seen just how effective this is going to be, but it's a step in the right direction, and Nvidia really needs to take it further.\u00a0A pre-embargo Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 has reportedly emerged, as spotted by Tom's Hardware, that suggests that Nvidia's limits perhaps didn't go far enough, but I can't say how well the graphics card will perform in any workload until I can get my hands on it for testing.\u00a0But even if Nvidia's limits aren't quite as restrictive on crypto mining performance as they should be, anything that can help people get their hands on a new graphics card without having to pay extortionate aftermarket mark-ups is a good decision in my eyes. I just want to see Nvidia take it even further.(Image credit: Future)It's almost time for the Super cardsThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super, RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2080 Super all appeared in July 2019, about 10 months after the September 2018 launch of the initial Nvidia Turing lineup.\u00a0It definitely doesn't feel like it, but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 launched five months ago on September 17, 2020. So, it's about time to start speculating on what Nvidia is going to do to refresh the lineup halfway through its lifespan, like it did with Turing.\u00a0Rumors about refreshed versions of Ampere graphics cards started showing up, like, right when Nvidia launched the initial lineup. Word of a 20GB version of the RTX 3080 and a 16GB RTX 3070 has been spreading like wildfire for months now, even though there have been countless reports those cards have been cancelled \u2013 if they ever existed in the first place.\u00a0Here's the thing, though: that's exactly what we need.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.I've gone on in the past about how Nvidia's announcement of an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 with 12GB of VRAM is going to potentially confuse a lot of potential buyers. For instance, if someone sees the RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti sitting on a shelf next to each other, and don't know much about graphics cards, it's not unrealistic to think some may get the former thinking it's the more powerful product.\u00a0That highlights the importance of reading reviews, but when we're talking about a product that's feasibly going to be bought on the shelf at a local retail store, there's a real chance that customers are going to have a worse experience than they should when making an impulse purchase.(Image credit: Future)What we needIt's no secret that cryptocurrency miners have started buying up Nvidia Ampere graphics cards in droves, driving up prices to astronomical prices. In fact, for PC gamers, it's at the point where we can't recommend an Nvidia \u2013 or AMD, for that matter \u2013 graphics card at the current going rate. Nvidia needs to step in, and not just for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060.Since Nvidia came out and announced that the RTX 3060 would have a driver-level handbrake to limit mining performance, Nvidia Director of Global PR for GeForce Bryan Del Rizzo came out on Twitter to clarify what's going on.\u00a0Hi Ryan. It's not just a driver thing. There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.February 19, 2021So, because the limitations Nvidia worked into the Nvidia RTX 3060 seem to go down to the silicon level in order to prevent miners from just flashing the BIOS to get around it, Nvidia will have to release new versions of its existing graphics cards in order to protect those from being bought up by miners.\u00a0Spotted by Wccftech, known Nvidia leaker @kopite7kimi has been speculating since Nvidia's news about the RTX 3060 limit suggesting that Nvidia might be planning on releasing a new version of every GPU in the lineup. Given that it's still a bit early to actually see an RTX 3080 Super emerge, this is exactly what Nvidia should do.\u00a0Thanks, I should explain that. \ud83e\udd14Maybe we won't see new specs, but every old spec will have a new sku. That is possible.February 19, 2021Nvidia should absolutely use this mining brake as an opportunity to refresh its product line with new Super cards. And, Team Green can take it as a chance to also improve memory capacity on the older Ampere cards. I've reached out to Nvidia for comment on this, and I'll update this article the moment I hear more about it.\u00a0I would love to see an RTX 3080 Super and an RTX 3070 Super hit the streets later this year, that use this brake to get the GPUs into the hands of gamers that have been stressing themselves out mashing the F5 key on Newegg, only to see all the stock disappear within seconds.\u00a0Cryptocurrency miners definitely aren't the the only reason RTX 3000 graphics cards \u00a0are sold out everywhere. Demand is genuinely high for what are some of the best graphics cards we've ever seen. And, given the stock shortage that game consoles are experiencing, with similar \u2013 though less extreme \u2013 aftermarket price increases, it's unlikely that any one solution is going to make it easy to buy a new graphics card.\u00a0But, when you look at a site like StockX, which resellers can use to sell off high demand items, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition is selling for nearly three times the MSRP. The PS5 is just $250 more than retail on the same site.\u00a0I'm not saying that making the Nvidia Ampere lineup unappealing for miners is going to be the magic bullet that cures the current stock situation.

It's not just the FPS that matters these days, it's visuals, and a smoother frame rate too and this is exactly what the GeForce RTX 30 series is made to excel at.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Card Specifications - GA106 GPU & 12 GB GDDR6 Memory\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card lies the GA106 GPU. The GA106 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA106 GPU is the third gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced.\nThe new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster, the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nFor the GeForce RTX 3060, NVIDIA has enabled a total of 28 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 3584 CUDA cores, 112 TMUs. In addition to the CUDA cores, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3060 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores, Tensor cores, and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The graphics card has a TDP of 170W.\n\nIn terms of memory, the GeForce RTX 3060 comes packed with 12 GB of GDDR6 memory. The memory runs across a 192-bit bus wide interface and features an effective clock speed of 15.00 Gbps which delivers a cumulative bandwidth of 360 GB/s which is slightly higher bandwidth than the RTX 2060 6 GB model & you also end up with twice the memory while Ampere's brand new compression architecture makes sure that the GPU isn't bandwidth starved.\n\n\n\n\nDesktop CPU and Chipset Support\n\nAs of February 25th, 2021, the following CPU chipsets and CPUs support Resizable BAR on GeForce RTX 30 Series desktop GPUs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Chipsets\n\n\nAMD 400 Series (on motherboards with AMD Zen 3 Ryzen 5xxx CPU support)\n\n\nAMD 500 Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD CPUs\n\n\nAMD Zen 3 CPUs\nRyzen 3 5xxx\nRyzen 5 5xxx\nRyzen 7 5xxx\nRyzen 9 5xxx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Chipsets\n\n\nIntel 10th Gen\nZ490\nH470\nB460\nH410\n\n\nIntel 11th Gen S\nAll 11th Gen chipsets available as of February 25th, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CPUs\n\n\nIntel 10th Gen\nIntel 11th Gen S-Series\n\n\ni9-10xxx CPUs\ni9-11xxx CPUs\n\n\ni7-10xxx CPUs\ni7-11xxx CPUs\n\n\ni5-10xxx CPUs\ni5-11xxx CPUs\n\n\ni3-10xxx CPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIntel has been working with NVIDIA to enable Resizable BAR, an advanced PCI-Express technology, across the PC ecosystem,\u201d said Fredrik Hamberger, GM of Premium & Enthusiast Laptop Segments at Intel. \u201cThis feature can give gamers an extra boost in gameplay FPS on Intel\u2019s new 11th generation H/S and select 10th generation systems when paired with supported graphics cards, including NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard Support\n\nNVIDIA is working with motherboard manufacturers around the world to bring Resizable BAR support to compatible products.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)Recently, Nvidia brought some confusion to those shopping for the best gaming monitors when it quietly changed the G-Sync Ultimate requirements listed on its website. We spoke with Nvidia about its highest tier of Adaptive-Sync technology to understand what exactly a G-Sync Ultimate monitor entails in 2021.In general, G-Sync Compatible is Nvidia\u2019s answer to AMD FreeSync. A G-Sync monitor paired with a system running an Nvidia graphics card will fight off screen tearing and offer other gaming benefits, depending on the type of G-Sync the monitor has. There\u2019s standard G-Sync, which requires Nvidia\u2019s proprietary scaler, G-Sync Compatibility, which doesn\u2019t, and G-Sync Ultimate.Up until a few weeks ago, Nvidia\u2019s website listed G-Sync Ultimate as featuring \u201cthe latest Nvidia G-Sync processors to deliver the very best gaming experience, including HDR, over 1,000 nits brightness, stunning contrast, cinematic color and ultra-low latency gameplay.\u201d In January, Nvidia changed that description, now saying that G-Sync Ultimate monitors have \u201cthe top Nvidia G-Sync processors to deliver the very best gaming experience, including lifelike HDR, stunning contrast, cinematic color and ultra-low latency gameplay.\u201d\u00a0Nvidia removed mention of \u201c1,000 nits\u201d as a necessary checkmark for G-Sync Ultimate monitors and replaced it with \u201clifelike HDR.\u201d(Image credit: Tomshardware)But what exactly does \"lifelike HDR\" mean?An Nvidia representative confirmed to Tom\u2019s Hardware that today G-Sync Ultimate monitors require:Refresh rates greater than or equal to 144 HzVariable LCD overdriveOptimized latency for gamingFactory-calibrated accurate SDR (sRGB) and HDR color (P3) gamut supportBest-in-class HDR supportBest-in-class image qualityWhile that doesn\u2019t provide us much more information on that idea of \u201clifelike HDR,\u201d Nvidia did note that its design, testing and validation processes take into account color gamut, brightness, contrast, resolution and refresh rate, among other factors.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.But what about the old 1,000-nit spec? If you\u2019re looking for the best HDR monitor, a monitor that can hit 1,000 nits brightness can do wonders. Some of the first G-Sync Ultimate monitors included the Acer Predator X27 and Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ. Both are VESA-certified to hit a minimum/maximum brightness of 1,000 nits with HDR content and do using premium-priced full-array local dimming (FALD) backlights. The results are stellar, making for two excellent HDR screens, as well as some of the best 4K gaming monitors money can buy.\u00a0Nvidia no longer promises 1,000 nits with G-Sync Ultimate but did point to OLED monitors as potential candidates for the certification. OLED monitors are also known to make amazing HDR monitors, due to infinite contrast levels, but may not hit 1,000 nits. For example, the Alienware AW5520QF, which our testing found to produce brilliant HDR thanks to amazing contrast offered by the OLED panel, is only specced for a minimum max brightness of 400 nits with HDR (the AW5520QF isn\u2019t G-Sync-certified).\u00a0There are currently no OLED monitors on Nvidia\u2019s list of G-Sync Ultimate monitors, but with the continuing growth of OLED, including an upcoming desktop-sized OLED monitor from LG, OLED may eventually play a bigger role in gaming monitors than it does today.\u00a0An Nvidia rep also noted that \u201cadvanced multi-zone edge-lit displays offer remarkable contrast with 600-700 nits.\u201d Edge-lit backlights are a tier down from the FALD backlights the aforementioned 1,000-nit monitors feature, but, if well-implemented, can still produce strong HDR that brings a noticeable impact over SDR content. One such example is the Dell S2721DGF (G-Sync Compatible and FreeSync only), which is only specced for 400 nits. We can expect monitors like this to earn the G-Sync Ultimate badge moving ahead.\u00a0\u201cG-Sync Ultimate was never defined by nits alone nor did it require a VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certification,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s rep said.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's best Dell S2721DGF deals $398View $439.99View No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Monitors News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nHardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nScharon HardingSocial Links NavigationScharon Harding has a special affinity for gaming peripherals (especially monitors), laptops and virtual reality.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeforce Now\n(Image credit: Windows Central)\n\n\n\n\nWhether you have a gaming PC or not, one of the best things about a cloud gaming service, such as NVIDIA GeForce Now, is that you don't need to spend time optimizing in-game settings. NVIDIA does all the hard work for you when it comes to graphics settings to make sure your games look amazing whatever you're playing them on.But to make sure you have the best experience possible you should take a few minutes to optimize your GeForce Now settings. By default, the service will do what it thinks is best, but there's quite a bit you can do yourself to help it along.Whether you're using the desktop client or the browser version, here's what you can do.How to optimize NVIDIA GeForce Now settings in the desktop appSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)The desktop app is the recommended way to play GeForce Now if you're on Windows, and this is in part down to the extra control you have over the settings. There's just more you're able to control versus using the web app.The auto settings will do a good job most of the time, especially if you're on a fast connection. But if you're a little more limited on bandwidth, it's a valuable exercise to do a little optimization.The first thing you should look at is how well your connection will fare using the built-in bandwidth check tool. You'll find this next to the server location dropdown, which by default will be set to automatically choose the best server.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Running the bandwidth test will provide you with some useful information. Not only will it recommend a maximum resolution and frame rate, but it will also show you how your download, packet loss, and ping (latency) match up against what NVIDIA requires. It will do this against any server you choose, too, though if you venture from the auto setting you'll be given a warning that choosing a server could have detrimental effects.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The best reason to run this first is that it completely ignores whatever current settings you have enabled and just tells you what your connection can handle. You can then take this information into the next step and adjust your settings to suit.NVIDIA includes a number of presets in the desktop app to allow easy optimization, but there's also a good chance they compromise a little too much. But using the information you gained in the bandwidth test, select the custom option, and try these steps.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Limit the maximum bit rate using the slider to the highest value you can. Bear in mind also any other network stress from other devices, such as streaming video. If GeForce Now is going to be the only thing stressing your network then you can go a little higher and you'll be rewarded with a nicer looking stream.Lower the resolution if you can. If you're playing on a 13-inch laptop, for example, then you can easily drop to 900p or even 720p and your games will still look good. Fewer pixels cause less strain on your connection and if you really don't need to use a higher resolution, you'll be better off all around.Set the frame rate to 60 FPS unless the bandwidth test told you that you really can't get it. You don't want 30 FPS if you can avoid it.Set VSync to on to ensure you're not experiencing unnecessary tearing.If you have an unstable or slower network then ensure you enable the toggle to adjust for poor network conditions. This means the system will take matters into its own hands if things start to struggle to make sure your gaming isn't interrupted. You should also ensure the Network Status setting is enabled so that you'll always be warned if you're about to run into some problems.By contrast, if you have a high-speed connection, you can use the custom settings to make sure everything is turned up to the maximum. Bit rate tops out at 50mbps, which is pretty good, though you'll always be limited to 60 FPS. At least for now. The app will also tell you what your current settings look like in terms of estimated hourly data usage for some idea of how much strain you'll be putting on your network.How to optimize NVIDIA GeForce Now settings in the Google Chrome browserSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)The Google Chrome browser version of GeForce Now is, mostly, identical to the desktop client. The user interface is exactly the same but there are fewer settings you can change.The bandwidth checker is not available and you have only two options under quality, balanced and custom. The custom option allows the same customization as the desktop client, with the exception of a V-Sync toggle.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)But you should follow a similar process to get the best experience as detailed above. Run a web-based speed test first to see what your ping and download looks like, and then use this information to adjust your bitrate. Again, if your network is busy or unstable, lower is better for stability.Set the frame rate to 60 FPS unless on a slow connection and as above, if you're playing on a laptop you can definitely drop the resolution. As with the desktop client, the web app will tell you what kind of hourly data usage your settings can expect to produce for an added indicator on the strain you'll be putting on your network.Other things you can trySource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Besides tweaking the settings to make sure you're getting both a good quality stream and a reliable one, there's also the matter of your home network to consider. Here are a few things you can try that should make your experience a little better.Use Ethernet where possible. No matter how good your Wi-Fi router (and we've rounded up the best Wi-Fi routers), you simply can't beat the reliability of a cable.If you're using Wi-Fi, make sure you're connected to a 5GHz connection. 5GHz is faster but has a shorter operating distance, so you may need to be closer to the router. 2.4GHz offers a longer reach but you'll lose out on performance.Ensure your machine is getting priority service on your network. This will vary from router to router, but many now have Dynamic QoS (Quality of Service) features to prioritize bandwidth-reliant processes like gaming. On Google/Nest Wifi that I use, for example, there is a setting built-in that will prioritize gaming traffic once enabled, but you can also manually assign a priority device.Game when your network is quiet for the best results. Unless you have a crazy fast connection, the less traffic sharing your bandwidth the better. If the kids are watching Netflix and downloading Xbox games at the same time, you're going to have a less enjoyable time than when the network is quiet.While there's no single one size fits all solution, it's still very straightforward to optimize your NVIDIA GeForce Now settings to have the best time. Whether you just want everything to look its absolute best or you have to consider your network conditions carefully, GeForce Now has the flexibility to be enjoyed by all.\n\n\n\nGeForce Now\n\n\nFree at NVIDIA\nNVIDIA's cloud game streaming service is one of the best available today, delivering lag-free gaming at 1080p/60fps.

The graphics card has been in the rumors even before the GeForce RTX 30 series was introduced and has seen various spec changes but it looks like as we get close to an introduction, NVIDIA has decided to revise the core and memory configuration once again.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Now Rumored To Feature 12 GB GDDR6X Memory & 10240 CUDA Cores, Expected To Launch in April\nIn his latest tweet, Kopite7kimi reports that NVIDIA has once again modified the specifications of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. We know that GPU makers plan out several GPU configs prior to their release but in this generation, we have got to see just how much different variants a graphics card sees prior to finalization and production. This has to do with GPU yields, production & stock, & the latest specifications, while a small downgrade core-wise, will still net almost similar performance as the GeForce RTX 3090.\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / RTX 3080 20 GB 'Rumored' Graphics Card Benchmarks\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / RTX 3080 20 GB FE (Founders Edition) graphics card is expected to feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-250 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and will now feature 10240 CUDA cores within a total of 80 SM units. Since the main core configuration is entirely brand new, the previously leaked clocks & TMU/ROP counts should now be dismissed.\n\nThings have changed. Maybe the current spec is 10240FP32, 12G GD6X. \ud83d\ude03\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) February 6, 2021\n\nAs for memory, the card will feature 12 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting 12 GB memory, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be using a 384-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 912 GB/s. So while we see an 8 GB VRAM reduction over the previous spec, the larger bus interface should drive higher memory bandwidth. The TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\nAs for the launch date, Videocardz has suggested that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is likely to launch sometime in April though the date isn't 100% guaranteed. The reason stated is that the same roadmap that lists down April also has other dates mentioned. But with that said, the RTX 3080 Ti still aims to compete against the Radeon RX 6900 XT at a lower price point. It is likely the changes to the memory design could've been made to offer the card at a more attractive price point which will still end up being closer to $999 US, the same as AMD's flagship graphics card.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n151\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1160\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

With 3584 CUDA cores, its performance was firmly positioned between the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti, and the $329 MSRP made it one of the best bang for buck cards around. Unfortunately for gamers, GPUs in 2021 remains a pipedream for most. Some European retailers have already marked the card upwards of $600 USD (EUR 499) which is almost two times the premium over NVIDIA's MSRP and 50% over official European MSRP.\nEuropean retailers hike up prices of the upcoming RTX 3060 by almost 50% over the official EU MSRP\nThe price hike was spotted by Videocardz user The Determinator and posted by WhyCry. While NVIDIA tries to make vendors stick to its MSRP by allocating cards to vendors that will fulfill preorders at MSRP, retailers have adopted the tactic of canceling said preorders and forcing customers to reorder at inflated prices. You can argue here that NVIDIA can't really do anything else in this situation while staying under the rules of a free market. While it can limit or restrict future supply to these vendors \"at will\", they can't really be seen enforcing pricing conditions on any retailer (which would be against the law).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nSome retailers in Europe have even hiked prices of the RTX 3060 up to a massive $835 USD (or $689 EUR) which is absolutely insane considering it is almost three times the original MSRP at this point. In the before and after comparison screenshots, you can see that the initial (already inflated) prices of the RTX 3060 versus the new exorbitant pricing on PCDIGA - an European store:\n\nWe have heard that the RTX 3060 will have the most allocation out of all of NVIDIA's 3000 series lineup so far but considering the booming cryptocurrency (and mining) market and the insane demand for GPUs, it is hard to see how the free market will not keep jacking up the prices of this incredibly valuable silicon. The sad fact of 2021 is that gamers are just not as lucrative a customer to retailers as miners are - and as long as there is demand at these exorbitant rates, retailers will continue to mark these up.\nWe have already seen Pakistani retailers sell the RTX 3060 (which hasn't even launched yet!) for $750 USD and it is hard to see how the situation will improve any time soon given the current supply-constrained environment. The one ray of hope for gamers appears to be in prebuilt, where you can regularly find premiums as low as 10% - which is almost nothing in 2021. Buying a prebuilts might be the only way gamers get their hands on some GPUs this year considering big OEMs like HP, Dell and Alienware have the resources (and will power) to enforce reasonable MSRPs.\nBrick and mortar stores might also make a comeback as scalping through bots is impossible at scale in the real world and you can actually pick up a decently specced pre-built at best buy. At the rate the prices are increasing, it might actually be cheaper to just buy pre builts and sell the components you do not want instead of purchasing a GPU directly.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n72\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

There are no longer labels distinguishing between efficient (Max-Q) and full-performance GPUs, making it possible for a laptop with a lower-spec yet full-power chip to outperform a top-end component that\u2019s power-constrained. However, NVIDIA is trying to minimize that chaos \u2014 a spokesperson told The Verge the company now requires laptop makers to be transparent on RTX 30 specs.PC builders now have to disclose the clock speeds, power demands and Max-Q features in their product pages to convey the \u201cexpected GPU performance\u201d for a given laptop, NVIDIA said. You should get a better sense of which laptops have the most powerful real-world performance.It may take some time for that requirement to manifest in the real world. ASUS is divulging more detailed specs, but that isn\u2019t yet true for everyone. The requirement could be vital once companies consistently adopt it, though. In some cases, you could save money by buying a mid-tier laptop that\u2019s faster in practice than a more expensive model.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Scroll down for news of the new connection plugins.\nNvidia has released Omniverse, its new open collaboration system for 3D production, in free public beta.\nThe collection of cloud-enabled apps enables users to see changes made to shared 3D assets by other artists, working in other software, in a photorealistic real-time view.\nAs well as the Omniverse core, Nvidia has released frontend applications targeted at particular industries, including Omniverse Create for VFX and animation, and Omniverse View for design and visualisation.\nThe software also comes with integration plugins for key DCC applications and game engines, including Maya and Unreal Engine, with 3ds Max, Blender and Houdini to come.\nA cloud-native collaboration platform aiming to become \u2018the Google Docs for 3D design\u2019\nWhen it was first announced at the firm\u2019s GTC user conference last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described Omniverse as \u201cessentially the Google Docs for 3D design\u201d.\nThe platform enables users anywhere in the world to collaborate on 3D projects via the internet.\nChanges made to an asset or scene in a linked DCC application are rendered in real time, and the rendered output can be streamed to other collaborators on a project.\nAs well as enabling multiple users to view an asset, Omniverse handles version control for any edits made.\nConnection plugins for key DCC tools and game engines\nOmniverse has a modular structure, with components including Nucleus, its server-side services, Kit, its framework for viewing and editing scenes, and Connect, which connects the software to other DCC tools.\nThe initial open beta ships with connector plugins for Maya, Revit, Rhino, SketchUp and Unreal Engine. Connectors for 3ds Max, Archicad, Blender, Houdini and MotionBuilder are \u201ccoming soon\u201d.\nUpdated 26 February 2021: Nvidia has now released the 3ds Max connector. \nUpdated 12 April 2021: Nvidia has released a connector for Reallusion\u2019s Character Creator and announced new connectors for clothing design tool Marvelous Designer and city generator CityEngine.\nPhotoshop, Substance Designer and Substance Painter are also listed on the product website as already supported, although no corresponding connector plugins are available through the installer.\nUpdated 10 January 2021: Nvidia has posted a video explaining the process of viewing textures from Photoshop and Substance Painter inside Omniverse.\nHardware-accelerated ray tracing on Nvidia RTX GPUs\nOmniverse comes with its own photorealistic render engine, RTX Renderer, which taps into the hardware-accelerated ray tracing capabilities of Nvidia\u2019s current-generation RTX GPUs.\nHowever, since Omniverse is built on Pixar\u2019s open-source Universal Scene Description format, developers can integrate any third-party renderer capable of running as a USD Hydra render delegate.\nThat includes AMD\u2019s Radeon ProRender and Intel\u2019s OSPRay, so it should be possible to build Omniverse apps that run on non-Nvidia GPUs, but they aren\u2019t currently supported out of the box.\n\n\n\nOmniverse Create: a collaborative world-building tool for VFX and games work\nFor most end users, access to Omniverse\u2019s functionality will come through one of Nvidia\u2019s own industry-specific apps, including Kaolin for AI research, and View for AEC work and architectural visualisation.\nEntertainment artists, such as those working in VFX, animation or game art, get Omniverse Create, a \u201cworld-building [tool] that allows users to assemble, light, simulate and render large scale scenes\u201d.\nWorkflow begins with importing assets into Omniverse, either from other DCC software via the connection plugins, or by importing files in FBX, OBJ or glTF format directly.\nThe materials system is based around Nvidia\u2019s open-source MDL format, with a range of template materials available, including USD\u2019s UsdPreviewSurface and readymade physical glass and multi-purpose materials.\nOnce assembled, a scene can be lit inside Omniverse Create using a set of standard light types, and viewed via virtual cameras that emulate a range of real-world camera properties.\nThe native animation tools are described as \u201crudimentary\u201d, but more complex animations can be imported from other apps: Create supports animation clips, skeletal animation, animation caches and blendshapes.\nCreate also has a range of built-in physics capabilities, based on Nvidia\u2019s own real-time technologies: PhysX for rigid body dynamics, Blast for destruction and Flow for gaseous fluid simulation.\nRendered output can be exported as sequential images or as an MP4 movie file, or streamed to compatible Android devices via the experimental Cloud XR extension.\nAvailability and system requirements\nOmniverse is available as a free public beta for Windows 10 and CentOS 7/Ubuntu 18.04 Linux. It requires a current-gen Nvidia RTX GPU. You can find system requirements for the integration plugins here.\nOmniverse Create and View can be installed from the same installer as Omniverse itself. Create is available for Windows 10 and CentOS 7/Ubuntu 18.04 Linux; View for Windows 10 only.\n\nDownload Nvidia\u2019s free public beta of Omniverse\nRead more about the Omniverse platform in the online documentation\nRead more about Omniverse Create in the online documentation\n\n\nRelated Posts\nNvidia announces pricing and new plugins for Omniverse\nNvidia unveils new Substance 3D plugin for Omniverse\nSee Nvidia\u2019s new Omniverse plugins, apps and pricing\nNvidia announces Omniverse open beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n # 3ds max # AMD # Android # animation # arch viz # ArchiCAD # architectural visualization # asset management # asset viewer # Blast # Blender # character creator # CityEngine # Cloud XR # collaboration # destruction # download # FBX # fire # flow # fluid simulation # fracturing # free beta # game art # game development # gaseous fluid # glTF # Google Docs for 3D # hardware-accelerated ray tracing # Houdini # Hydra # Hydra render delegate # integration plugins # Intel # lighting # Marvelous Designer # material definition language # Maya # MDL # MotionBuilder # NVIDIA # OBJ # Omniverse # Omniverse Connect # Omniverse Create # Omniverse Kaolin # Omniverse Kit # Omniverse Nucleus # Omniverse View # open beta # OSPRay # photorealistic # Photoshop # physics # PhysX # Pixar # plugin # price # public beta # Radeon ProRender # ray tracing # real time # release date # remote collaboration # rendering # Revit # Rhino # rigid body dynamics # RTX # RTX Renderer # simulation # SketchUp # smoke # stream to Android device # Substance Designer # Substance Painter # system requirements # UE4 # Unity # Universal Scene Description # Unreal Engine # USD # version management # versioning # vfx # virtual camera # visual effects \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n5 key features in Blender 4.4\nCheck out the key changes in the latest version of the open-source 3D app, including important updates to animation and the CPU compositor.\nTuesday, March 18th, 2025\n\n\n\n\nSketchsoft releases Feather 1.1\nPromising 3D sketching app for iPad gets time-saving new workflows for Apple Pencil users, including support for haptic feedback.\nTuesday, March 18th, 2025\n\n\n\n\nGIMP 3.0 is out after seven years in development\nLong-awaited update to the open-source image editor adds non-destructive layer effects and better interoperability with Photoshop.\nTuesday, March 18th, 2025\n\n\n\n\nAdobe releases Substance 3D Modeler 1.21\nCheck out the new export features in the VR modeling software.

This approach means Arm earns significantly less per chip sold, but also means it ends up in more products.Many of those products are made by Nvidia's direct competitors.\"Arm\u2019s business model is brilliant,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the time of the acquisition.\"We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand Arm\u2019s IP licensing portfolio with Nvidia\u2019s world-leading GPU and AI technology.\"Since announcing its acquisition attempt, Nvidia has launched a charm offensive targeted at the public and government.It has promised to keep Arm's headquarters in Cambridge, and build the UK's largest supercomputer. The system, set to be hosted by Kao Data, will be opened by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.Graphcore declined to comment on its CMA filing. Last year, CEO Nigel Toon told CNBC: \"It risks closing down or limiting other companies' access to leading-edge CPU processor designs which are so important across the technology world, from data centers, to mobile, to cars and in embedded devices of every kind.\"Toon sold his previous chip company, Icera, to Nvidia for $435 million in 2011. Along with fellow founder Simon Knowles, Toon launched Graphcore in 2016. It has raised $750 million for its AI chips from Microsoft, BMW iVentures, Dell, Samsung, and others, Dell, Samsung, and others.Entering into a Dialog\nAt the same time as the Arm debate, Japan\u2019s Renesas Electronics Corporation agreed to acquire British chip design company Dialog Semiconductor for $6bn.Dialog makes power management technology for smartphones and other Internet-connected devices, as well as wireless chips.Shares in Renesas dropped on concerns over the company's stretched balance sheet. Around half of Renesas' revenue comes from automotive semiconductors, but it has been on an acquisition spree to try to diversify its income streams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 May 2018\n\n\n\n\nTo conquer the world, Nvidia will simulate it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\nArm tries to fire Chinese CEO over \"irregularities;\" Arm China says no, fires replacement over \"irregularities\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\nBamboo Systems launches Arm B1000N server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nGraphcore\n\n\nDialog Semiconductor\n\n\nArm\n\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\nRenesas Electronics Corporation\n\n\nHermann Hauser\n\n\nNigel Toon\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

And that\u2019s great for gamers and indie devs.\nAn Indie Spotlight\nPC gaming thrives because of independent studios. Some of the world\u2019s smallest developers have made the biggest and best games. It\u2019s one of the things we love most about PC gaming and why NVIDIA built its Indie Spotlight program.\nDeveloping a great game is challenging enough, so we\u2019re supporting indie devs by helping them reach a wider audience. GeForce NOW connects to game stores where PC games are already offered, so developers can grow their audience while focusing on their creative vision, without worrying about ports.\nTeams like Iron Gate AB and Coffee Stain Studios are now able to bring a graphically intense PC game like Valheim to more gamers by streaming the PC version from our cloud servers.\nYou can build your dream Viking home in Valheim. And with GeForce NOW, you don\u2019t even need a PC.\nValheim asks you to battle, build and conquer your way to a saga worthy of Odin\u2019s patronage. The game\u2019s already a huge success on Steam, and with GeForce NOW, Iron Gate\u2019s team can share their vision with cloud gamers on Mac, Android, iOS and Chromebooks.\n\u201cWe launched Valheim in early access on Steam, and immediately NVIDIA helped us bring it to more gamers with GeForce NOW. That way, even Mac users can play Valheim,\u201d said Henrik T\u00f6rnqvist, co-founder of\u00a0Iron Gate AB.\nMotoring Toward the Indie 300\nGeForce NOW\u2019s library includes nearly 300 of the most-popular and most-loved indie games, with more released every GFN Thursday.\n\u201cStreaming Terraria on GeForce NOW makes perfect sense to us. We have always sought out ways to make our game as accessible to as many people as possible. GFN helps accomplish that goal by giving our players the ability to play on any device they want, without any added development work on our side. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing both new and existing players enjoy all that Terraria has to offer, whether that be via the more traditional PC/console/mobile route or streaming from the cloud,\u201d said Ted Murphy, head of business strategy and marketing at Re-Logic.\nTerraria, from Re-Logic, is one of the most popular indie hits of all time. It\u2019s also one of the longest-running, best-supported games. Regular content updates since launch have lifted the total item count from 250 to over 5,000.\nUsing GeForce NOW, members can check in on their Terraria homes on any of their supported devices.\nThe indie catalog is a great place to discover games you might\u2019ve missed. Monster Train, from Shiny Shoe and Good Shepherd Entertainment, a strategic roguelike deck building game with a twist, was PC Gamer\u2019s Best Card Game of 2020 and is streaming from the cloud.\nMembers can see even more highlights in the \u201cIndie Spotlight\u201d in-app row, and the complete indie catalog by clicking \u201cSee More.\u201d\nGeForce NOW\u2019s indies include incredible global success stories. Chinese-developer TPP Studio\u2019s Home Behind 2 is a fairly new indie title that\u2019s rapidly growing in popularity. The game, released in November, has a two-person development team and starts streaming on GeForce NOW this week.\nSince GFN streams the PC versions of games from popular digital stores, when a promotion happens \u2014 like Team17\u2019s Worms Rumble free weekend on Steam, happening through Feb. 21 \u2014 members are able to participate, instantly.\nAnd when games take advantage of NVIDIA technology like DLSS, GeForce NOW members can reap the benefits. Recent examples include War Thunder, and \u2014 just this week \u2014 Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. It\u2019s yet another way GeForce NOW supports future indie development.\nLet\u2019s Play Today\nAs is GFN Thursday tradition, let\u2019s take a look at this week\u2019s new additions to the GeForce NOW library.\nHellish Quart (day-and-date release on Steam, Feb. 16)\nA new Steam release this week, Kubold\u2019s sword-dueling game includes intense physics and motion-captured fencing techniques.\u00a0\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth (Steam)\nA brilliant RPG that satirizes the genre, Ubisoft\u2019s first South Park game lets you pal around with Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny and more in search of a twig of limitless power.\nHere are the rest of this week\u2019s additions:\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed I: Director\u2019s Cut (Epic Games Store)\nDarkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game (Steam)\nDay of Infamy (Steam)\nDusk Diver (Steam)\nGoing Under (Steam)\nHome Behind 2 (Steam)\nLumberjack\u2019s Dynasty (Steam)\nRise of Industry (Steam)\nSniper: Ghost Warrior 2 (Steam)\n\nWhat\u2019s your gaming plan this weekend, members?

It's a little unusual to be reviewing a laptop GPU variant before the desktop chip, but to align with the laptop release cycle and the launch of AMD's new Ryzen 5000 APUs, we're getting the RTX 3060 alongside the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 all at the same time.\nThe mobile RTX 3060 is using Nvidia's GA106 silicon with 3840 unlocked CUDA cores, more than what you'll find in the desktop equivalent. There are a range of power configurations that OEMs can use, anywhere from 60 to 115 watts, which brings with it a boost clock anywhere from 1283 MHz to 1703 MHz depending on the variant you get. Of course, one of the key talking points around this generation is Nvidia removing the \"Max-Q\" label, instead giving all configurations from the 60W model (previously Max-Q) up to 115W (Max-P) the same name, something we're not big fans of.\n\nThe memory configuration for all RTX 3060 laptop variants is 6GB of GDDR6 on a 192-bit bus, with clock speeds of either 14 Gbps or 12 Gbps depending on the power class. As this is a new GPU featuring the Ampere architecture, it's built on Samsung's 8nm process node and features all the new architectural benefits like 3rd-gen Tensor cores, 2nd-gen ray tracing cores, and dual FP32 pipelines.\n\nFor laptops specifically, Nvidia has introduced a range of new technologies such as Dynamic Boost 2.0, WhisperMode 2.0 and Resizable BAR, to go along with previous stuff like Advanced Optimus. While these features fall under Nvidia's Max-Q umbrella, they aren't restricted just to low power variants; all RTX 30 GPUs can use them. Not all of these features are required to be used though by the laptop manufacturer. From what we've seen so far, uptake Dynamic Boost in particular has been far higher than in prior generations.\n\nFor today's review, we'll be testing two variants of the RTX 3060 mobile GPU: one with a base power rating of 80W, and another with a base power of 115W. Note how we specify \"base power\" here as both come with Dynamic Boost 2.0, which is enabled by default. This balances system power load while gaming, and in some situations where CPU usage is light, it can enable the RTX 3060 to run up to 15W higher. Considering it's enabled out of the box on both systems, this is how we'll be testing these laptops and we'll be reporting a power range on our benchmark charts.\n\nOur RTX 3060 115-130W system today is the XMG Apex 17, a powerful beast of a system with significant cooling capacity. The RTX 3060 inside has a base clock of 1387 MHz and boost clock of 1702 MHz, along with 14 Gbps memory. It supports Dynamic Boost and Resizable BAR, but not WhisperMode or Advanced Optimus.\n\nThe XMG Apex is powered by the Ryzen 7 5800H, a new Cezanne APU that just launched and we'll be reviewing in detail soon. There's also 16GB of dual-channel DDR4-3200 memory and a 17-inch 1080p 144Hz display. 1440p laptops are also starting to filter into the market now, but our testing for today will remain at 1080p. We'll look to add 1440p to the mix in the future.\nOur second RTX 3060 laptop is another XMG Apex 17 but equipped with a 80-95W GPU power configuration. The laptop is a slightly different model with a thinner chassis and smaller cooler. Clock speeds are 900 MHz base and 1425 MHz boost, also with 14 Gbps memory. This laptop features Dynamic Boost and WhisperMode, but not Resizable BAR or Advanced Optimus. Perhaps the lack of Resizable BAR is down to the use of an Intel CPU. There's also 16GB of dual-channel DDR4-3200 memory and a 17-inch 1080p 144Hz display.\n\nIt's interesting to see that XMG and ODM Clevo have decided to make Ryzen 5000 processors the focus of the Apex 17 series. While many aspects to these chassis are similar, the AMD model is notably larger and has better cooling, allowing it to run the GPU at a higher power rating for better performance. This is opposite to previous generations where Intel was always given the higher end designs.\n\nWith that said, both of these Apex models are the sort of entry-level chassis options that XMG offers. Core and Neo models sitting above with slimmer builds and more premium materials.\nBenchmarks\nWe're starting off with some older games where we have more comparison data, then move into newer benchmarks with a smaller range of systems. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is up first, and immediately we're seeing pretty decent results.\n\nThere wasn't a huge difference between the power configurations of our RTX 3060 laptops in this test, but it did allow the 80-95W model to deliver 17% more performance than a 90W power configuration of the RTX 2060. So a similar power configuration here, just a decent chunk more performance out of the new RTX 30 series GPU.\nThis places the RTX 3060 slightly above the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q in our charts. Meanwhile for those with a system a couple of generations old, say a GTX 1060 6GB for example, you're looking at more than 65% better performance in the same power class.\n\nIn Metro Exodus, the RTX 3060 is able to flex its muscles, especially with the 115W power configuration. In both instances, the new RTX 3060 is pretty similar to an RTX 2070 Super of the same power rating, putting it towards the top of the charts. At 80W we're seeing 16% more performance than the RTX 2060, although this extends to a 30% delta at 115W. Plus, if you're upgrading from an older system or something lower tier, the gains are much more substantial.\n\nControl is extremely GPU limited on laptops, and as such shows some of the highest performance gains for the RTX 3060 over the 2060 at 1080p. We achieved a 27% higher frame rate when comparing at 80-95W, and 21% higher at the maximum 115W configuration.\nSo generation on generation, in the same sort of laptop design with the same cooler, an RTX 3060 will be giving you a decent step up in terms of frame rate. This puts the 3060 slightly above the last generation RTX 2070 Super, but at a lower price point.\n\nBorderlands 3 shows a solid performance improvement for the RTX 3060, pushing frame rates 17% higher in 80-95W range, and 19% higher in the 115-130W range, over the RTX 2060. This makes the 3060 about 5% faster than the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q in a lower power configuration, or equal to that GPU in a higher power configuration. And while we're not setting new records in the 90W power class with this GPU, we're getting 88% of the performance of the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q in a price range that's about half as expensive.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 shows some of the strongest results in favor of the RTX 3060, with the new GPU delivering performance above the RTX 2070 Super in a watt for watt battle.\nThe 3060 ends up 24% faster than the RTX 3060 in both power classes, and almost twice as fast as the GTX 1060 for people thinking of upgrading from a much older laptop. Really, now is the time to think about ditching your Pascal gaming system for something newer.\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a classic example of a competitive game running at medium settings. With new AMD CPUs in these systems, we're no longer suffering a huge performance penalty choosing an AMD-based laptop, so the end result is both RTX 3060 laptops deliver similar performance.\nLarge gains for the RTX 3060 in this title over previous generation GPUs, which is going to be especially good if you buy a system with a 240 Hz display.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the RTX 3060 is able to outperform the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q by a couple of frames, delivering a 17 percent performance gain over the RTX 2060 in a similar power class. Especially at 115W, this makes Valhalla quite playable on very high settings at 1080p, which wasn't previously the case.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 requires a lot of GPU horsepower for decent frame rates at 1080p on a laptop, and ultimately we'd recommend people turn down the quality settings one notch with a mid-range GPU like the RTX 3060. 17% more performance on offer than the RTX 2060 here in the lower power class, however the RTX 3060 does fall behind the RTX 2070 Super in this game.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion, even at 1080p on Ultra settings, is quite punishing on the RTX 3060 and part of that comes down to Ultra settings needing 8GB of VRAM. The 3060 has just 6GB, which in some areas of the benchmark causes stuttering and a somewhat lower 1% low than the RTX 2070 Super despite similar average frame rates.\nWe're still seeing a substantial 29% gain over the RTX 2060, another 6GB GPU, however we think having more VRAM for this game would be nice if you wanted to play on Ultra settings. With that said, how realistic ultra settings are for a laptop GPU is another question, and I'd probably turn down the preset one notch for actual gaming on a system like this.\n\nHitman 3 is the newest title in our benchmark suite, and for this test we are using the built-in test set to the Dartmoor level. This is an intensive test on both the CPU and GPU, with the RTX 3060 putting up a good showing relative to other products in the chart.\nIt is only 15% faster than the RTX 2060 in a watt for watt battle, but utterly obliterates the GTX 1060 configuration which is hamstrung by just a quad-core Intel 7th-gen processor.\n\nThe final benchmark we'll be showing in detail today is Dirt 5. The results seen here don't differ too much from the previous results, but this is a newer and more performance intensive title in some ways. With 17 percent more performance than the RTX 2060 on offer, it allows the 80-95W configuration to match the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q.\nPerformance Breakdown\nTime for some head to head comparisons featuring 20 games in our up-to-date laptop GPU benchmark test suite. When comparing the RTX 3060 (80 to 95W) with Dynamic Boost enabled, to the average of all our RTX 2060 laptops running at 90W, the RTX 3060 ends up 19% faster on average in the same power class.\n\nSome results were not as high for the new RTX 30 series GPU, like Gears 5 and Cyberpunk with ray tracing enabled, while other games like Control and Watch Dogs Legion could be nearly 30 percent ahead on Nvidia's new GPU.\nIn the higher power class \u2013 115W-130W \u2013 we don't have as many games that can be used for a comparison. However, from the tests ran we can say that the RTX 3060 is 22% faster than the RTX 2060 on average. This suggests that the 3060 is delivering a similar improvement to efficiency over its Turing predecessor regardless of whether you get a mid-tier or higher-end power configuration.\n\nAnother useful comparison is that the RTX 3060 provides similar performance to the RTX 2070 Super when you're on a similar power class. The one outlier here is Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing enabled, where 6GB of VRAM is not enough and causes a significant performance loss compared to the 8GB-equipped 2070 Super. Remove that result and the 3060 is a couple percent faster on average.\n\nNot unlike what we've observed from previous generations, the higher 115W power configuration is 11% faster on average than the 80W config of the RTX 3060. While there is also a CPU difference at play here, most of our gaming benchmarks are GPU limited, with results ranging from a low single-digit improvement, to an uplift of 20% or more, depending on the game. These two power classes deliver fundamentally different performance and, of course, the 115W model is faster.\n\nFor those looking to upgrade coming from a GTX 10 series Pascal GPU of the same class, the RTX 3060 provides a huge 72% performance gain over the GTX 1060 6GB on average.\nFor those looking to upgrade coming from a GTX 10 series Pascal GPU of the same class, the RTX 3060 provides a huge 72% performance gain over the GTX 1060 6GB on average. Factored into this is also the uplift moving from a dated Intel quad-core that was commonly used in 2017's laptops, to a new 8-core CPU that will be widespread across today's gaming systems. This is the primary comparison Nvidia is making for RTX 30 laptop GPUs and it makes sense given with these sorts of gains we think considering a gaming laptop upgrade is well worth it, especially for modern games.\n\nThe MaxQ naming issue (update)\nUpdate (Feb 5): Shortly after publishing this review, Nvidia announced that they will now require all companies selling RTX laptops to be more transparent about their graphics subsystems. In other words, while Nvidia used to encourage manufacturers to state clocks and power consumption on their product pages, now it requires them to do so. The Max-Q branding can still be used, albeit for different reasons, such as indicating support for Dynamic Boost 2.0, Advanced Optimus, and Whisper Mode 2.0.\nMany RTX 30-series laptop listings have yet to be updated to reflect differences in the clock speed and total power consumption. However, manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Razer, Origin, MSI, Alienware, and Gigabyte have already updated some product pages, so things are moving in the right direction for consumers.\nThe text below belongs to the original review, before Nvidia's change of heart with regards to RTX 30-series laptop GPU branding...\nClearly, the new RTX 3060 laptop GPU delivers on the performance front, that's why it's disappointing Nvidia has decided to confuse users with mixed naming schemes - in particular the removal of Max-Q branding. We've been banging on about this for years now, but the problem is bad enough that even mainstream media is catching on. Laptop makers usually only indicate what's the basic GPU name (e.g. \"RTX 3060\"), but different power configurations all differ in performance as we just saw in this review, sometimes significantly so.\nEssentially, the problem is that the same GPU model is being used across several power configurations.\nNvidia used to mitigate this somewhat by branding the lower power (and slower) variants as \"Max-Q\" and higher-power laptops with \"Max-P.\" And while there were still more sub-variants between the two extremes, this could at least give you some hint before you bought a new laptop. That's no longer possible with 2021's laptops.\n\nUsing today's review as a basic example, we looked at two RTX 3060 laptop GPU configurations that used an 80W and 115W base power level. The performance difference was 10% on average. That's significant enough in our opinion, but we didn't test the even lower power 60W variant of the 3060 which could be 15-20% slower, which is basically an entirely different GPU class at that point.\nNow, Nvidia has said that they are encouraging laptop makers to be clear about the power and clock speeds of the laptops they sell. But let's be honest. What maker wants to admit their cooling solution is inadequate and that they're using a slower GPU variant?\nThe solution is simple, these GPUs should be given different names. The RTX 3060 at 115W could be the RTX 3060MX, the 80W model could be RTX 3060M and the 60W model could be RTX 3060Q. There, solved.\n\nWhat We Learned\nOverall, there's a lot to like from the new RTX 3060 from a performance standpoint. The laptop GPU provides a notable performance uplift over previous parts of the same class and power level, which is something we couldn't say about Nvidia's Super refresh last year.\nThe upgrade to the Ampere architecture and Samsung 8nm process presents a solid leap for laptop hardware; hardware that's constrained by power and requires new architectures and next-gen process nodes to provide a leap in efficiency and therefore performance per watt.\n\nWhen we compare two laptop GPUs in the same price segment, relative to its generation - RTX 3060 vs RTX 2060 - we get 20% better performance on average. So if we have two laptops with the same design, same cooling capacity, and likely a similar price tag, the newer RTX 30 series option is going to deliver a decent performance gain in today's games at 1080p. That's exactly what we're looking for.\nThe generation on generation performance leap with Ampere vs. Turing isn't as large as we got from the Pascal to Turing upgrade on laptops. The RTX 2060, for example, was about 28 percent faster in our 2019 testing compared to the GTX 1060. However, in this instance Nvidia also increased the price tag. That isn't the case with the RTX 3060.\nShopping for a gaming laptop\nIn today's market, our conclusion above is not factoring in two key data points. First, this price comparison is based off the MSRP. We can't say for sure if gaming laptops will see inflated pricing due to the current terrible market situation for GPU hardware. It also doesn't account for end-of-life discounts on RTX 2060 laptops, so initially there may be a bargain to be had on last-gen hardware. But if we are comparing launch pricing to launch pricing, the RTX 3060 is well positioned and buyers are getting better performance per dollar.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the RTX 3060 matches the performance of the RTX 2070 Super from the previous generation, a GPU that was two steps above in the hierarchy. Those laptops used to cost around $1,800 or more, while some RTX 3060 laptops should be as low as $1,000-1,200. It's hard to make a direct comparison right now as most RTX 30 series laptops aren't available to buy just yet, but the early signs are a very strong value proposition for the RTX 3060 class of laptops.\nIt's also a promising landscape for those wanting to upgrade from a 4-year-old GTX laptop. Even when you don't factor in a drastic step up in CPU performance \u2013 from say the i7-7700HQ \u2013 new display tech and all the other benefits of modern laptops, the RTX 3060 alone is 70% faster than the GTX 1060 in the same power class. That's enough of a performance gain to justify an upgrade.\nFrom a performance standpoint and even without taking into consideration value-added features like ray tracing, DLSS, Dynamic Boost and so on, Nvidia is delivering the goods right now in the laptop market.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 2060 Laptops on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5980HS Laptops on Amazon\nIntel Core i7 Tiger Lake Laptops on Amazon\u00a0\nRyzen 7 4800U Laptops on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 27\n\n\n Got something to say?

A modern card can produce the high-resolution and high frame-rate graphics that gamers expect.But several factors, including manufacturing delays during the coronavirus pandemic, have contributed to a shortage.The great graphics card shortage of 2020 (and 2021)How do crypto-currencies work?Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina'Graphics cards are also popular with crypto-currency investors, who can use them for processing transactions and generating bitcoins, in a process known as mining.Many miners build rigs using several graphics cards at a time to produce a powerful machine dedicated to mining crypto-currency, rather than gaming.For this to be economical, the rig must generate more in bitcoins than the cost of the hardware and the electricity it uses to run.What has Nvidia done?Nvidia said the software for its forthcoming GeForce RTX 3060 card will limit how efficiently it can process Ethereum transactions by about 50%.This will make it less economical for miners to use the card for mining Ethereum.Nvidia said it had focused on Ethereum because it \"has the highest global mining yield for any GPU-mineable coin at the moment and thus is likely the main demand driver for GPUs in mining\".However, it has also decided to sell a range of crypto-currency mining processors (CMPs).Nvidia said the production of its CMPs would not impact the availability of its graphics cards. It told the BBC the CMP did not meet the \"specifications required\" of its GPUs and would also use less energy.But critics of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin say the energy they consume is wasteful.David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, has called Bitcoin \"anti-efficient\".\"More efficient mining hardware won't help - it'll just be competing against other efficient mining hardware,\" he told the BBC earlier in February.\"This means that Bitcoin's energy use, and hence its CO2 production, only spirals outwards.\"It's very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery.\" Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina'The great graphics card shortage of 2020 (and 2021)GamingBitcoinNvidiaCryptocurrencyRelated'I skipped college to make games - now I'm Roblox's top developer'2 days agoWalesIt's not a competition!

Fueled by NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, CANVAS delivers a range of ultra-high-resolution streaming and interactive solutions, so customers can engage audiences through any medium on any screen, anywhere in the world, whether that\u2019s in arenas, boardrooms, virtual studios or stages.\nIDS, which has been pushing creative boundaries for productions for two decades, also powered NVIDIA\u2019s opening keynote at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, dazzling audiences with a presentation delivered on an enormous 300-foot screen.\nNVIDIA\u2019s opening keynote at CES 2017.\nA Virtual Tournament Out of This League\nRiot Games hosts one of the largest esports events in the world \u2014 the League Championship Series (LCS) \u2014 which attracts millions of participants.\nBecause of the pandemic, Riot Games couldn\u2019t host its 2020 LCS Summer Split season from its broadcast studios in Los Angeles, so IDS designed a 3D virtual world called the LCS Dome, which consisted of five studios inside a virtual space. Riot Games remotely live-streamed matches during the season, with CANVAS powering the production for each matchup.\nAnalysts and gamers appeared inside the virtual environment as they followed live gamers battling for the championship. The entire season ran on CANVAS and was broadcast from the cloud to millions of viewers.\n\nThe virtual studio ran in the cloud, delivering stunning 3D virtual environments with seamless integration of remote video feeds from various participants. The LCS team easily integrated CANVAS into their existing broadcast workflow for live, fully cloud-based control over all components of the virtual studio with nothing more than an iPad.\nEverybody was at home, including the people who were broadcasting and operating the studio.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important is finding new ways for people to connect. It\u2019s the quality of experience that defines whether it\u2019s memorable,\u201d said Thomas Soetens, CEO and co-founder at Immersive Design Studios. \u201cWith NVIDIA RTX GPUs, our CANVAS platform was able to make anything happen in that studio virtually \u2014 from branding to public participation.\u201d\nCANVAS Brings Zoom Call Creativity in 360 Degrees\nTony Robbins is an author, coach, motivational speaker and philanthropist. Using CANVAS, IDS helped Robbins and his team turn his physical seminars into virtual events that attracted tens of thousands of participants from around the world.\nRobbins\u2019 first virtual event, Unleash The Power Within Virtual, was a live, 360-degree interactive experience. IDS designed Robbins\u2019 virtual studio using CANVAS to create an immersive, bi-directional experience for everyone. CANVAS allowed Robbins to see all of his 23,000 attendees simultaneously and interact with audience participants in real time.\n\nRobbins\u2019 CANVAS studio is equipped with a massive 360-degree screen and immersive sound system that serve to recreate the energy of a crowded arena. Six projectors, all in 4K resolution, displayed a custom Zoom interface showing tens of thousands of participants, any of whom could be enlarged or moved around instantly. And all the visuals were rendered in real time, at 60 frames per second.\nThe virtual event brought a new level of flexibility, as Robbins could move freely throughout the studio space, engaging with audience members virtually while his production team managed elements like music, lighting and visual effects.\n\u201cWe were able to connect the Zoom platform and create new controls for Zoom, whether it was bringing someone full screen above a beautiful background, displaying the participants in irregular grids or applying AI for mood recognition,\u201d said Kora Van den Bulcke, president and co-founder at Immersive Design Studios. \u201cWith the 360-degree space, the spatial sound and the real-time visuals rendered with RTX, it created this immersive experience that allowed the presenter to engage with his audience in a powerful way.\u201d\nThis approach is already spreading throughout the business community as a new standard for virtual events. Last month, the state-of-the-art GoPro Studio opened in Las Vegas, with a 360-degree LED wall designed as a permanent venue for virtual and hybrid events even beyond the COVID era. The studio\u2019s inaugural event, called Virtual GoPro, drew over 40,000 attendees to hear insights from coaches and guests such as actor Sylvester Stallone.\nLearn more about how Immersive Design Studios is using the latest features of CANVAS and NVIDIA RTX to create powerful bi-directional audience engagement, raising the bar for what virtual events can achieve.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | Remote Work \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But when they do eventually return to shop shelves, which one should you consider buying? Is the RTX 3080 really worth paying all that extra money for, or are you better off with the considerably cheaper RTX 3070? I've put both graphics cards head to head in today's biggest and most demanding games to find out.\n\nPrices are, admittedly, all over the shop right now, but under normal circumstances the RTX 3080 should cost around \u00a3649 / $699. The RTX 3070, on the other hand, is \u00a3200 / $200 less, starting at \u00a3469 / $499. That's quite a big difference if you're budgeting for a new PC build at the moment, so you'll want to make sure you're getting the right graphics card for your PC before you begin. After all, if the RTX 3070 ends up being more than enough for your current needs, then there's no need to spend another \u00a3200 / $200 on the RTX 3080.\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Review: Is It Really As Fast As 2080 Ti?\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nTo test the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, I used the same GPUs that I tested in my original graphics card reviews: the Zotac GeForce RTX 3070 Twin Edge and the Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 OC. I ran both cards at their default clock speeds, so the performance figures below should be fairly representative of what you'll find on other types of RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 cards elsewhere. I've also kept ray tracing switched off for this particular comparison test, as I'll be taking a closer look at next-gen ray tracing performance across all of the new AMD and Nvidia GPUs in a dedicated comparison piece.\nAs for the rest of my PC specs, I paired both cards with my usual Intel Core i5-10600K processor and 16GB of Corsair Vengeance Pro RAM and put them head to head in my suite of graphics benchmarks, taking an average frame rate from their own built-in benchmarking tools or from my own repeatable manual gameplay tests. These games include a mix of blockbusters from the last couple of years: Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Final Fantasy XV, Monster Hunter: World, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, The Witcher 3, Metro Exodus and Cyberpunk 2077.\nI tested every game at 1920x1080, 2560x1440 and 4K, so you can see exactly what's possible across a variety of different graphics settings. Naturally, both of these cards are geared toward 4K gaming rather than playing at 1080p, and there are plenty of cheaper graphics cards available, such as the RTX 3060 Ti or AMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT if that's the kind of resolution you're aiming for. I've included them here for the sake of completeness, but what we're really focusing on here is how each card fares at 2560x1440 and 4K. So all that in mind, let's take a look at some lovely bar charts.\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080: 1080p benchmarks\nNeedless to say, neither the RTX 3070 nor RTX 3080 are going to struggle to play games at on max settings at 1920x1080 right now, as even the most demanding of today's big games - Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077 - are both well into 70s and 80s when it comes to average frame rate. Admittedly, there isn't as much of a difference as you might expect given the price difference of these two cards, and as you can see from the benchmark results below, the RTX 3070 actually had a higher average frame rate in Cyberpunk 2077 in my benchmarking results than the RTX 3080.\n\n\n \n\nThe same thing happened in Monster Hunter: World as well, and even Final Fantasy XV was pretty much neck and neck. However, this is probably down to my choice of processor more than anything else, though, because if a graphics card is going to be CPU-bound at any of the three major resolutions these days, it's 1920x1080. Of course, Intel's Core i5-10600K is hardly a slouch when it comes to gaming performance, but it just goes to show that simply bunging in a new GPU to your PC doesn't necessarily always equal faster frame rates if you don't also have the right CPU to keep up with it. \nIn any case, though, even if you do have a more powerful Core i7 or Ryzen 7 processor at your disposal, it's still unlikely you'll be able to notice a discernible difference between these two cards at 1080p - unless, of course, you're particularly susceptible to playing games at 110fps versus 120fps. My eyes certainly can't tell the difference between these kinds of frame rates without the aid of a frame rate counter, so there's definitely not much point paying extra for the RTX 3080 at this resolution - especially when the even cheaper RTX 3060 Ti does it almost as well as the RTX 3070. \nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080: 1440p benchmarks\nAs I said above, though, 1080p gaming isn't what these two cards are intended for. Instead, they're really aimed at flawless 2560x1440 gaming and 4K. Looking at the former first, you can see below that both cards are more than capable of playing games on max settings at 1440p, as even the RTX 3070 can manage an average of 60fps+ in pretty much every game going. The only one that saw it drop below an average of 60fps was Cyberpunk 2077 - although this can be quickly remedied by enabling the game's DLSS support.\n\n\n \n\nIndeed, in most cases the RTX 3080 was a good 20fps in front of the RTX 3070, although some games such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Final Fantasy XV saw this gap narrow to just 7-8fps. Personally, I'd still err on the side of the RTX 3070 here, as everything can be played perfectly smoothly here (including Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS), and I'm still not sure my eyes can really tell the difference between 70fps and 90fps - and that's assuming you've got a high refresh rate monitor that can actually make use of those extra frames, too. If you've still got a regular 60Hz monitor, then both cards will appear to run games at a capped 60fps anyway, making the RTX 3070 the clear winner here.\nOf course, given that some of today's most demanding games such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla are already pushing the RTX 3070 pretty close to that 60fps sweet spot, some of you may think that it's worth investing that extra cash in the RTX 3080 so you can carry on playing games on max settings at 1440p for longer. And that's a perfectly valid conclusion, if that's what you want to spend your money on. Alternatively, you could just knock the settings down to High and still get perfectly smooth frame rates for many more years to come. Indeed, the RTX 3070 managed an average of 72fps on High at 1440p, which isn't really all that different from the RTX 3080's average of 80fps on the same settings. It really depends on how much you value being able to play games on max settings all the time, and whether you're okay with occasionally knocking the settings down to High in order to maintain those smooth 60fps performance levels.\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080: 4K benchmarks\nIf you're planning on buying a graphics card for 4K gaming, however, then the RTX 3080 is almost definitely worth shelling out for, particularly if you want to make sure your PC is well future-proofed against the games of tomorrow. Indeed, while both cards can hit at least 60fps on Medium settings at 4K in most of today's big games, there are still a couple of instances where the RTX 3070 starts to show its limitations, specifically in today's newest games, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n\n \n\nOf course, an average of 59fps in Valhalla is still nothing to be sniffed at, but the fact the RTX 3070 can only manage this on Medium graphics settings doesn't bode well for its overall longevity as a 4K graphics card as the years roll on. Cyberpunk 2077 at least has the benefit of DLSS to help bump up the numbers a bit, hitting well over 60fps on Medium with DLSS switched on, but let's not forget that the number of games that actually support DLSS right now are still few and far between. This may change over time, but right now it's still too early to say just how prolific DLSS support is going to be down the line.\nInstead, the vast majority of 2021's games and beyond are more likely to be in the same kind of situation as Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and when we start moving up the quality scale, those near-60fps frame rates quickly start dropping pretty quickly. When we bump up the settings to High, for example, the RTX 3070 quickly starts delivering an average closer to 50fps in today's big games, while the RTX 3080 is, for the most part, still well above 60fps, maintaining a 15-20fps lead over its RTX sibling.\n\n\n \n\nAgain, Assassin's Creed Valhalla remains a tough nut to crack at 4K, averaging 58fps on the RTX 3080, as does Cyberpunk 2077, where its regular, non-DLSS average levels out at just 45fps. Overall, though, the RTX 3080 is definitely in a much better position than the RTX 3070 to keep delivering those close-to-60fps / 60fps+ frame rates at these kind of quality settings as time goes on.\nHeck, it's also in a better position to keep running at close-to-60fps on Ultra settings, too, as the graph below shows we're still looking at some very decent frame rates on max settings across the board here. Indeed, while the RTX 3070 can manage 60fps in a couple of games here - Shadow Of The Tomb Raider and The Witcher III - these titles are getting on a bit now. Sure, if your Steam library largely consists of games from 2018 or earlier, then the RTX 3070 is probably going to be a pretty decent pick. However, if you're the type of person who wants to play the latest and greatest on release, then the RTX 3080 is pretty much a no-brainer here.\n\n\n \n\nNaturally, there are still going to be a few games that give the RTX 3080 trouble on max settings (especially if they don't have DLSS support) - I'm looking at you, Total War and Assassin's Creed Valhalla - but overall that's a pretty decent set of numbers from today's big blockbusters. Much better than chugging along at 35-45fps like the RTX 3070 in a lot of cases, as this is the kind of difference you definitely can appreciate without the aid of a frame rate counter.\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080: which is best?\nClearly, the RTX 3080 is the superior card in almost every instance when you look at the raw benchmarking figures, but unless you've got a 4K gaming monitor, there's really no need to shell out all that extra cash for it. The RTX 3080 is a great card, no doubt about it, but the RTX 3070 is just as capable at delivering fast, smooth frame rates at 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, and is a much better choice for your wallet overall (and heck, if you're really only after a card for 1920x1080, then you'd be doing yourself an even bigger favour by opting for the even cheaper RTX 3060 Ti or AMD's Radeon RX 5600 XT instead).\nIndeed, the RTX 3080 really only comes into its own when you start pushing up to 4K, at which point that extra \u00a3200 / $200 starts to feels like money well spent. After all, whatever resolution you're looking to play games at, you ideally want a card that can play games at 60fps on High settings straight off the bat, if only to make sure you've got enough headroom to carry on playing games at a decent quality setting at at that resolution in the years to come. If you only get a card that can do 60fps on Low or Medium settings, on the other hand, then it won't be long before you have to abandon that resolution altogether and drop down to the next one. \nIn summary, you should definitely save up for the RTX 3080 if you're hankering after that high-end 4K gaming experience, but if you've currently only a 2560x1440 gaming monitor, then the RTX 3070 will do you just fine.\nFor more GPU comparisons check out:\n\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs 1050 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1650 vs AMD RX 570\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Super\nNvidia GTX 1660 vs 1660 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1660 Super vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 Super vs 1660 Ti\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1060\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs 1070\nNvidia GTX 1660 Ti vs RTX 2060\nNvidia RTX 2060 vs GTX 1060\nNvidia RTX 2060 vs 2060 Super vs AMD RX 5700 vs RX 5700 XT\nNvidia RTX 2070 vs 2070 Super vs AMD RX 5700 XT\nNvidia RTX 2070 Super vs 2080 Super\nNvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080\nNvidia RTX 2080 Ti vs GTX 1080 Ti\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 vs 2080 Super\nNvidia RTX 3060 Ti vs RTX 3070\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs 3080\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs 2080 Ti\nAMD RX 5600 XT vs RX 5700\nAMD RX 6800 vs RX 6800 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

First unveiled back at CES 2021, the latest member of the GeForce RTX 30 series is continuing NVIDIA\u2019s ongoing top-to-bottom launch of Ampere-based video cards, with today\u2019s card in some respects being the most popular one. Aimed at the mainstream market, the RTX 3060 is designed to be a more balanced option for the larger market of gamers who probably aren\u2019t trying to drive high-end 4K displays, but still want the latest graphical features on a 1080p or 1440p display. RTX 3060 cards will go on sale a bit later this morning \u2013 at 9am Pacific \u2013 with prices starting at $329.\nUnderpinning the new cards is the first new GPU out of NVIDIA since last fall, GA106. This part has already been shipping in laptops for just under a month as part of the GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU, and now it\u2019s finally coming to desktops. We\u2019ll dive into GA106 more in a bit, but at a high-level it\u2019s a fairly traditional scaled-down NVIDIA GPU design, cutting down on the number of SMs and memory channels to produce a cheaper GPU. Like it\u2019s other consumer siblings, this is being produced on Samsung\u2019s 8nm process \u2013 a potential blessing at a time when TSMC is slammed with orders, but not completely meeting NVIDIA\u2019s needs amidst the insatiable demand for chips across the industry.\nAs previously mentioned, NVIDIA\u2019s 60-tier parts are traditionally their big volume parts for North America and Europe, and the RTX 3060 will be no exception. Though the $329 price tag is arguably on the north side of \u201cmainstream\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s the whole matter of unmet demand \u2013 there\u2019s little question that as the cheapest Ampere card yet, it\u2019s going to be the most popular one with gamers. NVIDIA sold nothing short of a massive amount of cards to this mainstream market 3-4 years ago with their Pascal-based GTX 1060 series, and now they\u2019d like to sell that market on an upgrade.\nThat said, the RTX 3060 comes at a very odd time for the video card industry, enough so that, volume aside, this may be the most important RTX 30 series video card launch yet. Specifically, this is the first GeForce video card to launch since the video card market went cuckoo bananas (to use the technical term) thanks to a spike in the price of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The compounding demand has made it nearly impossible to get a video card of any sort over the last few months, and has led to NVIDIA taking the unprecedented step of adding an Ethereum throttling mechanism to the RTX 3060 cards. Only time will tell how effective this measure actually is, but addressing the miner problem is the first step towards ensuring a more regular and predictable supply of video cards for NVIDIA\u2019s core gaming market.\nBut even with those mechanisms in place, pent-up demand for video cards in general means that the supply of cards for today\u2019s launch will go quickly. For those who are fortunate enough to get a card, they will have a significant number of models to pick from, as the absence of a retail NVIDIA reference card means that AIBs\u2019 custom designs making up the entirety of the RTX 3060 lineup. None of the usual suspects are releasing anything too exotic here \u2013 at least not right away \u2013 so expect to see a mix of dual and triple fan cards at a variety of price points.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3060\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 2060\nGTX 1060\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3584\n4864\n1920\n1280\n\n\nROPs\n48\n80\n48\n48\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.777GHz\n1.665GHz\n1.68GHz\n1.709GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n15Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n8Gbps GDDR5\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n192-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n12GB\n8GB\n6GB\n6GB\n\n\nSingle Precision Perf.\n12.8 TFLOPS\n16.2 TFLOPS\n6.5 TFLOPS\n4.4 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Perf.

As previously mentioned, this is based on NVIDIA\u2019s new GA106 GPU. At 12 billion transistors, the chip is notably lighter than the 17.4B chip that is GA104, and at a high level it\u2019s roughly equivalent to two-thirds of a GA104 both in the number of functional units and in the transistor count. Out of the fab, GA106 comes with 30 SMs, 48 ROPs, and 6 memory controllers. However for yield reasons, NVIDIA is shipping their leading GA106 card with only 28 of those SMs enabled. So as far as GA106 is concerned, there\u2019s a little more gas in the tank than what we\u2019ll see from the RTX 3060.\n\nWith its 28 SMs enabled, RTX 3060 offers a total of 3584 FP32 CUDA cores. Meanwhile everything else in GA106\u2019s SMs is in proportion per the Ampere architecture, so this means there is also 112 TMUs, 112 tensor cores, and 28 RT cores. The ROP count, on the other hand, stands out a bit more here since NVIDIA has significantly trimmed down this aspect of the chip; whereas GA104 had 96 ROPs, GA106 gets just 48. This means that, relative to GA104 and the RTX 3070/3060Ti cards, RTX 3060 is going to be a bit more hamstrung in terms of total pixel pushing power and thus higher resolutions, underscoring how this is a card aimed first and foremost at 1080p gaming.\nGiven that NVIDIA had decoupled the ROPs from the memory controllers in this generation, I had been hoping we\u2019d see 64 ROPs for the RTX 3060. But as it turns out, that won\u2019t be the case. NVIDIA has not increased the number of ROPs for a 60-tier card since the launch of the GTX 1060 in 2016, so it will be interesting to see what this means for the generational performance of the card, especially in 1080p games that still want to rasterize a relatively large number of pixels.\nAll of these blocks, in turn, will be clocked a little more aggressively for an Ampere part, with NVIDIA setting the baseline specifications for the RTX 3060 at 1.32GHz for the base clockspeed, and 1.777GHz for the rated boost clock. On paper, this means the RTX 3060 will offer around 80% of the RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s shader and texture performance, with the card\u2019s relatively high boost clock helping to make up for the overall lack of SMs. Meanwhile we\u2019re looking at just 64% of RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s ROP throughput.\nOn the memory side of matters, GA106 introduces a smaller 192-bit memory bus, which is comprised of six 32-bit memory controllers. This is standard fare for 60-tier cards, and does come with some trade-offs, mainly in terms of memory capacity. At three-quarters the size of the bus on the likes of the RTX 3070, NVIDIA normally opts to include three-quarters the memory, which would have been 6GB. However, as a 6GB card is looking kind of long in the tooth when game consoles have 16GB of total memory, likely impacting the card\u2019s long-term performance prospects, NVIDIA has decided to finally bite the bullet and make the jump to 12GB of VRAM on their mid-tier video cards. The net result is that there\u2019s currently an odd progression/regression in the GeForce RTX 30 lineup \u2013 going from 12GB down to 8GB and then back up to 10GB on the RTX 3080 \u2013 but at the end of the day it ensures the RTX 3060 ships with enough VRAM to be useful for years to come.\nNVIDIA\u2019s choice of VRAM, in turn, ends up being quite interesting. The company\u2019s official specifications call for RTX 3060 cards to use (at least) 15Gbps GDDR6 memory; the GDDR6 is to be expected, the speed grade is not. To the best of our knowledge, none of the GDDR6 vendors offer a 15Gbps speed grade \u2013 after 14Gbps, the next speed grade is 16Gbps. This means that in order to meet the 15Gbps requirement, AIBs will need to use 16Gbps chips to begin with. So why the odd choice in memory speed? The most rational explanation is so that it leaves a bit of room for vendors to sell factory overclocked cards, as this way they can sell cards with 16Gbps memory clocks as a premium product without actually exceeding the memory\u2019s specifications.\u00a0 In any case, using 15Gbps GDDR6 gives the RTX 3060 a total memory bandwidth of 360GB/second, 24GB/second more than what the RTX 2060 offered.\nWith lower performance and memory amounts, TDP is also dropping accordingly relative to the higher-end RTX 30 series cards. NVIDIA is rating the RTX 3060 at 170 Watts, which is 30W below the RTX 3060 Ti, and making this the first RTX 30 series card with a sub-200W TDP. However, much like the other RTX 30 series cards, TDPs are rising on a generational basis. Whereas the GTX 1060 was a 120W card and the RTX 2060 a 160W card, RTX 3060\u2019s 170W TDP is a further 10W higher. If nothing else, this is consistent with what NVIIDA has done with this entire generation of cards, but it means that the RTX 3060 series is going to be more powerful in more than just rendering performance.\nAn Extra Feature: Throttling Ethereum Mining Performance\nAs briefly mentioned towards the introduction, the RTX 3060 also introduces an interesting new anti-mining feature for the first time in any NVIDIA GeForce card. Specifically, the RTX 3060 is designed to throttle back on Ethereum mining, essentially capping the mining performance for the cryptocurrency at 50% of the card\u2019s actual (native) rate. As announced by NVIDIA last week, this is part of an effort to segment the gaming and mining markets \u2013 and to keep gaming cards from being pressed into a life of chasing digital riches.\nWhen NVIDIA originally announced the throttling mechanism, they merely called it a \u201cdriver\u201d feature \u2013 raising immediate questions about how this might be bypassed. However since then, NVIDIA has clarified that the feature is actually a mix of driver, hardware, and firmware functionality, relying on a \u201csecure handshake\u201d between the three of them. The involvement of the firmware makes things far more interesting (and far harder to break) since NVIDIA requires signed firmware on all GeForce video cards, meaning that an RTX 3060 card\u2019s firmware can\u2019t be modified nearly as easily as drivers.\n\nOne Year Ethereum Price History (Image Courtesy CoinMarketCap)\nThe outstanding question then is whether this is going to be hard enough to break, at least over the useful lifetime of the RTX 3060 series. Considering that nothing is impossible to break \u2013 there are always flaws in consumer-grade software/hardware to exploit \u2013 NVIDIA is, if nothing else, inviting an interesting challenge towards breaking their anti-Ethereum security in pursuit of profits. And make no mistake, there\u2019s quite a bit of money at stake to incentivize bypassing the throttle.\nOnly time will tell in the long-run how well NVIDIA\u2019s security can stand up \u2013 and if their forced market segmentation strategy will succeed. But in the short-run, as one colleague put it last week, even half of a profit is still a profit. So NVIDIA\u2019s halving of mining performance may still not be enough, at least at Ethereum\u2019s currently irrational price.\nAs an aside, some questions have been raised about what the throttle will mean for other workloads. The good news there, at least, is that Ethereum mining has a very distinct workload: it\u2019s essentially a proxy for memory bandwidth. So as algorithm that hammers the memory controllers but not the ALUs, it stands out even among compute workloads. Still, I don\u2019t doubt that we\u2019ll see some edge case testing as people look to verify this.\nPartner Cards & Product Positioning\nAs part of being NVIDIA\u2019s cheapest Ampere video card to date, the RTX 3060 is also the first card that isn\u2019t getting a reference (Founders Edition) release from NVIDIA. So even though this is the first card to use the new GA106 GPU, NVIDIA is comfortable letting the AIBs take the wheel with Ampere\u2019s first purely virtual hardware launch. As a result, hitting the streets today will be a collection of custom cards from the usual regional board partners.\n\nGallery: GeForce RTX 3060 Partner Boards\nNVIDIA and their board partners have already sent out photos and spec sheets for a number of cards, and for anyone familiar with past generations of 60-tier cards, everything here looks quite familiar. The bulk of cards being announced today are going to be of the dual and triple fan variety, with a couple of single fan cards surprisingly thrown in for good measure. For better or worse, this is the tried and true cooler method for mid-range cards, and the board partners are apt to recycle proven designs \u2013 especially if they\u2019re pin-compatible. Meanwhile I have not seen any blower-type cards, though given OEMs\u2019 fondness for them, I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if there\u2019s someone out there doing them for those customers as well.\n\nSince NVIDIA doesn\u2019t have a reference card of their own, for today\u2019s reviews the company has been sending out cards from long-time partner EVGA. The company\u2019s RTX 3060 XC BLACK GAMING card is a very typical example of a baseline RTX 3060 cards, offering a dual fan cooler and no factory overclock of any kind. It\u2019s also one of the only cards that, judging from some early Newegg listings, will be launching at NVIDIA\u2019s $329 MSRP. So expect to see a lot of this card today in reviews, with retail units moving very quickly due to the price.\nOtherwise, an all-custom card launch means that we\u2019re expecting a wide range of performance levels, and an even wider range in prices. Early Newegg listings have indicated that cards will be priced anywhere between MSRP ($329) and over $500, depending on the factory overclock and any other premium features an AIB has added to a specific card. This is a wider variance than we normally see, but then these are unusual times, and AIBs can reasonably count on RTX 3060 cards selling even at higher prices, given how hard it is to find a modern video card on retailer shelves right now.\n\nAs always, NVIDIA is targeting an N + 2 upgrade cycle with these latest cards, meaning that the company is particularly pitching them as an upgrade for Pascal (GTX 10 series) owners. Along with the significant feature differences afforded by two generations of improvements \u2013 things like RT cores and tensor cores, HDMI 2.1 ports and AV1 decoders \u2013 there is also a sizable performance advantage for the newer cards. RTX 2060 owners will not be impressed from a single generation\u2019s gains, but it\u2019s the GTX 1060 owners that NVIDIA really wants to reach.\nThe bigger challenge for NVIDIA is going to be enticing those Pascal owners to upgrade in light of the higher prices that all of the RTX cards over the last two generations have fetched. The baseline GTX 1060 6GB hit the market at $249 a bit over 4 years ago, so even if we ignore the current crypto craziness, $329 for its Ampere-based successor is a stiff price increase. Mind you, all of the RTX 30 series cards have faced a similar challenge, but it\u2019s really once we get to 60-tier cards that NVIDIA\u2019s regular customer base becomes increasingly focused on perf-per-dollar.\nMeanwhile, although today is all about the RTX 3060, NVIDIA does have some competition on the horizon. In a suspiciously timely announcement, yesterday AMD teased that they\u2019ll be announcing new Radeon video cards next week \u2013 lower tier products that will almost certainly include an RTX 3060 competitor. To date, NVIDIA has had the $300 to $500 market entirely to itself, and while they will for a little longer, that run will be coming to an end soon enough.\nFinally, in one more wrinkle that makes today\u2019s RTX 3060 launch a little different from anything prior, NVIDIA and retailers are also changing when cards will go on sale. Traditionally, card sales start either concurrently with the review embargo (normally 9am ET for NVIDIA), or days later for a soft launch. However for the RTX 3060, NVIDIA has opted to keep the same-day release with a twist, setting the retail release for noon ET. This means that potential RTX 3060 buyers will have at least a couple of hours to check our reviews before they need to commit to buying a potentially hard to get card, which isn\u2019t a massive lead, but is certainly more consumer-friendly than having the cards go on sale before anyone has a chance to read a review.\nIn any case, given what we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, NVIDIA\u2019s board partners shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble clearing their inventories today. The RTX 3060 Ti flew off the shelves at $399, and with video card demand spiking, the even cheaper RTX 3060 will fly off the shelves even faster. In fact, keeping the card on shelves (and at MSRP) is likely to be NVIDIA\u2019s biggest problem for the next quarter, even if NVIDIA\u2019s Ethereum throttling mechanism remains undefeated. We are in unprecedented times for video card demand, and unfortunately that means that our favorite PC hardware continues to be hard to get. Which for NVIDIA and its partners mean they\u2019ll be able to move everything they can make, but it means gamers will want to be on their toes today if they hope to get an RTX 3060.\n\n\n\nQ1 2021 GPU Product Lineups\n\t\t\t(Theoretical MSRPs)\n\n\nAMD\nPrice\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1499\nGeForce RTX 3090\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\n$999\n\u00a0\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\n$649/$699\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n$579\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$499\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n\nRadeon RX 5700 XT\n$399\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\n$329\nGeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n115 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nvalinor89 - Thursday, February 25, 2021 - link\nThank god that miners only mine ETh on GPU these days and there axist no other altcoins being mined. /sEven then I wonder if even at 1/2 speed it makes more sense to buy these than to buy the dedicated mining cards. At least these can be flipped when the current craze ends or these cards start to loose eficacy at mining. It all boils down to making a proffit, and considering people are mining on laptops, this card will still be used to mine.Also, has anyone calculated what the speed halving on ethereum does to power efficiency? While they mine slower they might do so more efficiently.\n\n\n\nvalinor89 - Thursday, February 25, 2021 - link\nAnd it doesn't take long to find out you can make close to 7$ a day with this card mining other coins.

That's the lowest price I saw at Best Buy and Micro Center, with most prices around the $500 mark, with some as high as $629.99 and $534.99, respectively. The latest back-of-the-napkin calculations squarely peg video card price-to-performance (excluding ray-tracing) no better than (and sometimes worse than) 10 series performance per dollar. That's how far we've regressed: we are paying for the same performance as video cards released five years ago. Normally, you would be paying around half as much for the same amount of performance from half a decade ago at this point. This is one market bubble that is going to burst in NVIDIA and AMD's faces and subsequently nosedive as terribly as prices first skyrocketed.

Both models prominently feature the latest MBUX AI cockpit, powered by NVIDIA, delivering an intelligent user interface for daily driving.\n\nThe newest MBUX system debuted with the flagship S-Class sedan in September. With the C-Class, the system is now in Mercedes-Benz\u2019 most popular model in the mid-size sedan segment \u2014 the automaker has sold 10.5 million C-Class vehicles since it was first introduced and one in every seven Mercedes-Benz sold is a member of that model line.\nNVIDIA and Mercedes-Benz have been working together to drive the future of automotive innovation, starting with the first generation MBUX to the upcoming fleet of software-defined vehicles.\nThis extension of MBUX to such an appealing model is accelerating the adoption of AI into everyday commutes, ushering in a new generation where the car adapts to the driver, not the other way around.\nUncommon Intelligence\nWith MBUX, the new C-Class sedan and wagon share much of the innovations that have made the S-Class a standout in its segment.\nAI cockpits orchestrate crucial safety and convenience features, constantly learning to continuously deliver joy to the customer. Similarly, the MBUX system serves as the central nervous system of the vehicle, intelligently networking all its functions.\n\u201cMBUX combines so many features into one intelligent user interface,\u201d said Georges Massing, vice president of Digital Vehicle and Mobility at Mercedes-Benz. \u201cIt makes life much easier for our customers.\u201d\n\nThe new MBUX system makes the cutting edge in graphics, passenger detection and natural language processing seem effortless. Like in the S-Class, the C-Class system features a driver and media display with crisp graphics that are easily understandable at a glance. The \u201cHey Mercedes\u201d voice assistant has become even sharper, can activate online services, and continuously improves over time.\nMBUX can even recognize biometric identification to ensure the car is always safe and secure. A fingerprint scanner located beneath the central display allows users to quickly and securely access personalized features.\nAnd with over-the-air updates, MBUX ensures the latest technology will always be at the user\u2019s fingertips, long after they leave the dealership.\nA Modern Sedan for the Modern World\nWith AI at the helm, the C-Class embraces modern and forward-looking technology as the industry enters a new era of mobility.\nThe redesigned vehicle maintains the Mercedes-Benz heritage of unparalleled driving dynamics while incorporating intelligent features such as headlights that automatically adapt to the surrounding environment for optimal visibility.\nBoth the sedan and wagon variants come with plug-in hybrid options that offer more than 60 miles of electric range for a luxurious driving experience that\u2019s also sustainable.\nThese features, combined with the only AI cockpit available today, will have C-Class drivers feeling like a million bucks.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I know. Waiting sucks, especially when new GPUs keep cropping up. But while that money is burning a hole in your pocket, you have the time to wait for reviews to roll in and really think about what new graphics card will work best for the rig you\u2019re upgrading or building. Or perhaps you can take this time to save some extra money for the bigger and better GPU. That\u2019s the position I\u2019d most likely find myself in deciding between Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti. If the RTX 3060 stock is available and you have can easily afford it, I\u2019d take the Ti version over the base 3060 in a heartbeat. The RTX 3060 is not a bad card. It gets superb 1080p and 1440p performance in the majority of games, and can hit over or close to 60 frames per second with ray tracing on. It covers a lot of ground for having similar specs to its more mature Ti sibling. But the RTX 3060 Ti just gives you better performance for your dollar, and part of that comes down to how the two cards are specced. While the RTX 3060 has 12GB of VRAM (video memory) compared to the 3060 Ti\u2019s 8GB, and even a slightly higher boost clock than the Ti, the RTX 3060\u2019s 192-bit memory bus drags it down. The smaller the memory bus, the less data than can flow to and from the GPU. The RTX 3060 Ti has a 256-bit memory bus, so its overall bandwidth is almost 100 Gbps more than the RTX 3060. More bandwidth means better performance, of course, but it was somewhat surprising just how much better the RTX 3060 Ti preformed compared to the 3060 for being only $70 more. (I\u2019m talking MSRP prices here\u2014if you\u2019re dealing with scalpers, all bets are off.)\n\n\n     Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060        What is it? Nvidia's newest, and so far cheapest, RTX 30-series GPU   Price $329 MSRP   Like Price, decent performance   No Like Not a big jump in performance compared to the RTX 2060, small memory bus     I compared the RTX 3060 to the 3070, 3060 Ti, and the older RTX 2060 using a system configured with the following parts: Intel Core i9-10900K CPU; Asus ROG Maximus Extreme XII motherboard; 16GB (8GB x2) G.Skill Trident Z Royal DDR4-3600 DRAM; Samsung 970 Evo NVMe M.2 500GB SSD; Seasonic Focus GX-1000 PSU; and a Corsair H150i Pro RGB 360mm AIO for cooling. The RTX 3060 averaged a 5-15 fps lead over the RTX 2060, depending on the resolution. (The higher the frame rate gap, the lower the resolution.) The RTX 2060 was $349 when it was first released\u2014just $20 more than what the 3060 retails for. The RTX 3060 Ti averaged a 15-30 fps lead, and in some cases, 40 fps, over the RTX 3060.\n\n\n\nThat sort of puts the 3060 in a weird spot; it gets better performance for less over the previous generation, but it\u2019s not enough to make a compelling argument for someone with an RTX 2060 to upgrade to a 3060. In this case, that massive frame rate gap between the 3060 and 3060 Ti makes shelling out some extra cash totally worth it. Also, there is no Founders Edition of the RTX 3060\u2014just cards from partners like Asus, MSI, etc. That\u2019s not such a terrible thing for most people I would imagine. The card reviewed here is from EVGA and it works great. It even comes with the standard 8-pin power connector, unlike the Founders versions of the RTX 3080, 3070, and 3060 Ti that have a svelte 12-pin connector but need an adapter that juts out of the card like a two-headed snake. But if you prefer the aesthetics of Nvidia\u2019s Founders cards, you are also out of luck with the RTX 3060 on that end, too.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              Click to open Slideshow And to further complicate things, Nvidia is re-releasing the RTX 2060 to help ease the graphics card shortage. No telling when that will happen, but it seems like that will put the RTX 3060 in an even weirder spot. Anyone looking for a simple GPU that can handle every game at 1080p, and even a few games at 1440p, is probably going to go for the RTX 2060 if it\u2019s decently cheaper than the RTX 3060. When a newer card only has a 5-15 fps lead over its older version, and it can still get 60 fps in a demanding game like Metro Exodus at 1080p on ultra, that makes the older one the \u201cgood enough\u201d card\u2014the card that people on a budget will probably go for over the RTX 3060. At least I would. It might have made more sense to put a 256-bit memory bus with 8GB of VRAM in the RTX 3060, given how much more performance the RTX 3060 Ti gets. But then again, maybe that would have raised the price a bit, and Nvidia likely wanted to hit a specific price point to cover a smaller segment of consumers who might be interested in the RTX 3060. Or maybe Nvidia purposefully made that large performance gap so more people would spend an extra $70 for the Ti version. I can\u2019t say for sure, but whatever the case, I\u2019m over here saying, \u201cYeah, the 3060 is nice\u2026BUT THE 3060 Ti!\u201d\n\n\n\n                                      Click to open Slideshow AMD is also not far away from announcing its next graphics card, which could rival either the RTX 3060 Ti or RTX 3060\u2014or both! As we\u2019ve reviewed previously, AMD\u2019s RTX 6800 XT and RTX 6800 excelled in non-ray tracing performance, besting even Nvidia\u2019s flagship cards. It\u2019s likely the RTX 3060 will still beat AMD in ray tracing, though, based on our previous testing. Those who will probably benefit most from upgrading to an RTX 3060 are those who are using a GTX 1660 Ti or below. The performance increase is too small to justify moving from a RTX 2060 or above, especially not at scalping prices. But maybe, just maybe, the scalpers and crypto miners won\u2019t touch this graphics card. (Fingers crossed.)\n\n\n\nREAD ME No Founders Edition Small performance increase over the RTX 2060 Might have to compete with the RTX 2060 if Nvidia re-releases it\n\n\n\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is the more

Baking is also now available when OptiX is active, enabling artists to continue using the fastest rendering software.\nFinally, NVIDIA GPUs can automatically contribute to help render sections of models being rendered by the CPU once the GPU has completed its tasks, a process called tile stealing, which further improves hybrid rendering performance.\nIn short, rendering with Blender, no matter the task, just got better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender Leap In V-Ray \nV-Ray 3D rendering software is built for artists and designers to create photoreal imagery with world-class rendering features.\nLight cache, which greatly improves rendering efficiency, is now GPU accelerated, speeding up how quickly pixels start to render.\nOut-of-core rendering uses system memory when GPU memory is exceeded for geometry, enabling artists to work in much larger scenes. This vital capability now supports all V-Ray GPU features allowing it to be used with any scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of Chaos Group. tyFlow simulations rendered in V-Ray GPU \u00a9 BBB3Viz\nIn addition, artists can now render with tyFlow, the popular 3ds Max plugin for particle simulations, with the added speed of V-Ray GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedshift Adds New Rendering Features\nRedshift, a powerful GPU-accelerated renderer, built to meet the specific demands of contemporary high-end production rendering, has several exciting updates.\nNVIDIA RTX ray tracing in Redshift is now fully supported with OptiX 7.2, providing further performance boosts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendered in Redshift with OptiX. Credit: Syed Jafri.\nOSL shader support enables Redshift users to write their own shaders or utilize OSL shaders in the rendering community, even for a different renderer, adding a ton of new shading possibilities.\nAn upgraded hair shader produces much more realistic lighting while offering artist-friendly controls and cool built-in variation features that add to the realism.\nRedshift is also getting NVLINK support. Projects with exceptionally large models can share the VRAM of multiple GPUs to render massive scenes.\nRedshift v3.0.38 is available for purchase here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaster Rendering in Arnold\nAutodesk Arnold is the power user\u2019s 3D rendering application, providing production-ready tools to reliably manage complex characters, scenery and advanced lighting challenges.\nArnold GPU now loads only the required texture tiles, giving creators with limited GPU memory the ability to run more texture-heavy scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Unlocks Photorealistic Visuals in Real-Time Content Creation\nGamers are familiar with the enhanced visual fidelity NVIDIA RTX GPUs provide thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 (Deep Learning Super Sampling). DLSS uses AI to turn images rendered at low resolution into higher resolution. And it runs in real time on RTX GPUs, using dedicated AI processors called Tensor Cores.\nThis powerful tool is also an ally for content creators, especially in computationally complex tasks like virtual production and architectural visualization. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYuase Digital Art Studio. Courtesy of D5 Render\nDLSS has now been integrated in over a dozen creative applications, from architecture to product design to virtual production. Read our latest DLSS blog to see how our partners are utilizing DLSS to deliver up to 2x speedups in rendering, without sacrificing quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest 30 Series Studio Products Available Now\nThe latest NVIDIA Studio laptops and desktops are available now. They feature advanced GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, blazing-fast memory and storage, vivid color displays and precision engineering.\nOur refreshed Studio lineup of fully-capable laptops and ultra-powerful desktop PCs are available from hardware partners you know and trust:\n\nGigabyte Aero 15 & OLED\nGigabyte Aero 17 & HDR\nRazer Blade 15 Base & Advanced\nRazer Blade Pro 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Razer Blade 15 Advanced Edition\u00a0 powered by NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce RTX\u2122 3070. Full HD 360Hz, 100% sRGB, 4.9mm bezel, factory calibrated\nThe new Studio Driver also supports GeForce RTX 3060 desktop GPUs, released today.

The same is true for esports -- better GPUs, displays, peripherals, and good software can help you respond more quickly and precisely to opponents.\u00a0\u00a0\nRainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular esports around, with frequent content updates including new map redesigns and Operators. Rainbow Six Siege is not your typical shooter, favoring strategic and tactical gameplay over a \u2018run-and-gun\u2019 style. Reaction time is measured in milliseconds, and is critical to a player's success. Being a fraction of a second late on the trigger is the difference between your digital life and death, so reducing system latency can be a huge boon for Rainbow Six Siege players.\nLater today, NVIDIA Reflex support will be added to the Technical Test Server for Rainbow Six Siege. With NVIDIA Reflex, system latency is significantly reduced, making it easier to target enemies and improving your competitiveness.\nRainbow Six Siege supports NVIDIA Reflex in the Vulkan version of the game and provides a free upgrade to a huge number of GeForce gamers by reducing latency and improving responsiveness for GeForce GTX 10 Series and\u00a0newer GPUs.\u00a0 In fact, latency reductions are typically better for lower end hardware. \nEnabled by a simple toggle in the display settings menu, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency by up to 25%, giving you a split-second advantage in the heat of the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to help test the new update and the included NVIDIA Reflex support, open the Ubisoft Connect app and download the \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege - Test Server\u201d client using a Ubisoft account that owns a copy of Rainbow Six Siege, and launch the Vulkan version of the game. Stay tuned to NVIDIA social channels for updates on the public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS ROG SWIFT 360Hz PG259QNR Launches With NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer Support\nTo help competitive gamers measure and optimize end to end system latency, we created the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer.

Autonomy, however, is transforming much more than personal transportation.\nAutonomous trucks are commercial vehicles that use AI to automate everything from shipping yard operations to long-haul deliveries. Due to industry pressures from rising delivery demand and driver shortages, as well as straightforward operational domains such as highways, these intelligent trucks may be the first autonomous vehicles to hit public roads at scale.\nThis technology uses long-range, high-resolution sensors, a range of deep neural networks and high-performance, energy-efficient compute to improve safety and efficiency for everyday logistics.\nWith the rise of e-commerce and next-day delivery, trucking plays an increasingly vital role in moving the world forward. Trucks transport more than 70 percent of all freight in the U.S. Experts estimate that most essential businesses, such as grocery stores and gas stations, would run out of supplies within days without these vehicles.\nThese trends come as driver shortages accelerate. The American Trucking Association reports the industry has struggled with driver supply over the past 15 years. It estimates the industry could be in need of 160,000 drivers by 2028 if trends continue. Additionally, limits on the amount of hours drivers can consecutively work restricts operation.\nAutonomous driving can help ease the strain of trucking demand, as well as increase efficiency, by operating around the clock with lower requirements for human labor. In fact, a recent pilot run by self-driving trucking startup TuSimple and the U.S. Postal Service showed that autonomous trucks repeatedly arrived ahead of schedule on hub-to-hub routes.\n\nAnd with hub-to-hub autonomous trucks constrained to fenced-in areas or highways, most autonomous trucks don\u2019t have to deal with the challenges of urban traffic and neighborhood driving, freeing up roadblocks to widespread deployment.\nThis groundbreaking development is possible in part due to centralized, high-performance compute such as the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. With the capability to process the redundant and diverse deep neural networks necessary to operate without human supervision, these vehicles are poised to revolutionize delivery and logistics in the years to come.\nScalable Solutions for the Long Haul\nAutonomous driving is a scalable technology. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines it in categories that include assisted driving where the driver is still in control (level 2) as well as full self-driving, where no human supervision is required (level 4/5). AI compute must also be able to scale with the capabilities of self-driving software.\nIn addition, the system must be able to handle the harsh environments of trucking. The average truck driver travels 100,000 miles a year, compared with the average motorist, who drives about 13,500 miles a year.\nNVIDIA DRIVE is the only solution that easily scales from level 2 AI-assisted driving to fully autonomous operation while being designed to withstand the wear and tear of long-haul trucking.\nThis versatility and durability is already in development today. Companies such as Locomation are leveraging the compute platform for platooning pilots, where one driver operates a lead truck while a fully autonomous follower truck drives in tandem. Truck manufacturer FAW and startup PlusAI are jointly developing a large-scale autonomous trucking fleet. TuSimple uses NVIDIA DRIVE in its fleet.\n\nOn the Open Road\nBeyond improving current trucking practices, autonomous driving technology is opening up entirely new possibilities for the industry.\nSelf-driving truck startup Einride is developing cab-less vehicles for a variety of trucking applications. It recently announced the next generation of its Pod trucks, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin. These futuristic electric haulers will be able to scale from closed-facility operation to fully autonomous driving on backroads and highways.\n\nWith high-performance, energy-efficient AI compute at the core, autonomous trucks will push the limits of what\u2019s possible in delivery and logistics, transforming industries around the world.\nLearn more about autonomous driving on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Some of the biggest blockbuster games and Hollywood films have used 3ds Max as the foundation of visual effects.\nA plugin allows professionals to use this powerful tool inside Omniverse and enhance their workflows and pipelines by seamlessly integrating with a multitude of other popular content creation applications.\nThe Omniverse platform, now in open beta, enables creators, engineers, artists and designers to virtually collaborate and work between a range of industry software applications. Teams can open, edit and sync with any application through Omniverse Connectors, plugins to third-party content creation applications.\nThe Omniverse 3ds Max Connector delivers a robust toolkit for live-syncing and sending model data to Omniverse Nucleus, a module that enables teams to collaborate from any location.\nProfessionals can use the Connector to design complex models and render immense scenes in 3ds Max while leveraging the multi-GPU scalability of Omniverse RTX Renderer. And with applications such as Omniverse View for architects and Omniverse Create for designers, users can interactively design photorealistic images and scenes in 3ds Max in real time.\n\nExplore Omniverse with Various 3D Models and Assets\nProfessionals can access their favorite apps through Omniverse Connectors and start creating designs by exporting assets, or using models and scenes available in the platform.\nTurboSquid, the 3D industry leader recently acquired by Shutterstock, hosts a key marketplace of over a million 3D models that enables unified 3D workflows. For the recent Omniverse open beta launch, TurboSquid announced a marketplace of thousands of USD-based models that are ready to use with NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\u201cWe love anything that makes 3D more accessible to everyone,\u201d said Matt Wisdom, vice president of 3D Strategy for Shutterstock. \u201cThe possibilities of standardization developing around USD formats are really exciting to see and Omniverse is a great step in that direction.\u201d\n\nEvermotion, one of the largest computer graphics resource and 3D education sites, is also providing models and architectural scenes that can be accessed in Omniverse. With the 3ds Max Connector with V-Ray export, users can take assets from Evermotion\u2019s vast library and export them to Omniverse with USD and MDL materials.\n\u201cWe are glad to share one of our architectural visualization scenes with users of NVIDIA Omniverse and we are sure that this tool will be helpful to streamline the complicated process of creating high-quality 3D content,\u201d said Michal Franczak, editor at Evermotion.\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse now has Autodesk Maya, Revit and 3ds Max Connectors, with MotionBuilder coming soon.\nLearn more about Omniverse and download the open beta today.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Previously, the company encouraged GPU specification transparency from its partners, but it is now actively enforcing it.Where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080The best PC games of 2021PLUS: Cyberpunk 2077 hotfix makes mods safe \u2014 these are the best ones\u201cWe\u2019re requiring OEMs to update their product pages to the Max-Q technology features for each GeForce laptop, as well as clocks and power \u2014 which communicates the expected GPU performance in that system,\u201d explained an Nvidia spokesperson, speaking to The Verge.\u00a0This is quite an important change, because GPU clock speed makes a huge difference when it comes to frame rate, and not all RTX 30s are born equal. An RTX 3070 with a 115W TGP could easily outperform a 3080 limited to 80W, but potential buyers could previously have been none the wiser.\u00a0While some would argue this development is long overdue, the timing is especially important, as Nvidia has recently amended the way it applies Max-Q labels to its mobile GPUs. Previously, the branding would indicate more power efficient and weaker units aimed at thinner and lighter laptops, but Nvidia has adjusted this, telling our sister site Tom\u2019s Hardware that it now represents \u201ca holistic set of platform technologies and design approach to building powerful and thin laptops.\u201dIn other words, the Max-Q brand indicates the presence of efficiency friendly features like Whisper Mode 2, Dynamic Boost 2 and Advanced Optimus rather than necessarily suggesting light performance.Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.A spot check reveals that not all manufacturers have updated their listings at the time of writing, but both Asus and Gigabyte have begun to adopt the new instructions with updated listings on their RTX 30 models.

Literally.\nColorado State University researchers Jason Stock and Tom Cavey have published a paper on an AI system to recognize and reward dogs for responding to commands.\nThe graduate students in computer science trained image classification networks to determine whether a dog is sitting, standing or lying. If a dog responds to a command by adopting the correct posture, the machine dispenses it a treat.\nThe duo relied on the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform for real-time trick recognition and treats.\nStock and Cavey see their prototype system as a dog trainer\u2019s aid \u2014 it handles the treats \u2014 or a way to school dogs on better behavior at home.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated the potential for a future product to come out of this,\u201d Stock said\nFetching Dog Training Data\nThe researchers needed to fetch dog images that exhibited the three postures. They found the Stanford Dogs datasets had more than 20,000 at many positions and image sizes, requiring preprocessing. They wrote a program to help quickly label them.\nTo refine the model, they applied features of dogs from ImageNet to enable transfer learning. Next, they applied post-training and optimization techniques to boost the speed and reduce model size.\nFor optimizations, they tapped into NVIDIA\u2019s Jetpack SDK on Jetson, offering an easy way to get it up and running quickly and to access the TensorRT and cuDNN libraries, Stock said. NVIDIA TensorRT optimization libraries offered \u201csignificant improvements in speed,\u201d he added.\nTapping into the university\u2019s computing system, Stock trained the model overnight on two 24GB NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs.\n\u201cThe RTX GPU is a beast \u2014 with 24GB of VRAM, the entire dataset can be loaded into memory,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes the entire process way faster.\u201d\nDeployed Models on Henry\nThe researchers tested their models on Henry, Cavey\u2019s Australian Shepherd.\nThey achieved model accuracy in tests of up to 92 percent and an ability to make split-second inference at nearly 40 frames per second.\n\nPowered by the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, the system makes real-time decisions on dog behaviors and reinforces positive actions with a treat, transmitting a signal to a servo motor to release a reward.\n\u201cWe looked at Raspberry Pi and Coral but neither was adequate, and the choice was obvious for us to use Jetson Nano,\u201d said Cavey.\nBiting into Explainable AI\u00a0\nExplainable AI helps provide transparency about the makeup of neural networks. It\u2019s becoming more common in the financial services industry to understand fintech models. Stock and Cavey included model interpretation in their paper to provide explainable AI for the pet industry.\nThey do this with images of the videos that show the posture analysis. One set of images relies on GradCAM \u2014 a common technique to display where a convolutional neural network model is focused. Another set of images explains the model by tapping into Integrated Gradients, which helps analyze pixels.\nThe researchers said it was important to create a trustworthy and ethical component of the AI system for trainers and general users. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way to explain your methodology should it come into question.\n\u201cWe can explain what our model is doing, and that might be helpful to certain stakeholders \u2014 otherwise how can you back up what your model is really learning?\u201d said Cavey.\nThe NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute offers courses in computer vision and the Jetson Nano.\n\n\nCategories: Research | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Jetson | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By making mining-specific silicon and nerfing the upcoming RTX 3060 graphics card's ability to mine efficiently, the company hopes to quell criticism that it caters only to the crypto crowd. \nThe crypto craze is having a big impact on the availability of graphics cards, to the point where miners are snapping up laptops equipped with Nvidia's RTX Ampere GPUs to support their ever-growing operations. Some are even actively trying to tick off the gaming community by bragging about having things like mobile mining farms in the trunk of their expensive sports cars, RGB and all.\nGPU manufacturers AMD and Nvidia are usually quick to respond to this type of demand, but the situation this time around is vastly different to what we saw a few years ago. Emerging trends like working and studying from home, as well as people looking to entertain themselves during lockdowns have put additional pressure on the tech industry's supply chain, leading to a lot of scalping and higher prices for computer hardware.\nGamers are understandably upset about it, but cryptocurrency mining has helped some businesses that have been affected by the pandemic to stay afloat. On the other hand, Nvidia and AMD made huge profits riding the mining waves, so they haven't felt the need to do much about it. And board partners like Zotac celebrating the issue only adds insult to injury.\n\nNvidia's new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor\nThat changes today, as Nvidia announced it will take two steps to ensure that both miners and gamers can get what they want, or so they claim. The company will essentially nerf the upcoming GeForce RTX 3060 in terms of hash rate for popular mining algorithms, in the hopes that it will become less attractive for miners and in turn put more cards \"in the hands of gamers.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n Federal agents confirm LastPass breach linked to massive cryptocurrency heists \n\n\n\nAccording to Nvidia, drivers will be able to detect when, say, an Ethereum mining algorithm is running and throttle the card to lower the mining efficiency to 50 percent. These performance restrictions will be applied to both Windows and Linux drivers, which means that even using custom Linux distributions like NiceHash OS or Hive OS won't work to restore full compute capabilities for mining purposes.\nThe second announcement is the Nvidia Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, which is not an entirely new idea. Some of Nvidia's board partners have sold mining-specific graphics cards in the past, and those were essentially the same as their consumer counterparts, save for the absence of video outputs and using a different driver.\n\nNvidia says CMP HX products will feature silicon that has no video outputs and is optimized for mining efficiency. The cards will be available from AIB partners in four configurations ranging from 6 GB to 10 GB of VRAM and can achieve up to 86 MH per second in Ethereum mining algorithms. Power consumption ranges from 120 watts for 26 MH per second to 320 watts for 86 MH per second. Of course, miners are able to get significantly better numbers with tuning of individual cards, but that takes additional time and effort.\nAt this point, there is no way to predict if Nvidia's strategy will be advantageous for consumers.\nThe RTX 3060 is likely to be Nvidia's top-selling RTX 3000 series graphics card, so limiting its mining appeal is a welcome move, even if it's a software lock that can be circumvented in time. And this doesn't solve the problem for people interesting in buying higher-end Ampere graphics cards.\nReleasing mining-specific cards will likely reduce demand for consumer versions, but will also produce a large amount of e-waste when mining is no longer be profitable on them. But the real question is whether miners will bother buying them when gaming graphics cards can be resold to recoup some of the investment money once they can no longer turn a profit.\n\n\n\n\n 45 comments\n \n363 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Some of Arm's biggest customers hate the idea of Nvidia gatekeeping the tech through an acquisition, so they're urging regulators to take a careful look at the potential antitrust implications. \nWhen Nvidia announced it was buying Arm for a whopping $40 billion, it understandably shocked a number of tech giants, as it's bound to change the semiconductor landscape as we know it and extend Arm's influence beyond smartphones and the Internet of Things. Even the company's co-founder, Hermann Hauser, believes it to be a bad idea, since Arm will most likely be unable to retain its neutrality as most of its licensees are competitors of Nvidia.\nNvidia told regulators in the UK, US, EU, and China that it is committed to maintaining Arm's open-licensing model and customer neutrality, but many of the companies that depend on that model aren't convinced. This includes Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Google, who have expressed their concerns to government authorities overseeing the acquisition. And others like Apple, Samsung, Intel, AMD, Amazon, NXP, MediaTek, and Huawei are also dependent on access to Arm's chip designs and software, which could get more expensive under Nvidia ownership.\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, Qualcomm is the most adamant to see the acquisition blocked by regulators, as it believes it could lead to Nvidia gatekeeping important parts of Arm's intellectual property.\nFor years, Arm has been described as an \"enabler of competition\" thanks to its business model, which is unique in the hardware industry. The company's customers \u2013 both big and small \u2013 create a feedback loop that leads to continuous improvements of its chip designs and a healthy ecosystem of both standard and custom processors for a variety of applications.\nTheoretically, Nvidia plans to build on that open-licensing model and add some of its own intellectual property and research and development capabilities into the mix. But more importantly, Nvidia is eyeing the \"combined company's target addressable market,\" which it estimates at $250 billion by 2023. Essentially, it wants to dominate in pretty much every area of computing \u2013 consumer, enterprise, and industrial. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Arm wants to build its own chips, so it may be poaching from chip-making clients \n\n\n\n Apple and Google browser policies are \"holding back\" browser innovation, UK probe says \n\n\n\n\nThe impact to Arm's 530 licensees could be huge, although Nvidia insists it would only help them grow their businesses. In its latest quarterly report, Arm revealed that its designs were materializing into around 842 chips per second by the end of last year, which should offer some perspective on the scale of its success. Regulators will need to go through a lengthy review process to ensure the acquisition won't affect competition, and opposition from several large tech companies spells trouble for Nvidia's ability to close the deal.\nIn the end, tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and AMD are currently developing custom\u00a0silicon based on Arm designs, and they don't want to see a repeat of the x86 situation where the market is closed to new entrants. This is even more important for startups, which are using free access to 75 percent of Arm's chip portfolio to spearhead hardware innovation.\n\n\n\n\n 47 comments\n \n441 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Since the assumption is you're building a decent spec gaming PC, basically any motherboard you pick will be fine.There's only one thing of note. The GTX 1660Ti will use a single PCIe 3.0 slot at x8 or x16 depending on your system (the longer slots if you're wondering). Even the tiny mATX motherboards will accept a GTX 1660 Ti and most pre-built gaming PCs from the last few years should be good to take one as an upgrade.Pick one of the best motherboards for your build and your budget. Check the specs and features against other requirements you're looking for rather than the graphics card.AMD or Intel is fineIt also doesn't matter whether you use an AMD or Intel motherboard when it comes to running a GTX 1660 Ti. If you were ever concerned about compatibility with AMD processor like the Ryzen 7 2700X, don't be.We have some recommendations listed below, whether you have an Intel or AMD build.

Prices are from $500 to $700.\nNvidia also offers self-paced online certification courses, which cost significantly less at $30 to $90 a course.\nThe GPU maker and AI software giant is not the only technology vendor that offers online training courses. Google, AWS and Microsoft, for example, offer a variety of certification courses, as do many medium-sized AI companies and startups.\nCompared to the scale and impact of AI on society, however, there is a scarcity of AI courses, said Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis.\n\n\n\n   The biggest gap at present is in teaching nontechnical businesspeople [about AI].\n  \n\nAlan Pelz-SharpeFounder and principal analyst, Deep Analysis\n  \n\n\n\n\"The biggest gap at present is in teaching nontechnical businesspeople the uses, challenges and opportunities for AI in the enterprise,\" he said. \"Courses that teach the use and deployment of AI amid the complexity of legacy IT.\"\nOften, AI workshops and courses offered by a technology vendor focus on how to use that vendor's products, without straying too far off that path.\nMeanwhile, courses that delve into general concepts of AI often do so through a vendor-esque lens. Microsoft's AI Business School, for example, offers self-taught courses on topics such as how to scale AI or deploy responsible AI, but the course materials often reference Microsoft culture and products.\nThe courses are a way for vendors to get potential customers interested in their products. Users, meanwhile, get free or relatively inexpensive AI education.\nComparatively few higher-education institutions offer practical courses on AI, although that is changing, with more colleges and universities providing AI education options.\nEven so, those vendor programs and college courses, which are often theoretical, are still not enough to educate the global workforce, Pelz-Sharpe noted.\nNvidia opening its AI workshops to the general public is positive, Pelz-Sharpe said, but ultimately, \"it's a drop in the ocean when one thinks of the broader global need.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Resources\n\n\nAI business strategies for successful transformation\n\u2013Video\n\n\nRedesigning Productivity in the Age of Cognitive Acceleration\n\u2013Replay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on AI business strategies\n\n\n\nAdobe releases generative AI contract management tool\n\n\n\n\nBy: Don\u00a0Fluckinger\n\n\n\n\nBiden's AI diffusion rule met with heavy backlash\n\n\n\n\nBy: Makenzie\u00a0Holland\n\n\n\n\nExplaining an AI bubble burst and what it could mean\n\n\n\n\nBy: Sean\u00a0Kerner\n\n\n\n\nBox AI adds Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service integration\n\n\n\n\nBy: Don\u00a0Fluckinger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nThe Future of Private AI: How Industries Take Advantage of AI\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\nPrivate AI Demystified\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nMicrosoft India AI workshops to upskill government ...\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nNvidia, Arm deal creates AI, chip powerhouse\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\nNvidia acquisition of Arm faces industry, regulatory ...\n\u2013 Search Enterprise AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Management\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tERP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Business Analytics\n\n\n\n\nData preparation in machine learning: 4 key steps\nData preparation for ML is key to accurate model results.

In both cases, ASUS has a great motherboard for your gaming PC.For Intel builds: ROG Strix Z390-E Gaming ($258)For Ryzen Builds: ROG Strix X470-F Gaming ($187)The GPU: Gigabyte GTX 1080 Ti (Factory Refurb) ($838)It doesn't really matter which motherboard you chooseThe GTX 1080 Ti is one of the best graphics cards on the market, but it doesn't require any magic hardware to run. Since the assumption is you're building a pretty high-end PC if you want a GTX 1080 Ti, basically any motherboard you pick will be fine.The GTX 1080 Ti requires a single PCIe 3.0 slot at x8 or x16 depending on your system (the longer slots if you're wondering). There will be exceptions, such as super budget or very old motherboards, but even if you're running a pre-built gaming PC you should be OK. Likewise, even the tiny mATX motherboards will accept a GTX 1080 Ti.Instead, pick one of the best motherboards for your build and your budget. Check the specs and features against other requirements you're looking for rather than the graphics card.AMD or Intel is fineIt also doesn't matter whether you use an AMD or Intel motherboard when it comes to running a GTX 1080 Ti. If you were ever concerned about compatibility with AMD processors, don't be.If you are using an AMD processor in your build, it's important to remember that unless you have the APU variant (with Radeon Vega integrated graphics), you'll always have to connect your monitor to the graphics card.Check your power supply is big enoughWith a powerful GPU comes a higher power requirement. The GTX 1080 Ti is also not as power hungry as you may expect, but nevertheless, the power supply still needs to be big enough and it's more of a concern that your choice of motherboard.The GTX 1080 Ti has a 250W TDP and NVIDIA recommends a minimum 650W power supply in your system. Of course, you need to factor in whatever else you're using, but something like the EVGA Supernova 750 P2 would be your best bet.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 2080 is a better buyNVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti (Image credit: Windows Central)Unfortunately, if you're considering a GTX 1080 Ti right now for a new PC build, it's hard to recommend. Initially, prices fell when NVIDIA debuted its new RTX GPUs, but that has since ended and now prices are a lot higher than anyone should be comfortable paying.For less money in almost every case, you can get the newer, Turing-based RTX 2080 for over $150 less than even a refurbished GTX 1080 Ti. Motherboard compatibility is the same, and it has a lower TDP slightly than the GTX 1080 Ti at 215W. So it's more powerful and more efficient.\n\n\n\nOur pick\nASUS Strix Z390-E Gaming\n\n\n$258 at Amazon\nGreat value and a solid baseThe ASUS ROG Strix Z370-F Gaming by ASUS isn't the most expensive board out there, but it comes packing some killer features for system builders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor AMD\nROG Strix X470-F Gaming\n\n\n$187 at Amazon\nOne of the best motherboards for RyzenASUS has AMD system builders covered too with the most excellent X470-F gaming which is feature packed and very well priced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you must\nGigabyte GTX 1080 Ti (Factory Refurbished)\n\n\n$838 at Amazon\nThe GTX 1080 Ti was the king of NVIDIA's lineup in a pre-RTX world.

The mainstream(ish) video card, previously revealed at CES 2021 with a late February release date, has now been locked in for a launch on February 25th, with prices starting at $329.\nAs a quick recap, the RTX 3060 is the next card down in NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere architecture consumer video card stack. Using the new GA106 GPU \u2013 which is already shipping in RTX 3060 laptops \u2013 the RTX 3060 follows the traditional price/performance cadence for video card launches, with NVIDIA releasing a cheaper and lower performing video card for the mainstream-enthusiast video card market. NVIDIA\u2019s 60-tier cards have long been the company\u2019s workhorse parts for 1080p gaming \u2013 as well as some of their highest-volume parts in North America \u2013 and the RTX 3060 is expected to fill the same role within the Ampere/30-series family.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3060\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 2060\nGTX 1060\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3584\n4864\n1920\n1280\n\n\nROPs\n64?\n80\n48\n48\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.78GHz\n1.665GHz\n1.68GHz\n1.709GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14Gbps?

Including the fact that it offers 28 SMs (3584 CUDA cores), and 12GB of GDDR6 running on a 192-bit memory bus. As with previous 60-tier cards, the non-power-of-two memory bus means that NVIDIA is shipping with a somewhat odd amount of memory, in this case 12GB, which is actually more than what comes on even the RTX 3080. However with the only other option being an anemic-for-2021 6GB, NVIDIA is opting to make sure that the card isn\u2019t for want of VRAM capacity.\nMeanwhile, for better or worse the RTX 3060 is all-but-guaranteed to fly off of shelves quickly. With every video card more powerful than a GTX 1050 Ti seemingly getting shanghaied into mining Ethereum, desperate gamers will be fighting with hungry miners for supplies. Even with the 192-bit memory bus, I would be shocked if the RTX 3060 wasn\u2019t profitable, especially with Ethereum reaching record highs. So for anyone thinking of grabbing the card, best be prepared to camp out at your favorite retailer or e-tailer on that Thursday morning.\nOn a final note, unlike the other RTX 30 series cards launched to date, NVIDIA will not be producing any Founders Edition cards for the RTX 3060 series. So all of the cards released will be AIB cards with their own respective designs. And, if tradition holds, don't be surprised if we see the AIBs outfit their cards with premium features and raise their prices accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n73 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\ncommenter001 - Friday, February 12, 2021 - link\nannnnnnnnd it's sold out\n\n\n\nAchaios - Friday, February 12, 2021 - link\nOut Of Stock.\n\n\n\nbigboxes - Tuesday, February 23, 2021 - link\nannnnnnnnd it's selling for twice it's MSRP!\n\n\n\nraywin - Friday, February 12, 2021 - link\nis this another Fictional Edition, or are they going to make enough to meet demand? Not that I am bitter...\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Saturday, February 13, 2021 - link\nThis is one of those rare cases where the answer to a \"this or that\" question is 'no'. No, it's not a Fictional Edition. No, they won't make enough to meet demand.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Monday, February 15, 2021 - link\nThis one's hardly worth the money for gamers anyway. They're really pushing their creative lie about \"doubling\" CUDA cores and FP32 FLOPS to cover for the fact that this will have very little advantage over the preceding generation in games, because it can't render at resolutions high enough to benefit substantially from that dynamic reassignment of INT32 resources to FP32. I'll be surprised if this substantially outperforms the 2060 Super at 1080p.In four generations, Nvidia have gone from having their third-rank card be a price/performance bargain as was traditional (GTX 970), to having their succeeding fourth-rank card be *substantially* more powerful than that for less money (GTX 1060), to charging third-rank video card prices for their fifth-rank card and for meagre performance increases. I'm not going to reward that with a purchase.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Tuesday, February 16, 2021 - link\nThere's no lie, there's just an architecture change, and it wasn't done for marketing purposes. Enthusiasts look at games benchmarks to see how fast a card is, not the number of CUDA cores. And non-enthusiasts are not going to look at CUDA core counts, either. I imagine they look at the product number (3060 vs 3070). Of course it's foing to substantially outperform the 2060 SUPER.Firstly, with the 970 you are referencing a nadir in pricing. You are also referencing a card that had 3.5 GB of fast memory and .5 GB of slower memory to cut costs. But, that being said, GPU average selling prices, in terms of what customers are looking to pay, have been steadily climbing over the past 20 years. NVIDIA's rejiggering of their numbering schemes with respect to die sizes simply reflects that evolution of the market. You should probably buy the card that suits your value proposition. \"Not rewarding\" a company going about its business is an irrational thing. The prices that are charges are the prices of the market. NVIDIA doesn't set them. And if NVIDIA really were charging \"third-rank video card prices for their fifth-rank card\" their gross margins would be colossal now compared to back then, and that just isn't the case. The margins are pretty much the same as they were back then. It's the naming scheme that has changed, not the price being charged for the underlying hardware. In other words, a 3060 is a lot more expensive to make than a 960 or 1060. These are facts. You might not like the facts but there they are. Otherwise NVIDIA's gaming gross margins would be absolutely skyrocketing, and they are not.\n\n\n\nbrucethemoose - Friday, February 12, 2021 - link\nParts of the (non-cryptocurrency) compute crowd will be willing to shell out for this card too. 12GB of VRAM for under $500 is a bargain, especially with RTX/tensor cores and a nice transcoding block.\n\n\n\nsonny73n - Friday, February 12, 2021 - link\nMidrange cards over $300?

With 10x the ray tracing performance of the GeForce GTX 1060, and double the rasterized performance, the new GeForce RTX 3060 offers previous-gen gamers a massive upgrade that\u2019ll get them playing the latest and greatest games with fast frame rates, high fidelity graphics, and game-changing features like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 has the power to dazzle you with immersive ray-traced effects in Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Watch Dogs: Legion, and many other titles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe venerable GeForce GTX 1060 is the most popular graphics card on Steam, having offered users years of high quality 1080p gaming. Now, however, it\u2019s starting to show its age as the production values of the latest and greatest games continue to improve, demanding more and more from your GPU.\nFor example, gamers were playing Watch Dogs 2 with high settings at 60 frames per second on the GeForce GTX 1060, but with Watch Dogs: Legion, released last October, they only get 24 frames per second. And an even bigger change is underway: turn ray tracing on and these games become unplayable on the GeForce GTX 1060. Furthermore, the GeForce GTX 1060 lacks the latest enhancements and features of the newest GPUs; features that can improve your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the GeForce RTX 3060, which brings the power of Ampere, our 2nd Generation RTX architecture, to every gamer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the GeForce RTX 3060, which brings the power of Ampere, our 2nd Generation RTX architecture, to every gamer.

It was even announced recently that these shortages could have had an impact on Nvidia's\u00a0RTX 3080Ti range. However, it appears as though the hardware company has a solution that could make a lot of people happy. \nOne of the reasons behind low supplies of the RTX cards may be down to people purchasing them in bulk in order to set up GPU farms for mining cryptocurrency. To solve this, Nvidia has announced that it will be launching a new range of graphics cards that will be used just for mining. These GPUs, according to a report, will operate at lower voltages and have no video output whatsoever. This means the new range will be useless as actual video cards, and PC gamers need not give them a second glance, but it also means miners can lay off the standard GPU choices.\nRELATED: Programmer Can't Remember Password for Hard Drive That Has $240 Million Worth of Bitcoin\nOn top of this, Nvidia says it will also be releasing GPU drivers that\u00a0will curb the potential for its RTX cards to be used for mining purposes. These drivers are said to be launched just ahead of the launch of its midrange RTX 3060 cards, which are coming at the end of this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mining GPUs will be sold by authorized partners, not too dissimilar to the Quadro range. Nvidia has been on the lips of many PC gamers and hardware enthusiasts, not only because of the RTX shortages, but also because of controversies over the allegations that its 3080Ti cards had been downgraded. That aside, dedicating a range of cards for mining means potential customers will be split down the middle, with miners going to one side and gamers remaining on the other. It could be the answer users have been waiting for.\nSome may be wondering why it's taken the company so long to think of this as a solution, especially as graphics cards have long been used for cryptocurrency mining. Even gamers have utilized them for making money on the side. However, the low supplies of Nvidia's newest RTX series is likely the reason behind the new cards. With so many stores and customers vying for one, Nvidia needed a solution to satisfy both gamers and miners. Hopefully, this will work out, and fans will\u00a0start to see RTX GPUs coming back into stores again soon.\nMORE: Unreal Engine 4 Will Now be Able to Support Nvidia's DLSS Natively\nSource: Gamespot \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWin a PlayStation 5 Pro With Game Rant\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nBy participating in Game Rant's Threads, you can be in the draw to win a PS5 Pro.

Normally, the release of Nvidia\u2019s 60-class graphics cards spark a lot of excitement. They tend to be the best-selling cards of any GeForce generation.\nBut this time around, graphics cards are mired in a months-long shortage driven by a mixture of sky-high demand, logistics woes caused by the pandemic, a cryptocurrency boom that\u2019s driving miners to gobble up GPUs, and some component shortages. It\u2019s a perfect storm, and things are so bad that Nvidia brought the ancient GTX 1050 Ti out of retirement.\n\nSo today\u2019s launch of the GeForce RTX 3060 may be the best bet for gamers hoping to get a graphics card at a sane price\u2014if you\u2019re able to beat the purchasing bots, that is. Here are five key things you need to know about the GeForce RTX 3060 before you buy.\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n1. It goes on sale at noon Eastern time\nThat\u2019s 9 a.m. Pacific. If you\u2019re hoping to snag a GeForce RTX 3060 today, be sure to have the relevant pages loaded at your favorite etailers, and get ready to slam that F5 button.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t manage to strike gold, our guide to finding hard-to-get hardware at a fair price can help you out. It\u2019s written for AMD\u2019s similarly scarce Ryzen 5000 CPUs, but the techniques apply for graphics cards too.\n2. It will probably cost more than $329\n Nvidia\nDon\u2019t expect to pay $329 for an RTX 3060 any time soon unless you get lucky on launch day. Nvidia isn\u2019t shipping a Founders Edition version of this GPU, leaving distribution up to custom cards from partners like EVGA, Asus, MSI, etc. If past launches from this generation are any indication, there will be light supply of a handful of RTX 3060s at MSRP, but most of the stock is likely to be pricier, feature-laden models that go for a significant price premium.\nWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised if retailers jack up prices even further on their end. Graphics cards are hot right now, with even used cards from several years ago selling for more than they cost at launch.\n3. It can\u2019t mine Ethereum well\nOne of the factors limiting graphics card availability might not harm the GeForce RTX 3060. Part of the reason GPUs have been so hard to get is because the price of Ethereum\u2014a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin\u2014has skyrocketed in recent months, and you need consumer graphics cards to \u201cmine\u201d it. Almost every recent graphics card can be profitable mining right now, which isn\u2019t common whatsoever. The RTX 3060 won\u2019t be anywhere near as profitable as its RTX 30-series sibling. Nvidia tweaked the hardware, firmware, and drivers of the RTX 3060 to halve its hashing performance when the graphics card is being used specifically to mine Ethereum, and launched a dedicated \u201cCMP\u201d line of mining graphics cards at the same time. Good.\n\nThe RTX 3060 will still perform full-force on lesser known alternative coins, so it may still be desired by some miners. Keeping Ethereum miners away from this card could mean it becomes more easily available though.\n4. It has all the memory\n Nvidia\nPrevious RTX 30-series cards received criticism for their meager memory allotments. The GeForce RTX 3080 only has 10GB of GDDR6X, while the RTX 3060 Ti and 3070 pack 8GB of GDDR6\u2014a worrisome amount when some games already use over 8GB of memory at 1440p resolution. Then AMD launched its Radeon RX 6800-series graphics cards with an ample 16GB of memory. Suddenly, the GeForce RTX 3060 wields a whopping 12GB of memory across a 192-bit bus. That\u2019s overkill for the 1080p and entry-level 1440p gaming this card is intended for, but a lot better than the paltry 6GB this card was probably going to get before AMD started the memory wars.\nThe RTX 3060 is also the first Nvidia graphics card to support the PCIe Resizable BAR functionality, which first debuted in the Radeon RX 6000-series cards as Smart Access Memory. Resizable BAR grants your CPU full access to your GPU\u2019s memory, which can result in a small performance uplift, though the results vary depending on the game as well as the resolution and visual level you\u2019re playing at.\u00a0\n5. It\u2019s not a big performance upgrade\n\n\n \n\n\nOur review sample of the GeForce RTX 3060 has been stuck in a FedEx sorting facility on the other side of the country for over a week now, but some other reviewers were able to receive theirs, and they say the GPU is a modest upgrade over what came before. Tom\u2019s Hardware and Gamer\u2019s Nexus say the RTX 3060 performs roughly on par with last generation\u2019s $400 RTX 2060 Super for only slightly less money. The gap widens slightly in games that support ray tracing or Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology owing to the RTX 3060\u2019s upgraded technology there, but both reviewers aren\u2019t very excited about this release. \u201cSlightly better performance than an RTX 2060 Super at a moderately lower price is the least we could expect, and that\u2019s pretty much what we got,\u201d Jarred Walton says at Tom\u2019s Hardware.\n\nGamer\u2019s Nexus puts the RTX 3060\u2019s performance on par with the legendary GTX 1080 Ti, so it\u2019s definitely not bad, and will be a great 1080p gaming option. That said, Nvidia is keen to compare the new release against the two-generation-old GTX 1060, but that card cost $250 at launch in 2016\u2014a full $80 less than the retail price that the RTX 3060 isn\u2019t very likely to hit anyway. And the GTX 960 launched at $200. Graphics cards prices have skyrocketed over the last couple of generations and not just when they\u2019re in short supply.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The only requirement is a good internet connection, with the virtual gaming PC handling all of the GPU and CPU requirements.\nGeForce NOW integrates with Steam and works with games users already own, in contrast to other gaming services that provide access to a large catalog of games. Users need to purchase the games they play, with GeForce NOW providing the power to play them.\nGeForce NOW requires a fast internet connection to use, demanding a 25Mb/s download speed at a minimum and a 5GHz wireless router. Nvidia recommends a 50Mb/s connection or higher to account for other potential internet traffic. \nApart from official support for the new Mac mini, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air models powered by Apple silicon, version 2.0.27 of Nvidia's browser client also adds support for Google Chrome, as noted by XDA Developers.\n MacRumors tests NVIDIA GeForce Now on a MacGeForce NOW can also be accessed on iPhone or iPad through Safari by visiting the GeForce NOW website. The service is priced at $24.99 for a 6-month Founders membership subscription. Due to high demand, the $4.99 monthly memberships are currently sold out. \n2/3 Correction: This article originally reported that GeForce NOW offered native support for Macs with Apple silicon, when in fact the support is \"official\" (Nvidia's term) rather than native. Apologies for any misunderstanding.\nTags: Apple Silicon  Guide, GeForce Now, Nvidia[ 53 comments ]Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.Popular StoriesiOS 19 to Have Some of the 'Biggest' Design Changes in iPhone's HistorySunday March 16, 2025 10:35 am PDT by Joe RossignolApple is planning some of the \"biggest iOS and macOS redesigns in its history,\" according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\rIn his Power On newsletter today, Gurman reiterated that iOS 19 will have a visionOS-like design with more transparent interfaces:The new interfaces will adopt the design principles introduced in visionOS, the software for Apple's Vision Pro headset.

It works brilliantly - very rarely any noticeable latency or stutter, even at 4K.Just make sure you have a strong WiFi signal on a clean 5 GHz band without interference from other networks. Using the DFS bands, if your router supports them, is ideal as there is usually zero interference in my experience.Pro tip: Option-click on the WiFi icon in your Mac's menu bar to check detailed WiFi connection info. Ideally you want to see something like \"DFS, 5GHz, 80 Mhz\" under channel, and a high (> 500 Mbps) Tx Rate.Score: 9 Votes (Like | Disagree)-DMN-54 months agoLatency will definitely be an issue, look at Google Stadia.

Mine just updated to v2.0.27 and there isn't a whiff of any arm in sight.The important part from the \"Release Highlights\" explicitly says:\"Did you get a new Mac with the Apple M1 chip over the holidays? Good news: Our latest v2.0.27 macOS app officially supports these Apple products\"Now, where in those two sentences does it say it runs on Arm or Universal binaries? I think people are jumping to conclusions here! In my view, \"supports these Apple products\" is a world away from \"runs on native Arm binaries on these Apple products\"Is anyone from Mac Rumours able to reach out to Nvidia and actually confirm the accuracy of the news story??I mean, it would be nice if we're wrong and our apps are just not updating correctly.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card is out later this week on February 25, but we\u2019ve just caught another glimpse of purported pricing \u2013 and it\u2019s not great news on the affordability front.It seems that RTX 3060 GPUs have arrived with retailers, unsurprisingly at this point, with Coreteks supplying images of a load of different boxed models at an unspecified US retail outlet (presumably one of the big players), all ready to go on sale \u2013 and doubtless be snapped up instantly.Nvidia's RTX 3060 Ti is the best GPU for most peopleCheck out all the\u00a0best PC gamesWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCThe really interesting bit, however, is Coreteks also provides what it believes to be the retail prices for some of these graphics cards. Remembering that the recommended price is $329 (around \u00a3235, AU$420) in the US, the supposed actual prices at this one retailer will be as follows:MSI Gaming X Trio: $514.99MSI Ventus X2: $484.99Zotac Gaming: $499.99Asus Strix: $499.99Asus TUF: $489.99So, as you can see, the cheapest model is $485, a whopping 47% more than Nvidia\u2019s recommended price. Huge pinches of salt are required, naturally, and we certainly can\u2019t take this as anything other than a potential indication of possible price hikes. (Also note that the MSI Ventus X2 presumably refers to the Ventus 2X).That said, sadly this fits with the price-related leakage we\u2019ve seen in Europe as well, with retailers like ProShop hiking the price of the 3060 by 50% or even more.Which as you may realize, leaves us in the situation where the RTX 3060 will actually be more expensive than the recommended price of the 3060 Ti. Or indeed even the real-world price of some Ti models \u2013 you can get an EVGA 3060 Ti for $460 at Best Buy, for example, which is cheaper than any of the above 3060 prices (but naturally, that 3060 Ti is out of stock \u2013 as are all models).Taking stockThe RTX 3060 has 3,584 CUDA cores and a base clock of 1.32GHz, with a boost clock of 1.78GHz. It\u2019ll come with 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM (due to the 192-bit memory interface).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Stock problems have plagued Nvidia\u2019s Ampere graphics card since their launch, and that situation is expected to continue with a stampede for the RTX 3060 \u2013 particularly given that this is the most affordable RTX 3000 card yet released (although as we\u2019ve seen, affordable is a relative term here).Nvidia is doing some firefighting on the pricing front in terms of putting off crypto miners when it comes to the attractiveness of the new graphics card by deliberately halving the hash rate of the RTX 3060 \u2013 as well as launching dedicated mining GPUs.That should mean that these cards are much more likely to end up in the PCs of keen gamers, rather than mining rigs, hopefully easing some of the massive demand issues.That\u2019s a welcome move, of course, but demand is very likely to be huge from gamers alone, so there\u2019ll need to be a seriously fast flowing supply of RTX 3060 models \u2013 which isn\u2019t likely to happen given what Nvidia and retailers have already said about production woes.The danger is that Ampere is already being talked about and viewed as a kind of \u2018lost GPU generation\u2019; a great product that literally isn\u2019t being delivered, or at least not in much quantity. Nvidia needs to ensure that this isn\u2019t how the RTX 3000 range goes down in history, and as we recently discussed, Team Green should go further than its anti-mining measures \u2013 with one possibility being pushing the release of refreshed \u2018Super\u2019 RTX 3000 cards sooner rather than later.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for youVia Wccftech\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Nvidia released the plug-in for Unreal Engine 4.26 at the end of last week, and golly, I'm really hoping this means we'll get loads more DLSS games from now on, as it's a feature that's become pretty much mandatory in all of the big ray tracing games that have come out over the last few months.\n\nDLSS (or Deep-Learning Super Sampling, to give it its full and proper name) has quietly become one of the best things about recent graphics card tech. Ray tracing may be the big shiny obvious one that gets all of the attention whenever a new graphics card comes out, but DLSS is what makes a lot of those ray tracing games actually playable on today's RTX cards, as the performance cost of switching on ray tracing (particularly at higher resolutions) is still prohibitively large in a lot of cases. Indeed, Watch Dogs Legion is pretty much unplayable without it if you want to play in the ray traced streets of London, and The Medium's ray tracing performance also proved a formidable foe even for Nvidia's flagship RTX 3080 GPU.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 | A Big Leap In AI Rendering\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nThis is where DLSS comes in, as it uses AI to help take some of the load off your GPU, allowing it to render fewer pixels while the AI fills in the gaps. It's a bit like Sony's checkerboarding techniques on the PlayStation 4 Pro, but much fancier - and in some cases constructs images that are sharper and higher resolution than they would be at native 4K. I think the most impressive use of it so far has been in Death Stranding, where I literally couldn't tell the difference between its DLSS-ified landscapes and its natively rendered ones. Death Stranding isn't a ray tracing game, but its DLSS support means that even people with an entry-level RTX 2060 card can play the game at 60fps speeds at 4K with maxed out settings. \nIt's impressive stuff, and could open the doors to higher resolution gaming like never before if support for it takes off. Of course, you still need an Nvidia RTX card to take advantage of DLSS, as it's all tied to Nvidia's AI-infused Tensor Cores - which you don't get with AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT cards. AMD are currently working on their own rival DLSS technology for their RX 6000 GPUs - tentatively dubbed FidelityFX Super Resolution - but we still don't know when this is going to arrive, or how its upscaling will compare to Nvidia's DLSS tech.\nOf course, DLSS coming to Unreal Engine is also kind of inevitable. After all, once AMD's FidelityFX Suepr Resolution eventually launches, that, too, will be open source much like the rest of AMD's FidelityFX suite, making it even easier for developers to incorporate it into future games. If Nvidia want their DLSS tech to compete / gain equal amounts of support as AMD's version of it, then they've got to open the floodgates and make it available rather than keeping it under lock and key. Either way, it's a big win for us, and that's really all that matters in the end. Now if only we could actually buy some of those next-gen graphics cards that actually support DLSS, that would be swell...\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

Featuring a GA106 GPU with 3584 CUDA cores and packing 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit, all at $329, the Geforce RTX 3060 promises big improvements over the RTX 20 series cards and brings 60FPS+ ray tracing with DLSS in games like Watch Dogs: Legion, Fortnite RT, Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and others.\n\n\n\nAs detailed and rumored earlier, the Geforce RTX 3060 is actually the first Geforce graphics card based on the Ampere GA106 GPU, made on an 8nm Samsung manufacturing process. It packs 3584 CUDA cores, 28 RT cores, and 112 Tensor cores, as well as 112 TMUs and 48 ROPs. Nvidia has decided to pack 12GB of 15Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit memory interface.\nThe reference clocks for the Geforce RTX 3060 are set at 1.32GHz base and 1.78GHz Boost clocks but so far, most OC versions from various Nvidia AIC partners are pushing the GPU Boost clock up to 1852MHz.\nThe TDP of the RTX 3060 is set at 170W, which means it should need a single 8-pin PCIe power connector (225W), but you can expect some versions to draw power from two 8-pin PCIe power connectors, depending on the OC.\nWith a price of $329, the Geforce RTX 3060 brings hefty improvements compared to the previously available RTX 20 series cards, like the RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070.\nIn terms of performance, you can expect the Geforce RTX 3060 to have no trouble with most games at 1440p resolution without ray tracing, and, according to Nvidia, it can run some games even with raytracing, mostly thanks to DLSS.\n\nNvidia has pretty much detailed the performance as the gap between the RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti is so tight at around 20 or so percent. This does not come as a surprise considering the $70 MSRP price difference, as the RTX 3060 Ti MSRP is set at $399. Of course, AMD's RX 6700 series is just around the corner, and it will be interesting to see how much pressure will these put on Nvidia's lineup.\nIt is left to be seen if Geforce RTX 3060 graphics cards from various Nvidia AIC partners will stick to $329 MSRP (or slightly above for custom OC cards), and if Nvidia's recent limitation to Ethereum crypto-mining will actually leave more RTX 3060 on retail/e-tail shelves.\u00a0\nHere are some of the reviews from usual suspects.\n- Techpowerup.com - Palit GeForce RTX 3060 Dual OC Review, EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Review, Zotac GeForce RTX 3060 AMP White Edition Review, MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Gaming X Trio Review\n- Hothardware.com - GeForce RTX 3060 Review: NVIDIA's Most Affordable Ampere Yet\n- IgorsLab.de - MSI RTX 3060 Gaming X Trio Review\n- Hexus.net - Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Gaming OC 12GB: How good is the latest Ampere?
