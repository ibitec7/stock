And register for the next GPU Technology Conference, running online Nov. 8-11, to hear from healthcare experts using AI and accelerated computing around the globe.\nSt. Jude Researchers Extract Data to Find Cures With NVIDIA DGX\nApart from treating and curing childhood diseases, the team at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital drives the research for developing treatments for pediatric brain tumors.\nMedulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor pediatric diagnosis. With extensive therapy, the average survival rate is between 70 to 75 percent. However, the therapy, while treating cancer, can cause other problems such as long-term neurocognitive deficits.\nIt can also cause short-term brain damage called posterior fossa syndrome, causing problems with language, emotions and movement that can last for weeks or years.\nZhaohua Lu, a biostatistician at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, is using neuroimaging data acquired after radiotherapy to compare the neurocognitive outcomes of patient subgroups with different brain structures affected by the cancer treatment.\nThis research into structural brain changes following medulloblastoma treatment will enable earlier prognosis and more targeted interventions.\n\u201cWe use neural imaging data to distinguish the patients into subgroups according to their MRI measurements. So the MRI measurement at baseline after radiotherapy is a quite promising predictor for the neurocognitive outcomes 36 months later,\u201d said Lu.\nUsing an NVIDIA DGX A100 for the study, Lu and the team developed a 3D convolutional autoencoder to extract features from the neuroimaging data. In a future study, the team will investigate potential confounders like age, gender and treatment intensity to build a more rigorous model that further supports their hypothesis.\nDriving UCSF Research to Clinical Radiology Application With NVIDIA Clara\nAs demand for imaging and radiologist efforts increases, clinical teams can benefit from university research by bringing machine learning into every step of the radiology workflow \u2014 from data acquisition and inference to review and clinical practice.\nOne application of this machine learning model is to detect hip fractures in patients for triage. The classification algorithm uses object detection to identify the left and right hip and classify it as fractured or not fractured, and identify if there is hardware in the hip. When a fracture is detected, the case is accelerated to the top of the list for faster review.\n\u201cWe were once discussing the implementation of inserting an algorithm into a clinical workflow and the physician told us that \u2018if we could do it in two clicks, that would be too slow.\u2019 It needed to be one click for the physicians to get into the data,\u201d said Beck Olson, a data scientist at the UCSF Center for Intelligent Imaging. \u201cThese workflows are razor-thin in terms of efficiency and we need to seamlessly integrate these results.\u201d\nThe UCSF framework routes the data through radiologists\u2019 existing workflows using the NVIDIA Clara Deploy software development kit. This data then goes to the inference model and quantification is performed using custom operators running on the NVIDIA Clara Train SDK.\nThe results are then sent into the open-source XNAT platform for clinical review. Clinicians are able to provide feedback to data scientists, who in turn retrain the machine learning model, which can then be used to update the inference model NVIDIA Clara Deploy is using \u2014 providing a seamless experience for radiologists.\nModality Manufacturer Uses AI to Identify Multiple Diseases From a Single Image\nIn trauma patients, multiple rib fractures can indicate how severe their injuries are \u2014 a key indicator of potential respiratory failure and overall mortality. Radiologists have to dedicate time and effort to catch these injuries before it\u2019s too late.\nShanghai-based United Imaging Intelligence, a member of the NVIDIA Inception acceleration platform, uses AI to make medical devices more efficient, optimize clinical workflows and facilitate advanced research.\n\u201cWe believe the proper way to see AI is making it a \u2018best friend\u2019 for healthcare professionals and empower them to be better in doing their jobs \u2014 but not replace them,\u201d said Terrence Chen, CEO of UII America.\nWith AI, UII\u2019s technologies can analyze and detect multiple diseases from a single image. From a chest CT scan, its uAI Portal can identify rib fractures, lung nodules and lymphadenopathy, as well as other diseases like pneumonia, COVID-19, esophageal cancer, spinal tumors and breast masses and lesions.\nThe uAI technologies run on the NVIDIA JetPack SDK and Jetson embedded modules including Jetson TX2, Jetson Nano and Xavier NX. With NVIDIA TensorRT, efficiency is improved by up to 40 percent and GPU memory requirements are reduced by 50 percent.\nFind these full talk replays from the NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference, and hundreds of other free sessions, at NVIDIA On-Demand.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news here. \n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Peptone, a U.K. company collaborating with NVIDIA on AI-driven protein engineering, will also use Cambridge-1 for its work.\n\u201cThe astounding parallelism embedded in NVIDIA processors allows us to run very dense, very complex simulations,\u201d said Peptone founder and CEO Kamil Tamiola. \u201cWe envision that computers will transform engineering and design in the protein space.\u201d\nThe first NVIDIA supercomputer designed and built for external research access, Cambridge-1 is an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powered by 80 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, BlueField-2 DPUs and NVIDIA HDR InfiniBand networking. Running on 100 percent renewable energy, it\u2019s among the top 50 supercomputers in the world.\nGiving startups access to the powerful system will help the companies bring their healthcare innovations to market faster, accelerating the evolution of drug discovery, genome sequencing and disease research.\nPeptone Pushes the Frontier of Protein Engineering\nPeptone, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for AI and data science startups, aims to change the way protein drugs are engineered using unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques. It plans to use Cambridge-1 to design antibodies that could help treat several inflammatory disorders.\nDeveloped in collaboration with NVIDIA, Peptone\u2019s protein drug discovery engine enables scientists to search for protein variants that would be cost effective to manufacture and offer promising therapeutic properties. It\u2019s already in use for pre-clinical research.\nThe startup combines generative AI models, computational molecular physics and lab experiments to model unstructured proteins. Also called disordered proteins, these molecules lack a stable shape, making it extremely difficult to engineer drug compounds to bind with them.\nUp to half the proteins in the human body are of this shape-shifting variety, including proteins involved in cancer, inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThese proteins are challenging to study experimentally, so Peptone uses AI and complex simulations to study the link between molecular mutations and protein behavior. The company\u2019s researchers require powerful computational resources to help them iterate faster, mutate more of the simulated proteins and build a bigger library of promising drug molecules to test.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t run one massive simulation, we run millions of short simulations. With many of these calculations running concurrently, we need to think about calculating events asynchronously to get the best performance from our system,\u201d said Tamiola. \u201cFor us, the A100 GPU was a breakthrough \u2014 because with the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture, it was so much easier to get this right.\u201d\nTamiola said the latest NVIDIA CUDA libraries helped Peptone reduce latency and \u201cunlock that computational power\u201d by compiling the team\u2019s standard C++ code to CUDA, allowing them to quickly port their algorithms to run on NVIDIA GPUs.\nUK Startups: Apply for Cambridge-1 Access\nApplications from U.K. healthcare startups for access to Cambridge-1 will be accepted here until December 30.\n\nThe selected companies, to be announced in early 2022, will also be invited to meet with the founding partners of the supercomputer \u2014 AstraZeneca, GSK, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London and Oxford Nanopore \u2014 and will gain access to NVIDIA Inception benefits including critical go-to-market support, training and technology.\nLearn more about the capabilities of Cambridge-1, and about the NVIDIA Inception program, which includes more than 500 of the U.K.\u2019s most dynamic AI startups.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news and follow NVIDIA Healthcare on Twitter.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Edgar Su)  \u00b7 Edgar Su / Reuters By Yoolim Lee (Bloomberg) \u2014 Ninja Van, a Southeast Asian logistics company that\u2019s just raised US$578 million from investors including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., plans to hire 200 engineers to beef up its technology ahead of a potential initial public offering in the U.S. within two years. The new hires across Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia would double the startup\u2019s engineering workforce to 400 in the next 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Lai Chang Wen, 34, said in a video interview.  Ninja Van, which is 40% owned by European logistics company GeoPost/DPDgroup, plans to invest in technology and automation to improve its parcel delivery services as Southeast Asia\u2019s e-commerce industry expands rapidly. It plans to allocate the bulk of the funds on Ninja Direct, a relatively new business that allows online sellers in the region to buy products from China and other markets. The service includes customs clearance, delivery and financing, Lai said. \u201cI see so much potential in the Ninja Direct business and so much more room for growth in our core business,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cWe need to execute first, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re too far away. We can push to an IPO\u201d within two years, he said. Seven-year-old Ninja Van is among the biggest Southeast Asian startup employers with 61,000 workers across six countries, including 46,000 who work as truck drivers, warehouse staff and in other operational roles. The company has raised a total of US$974.5 million from investors including Monk\u2019s Hill Ventures, B Capital Group and Zamrud, according to Crunchbase. \u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Now, POCO (via 91mobiles) has concluded its investigation, noting that it is a case of \"customer induced damage\" as there was application of external force. Here are more details.  Fact: 'The device appeared bent and the LCM was crushed'  \"Basis our technical investigation, the device (POCO X3 Pro) appeared bent and the LCM (liquid crystal module) was in a crushed condition which indicates the application of external force.

The handset bears a 6.67-inch Full-HD+ (1080x2400 pixels) IPS LCD screen with an aspect ratio of 20:9, a 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10 support. It is available in three color options.  Fact: It sports a 48MP main camera  The POCO X3 Pro is equipped with a quad rear camera setup comprising a 48MP (f/1.8) primary sensor, an 8MP (f/2.2) ultra-wide lens, a 2MP (f/2.4) macro snapper, and a 2MP (f/2.4) depth sensor. Up front, it has a 20MP (f/2.2) selfie camera.  Internals: It boots MIUI 12.5 based on Android 11  The POCO X3 Pro is powered by a Snapdragon 860 chipset, paired with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. It runs on Android 11-based MIUI 12.5 for POCO and packs a 5,160mAh battery with 33W fast-charging support.

Not surprisingly, shareholders have done quite well for themselves. The stock is up a whopping 1,300%\u00a0in the last five years alone, crushing the performance of the broader market.\nHowever, this chipmaker still has plenty of room to grow its business, especially in the data center space. Here's what investors should know.\nThe leader in accelerated computing\nIn 1999, NVIDIA invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip capable of parallelizing computing-intensive code. In other words, GPUs can handle lots of data very quickly. While these chips were originally created to render ultra-realistic video game graphics, they have since become an important part of data centers.\n\nImage source: NVIDIA.\n\nSpecifically, NVIDIA GPUs have become the gold standard for accelerating workloads like analytics, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. In fact, the company recently set records at the MLPerf benchmarks, a series of tests designed to measure the performance of AI compute platforms. And NVIDIA currently controls 90%\u00a0of the market for supercomputer accelerators.\nData center budgets were still heavily skewed toward central processing units (CPUs) in 2020, with these chips comprising 83% of total spend on processors. But Ark Invest believes that figure will drop to 40%\u00a0over the next decade. In other words, by 2030, GPUs will not only be the dominant data center accelerator, they will also be the dominant processor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's good news for NVIDIA. Management puts its addressable market in the data center business at $100 billion by 2024, but that figure should be even bigger by 2030. And given the company's strong competitive position, NVIDIA is well positioned to capture the lion's share of that sum.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA three-chip company\nNVIDIA has also expanded beyond its trademark GPU. In 2020, it completed its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox, a company that specializes in high-performance networking solutions. Since the merger, NVIDIA has introduced a new chip that incorporates Mellanox technology: the data processing unit (DPU).\nThis chip offloads networking, storage, and security tasks from CPUs, boosting performance and efficiency. More broadly, the Mellanox acquisition makes NVIDIA's compute platform more robust, enabling the company to optimize\u00a0workloads across computing, networking, and storage, which should drive market share gains in the data center.\nMore recently, NVIDIA announced a third chip: the Grace CPU. This processor is slated to launch in 2023, and features energy-efficient ARM cores that pack ten times the performance of today's fastest servers. The Grace CPU will join the GPU and DPU to complete NVIDIA's compute platform, and there's reason to believe it will be a success.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the last two decades, CPUs built on x86 architecture -- think Intel and AMD -- have dominated the data center, and the pair captured 92%\u00a0market share in 2020. But Ark Invest believes that will change over the next 10 years, because ARM CPUs are becoming faster\u00a0and cheaper. To that end, Ark estimates that ARM and RISC-V will hold 71% market share\u00a0by 2030, while x86 chips will drop to 27%.\nAgain, this is good news for NVIDIA. If this trend does indeed play out, investors should expect the Grace CPU -- which is built on ARM cores -- to be a key growth driver.\nThe bottom line\nNVIDIA is now a three-chip company, meaning its product portfolio now addresses a greater portion of data center infrastructure. And in the years ahead, NVIDIA should see strong demand as GPUs become the most prevalent data center processor, and ARM chips become the most prevalent data center CPU.\nThat's why I think NVIDIA will dominate the data center by 2030.\n\n\n\nTrevor Jennewine owns shares of Nvidia.

This time, the price seems to be getting closer and closer to its SRP selling for just $47.76 past its original price!EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 RestockAs of the moment, it is extremely difficult to purchase certain PC parts like GPUs at fair prices. With scalpers buying out stock online and reselling them at higher prices, even owners of second-hand GPUs are now selling the PC part for the original price despite it being used.Although there hasn't been a GPU selling at its original SRP for quite some time now, EVGA is selling closer and closer to the original price of the GPU. This can be seen with the recent EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 restock that was spotted selling for just $376.76, which is just $47.76 past its SRP.Scalper Prices Ending?According to the article by The Verge, the price of the EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 restock is sold at $329. A recent restock was spotted online for the EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 restock selling at $376.76, and so far, this could be the lowest priced high powered RTX 3000 series GPU as of the moment.With other GPUs being sold for sometimes more than twice their original value, the new EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 restock shows an improvement in price despite not being totally back to its SRP. For buyers interested in purchasing a GPU, the best thing to do is to either settle for the closest price to SRP or look for an alternative.GPU Prices Closer to SRPOne alternative to purchasing a GPU as a PC part and building a desktop is to purchase a laptop with a preinstalled high powered GPU. This is one way that buyers can save when purchasing a GPU but it does come with a small downside. For those interested in purchasing a GPU at prices close to SRP, follow restock tracker Twitter accounts to learn more.Laptop GPUs, however, aren't able to massively overclock themselves, meaning it might not bring out the GPU's full performance.

Video gaming revenue jumped a whopping 85% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to $3.06 billion. The segment produced 47% of total revenue last quarter, so it moves the needle in a big way for the company.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nThe good news for Nvidia investors is that the gaming business will continue to power its growth. Its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.98%), is failing to make headway in this multibillion-dollar space, according to the latest market share\u00a0numbers from Jon Peddie Research.\nNvidia crushes AMD once again in graphics cards\nPeddie's research points out that Nvidia's share of the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market stood at 83% in the second quarter of 2021, with AMD holding the rest. That's an improvement over the 81% market share the company held in the first quarter and 80% in the second quarter of 2020. It is also worth noting that it has clawed back substantial market share from AMD, since the latter held nearly\u00a031% of the discrete GPU market in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThere are two reasons Nvidia has been crushing AMD in the graphics card market over the past year. First, it brought a big leap in performance with the Ampere architecture-based RTX 30 series cards that were released a year ago. The new cards pack serious performance gains at aggressive prices, triggering an upgrade cycle that has led to tremendous demand and a supply shortage.\nAmpere is Nvidia's fastest-growing gaming GPU architecture, with sales of cards based on this platform growing at twice the pace of the previous generation Turing cards in the initial months of launch. More important, gamers are paying more money; the average selling prices of the Ampere cards at launch stood at $360, compared to $300 for the Turing cards during their launch.\nNvidia is still struggling to meet the massive demand for the RTX 30 cards. CEO Jensen Huang noted on the August earnings conference call that \"a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year\" is likely. Despite this constraint, the company is doing well to increase its GPU market share.\nThis brings us to the second reason it has gotten a jump on AMD. Huang explained on the August earnings call that the company has and continues to secure \"pretty significant long-term supply commitments.\" This is probably the reason third-party sources note\u00a0that Nvidia has increased the frequency of restocking\u00a0its cards in Europe and the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the chipmaker has taken steps to ensure that its cards find their way to gaming enthusiasts instead of cryptocurrency miners by limiting\u00a0the mining capabilities of popular RTX 30 series cards. On the other hand, AMD's cards have been difficult to secure, and that seems to have contributed to its falling GPU market share.\nAccording to a report by game distribution platform Steam, the flagship RTX 3090 GPU alone has sold more\u00a0units than AMD's entire lineup of RX 6000 series cards. This shows the strength of Nvidia's supply chain, pricing power, and installed base. These factors could help it sustain its impressive gaming growth in the future.\nThe massive market share could drive long-term growth\nIt won't be surprising to see Nvidia continue to hold more than 80% of the discrete GPU market for a long time to come. One of the reasons might be because 80% of the company's installed base of gaming GPU users are yet to upgrade to the Ampere-based cards. As the chipmaker brings more supply into the market to increase the availability of its latest cards, its sales could continue growing at a fast clip.\nAdditionally, Nvidia is expected to launch a new generation of graphics cards next year that could be based on a more advanced manufacturing process, giving gamers another reason to upgrade. All of this could help it dominate the GPU market in the long run. Now, the graphics card market is expected to generate $54 billion in revenue by 2025 as compared to last year's $23 billion, indicating that Nvidia's largest business is built for long-term growth and will help the chipmaker remain a top growth stock to deliver more upside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The slide lists down the proposed ARC Alchemist 'DG2' lineup for 2022 and respectively competitors they will be positioned against. According to the slide, the lineup will include at least four SKUs but there may be more. Also, the slide looks to be a little old since it doesn't mention the ARC branding that Intel just recently introduced for its graphics lineup so internal plans might have changed since then.\nRelated Story ASRock Intel Arc B570 Challenger OC \u201cBattlemage\u201d Graphics Card Review \u2013 10 GB Vs 8 GB RTX 4060 For $80 US Less\n\nIntel's High-End ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($300 - $500 US)\nWith that said, let's talk about the upper echelon of the lineup which will feature Enthusiast ($400 - $499 US) and Performance+ ($300 - $399 US) graphics cards. These Intel ARC Alchemist GPUs will feature the 'SOC1' which could be the internal codename for the Alchemist 512 EU chip. This chip has a TDP range of 175W to 225W. The Enthusiast part will tackle the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 & the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT.\n\nDo note that Intel doesn't plan to launch an 'Enthusiast+' contender in its first-gen ARC lineup as that will be reserved for the next-gen. This means that the top graphics cards from NVIDIA & AMD such as the GeForce RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6800 XT will remain uncontested.\nIntel ARC ACM-G10 vs NVIDIA GA104 & AMD Navi 22 GPUs\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameIntel ARC A770NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameACM-G10NVIDIA GA104AMD Navi 22\n\n\nArchitectureXe-HPGAmpereRDNA 2\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 6nmSamsung 8nmTSMC 7nm\n\n\nDie Size406mm2392mm2335mm2\n\n\nTransistors21.7B17.4B17.2B\n\n\nTransistor Density53.4M Transistors/mm244.4M Transistors/mm251.2M Transistors/mm2\n\n\nFP32 Cores32 Xe Cores48 SM Units40 Compute Units\n\n\nFP32 Units409661442560\n\n\nMax Clock2100 MHz1770 MHz2581 MHz\n\n\nFP32 TFLOPs17.2 TFLOPs21.75 TFLOPs13.21 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Bus256-bit256-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory Capacity16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6\n\n\nLaunchQ3 2022Q2 2021Q1 2021\n\n\n\nIntel's Entry-Level ARC Gaming Graphics Card Lineup ($100 - $200 US)\nMoving on to the lower-end segment, this is one place where Intel may hit AMD and NVIDIA hard considering both GPU manufacturers haven't released a single sub-$300 US desktop graphics card in the market yet. The mainstream segment will feature the 'SOC2' which is the Alchemist 128 EU GPU and will feature a TDP of 75W and up. ARC graphics cards based on this chip will be featured in the 'Mainstream+' ($150 - $199 US) and 'Mainstream' ($100 - $149 US) segment.\n\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA do have the chips to launch in the entry-level segment but they are being pushed to notebooks and laptops first. If launched prior to Q1 2022, then entry-level ARC GPUs will tackle AMD's Navi 24 (RX 6500 Series) and NVIDIA's GA107 GPUs (RTX 3050 Series) though those may end up over $200 US pricing considering where the mainstream cards are currently featured.\nA major lead that Intel could have over the competition, especially NVIDIA since AMD lacks in this department, is AI assistance in supersampling technologies. Intel has already\u00a0showcased an impressive demo of its XeSS technology\u00a0and based on the expected numbers, Intel GPUs could outperform NVIDIA's Tensor Core implementation (DLSS) with its XMX architecture. Intel is also expected to feature a small but useful game cache on its GPUs and will be equipped with higher VRAM capacities of up to 16 GB (GDDR6) across a 256-bit bus interface. This would be twice as much memory as NVIDIA's RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti so they may have to prepare a refresh to counter it.\nWe have seen the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU-based\u00a0discrete graphics card engineering sample leak out\u00a0a few months back along with some rumored performance and pricing figures,\u00a0you can read more on that here. Based on the timeline, the Xe-HPG Alchemist lineup will compete against NVIDIA's Ampere & AMD RDNA 2 GPUs since both companies aren't expected to launch their next-gen parts by the very end of 2022. The Xe-HPG ARC GPUs will be coming to the mobility platform too and will be featured in\u00a0Alder Lake-P notebooks.\nIntel Xe-HPG Based Discrete Alchemist GPU Configurations:\n\n\n\nGPU VariantGraphics Card VariantGPU DieExecution UnitsShading Units (Cores)Memory CapacityMemory SpeedMemory BusTGP\n\n\n\n\nXe-HPG 512EUARC A780?Arc ACM-G10512 EUs4096Up To 32/16 GB GDDR618 / 16 / 14 Gbps256-bit~225W (Desktops)\n120-150W (Laptops)\n\n\nXe-HPG 384EUARC A580?Arc ACM-G10384 EUs3072Up To 12 GB GDDR616 / 14 Gbps192-bit150-200W (Desktops)\n80-120W (Laptops)\n\n\nXe-HPG 256EUARC A550?Arc ACM-G10256 EUs2048Up To 8 GB GDDR616 / 14 Gbps128-bit60-80W (Laptops)\n\n\nXe-HPG 128EUARC A380?Arc ACM-G11128 EUs1024Up To 6 GB GDDR616 / 14 Gbps96-bit~75W (Desktops)\n\n\nXe-HPG 128EUARC A350?Arc ACM-G11128 EUs1024Up To 4 GB GDDR616 / 14 Gbps64-bit35-50W (Laptops)\n\n\nXe-HPG 96EUARC A330?Arc ACM-G1186 EUs768Up To 4 GB GDDR616 / 14 Gbps64-bit~35W (Laptops)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich graphics card do you think will offer the best price/performance in Q1 2022?\n\n\n AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT ($479 US)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 ($499 US)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist Enthusiast ($499 US)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B570 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Tested In Geekbench: Roughly 12% Slower Than Arc B580 For 12% Lower Price\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B580 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Hits Retail, Starting at $249 But Runs Out of Stock Almost Instantly, Restock In Early January\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B580 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Benchmarks Leak: Faster Than RTX 4060 & RX 7600 XT In Vulkan\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Launches Arc B580 12 GB & B570 10 GB \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPUs For $249 & $219, Faster RT Than RTX 4060 & 10% Faster On Average\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n84\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n21\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

If you\u2019re not entirely familiar with the GeForce Now, it\u2019s a service from GPU manufacturer Nvidia that allows users with an account to stream games made available in its library.\nIt\u2019s a service that\u2019s been dogged by controversy over the last couple of years. Initially launching as buy-to-play service, with games available through the platform, it has become a service which offers titles through other providers as well as its own. That means that if you already own a game on Steam or Epic, you can launch it through GFN.\n\nThis functionality is at the core of the issue. A YouTube user called IGHOR created a video to bring an issue with GFN to Nvidia\u2019s attention, after apparently being ignored previously.\nIt\u2019s a little tricky to follow, but the essence is that when GFN loads up, it requests and receives unsecured library information from the platform\u2019s server. The information contains not only all the titles that a normal subscriber can use, but a wide range of over 18,000 items of software, most of which is usually invisible and inaccessible.\nUsing a proxy server, IGHOR was able to load up all of the software into a GFN interface and see precisely what\u2019s inside. Among other things, that included PlayStation exclusives like Gran Turismo 7, Horizon Forbidden West, Ratchet & Clank, and Returnal.\n\n\n\nNaturally this has prompted a rumor that GT7 will be coming to PC, and while it\u2019s certainly a possibility \u2014 Sony has been looking at making PS exclusives available on PC \u2014 it isn\u2019t actually what\u2019s shown here.\nLooking more closely at the data retrieved, we can see that all of the titles listed have no Steam or Epic ID except for those already available or in development for PC.\nHorizon Zero Dawn for example appears in the list several times. The title is available on Steam and is listed with a valid Steam ID, but February\u2019s sequel Horizon Forbidden West only appears without a Steam ID. \nThat also applies to God of War, but with an interesting twist. The original, which is available on PS Now, is also listed with a Steam ID of \u201cTBD\u201d, which would suggest that title is indeed heading to PC. However the upcoming sequel \u2014 God of War Ragnarok \u2014 has no Steam listing. Neither does Gran Turismo 7.\n\nIGHOR\u2019s video makes it pretty clear that the list of games shown is probably a result of data being scraped from other providers\u2019 libraries, rather than any confirmed or future availability through GFN. \nThat includes not only Steam but Epic, GOG, and myriad others, with the PlayStation exclusives simply showing up as a result of being in PlayStation\u2019s storefronts, and on the PS Now service.\nInterestingly, the list also contains Nintendo emulation software and Nintendo titles labelled as \u201cNvidia Confidential\u201d, which suggests that GFN has a private testing environment for Nvidia staff. However none of the PlayStation games show up in this manner, only as titles without description or screenshots.\nWhile we\u2019re not going to rule out a Gran Turismo title heading to PC eventually, this particular leak doesn\u2019t make it any more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tComments (30)\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tL56778\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 15, 2021 at 10:51am EDT \n\n\n\nThe niche PC crowd port begging yet again (yawn).

I believe that not every Simcade players on consoles would able to afford racing wheel so they end up using controller pad instead.\nWhile Sim Racing sounds more associated on PC since it is much more optimized for wheel.\nSimilar that DiRT Rally series appears to be a spin-off of DiRT series.\nDifference:\nDiRT Rally is Rally Sim\nDiRT (Main series) is Simcade Rally (Apart from DiRT 5 and Showdown).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMr Wheel Guy\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 1:21am EDT \n\n\n\nI remembered some games like Nascar Heat 5, I thought this game is supposed to be a sim racer but feels more like simcade because simply Studio 397 wanted to make it accessible for any kind of players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNoobiix007\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 7:16am EDT \n\n\n\nYou\u2019re mixing everything here, Nascar Heat 5 wasn\u2019t at all made in association with Studio 397, that\u2019s the upcoming Nascar 21 Ignition that is, which is going to be way more of a sim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwist3d_Drift3rr\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 7:17am EDT \n\n\n\nNASCAR Heat 5 had nothing to do with Studio 397. That was before S397 even got involved with the physics of the game. The new game coming out however NASCAR \u201921 Ignition has studio 397 making the physics. Heat 5 is full arcade and runs on the atrocious unity engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMr Wheel Guy\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 7:47am EDT \n\n\n\nOh, my bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKazuya720\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 4:57am EDT \n\n\n\n@Mr Wheel Guy: Well I have a whole race cockpit, with seat, wheel, paddles etc. and I only play on consoles! As the huge area to adjust your (what ever) steering wheel is included back than in GT5, GT6, Sport and sure it will be in GT7, I don\u2019t see, why consoles should only have \u201csimcade\u201d, (which sounds like a vilification), while the PC is allowed to get the REAL sim racing (games) ?!\nNo, its not the case! I don\u2019t even see where this comes from, because everyone who plays on PC and (mostly) uses Steam is most likely also a casual gamer who plays with pad and keyboard. The \u201ccore\u201d gamer who wants to experience a racing sim as most imersive playes with a wheel. But not matter on which plattform, PC or console. \nGT is a sim racer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMr Wheel Guy\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 6:46am EDT \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s just my opinion and thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNekoPufferPPP\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 6:47am EDT \n\n\n\nSim racing, i.e. competitive racing where reaction times are key, does work better on PC. Consoles are limited to 60fps, that\u2019s not good enough for minimal input delay. In my experience, for example in PC2, the difference in input delay between 60 and 120 fps is astronomical, plus, the physics work better at a higher framerate, that includes force feedback as well.\nYou can get used to driving at 60fps, but once you try it in double that, you\u2019re not gonna wanna go back to 60, trust me. The difference is roughly 8ms. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but it really is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMr Wheel Guy\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 7:48am EDT \n\n\n\nUnfortunately GT is still considered to be simcade just like Forza Motorsport series.\nThey\u2019re still lower tier compared to the rFactor series though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNekoPufferPPP\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 9:04am EDT \n\n\n\nGT would still benefit from a higher framerate regardless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSkinny McLean\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 6:45pm EDT \n\n\n\n@NekoPufferPPP Only in very badly made games are the physics and FFB systems coupled to the frame-rate. Otherwise it\u2019s handled in separate threads. It sounds like you\u2019re talking about 20-30 year old games from before that was a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTomBrady\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 9:33pm EDT \n\n\n\nPorting games to PC day and date is terrible for games. The biggest reason exclusives are so special and so polished is because they only have to focus on 1 platform. Just making a game cross gen hurts games a huge amount, let alone getting a game running on PC.\nSure, it\u2019s fine if they port games to PC 2 years later but it\u2019s never gonna stay that way. That is why PC ports is the worse thing to happen to PS exclusives\nI don\u2019t want worse games just so Sony can put more money in its pockets in the short term. Eventually it\u2019s gonna bite them in the ass when the quality and dev time of their games gets worse and worse\nEspecailly for a studio like PD that already struggles to release games on time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCodyRoy\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 10:21pm EDT \n\n\n\nThe architecture of the PS5 is almost identical to PC now so porting games isn\u2019t much of a task anymore. PS5 has a Ryzen SOC with RDNA graphics so basically it is a gaming laptop. The port shouldn\u2019t be an issue and would greatly increase the sale of GT. PC already got Forza, hopefully we get GT as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tphillgt2002\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 7:41pm EDT \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t see this costing Sony anything. Their biggest competitor, Microsoft, is running off with consumer trust with cross-platform availability and compatibility. This is something that Sony needs to do. \nAlso, considering the racing game market on PC, if GT7 came out on it, there would be NOTHING as polished as a GT game to compete with it. The only games I can say could compete with it is Forza 8 and Project Cars 3, and we all know that those just are lacking.\nSometimes I don\u2019t feel like messing around with online-lobbies and I just want to get straight into a fleshed out career mode with good AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDan kem\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 1:20am EDT \n\n\n\nThis will be simcade, made for pad users. It will not compete as far as refind ffb and contact patch as assetto Corsa competzione, rfactor 2 or iRacing. When it comes to PC it will be just for some fun, relax on the couch game play. Do not kid yourself if you think this will be anything other then some slap and tickle fun, it will not complete with proper sim racing on PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDan kem\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 at 1:25am EDT \n\n\n\nThis is coming to PS4 also, so I am pretty sure this will feel and play identical to gt sport, which when compare to the aforementioned proper sim titles, gt sport is more then lacking. I really hope it\u2019s a refined Sim, will not hold.my breathe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHuskyGT\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 5:55pm EDT \n\n\n\nThis would be a god-sent gift. I mean, they could just release their first party games on a Sony exclusive launcher. It doesn\u2019t have to be Steam or Epic. This would be my only chance of ever getting back to Gran Turismo. I hope it happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\twarp9engage\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 4:15pm EDT (Edited)\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGiven the dedicated sim-racing community the PC has, Gran Turismo makes more sense to be ported than any other first-party game. I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s not an \u2018if\u2019 but a \u2018when\u2019 it will come.\nGran Turismo is a system seller, but so is Horizon and Uncharted, and that didn\u2019t stop Sony. In fact, I would bet the latter two are probably bigger system sellers than GT, nowadays. I don\u2019t see a racing simulator being the game that makes you splurge 400-500$ on a whole system, in more cases. Buying a PS just for Uncharted or God of War, on the other hand\u2026\nThis leak is nothing definitive, but it is curious that the publisher is \u201cPlaystation Mobile Inc\u201d, which is the one publishing the ports. Also curious is that it\u2019s not just a bunch of placeholders for anything Playstation, just in case, there\u2019s no Bloodborne, no Spider-Man, no Last Of Us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNujaseb\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 5:58pm EDT (Edited)\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nWhy would I buy a 400-500$ system for Uncharted or GoW? They\u2019re both games that once finished are basically one and done, whereas GT could give me hundreds of hours of gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\twarp9engage\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 6:57pm EDT \n\n\n\nBecause GT\u2019s gameplay is only really appealing to racing fans, which tend to be a minority. For most of those others, hundreds of hours of \u201cdriving in circles\u201d would be worthless.\nA lot of these PS experiences, like God of War, are made to be like long, interactive blockbuster movies. Just like people re-watch movies they enjoy, people will replay the stories they enjoy, even if it\u2019s just to try to complete things in a different manner.\nIn sum, Gran Turismo, as big of a franchise as it is, is more niche than the likes of GoW, Uncharted, TLoU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTomBrady\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 9:26pm EDT \n\n\n\nFirst of all, there\u2019s 100\u2019s of \u201cone and done\u201d games. That doesn\u2019t make them any less valuable. Second of all, no games are one and done. Most people replay their favorite games multiple times whether they\u2019re \u201creplayable\u201d or not. \nPlus, $500 is nothing for what the PS5 and Series X offer. Just a mid grade CPU upgrade can cost the same amount and barely offer more performance. I looked into upgrading my PC to play Xbox games at a decent framerate and even if I only upgraded my CPU and got the RAM and MOBO a new CPU would require, it came to $450. Let alone the cost of a modern ray tracing capable GPU, if you can even find one. \nI bought a series X instead and it\u2019s a much better experience than PC anyways. So is PS5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSkinny McLean\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 4:05pm EDT (Edited)\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nI also think the list has been constructed by scraping various online game stores, as Andrew mentioned, so GT7 is probably not coming to Steam or Epic etc. anytime soon (or ever.)\nThere's a write-up by Ighor here: ighor.medium.com/i-unlocked-nvidia-geforce-now-and-stumbled-upon-pirates-dc48a3f8ff7\nIt's quite sensationalist, in my opinion \u2013 he didn't really \"unlock all games,\" because he could only run the games he already owns. It's simply the downloading of a JSON file through a web browser instead of via Nvidia's GFN app we're talking about. And Nvidia's online GraphQL editor (now disabled) is not needed. Feeding that JSON file to the GFN app by setting up a proxy doesn't really add anything at all (as all the info and all the links are in the JSON file,) other than it looks 'cool' in a YouTube video. It does make Nvidia's web developers look like amateurs, of course.\nAnd regarding the alleged piracy, a comment on his page says:\n\"new super mario bros. wii is there because it's on the nvidia shield in china, has nothing to do with dolphin being there,\" so I guess his \"software piracy\" claim is bogus too.\nThere's a list of the non-Steam games (from before Nvidia shortened the JSON file to 1083 entries) here: gist.github.com/xPaw/6a42aafd3c9d19b3ceab2e90b5a37cd2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMisterWaffles\t\t\t\t\n\nSeptember 13, 2021 at 3:26pm EDT \n\n\n\nIf by some miracle GT7 ends up becoming playable on the PC, I wish your graphics cards good luck.

And the university aims to hire 100 AI-focused faculty to meet its goal of educating 30,000 AI-enabled graduates by 2030.\n\u201cUltimately, UF\u2019s effort will help to address the important national problem of how to train the nation\u2019s 21st-century workforce at scale,\u201d Glover said.\nPlugged Into an AI Supercomputer\nPowering UF\u2019s vision is HiPerGator AI, the eighth most powerful supercomputer in the U.S. and 22nd most powerful supercomputer in the world.\nIn January, the university switched on the system that\u2019s supported with separate donations from both UF alumnus and NVIDIA founder Chris Malachowsky and NVIDIA itself.\nBuilt in a matter of weeks thanks to its modular architecture of 148 NVIDIA DGX systems, HiPerGator AI delivers up to 17.20 petaflops of AI power that\u2019s already being applied to tackle tough research problems.\nAn effort called Gatortron is analyzing a billion words in a medical database maintained by the university\u2019s hospital system. It aims to identify patterns that could lead to improved healthcare at lower costs.\nOther projects seek new ways to improve agriculture and address climate change. \u201cAll of these things involve huge amounts of data, and this is where the HiPerGator AI really excels,\u201d Glover said.\nAn AI Hub for Florida\nUF will make the supercomputer available through the state university system, creating an AI hub for others to enhance education and research.\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to see the university recognized for its pioneering initiative,\u201d said Cheryl Martin, a director in NVIDIA\u2019s higher education and research group.\n\u201cWe think UF shows universities around the country a model they can adopt to transform with AI their curriculum and research for the benefit of their local communities,\u201d she said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA DGX | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Do keep in mind that NVIDIA has yet to introduce a SUPER lineup that revolves around its Ampere architecture but there have been several rumors that have hinted at the upcoming lineup.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostThe HP ENVY 34 AIO PC is pretty much what it sounds like, a 34-inch screen with an AIO design that has all the hardware embedded on the backside of the monitor. HP does list down the GeForce RTX 2080 for its ENVY 32 AIO PC and based on what we are able to learn, that specific variant is a Max-Q mobility card. Hence it would make sense that the RTX 3080 SUPER featured on the 34-inch model would also be a Max-Q variant and not a desktop discrete graphics card variant considering that is just too much for AIOs to handle.\n\nNow we have to remember that the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER also exists and this could be an error by HP. Or HP just updated its 34\" model specs and forgot to change the full model naming scheme from 2080 to 3080. OEMs usually make such mistakes and HP has also previously listed down cards such as the GTX 1180 which it later confirmed to be a placeholder so this might very well be the case here too.\nIf this does turn out to be true, then the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER might offer a refreshed Ampere SKU with higher clocks, possibly more VRAM, and slight power tweaks. With that said, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 SUPER Refresh is expected to hit streets on both mobile and PC desktops platforms by January 2022 (CES) so expect more information by then.\nNews Source: El Chapuzas Informatico\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n128\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n108\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n36\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1478\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Given that the RTX 3090 was launched in September 2020, it means a whole year has passed since a new GPU was launched by the company. While the tech world is still experiencing shortages, it has not stopped the big conglomerates from making announcements and pushing products. Now it looks as though the next series of graphics cards may be in development and ready for launch next year. \nA number of sources speculate that Nvidia is already beginning work on its RTX 4000 series, with a possible release date of \"next October,\" as well as the RTX 30 Super refresh cards coming \"early 2022.\" The rumor states that the next GPU will be codenamed \"Lovelace,\" but it seems as though, at least according to a tweet from a user called Greymon55, that the October release window could be referring to the next generation of graphics cards in general, and not specifically the RTX 4000 products.\nRELATED: Early Benchmark Test Shows Upcoming Intel GPU May Not be Ready to Tackle Nvidia\nWhile rumors of the Nvidia \"Lovelace\" have been flying around for a little while now, this is the first time that a potential release date has been mentioned. A few months back, it was suggested by Greymon55 that the up-and-coming hardware would likely be using the TSSC 5nm process nodes. For some perspective on that, Nvidia's 3000 series uses Samsung's 8nm, while AMD's 6000 series uses a TSMC 7nm. Outside these vague details, not much is known about what the next generation of Nvidia RTX cards will be like in terms of performance or specifics. \n\n\n\n\nOf course, it's worth saying at this stage that these are just rumors. There has been no official word yet from Nvidia about its possible 4000 series. However, if true, it's possible that Nvidia will be looking to release three SKUs for the October period, which sources label as AD102, AD104, and AD106. Rumors of AMD developing its RX 6900 XTX could be why its rival company may be getting ready to push out new versions of its 30 series, and why there are talks of the next generation of graphics cards doing the rounds.\nOn top of that, both AMD and Nvidia will have to compete with a new combatant entering the GPU ring. A few weeks ago, Intel announced it would be launching its own range of graphics cards that could rival the other two heavyweights. Whether or not it will be able to keep up with the next generation of tech remains to be seen.\nMORE: Intel Has a Chance to Hit the Ground Running With Its Arc GPUs\nSource: VideoCardz, PCGamesN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThere's a New Catch to Consider With the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nThere are already a few drawbacks to the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro console, and now fans discover yet another catch to Sony's enhanced console.\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nJ Brodie Shirey\n\n\nOct 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSave on GameSir Cyclone 2, a Wireless Controller With Hall Effect Triggers and Customization Features\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatti Robinson\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS2 is No Longer the Best-Selling Video Game Console of All Time in the US\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nDec 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Confirms Release Date and Massive Price Tag\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCRKD Fortnite Festival Edition NEO S Controller Review\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCarley Garcia\n\n\n15 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSonic X Shadow Generations May Not Feature a Chao Garden, But It Scratches the Itch\n\t\t\n\n\nSonic X Shadow Generations\n\nChao Gardens have been absent in the Sonic franchise since the early 2000s, but Sonic X Shadow Generations fills the void with a very simple feature.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Fallout Series Has Built-In Potential For a Call of Duty-Like FPS\n\t\t\n\n\nFallout\n\nFallout has a piece of important ingrained lore that would translate smoothly into an experience along the lines of Call of Duty.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: Best Resolve Upgrades to Unlock Early\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nThe Resolve Upgrades in Reignbreaker can significantly improve your abilities.

It\u2019s available in over 20 of the most popular multiplayer and esports games, it\u2019s free, it\u2019s available for all GeForce graphics cards dating back to the 900 Series, and it takes only a single click to enable.\nThis month, NVIDIA Reflex comes to Splitgate, and last week launched in Arkane\u2019s new single-player title, Deathloop. In addition, there are a further 4 Reflex-compatible mice, and a new Reflex-compatible ASUS 240Hz 1440p monitor. For more information, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Momentum Continues\nNVIDIA Reflex is quick and easy for developers to add to their titles thanks to SDKs, plugins, and extensive documentation. Over 20 games have incorporated the latency-optimizing technology, and this month it heads to Splitgate and Deathloop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplitgate\nSplitgate is a free-to-play, fast-paced multiplayer shooter from 1047 Games, featuring player-controlled portals that can be traversed and shot through, creating unique gameplay opportunities. The independently developed title recently launched on multiple platforms, bringing a surge of interest, and a massive increase in players, making it the perfect time to jump on in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis month, a Splitgate update will introduce support for NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for a smoother, more responsive gameplay experience. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to add NVIDIA Reflex to Splitgate where high-speed, multi-dimensional action is constant in each match. With a 50% reduction in system latency players will feel the difference immediately\u201d, said Ian Proulx, CEO, 1047 Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeathloop\nArkhane Entertainment\u2019s Deathloop launched to critical acclaim last week, receiving 10/10s from several outlets, and generally high marks across the board. In the PC edition, GeForce gamers have been benefiting from the inclusion of NVIDIA Reflex, which enhances both the single player campaign, and the multiplayer mode where other players invade your game to kill you and send you back to the start of the eponymous death loop.\nUsing NVIDIA Reflex, system latency is reduced by up to 40%, making action more responsive. Hit your targets with greater ease, chain together the game\u2019s supernatural abilities, and gain the competitive advantage against invading players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour New NVIDIA Reflex Compatible Mice\nFor competitive players and professionals, we created the NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer, enabling easy, accurate measurement of click-to-photon latency for the very first time. Using GeForce Experience and compatible tech built into Reflex mice and monitors, latency can be measured, players can tweak their setup, then test again to confirm latency is further reduced. When the game is on the line, eliminating any impedance to success is critical.\nPlugging a NVIDIA Reflex-compatible mouse into a G-SYNC monitor with NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer technology yields click-to-display system latency measurement. This is the be all and end all of system latency testing, revealing how long it takes for your mouse click to be transmitted through hardware and software before appearing on-screen in the game.\nUsing any mouse, the Reflex Analyzer can capture PC Latency and Display Latency.

However, one partner says it will take a major performance advantage for his customers to switch from x86 to Arm: \u2018Among our customers, there needs to be some large, clear selling point of why they need to change to a new architecture.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia said it has proven that Arm-based CPUs can provide nearly the same level of performance as x86-based CPUs when paired with GPUs for AI applications, specifically machine learning inference.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based made the assertion this week and backed it up using peer-reviewed performance data that was released Wednesday as part of test results from several OEMs and chipmakers for the new MLPerf Inference v1.1 machine learning inference benchmark suite.\n[Related: Arm Says New Neoverse V1, N2 Server CPUs Faster Than Intel, AMD]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nIn a briefing with journalists and analysts, Dave Salvator, senior product manager for AI inference and cloud at Nvidia, said the company determined the comparable inference performance between Arm-based CPUs and x86-based CPUs by taking the MLPerf results of an Arm-based GPU system and an x86-based GPU system and comparing them on a per-accelerator basis.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to deliver results that you see here are running pretty much neck and neck with a very similarly configured x86 server,\u201d he said.\nWhen looking at the performance provided by one accelerator, Nvidia found that the test results between the Arm-based system and the x86-based system were similar, with the x86-based system only showing a minor advantage for five of the six machine learning models tested in offline settings, which included BERT-Large for natural language processing and RRN-T for speech recognition. For the 3D U-Net medical imaging model, the Arm-based system had a clearer advantage.\nWhen it came to tests that required an online connection, the Arm-based system had a slight performance advantage for the ResNet-50 image classification model while the X86-based system had similar advantages for the SSD-Large object detection and DLRM recommendation models. However, with the RNN-T and BERT-Large models, the x86-based system had a much greater advantage.\nThe mostly similar performance results between an Arm-based system and an x86-based system represent \u201can important milestone,\u201d according to Salvator.\n\u201cFirst of all, it shows that Arm as an acceleration platform can deliver performance that is just about on par with a similarly configured x86 server,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a statement about the readiness of our software stack to be able to run the Arm architecture in a data center environment.\u201d\nThe Arm-based system, in this case, was a Gigabyte server running an Altra CPU from the semiconductor startup Ampere Computing and four Nvidia A100 GPUs connected via PCIe. The x86-based system was Nvidia\u2019s DGX A100, which comes with two AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs and eight Nvidia A100 GPUs connected via SXM connectivity. Nvidia also showed similar performance comparisons between the same Arm-based system and a different x86-based system using the same CPUs and GPUs but with PCIe.\nIn a statement to CRN, Salvator said comparing the systems on a per-accelerator basis was the best way to make the data directly comparable since the Arm-based system and x86-based systems have a different number of CPUs and GPUs. He added that it\u2019s a fair way to make a comparison, given that \u201cinference performance scales linearly with the number of GPUs.\u201d\n\u201cBy going to a per-accelerator or per-processor comparison, we\u2018re able to directly compare one against the other and really get a sense of the relative performance,\u201d he said.\nDavid Kanter, executive director of MLCommons, the consortium that reviews and releases the MLPerf test results, told CRN that measuring performance per processor in the case of CPU-based systems or per accelerator in the case of GPU-based systems is a \u201cfairly commonly used\u201d metric.\n\u201cPer-processor performance numbers make sense because inference is generally an explicitly parallel workload,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cEach inference is independent, so [it] could in theory go to a separate processor and thus normalizing is reasonable.\u201d\nHowever, he noted, MLCommons \u201conly officially endorses the measured MLPerf score,\u201d which is based on the performance of the total system, not a single accelerator or processor.\nNvidia made its new argument about Arm in the data center as it hopes to make the alternative chip architecture a big part of its future. The chipmaker is trying to acquire Arm for $40 billion, even as it faces heavy scrutiny from regulators and opposition from some competitors and ecosystem players. The company also plans to make its own Arm-based data center CPUs.\nEliot Eshelman, vice president of strategic accounts and high-performance computing initiatives at Microway, a Plymouth, Mass.-based Nvidia partner, told CRN that his HPC customers would need to see a major performance advantage to make the jump from x86 to Arm, which hasn\u2019t happened yet. Showing that the two chip architectures are merely comparable is not enough for them.\n\u201cAmong our customers, there needs to be some large, clear selling point of why they need to change to a new architecture,\u201d he said.\nEshelmen said Arm could eventually come out with architectural improvements that would give it a major advantage over Intel and AMD for AI, but he thinks it\u2019s more likely that performance advancements will come from the interconnect work Nvidia plans to do between the CPU and the GPU for the chipmaker\u2019s upcoming Arm-based data center CPUs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be so much that Arm is carrying the day and offering this huge multiplier over x86, or it\u2019s just the path that Nvidia takes to get their end going,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This is the latest post in our\u00a0NVIDIA DRIVE Labs series. With this series, we\u2019re taking an engineering-focused look at individual autonomous vehicle challenges and how the NVIDIA DRIVE AV Software team is mastering them. Catch up on our earlier posts,\u00a0here.\nUnderstanding speed limit signs may seem like a straightforward task, but it can quickly become more complex in situations in which different restrictions apply to different lanes (for example, a highway exit) or when driving in a new country.\nThis episode of DRIVE Labs shows how AI-based live perception can help autonomous vehicles better understand the complexities of speed limit signs, using both explicit and implicit cues.\n\nSpeed limit signs can be much more nuanced than they might first appear. For example, when driving through a school zone, the posted limit is only in effect at certain times of day.\nSome speed limits are conveyed by electronic variable message signs, which may show speed limits that apply to some lanes and not others, or apply under some conditions and not others, or apply differently under different conditions.\nAI-based live perception analyzes \u201centrance to motorway\u201d signs.\nAnd some signs, such as \u201centrance to motorway\u201d signs in Germany, convey speed limits implicitly, meaning that the driver needs to interpret the speed limit based on underlying local rules and regulations versus being able to read an explicit speed limit number.\nAdditionally, there may be many variations in semantic meaning for visually similar or identical speed limit signs, as well as signs and supplementary text, which, when present, can modify or even change the semantic meaning.\nConventional Speed Assist System Challenges\nDespite this complexity, a speed assist system (SAS) in an autonomous vehicle must be able to accurately detect and interpret signs across widely diverse driving environments. In advanced driver assistance systems, SAS capabilities are critical in correctly informing, and even correcting, the human driver.\nIn autonomous driving applications, SAS capabilities become critical inputs to planning and control software in order to ensure the vehicle is traveling at a legal and safe speed.\nConventional SAS relies heavily on a navigation map or a high-definition map that contains detailed information about nearby signs, as well as their semantic meaning.\nHowever, due to limitations in map accuracy, as well as potential accuracy limitations in localization to that map, legacy approaches may result in detecting a sign significantly after passing it. Thus, a vehicle may travel at an incorrect speed until after the sign is registered.\nAdditionally, the map may be outdated or may not correctly associate different signs to the lanes to which they apply.\nSAS Going Live\nIn contrast to legacy approaches, the NVIDIA DRIVE SAS leverages AI-based live perception through a range of deep neural networks (DNNs) that detect and interpret implicit, explicit and variable message signs.\nSpecifically, the NVIDIA WaitNet DNN detects the sign, the SignNet DNN classifies the sign type and the PathNet DNN provides the path perception information.\nAs a result, all the signals needed for understanding the speed limit signs, as well as establishing their relevance to the different driving lanes on the road \u2014 a process known as sign-to-path association \u2014 comes from live perception, without requiring prior information to be provided by a map.\nAnother advantage of this approach is flexibility. For example, if implicit speed limit signs happen to change in a given region or country, our SAS readily responds through a simple change in the underlying sign-to-path association logic.\nFor systems relying on a pre-annotated map, the new rule would instead need to be re-annotated everywhere in the map to perform the correct update.\nTo further increase robustness, both speed sign information and sign-to-path relevance information provided by our live perception SAS can be fused with information from a map. By incorporating a diversity of information inputs, SAS coverage can be enhanced for a wide range of real-world scenarios.\n\n\nCategories: DRIVE Labs | Driving | ResearchTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s a process that uses a deep learning model to filter data, finding results no human could capture.\nMLPerf\u2019s inference benchmarks are based on today\u2019s most popular AI workloads and scenarios, covering computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and more.\nSo, whatever AI applications they deploy, users can set their own records with NVIDIA.\nWhy Performance Matters\nAI models and datasets continue to grow as AI use cases expand from the data center to the edge and beyond. That\u2019s why users need performance that\u2019s both dependable and flexible to deploy.\nMLPerf gives users the confidence to make informed buying decisions. It\u2019s backed by dozens of industry leaders, including Alibaba, Arm, Baidu, Google, Intel and NVIDIA, so the tests are transparent and objective.\nFlexing Arm for Enterprise AI\nThe Arm architecture is making headway into data centers around the world, in part thanks to its energy efficiency, performance increases and expanding software ecosystem.\nThe latest benchmarks show that as a GPU-accelerated platform, Arm-based servers using Ampere Altra CPUs deliver near-equal performance to similarly configured x86-based servers for AI inference jobs. In fact, in one of the tests, the Arm-based server out-performed a similar x86 system.\nNVIDIA has a long tradition of supporting every CPU architecture, so we\u2019re proud to see Arm prove its AI prowess in a peer-reviewed industry benchmark.\n\u201cArm, as a founding member of MLCommons, is committed to the process of creating standards and benchmarks to better address challenges and inspire innovation in the accelerated computing industry,\u201d said David Lecomber, a senior director of HPC and tools at Arm.\n\u201cThe latest inference results demonstrate the readiness of Arm-based systems powered by Arm-based CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs for tackling a broad array of AI workloads in the data center,\u201d he added.\nPartners Show Their AI Powers\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI technology is backed by a large and growing ecosystem.\nSeven OEMs submitted a total of 22 GPU-accelerated platforms in the latest benchmarks.\nMost of these server models are NVIDIA-Certified, validated for running a diverse range of accelerated workloads. And many of them support NVIDIA AI Enterprise, software officially released last month.\nOur partners participating in this round included Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo, Nettrix and Supermicro as well as cloud-service provider Alibaba.\nThe Power of Software\nA key ingredient of NVIDIA\u2019s AI success across all use cases is our full software stack.\nFor inference, that includes pre-trained AI models for a wide variety of use cases. The NVIDIA TAO Toolkit customizes those models for specific applications using transfer learning.\nOur NVIDIA TensorRT software optimizes AI models so they make best use of memory and run faster. We routinely use it for MLPerf tests, and it\u2019s available for both x86 and Arm-based systems.\nWe also employed our NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software and Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) capability in these benchmarks. They deliver for all developers the kind of performance that usually requires expert coders.\nThanks to continuous improvements in this software stack, NVIDIA achieved gains up to 20 percent in performance and 15 percent in energy efficiency from previous MLPerf inference benchmarks just four months ago.\nAll the software we used in the latest tests is available from the MLPerf repository, so anyone can reproduce our benchmark results. We continually add this code into our deep learning frameworks and containers available on NGC, our software hub for GPU applications.\nIt\u2019s part of a full-stack AI offering, supporting every major processor architecture, proven in the latest industry benchmarks and available to tackle real AI jobs today.\nTo learn more about the NVIDIA inference platform, check out our NVIDIA Inference Technology Overview.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inference | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Representing the bottom end of Nvidia\u2019s latest crop of GPUs in terms of both power and performance, the 3060 nevertheless promises significant advancements over previous generations for a comparatively modest fee.The card on test here is the Palit Geforce RTX 3060 Dual OC, a partner card which follows the usual trend of building on the stock model with factory overclocking, enhanced cooling and a tweaked design.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review: A GPU worth waiting for Nvidia takes aim at Intel with first data centre CPU Nvidia's RTX 3060 GPU will self-throttle if used for crypto miningBefore we begin, a note on pricing; while we\u2019ve quoted the baseline RRP for an RTX 3060 above, factors including chip shortages and cryptocurrency mining booms are currently creating a huge crunch. This means that at the time of writing, you\u2019ll pay significantly more for a 3060 - if you can track one down at all. We\u2019ve used the RRP as a basis for the purposes of relative comparison, and to indicate how much to budget for when (or indeed if) prices start to stabilise again.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: DesignBefitting its status as the entry-level card in the RTX 3000 series, the 3060 Dual OC is among the smallest of Nvidia\u2019s new GPUs. It\u2019s a comparatively petite 245mm long, compared to the mammoth 320mm RTX 3090, and it\u2019s only a dual-slot card, in comparison to most other 3000-series boards which effectively take up three PCIe slots.It\u2019s smaller than both the GTX 1080 and the RTX 2080 Ti, which means upgrading an existing build with this card should be a piece of cake. While it\u2019s not quite as compact as single-fan cards, it should fit into most builds with few problems.As well as being smaller than other cards, Palit\u2019s offering is also more sedate than many rival manufacturers. Housed in a fairly sober black plastic chassis, the only real design flourishes are a honeycomb bracket to increase airflow and aid stability, and the GeForce RTX branding along the side is the only instance of RGB lighting.We\u2019re counting that a plus, as GPUs often have a tendency towards somewhat juvenile design sensibilities - but what\u2019s less positive is the slightly flimsy feeling that parts of the chassis have. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker, as your graphics card probably isn\u2019t going to be getting knocked around a great deal, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind when comparing this card to sturdier equivalents.In addition to the honeycomb airflow cut-outs we mentioned above, the card is cooled with a pair of 90mm fans and fin-stack heatsinks. The 180W of power the card consumes comes courtesy of a single eight-pin connector, and a system power budget of 550W is recommended.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: Specs and performanceNvidia has introduced a lot of improvements with its latest generation of cards, but if you\u2019re expecting the 3060 to blow every one of its predecessors out of the water, you may be disappointed. This is an entry-level card, so it\u2019s not going to represent an enormous step up over the likes of the 2080 Ti - even with support for PCIe 4 connections.With that having been said, it\u2019s not exactly a write-off. This GPU is equipped with a meaty 12GB of GDDR6 video memory, alongside 3,584 CUDA cores and maximum base and boost clock speeds of 1,320MHz and 1,837MHz, respectively. That\u2019s not a specification to be sneezed at, especially given the price.Sadly, however, it didn\u2019t put in the best showing in our benchmarks. Installed in our Chillblast-provided test rig supported by an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X processor and 32GB of RAM, it reached a score of 7,888 in the hotel lobby portion of LuxMark 3.1\u2019s OpenCL GPU rendering test. That\u2019s lagging a little behind the 2080 Ti\u2019s score of 8,492, and a considerable distance behind the 11,916 achieved by the RTX 3070. Its score of 294 for the Octanebench 2020 tests were similarly lacklustre in comparison to its stablemate, which managed to rack up 412 in the same test.Things start to perk up a little in the SPECviewPerf 2020 professional workload tests; here, the 3060 achieved respective scores in the 3dsmax-07 and maya-06 tests of 101 and 326. It\u2019s still roughly 25% slower than the 3070, but it\u2019s not as much of a gulf as with other tests, and while there\u2019s a definite gap between this card and its more expensive cousin, it\u2019s still capable of powering through even heavy-duty rendering and 3D modelling workloads.Its poor performance in the CAD, science and engineering portions of SPECviewPerf\u2019s tests, on the other hand, indicate that this card isn\u2019t going to be suitable for much beyond content creation and media workloads, even by the usual standards of Nvidia\u2019s consumer GPUs. It\u2019s a good choice for cost-effective all-purpose workstations, but anyone with specialised or intensive needs would be best advised to look at one of the higher-end models in the range.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: Ports and featuresAs with the RTX 3070, the 3060\u2019s port selection isn\u2019t hugely extensive; there\u2019s one HDMI 2.1 output and three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs, but no USB-C ports to speak of. That\u2019s not a massive loss though, given how widespread the two ports on offer are.The card supports a maximum resolution of 7,680 x 4,320, and can drive up to four displays. There\u2019s no SLI support for multiple GPUs, but users get all the other benefits of the new RTX line, including DLSS, second-generation ray tracing cores and third-generation tensor cores.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: VerdictConsidering the amount of power on display, the RTX 3060 is a pretty stonking deal. It\u2019s less than half the price of the next model up, but manages to avoid a corresponding drop in performance. In fact, it\u2019s not that far behind the 3070 at all, and it\u2019s powerful enough to cope with moderate-to-serious media and rendering workloads. It\u2019s almost enough to keep pace with the RTX 2080 Ti, which is impressive considering how far off the 3060 is from the 2080 Ti\u2019s launch price.Admittedly, this isn\u2019t a powerhouse card; it\u2019ll start to falter under strenuous enterprise rendering workloads, and scientific or engineering applications should definitely be avoided. If all you\u2019re looking for is a solid all-rounder that won\u2019t cost the earth, however, you could do a lot worse than outfitting your workstation with this tidy little number.Palit Geforce RTX 3060 Dual OC specificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyStream processors3,584Base clock1,320MHzBoost clock1,837MHzMemory12GBConnectivityPCIe 4.0 16xDisplay outputs3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.1Max resolution7,680 x 4,320 @60HzTDP180WPower connections1x 8-pinSupported APIsMicrosoft DirectX 12 Ultimate, Vulkan RT API, OpenGL 4.6\n\n\nAdam ShepherdSocial Links NavigationAdam Shepherd has been a technology journalist since 2015, covering everything from cloud storage and security, to smartphones and servers.

The next thing Hedley knew, Dewulf had him dumpster diving and developing the idea into a commercial product.\nBuoyed by acceptance into Microsoft\u2019s AI accelerator program, they found themselves on the receiving end of an \u00a3800,000 (about $1.1 million) seed investment, followed by another \u00a3400,000 in grants in 2020.\nBy the end of 2020, the startup had already proven itself with the top waste-management firms in the U.K. Last April, they partnered with energy leader TotalEnergies and recycling pioneer Valorplast on the OMNI project, one of seven winning projects selected by nonprofit French sustainability company Citeo.\nAn AI on Closing the Recycling Loop\u00a0\nTo date, effectively recognizing and separating items that have contained food from other items has not been possible. However, a crucial step in improving recycling rates is to optimize the quality of recycled materials that are passed on to plastic manufacturers.\nRecycleye\u2019s partnership with Valorplast and TotalEnergies focuses on the application of AI to identify food-grade and nonfood-grade plastic packaging with the goal of increasing the circular recycling of these products. It could even help in the development of new applications, such as improved food packaging.\nRecycleye has also partnered with universities to create WasteNet, an open-source database that is now the world\u2019s largest waste dataset, with more than 2.5 million training images.\nRecycleye is an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, providing offerings that integrate the full Metropolis stack for video analytics inference. The Recycleye team uses the NVIDIA Jetson platform and dug into accelerated deep learning tools such as pretrained models, the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit and the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK.\nWith the NVIDIA tools and huge training dataset behind it, Recycleye has slashed the time it takes to deploy its model from an unworkable two months down to just two hours, while achieving accuracies exceeding human vision in identifying items.\nThe company\u2019s devices run on the network\u2019s edge, doing all computations onsite, provided there\u2019s sufficient internet connectivity. Models are trained in the cloud, on a GPU-enabled instance of Microsoft Azure, and then deployed to Recycleye\u2019s devices at client sites.\nAlgorithms are automatically updated on client devices during software updates. The cloud system also processes data logs and provides the client with dashboard summaries of that data.\nA Recycleye intelligent picking system.\nComing: Global Expansion and More Robots\nRecycleye also develops robots powered by Recycleye Vision, jointly with FANUC, one of the world\u2019s largest robotics manufacturers. Having already installed Recycleye Vision and Recycleye Robotics in the U.K. and France earlier this year, Hedley expects more waste companies will follow suit to automate their manual sorting with robotics.\nBut Recycleye has much bigger aspirations now that it has a scalable system that can be deployed globally, and Hedley said that the more deployments the company does, the better its technology will get.\n\u201cWhen we have a device at both the end and the front of a line, we can see what happens if the quantity of material increases, but the quality decreases,\u201d said Hedley. \u201cWe can start optimizing machinery and configuration, and start having machines making decisions.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Inception | Jetson | Metropolis | NVIDIA in Europe | Smart Spaces | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA is proud to support the U.K.\u2019s AI ecosystem with Cambridge-1, the country\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, and our Inception programme that includes more than 500 of the U.K.\u2019s most dynamic AI startups.\u201d\nNVIDIA will also today announce the next phase for Cambridge-1, in which U.K.-based startups will be able to submit applications to harness the system\u2019s capabilities, during a talk at the Wired Health:Tech conference by Kimberly Powell, NVIDIA\u2019s vice president of Healthcare.\n\u201cAI and digital biology are reshaping the drug discovery process, and startups are by definition on the bleeding edge of innovation,\u201d she said. \u201cCambridge-1 is the modern instrument for science and we look forward to opening the possibilities for discovery even wider to the U.K. startup ecosystem.\u201d\nPowell will also describe work underway with U.K. biotech company and NVIDIA Inception member Peptone, which will have access to Cambridge-1. Peptone is developing a protein engineering system that blends generative AI models and computational molecular physics to discover therapies to fight inflammatory diseases like COPD, psoriasis and asthma.\n\u201cAccess to the compute power of Cambridge-1 will be a game changer in our effort to fuse computation with laboratory experiments to change the way protein drugs are engineered,\u201d said Dr. Kamil Tamiola, Peptone CEO and founder. \u201cWe plan to use Cambridge-1 to vastly improve the design of antibodies to help treat numerous inflammatory diseases.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA anticipates that giving U.K. startups the opportunity to use Cambridge-1 will accelerate their work, enabling them to bring innovative products and services to market faster, as well as ensure that the U.K. remains a compelling location in which to develop and scale up their businesses.\nStartups that are selected for the new programme will not only gain access to Cambridge-1. They will also be invited to meet with the system\u2019s founding partners to amplify collaboration potential, and access membership benefits of NVIDIA Inception, a global programme designed to nurture startups, which has more U.K. startups as members than from any other country in Europe.\u00a0\nFounding partners of Cambridge-1 are: AstraZeneca, GSK, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.\u00a0\nNVIDIA Inception provides startups with critical go-to-market support, training and technology. Benefits include access to hands-on, cloud-based training through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, preferred pricing on hardware, invitations to exclusive networking events, opportunities to engage with venture capital partners and more. Startups in NVIDIA Inception remain supported throughout their entire life cycle, helping them accelerate both platform development and time to market.\u00a0\u00a0\nStartup applications can be submitted here before December 30 at midnight GMT, with the announcement of those selected expected early in 2022.\u00a0\nAbout Cambridge-1\u00a0\nLaunched in July 2021, Cambridge-1 is the U.K.\u2019s most powerful supercomputer. It is the first NVIDIA supercomputer designed and built for external research access. NVIDIA will collaborate with researchers to make much of this work available to the greater scientific community.\u00a0\nFeaturing 80\u00a0DGX\u2122 A100\u00a0systems integrating\u00a0NVIDIA A100 GPUs,\u00a0BlueField\u00ae-2 DPUs\u00a0and\u00a0NVIDIA HDR InfiniBand\u00a0networking, Cambridge-1 is an\u00a0NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122\u00a0that delivers more than 400 petaflops of AI performance and 8 petaflops of Linpack performance. The system is located at a facility operated by NVIDIA partner Kao Data.\nCambridge-1 is the first supercomputer NVIDIA has dedicated to advancing industry-specific research in the U.K. The company also intends to build an AI Center for Excellence in Cambridge featuring a new Arm-based supercomputer, which will support more industries across the country.\nCambridge-1 was launched with five founding partners: AstraZeneca, GSK, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London, and Oxford Nanopore.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

No keyboard pops up to obscure the screen. Typed words appear in the appropriate text box. Or users can opt to view a stream of text to check accuracy.\nRather than presenting users with an on-screen keyboard, IMK takes advantage of its user\u2019s memory of where each imaginary key is in relation to all the others.\n\nThe heart of the system is what the researchers call a Self-Attention Neural Character Decoder, trained on GPUs and fueled by a vast user input dataset.\nIt consists of two decoder models.\nThe geometric decoder takes in a touch input sequence. It then converts it into a character sequence by using the touch locations on the invisible keyboard.\nThen, the semantic decoder corrects decoding errors in the character sequence estimated by the geometric decoder by considering semantic meanings.\nThe researchers trained the semantic decoder on the One Billion Word Benchmark created by Cambridge University and the University of Edinburgh and Google in 2014.\nThe researchers then fine-tuned the two models together. Both were trained with the open-source PyTorch 1.4.0 library on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.\nUsers can type whether they\u2019re using apps in landscape or portrait mode.\u00a0 Either way, users can use the whole screen to input text.\nThe result: users could type 157.5% faster using the Invisible Mobile Keyboard than third-party soft keyboards on their smartphones.\nFeatured image: vintage19_something, some rights reserved.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorSep 22, 2021, 01:00pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA rules the performance roost, Qualcomm demonstrates exceptional power efficiency, and Intel demonstrates the power of software.\nEvery three months, the not-for-profit group MLCommons publishes a slew of peer-reviewed MLPerf benchmark results for deep learning, alternating between training and inference processing. This time around, it was Inference Processing V1.1. Over 50 members agree on a set of benchmarks and data sets they feel are representative of real AI workloads such as image and language processing. And then the fun begins.\n\n\nFrom what I hear from vendors, these benchmarks are increasingly being used in Requests for Proposals for AI gear, and also serve as a robust test bed for engineers of new chip designs and optimization software. So everyone wins, whether or not they publish. This time around NVIDIA, Intel, and Qualcomm added new models and configurations, and results were submitted from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, NVIDIA, Inspur, Gigbyte, Supermicro, and Netrix.\n\nAnd the winner is...\nBefore we get to the acccelerators, a few comments about inference processing. Unlike training, where the AI job is the job, inference is usually a small part of an application, which of course runs on an x86 server. Consequently, Intel pretty much owns the data center inference market; most models perform quite will on Xeons. Aware of this, Intel has continually updated the hardware and software to run faster to keep those customers happy and on the platform. We will cover more details on this in a moment, but for models requiring more performance or dedicated throughput for more complex models, accelerators are the way to go.\n\n\nOn that front, Nvidia remains the the fastest AI accelerator for every workload, on a single chip basis. On a system level, however, a 16-card Qualcomm delivered the fastest ResNet-50 performance with 342K images per second, over an 8-GPU Inspur server at 329K. While Qualcomm increased their model coverage, Nvidia was the only firm to submit benchmark results for every AI model. Intel submitted results for nearly all models in data center processing.\n\nQualcomm shared results for both the Snapdragon at the edge, and the Cloud AI100, both offering rock solid performance with absolute leadership power efficiency across the board. Here\u2019s some of the data.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nNvidia, as usual, clobbered the inference incumbant, which is the Intel Xeon CPU. Qualcomm ... [+] out-performed the NVIDIA A30, however.Nvidia\n\nEvery year, Nvidia demonstrates improved performance, even on the same hardware, thanks to continuous improvements in its software stack. In particular, TensorRT improves performance and efficiency by pre-processing the neural network, performing functions such as quantization to lower-precision formats and arithmetic. But the star of the Nvidia software show for inference is increasingly the Triton Inference Server, which manages the run-time optimizations and workload balancing using Kubernetes. Nvidia has open-sourced Triton, and it now supports x86 CPUs as well as Nvidia GPUs. In fact, since it is open, Triton could be extended with backends for other accelerators and GPUs, saving startups a lot of software development work.\n\n Nvidia demonstrated nearly 50% better performance over results from a year ago, all based on ... [+] improved software especially for newer AI models such as medical imaging and speech recognition.Nvidia\nIn some applications, power efficiency is a critical factor for success, but only if the platform achieves the required performance and latency for the models being deployed. Thanks to years of research in AI and Qualcomm\u2019s mobile processor legacy, the AI engines in Snapdragon and the Cloud AI100 deliver both, with up to half the power per transaction for many models versus the Nvidia A100, and nearly four times the efficiency of the Nvidia A10.Qualcomm Cloud AI100 offered the best performance per watt of all other submissions.Qualcomm\nBack to Intel, the new Ice Lake Xeon performed quite well, with up to 3X improvment over the previous Cooper Lake CPU for DLRM (recommendation engines), and 1.5X on other models. Recommendation engines represent a huge market in which Xeon rules, and for which other contenders are investing heavily, so this is a very good move for Intel.Intel demonstrated 50%-300% better performance with Ice Lake vs, the previous Cooper Lake results. ... [+] This was accomplished in part by the improvements the engineering team has realized in the software stack.Intel\nIntel also demonstrated significant performance improvements in the development stack for Xeon. The most dramatic improvement was again for DLRM, in which sparce data and weights are common. In this case, Intel delivered over 5X performance improvement on the same hardware.Intel shared the five-fold performance improvement from sparsity, on the same chip. Intel\nConclusions\nAs followers of Cambrian-AI know, we believe that MLPerf presents vendors and users with valuable benchmarks, a real-world testing platform, and of course keeps analysts quite busy slicing and dicing all the data. In three months we expect a lot of exciting new Training results, and look forward to sharing our insights and analysis with you then.\n9/24: This story has been updated with a revised image for the Qualcomm result.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

Now, scientists can take a closer look at endangered species by studying AI-generated 3D representations of them.\nSifei Liu, a senior research scientist at NVIDIA, has worked with her team to create an algorithm that can reconstruct 3D meshes \u2014 graphics models used to display the edges, vertices and overall shape of an object \u2014 from 2D inputs like images and videos.\nLiu spoke with NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about her team\u2019s project, called Online Adaptation for Consistent Mesh Reconstruction in the Wild. Liu and her team have presented the project at various prominent conferences, including NeurIPS 2020.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Wild Things: NVIDIA\u2019s Sifei Liu Talks 3D Reconstructions of Endangered Species \u2013 Ep. 152\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\nThe deep learning algorithm made by Liu and her team creates 3D meshes with just 2D annotations. This means the AI mimics natural human perception, which can predict and visualize the 3D shape of an object based on a 2D image of it.\nInitially focused on birds and zebras, Liu hopes to expand the project for use by scientists who study any endangered species, since it can be difficult to make 3D models of animals that are hard to come across. The meshes could one day be 3D-printable.\n\nTweetables:\n\u201cThere are a lot of opportunities to leverage deep learning and graphics, and 3D reconstruction is one of them.\u201d \u2014 Sifei Liu [19:29]\nWith deep learning, \u201cyou can try to make our world more beautiful.\u201d \u2014 Sifei Liu [20:56]\nYou Might Also Like:\nGetting Clever With Kaolin: Researchers Accelerate 3D Deep Learning With New Tools\nNVIDIA researchers and engineers discuss NVIDIA Kaolin, a collection of tools within the NVIDIA Omniverse simulation and collaboration platform that allows researchers to visualize and generate datasets, move between 3D tools and retain basic functions for other users.\nPerfect Pairing: NVIDIA\u2019s David Luebke on the Intersection of AI and Graphics\nThe NVIDIA Research team employs more than 200 scientists around the world who are driving innovation across a range of industries.

Australia\u2019s bushfire season of 2019-2020 alone saw over 46 million acres of land devastated by wildfire, including the loss of almost half a billion mammals, birds and reptiles.\nNVIDIA Inception member OroraTech is addressing these issues head-on with its wildfire detection and monitoring service.\nCombining data from predominantly satellites but also ground-based cameras, aerial observations and local weather information, the Munich-based startup is taking on the challenge of preventing one of today\u2019s most prevalent disasters.\n\u201cWildfires are a natural phenomenon \u2014 but global warming is making it worse,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Stoffers, one of the company\u2019s co-founders. \u201cThere are more droughts, pest infestation, higher temperatures and humans are building houses in wildfire-prone areas. Our goal is to monitor wildfires around the world and detect every fire within 30 minutes.\u201d\nDetection From Start to Finish\nData suggests global warming might be happening faster than we thought. Temperatures are rising, carbon dioxide levels are at their highest and extreme weather events are happening more frequently. Preventing wildfires is one route to reducing a sizable chunk of CO2 emissions, not to mention saving lives and property.\nOroraTech provides risk assessment features to help monitor areas before wildfires can appear. Its holistic approach analyzes a fire risk index, wind particle layers, and the greenness of vegetation and moisture levels to highlight vulnerable areas where a potential wildfire can easily spread.\nEarly detection and real-time monitoring are used during an active wildfire. Using imagery from 19 satellites and many ground-based cameras, the company\u2019s system can detect wildfires even in remote areas and then present visuals of the area and fire progression over time.\nIn Mozambique\u2019s Niassa Special Reserve, the Wildlife Conservation Society has already put OroraTech\u2019s system to good use. Wildfire alerts enabled rangers to prevent a base camp from burning down with only 100 meters between the camp and the blaze.\nThe system also provides damage analysis to review air pollution, fire origin and burned area after a wildfire has taken place.\nThe view that OroraTech is able to capture of an active wildfire.\nSpeed Is of the Essence\nWhile OroraTech is already accelerating wildfire prevention and detection through its service, there are limitations to sharing a satellite with other users. Coverage isn\u2019t always available, and data downloads can take up to 1.5 hours. Wildfires aren\u2019t known for taking their time. Indeed, in grasslands, they can travel up to 14 mph.\nThis year, OroraTech is launching its own AI nanosatellites with the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX \u00a0system onboard. The compact, low-power module delivers up to 21 trillion operations per second of accelerated compute at just 15 watts. It runs modern neural networks in parallel and quickly processes data from multiple high-resolution sensors. Data is sent within 2-3 minutes of a wildfire taking hold for immediate action on the ground.\nThese miniature satellites can be built, launched and operated at a fraction of the cost of one large satellite by using smaller sensors \u2014 allowing OroraTech to easily launch a constellation of more than 100 satellites and achieve a much better coverage of the planet.\nFrom Satellites to Startups\nStoffers, Thomas Gr\u00fcbler, Florian Mauracher and Rupert Amann founded OroraTech in 2018 as a spinoff from the Technical University of Munich, where they researched space and satellite technology. Now, with over 50 employees internationally, OroraTech has made it its mission to revolutionize wildfire management around the world.\nThe company\u2019s efforts have gotten a boost from NVIDIA Inception, an accelerator program that offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for AI, data science and HPC startups. \u201cBeing an Inception member has helped us on our journey, with training support, access to hardware and visibility at networking and VC events,\u201d said Stoffers.\nLooking back at previous wildfire data, OroraTech is confident its tech would\u2019ve saved large areas of forest. Looking forward, it has its sights set on helping meet key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as sustainable communities, climate action and supporting life on land.\nThat\u2019s no mean feat for a small but growing innovator taking on the world, one wildfire at a time.\nRegister now to hear OroraTech speak at GTC 21 in November.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Aerospace | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Inception | Jetson | NVIDIA in Europe | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This can mean that smaller organizations or niche research areas lack enough data to train an accurate predictive model. Even large datasets can be biased by an organization\u2019s patient or customer demographics, specific data-recording methods or even the brand of scientific equipment used.\nTo gather enough training data for a robust, generalizable model, most organizations would need to pool data with their peers. But in many cases, data privacy regulations limit the ability to directly share data \u2014 like patient medical records or proprietary datasets \u2014 on a common supercomputer or cloud server.\nThat\u2019s where federated learning comes in.\nDubbed EXAM (for EMR CXR AI Model), the new study in Nature Medicine \u2014 led by Mass General Brigham and NVIDIA \u2014 brought 20 hospitals across five continents together to train a neural network that predicts the level of supplemental oxygen a patient with COVID-19 symptoms may need 24 and 72 hours after arriving to point-of-care settings like the emergency department. It\u2019s among the largest, most diverse clinical federated learning studies to date.\nMany Hands Make AI Work\nFederated learning enabled the EXAM collaborators to create an AI model that learned from every participating hospital\u2019s chest X-ray images, patient vitals, demographic data and lab values \u2014 without ever seeing the private data housed in each location\u2019s private server.\nEvery hospital trained a copy of the same neural network on local NVIDIA GPUs. During training, each hospital periodically sent only updated model weights to a centralized server, where a global version of the neural network aggregated them to form a new global model.\nIt\u2019s like sharing the answer key to an exam without revealing any of the study material used to come up with the answers.\n\u201cThe results of the EXAM initiative show it\u2019s possible to train high performing and generalizable AI models in healthcare without private identifiable data exchanging hands, thus upholding data privacy,\u201d said Dr. Brad Wood, coauthor and director of the NIH Center for Interventional Oncology and Chief of Interventional Radiology at the NIH Clinical Center.\n\u201cThe findings are impactful well beyond this cross-hospital model for COVID-19 predictions, and showcase federated learning as a promising solution for the field in general,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis provides the framework toward more effective and compliant big data sharing, which may be required to realize the potential of AI deep learning in medicine.\u201d\nThe global EXAM model, shared with all participating sites, resulted in a 16 percent improvement of the AI model\u2019s average performance. Researchers saw an average increase of 38 percent in generalizability when compared to models trained at any single site.\nEach participating hospital saw improved performance with the global federated learning model (green), compared to the model trained only on local data (blue). Figure originally published in Nature Medicine.\nThe performance boost was especially dramatic for hospitals with smaller datasets, visible in the chart above.\n\u201cFederated learning allows researchers all over the world to collaborate on a common objective: to develop a model that learns from and generalizes to everyone\u2019s data,\u201d said Sira Sriswasdi, co-director of the Center for AI in Medicine at Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Thailand, one of the 20 hospitals that collaborated on EXAM. \u201cWith NVIDIA GPUs and the NVIDIA Clara software, participating in the study was an easy process that yielded impactful results.\u201d\nHospitals, Startups Pursue Further EXAMination\nBringing together collaborators across North and South America, Europe and Asia, the original EXAM study took just two weeks of training to achieve high-quality prediction of patient oxygen needs, an insight that can help physicians determine the level of care a patient requires.\nSince then, its collaborators validated that the AI model may generalize and perform well in settings independent from sites that helped build and train the model. Three additional hospitals in Massachusetts \u2014 Cooley Dickinson Hospital, Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital and Nantucket Cottage Hospital \u2014 tested EXAM and discovered that the neural network performed well on their independent unseen data, too.\nCooley Dickinson Hospital found that the model predicted ventilator need within 24 hours of a patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency room with a sensitivity of 95 percent and a specificity of over 88 percent. Similar results were found in the U.K., at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge.\nMass General Brigham plans to deploy EXAM in the near future, said Dr. Quanzheng Li, scientific director of the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science, who developed the original model. Along with Lahey Hospital & Medical Center and the U.K.\u2019s NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Center, the hospital network is also working with NVIDIA Inception startup Rhino Health to run prospective studies using EXAM.\nThe original EXAM model was trained retrospectively using records of past COVID-19 patients, so researchers already had the ground-truth data on how much oxygen a patient ended up needing. This prospective research instead applies the AI model to data from new patients coming into the hospital, a further step toward deployment in a real-world setting.\n\u201cFederated learning has transformative power to bring AI innovation to the clinical workflow,\u201d said Fiona Gilbert, chair of radiology at the University of Cambridge School of Medicine. \u201cOur continued work with EXAM aims to make these kinds of global collaborations repeatable and more efficient, so that we can meet clinicians\u2019 needs to tackle complex health challenges and future epidemics.\u201d\nThe EXAM model is publicly available for research use through the NVIDIA NGC software hub. Businesses and research institutions getting started with federated learning can use the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite of AI tools and frameworks, optimized to run on NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\nLearn more about the science behind federated learning in this paper, and read our whitepaper for an introduction to federated learning using the NVIDIA Clara AI platform.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news and follow NVIDIA Healthcare on Twitter.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And during design reviews, KPF relies on collaborative sessions so their teams, clients and stakeholders can interact with the proposals and provide real-time feedback.\nWith over 700 employees spread across cities like New York, London, Singapore, and San Francisco working on different aspects of a project, KPF also needed a way to centralize all the design models in the cloud so users could better coordinate and visualize data more efficiently.\nNVIDIA Omniverse, an open platform for 3D collaboration and simulation, is helping KPF enhance these design workflows. By implementing Omniverse, and accelerating it with NVIDIA RTX technology, KPF is looking to unify their teams in one shared virtual environment, enabling them to render high-quality designs and simultaneously collaborate on the same projects.\nBringing Designers Virtually Together in One Place\nThe designers at KPF work on models in different software applications such as Rhinoceros 3D with Grasshopper, and Autodesk 3ds Max and Revit. The team typically runs visualizations on these apps using local hardware, but this makes it difficult to review the entire project because they can only show what is on a single application at a time rather than a collective, immersive scene.\nFor KPF, preparing and optimizing a model for advanced real-time performance can be a tedious, time-consuming process, one that can take days to complete. Additionally, its teams must export individual files from other applications into 3ds Max for scene building when rendering large datasets. Now, with Omniverse, the design teams at KPF can better address these challenges.\n\nKPF deployed Omniverse Nucleus from their data center in the U.K. The Enterprise Nucleus Server synchronizes all the data from the different design applications and converts the files to Universal Scene Description format. It acts as a universal asset exchange, letting the teams send only the deltas of project file changes.\nThe published model datasets, now in USD, are composed in Omniverse Create and visualized in real time using the Omniverse RTX Renderer, allowing the designers to modify models as they work. Using workstations and laptops equipped with NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 GPUs and NVIDIA RTX A3000 GPUs, and advanced workstations powered by NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 and NVIDIA RTX A6000, KPF can render high-quality images with the Omniverse RTX Renderer.\nSchematic of KPF\u2019s deployment of Omniverse, with multiple users working on RTX-enabled laptops and workstations, and Omniverse Nucleus deployed from their central data center.\nNVIDIA Omniverse renders ray-traced and path-traced images in high fidelity and in real time. This allows KPF designers and their clients to view the most photorealistic and physically accurate models possible.\n\u201cOmniverse serves as the \u2018one source of truth\u2019 since the latest content can be viewed from one application, rather than viewing separate data from different teams,\u201d said Cobus Bothma, director of Applied Research at KPF. \u201cHaving the content in one location substantially saves time on the overall project by avoiding exporting large files from every individual application \u2014 we simply use Omniverse to push real-time sets of geometries without overloading the file sizes.\u201d\nStreaming From the Cloud\nOmniverse is also helping KPF explore running design reviews in virtual and augmented reality.\nWith Omniverse and cloud-based streaming, KPF can experiment with delivering higher fidelity images to any device, whether it\u2019s a scaled-down version or a 1:1 digital model of the property. And by streaming from the cloud, KPF can make alterations in real time through changing variables like sunlight or noise.\n\u201cWe believe AR has a strong role to play in design experience and decision-making in the future,\u201d said Bothma. \u201cWith Omniverse, we\u2019re able to stream Omniverse Create to remote devices, allowing non-RTX devices to have similar functionality to our high-end, RTX-enabled workstations.\u201d\nKPF will continue to push all compute, geometry and visualization to the cloud, so their employees can run complex compute functions on devices like laptops and tablets. The move into the cloud will make sharing compute resources more efficient and scalable, and provide KPF with greater flexibility for upgrading and servicing the infrastructure.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse for AEC.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AEC | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Rendering | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Rush the objective in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2, or team up for competition in Rocket League.\nHigh-fantasy open-world MMORPGs are also available, with Runescape offering an evolving world of challenges, skills and quests. Or visit a vast world full of danger and opportunity in Albion Online, where you can form alliances and face off in intense PvP combat.\nReady for battle?

But even when she let the job run all night on a large bank of CPU servers the data refused to line up.\nShe returned in the morning to find the job had failed, so she tried again. It failed again.\nAbout that time, Nasheb Ismaily of Cloudera knocked on the door of Rahul Tikekar, manager of a technical team that supports data analysts at the IRS. The Cloudera solutions engineer asked if Tikekar\u2019s team had any uses for Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), implementing Apache Spark 3.0 software accelerated by GPUs.\n\u201cI jumped at the opportunity,\u201d said Tikekar. \u201cWe have NVIDIA graphics cards on standalone servers, but using Spark to run them on a distributed cluster had eluded us for a while, so this was perfect timing for us and Deb had the perfect use case,\u201d he said.\nA Nerdy Knot Untied\nA quick test of the software immediately speeded up many parts of Tylor\u2019s work up to 5x with no code changes, but a few pieces still lagged.\nIsmaily called in a team of data scientists at NVIDIA to examine the guts of the code. They quickly determined a few tasks with particularly gnarly data structures were still running on CPUs. They wrote code to handle those jobs and inserted it into Spark\u2019s software interface for RAPIDS, the open library for running data analytics on GPUs.\nTylor ran another test, \u201cand boom, it all went on the GPUs in a distributed Spark cluster and the speedup was remarkable \u2014 Deb\u2019s running the whole program on a four-node cluster right now,\u201d said Tikekar.\n\u201cThe Cloudera and NVIDIA integration will empower us to use data-driven insights to power mission-critical use cases,\u201d said Joe Ansaldi, technical branch chief of the research and applied analytics and statistics division at the IRS and Tikekar\u2019s boss.\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently implementing this integration, and already seeing over 20x speed improvements at half the cost for our data engineering and data science workflows,\u201d he added.\nSpark 3.0 + GPUs = New Horizons\nThe work promises several payoffs the IRS team is already exploring.\nWith a Spark cluster of GPU-powered servers, the group can accelerate all its current jobs and run others previously thought impractical. And those jobs can tackle big datasets the team has at its disposal.\n\u201cBefore Spark 3.0, this was not possible, but now we\u2019re upping the ante with GPUs and we can dream of solving problems that were once impossible,\u201d said Tikekar.\nCharting a Course to AI\nThe team plans to apply what it learned with its success in data preparation, the so-called extract/transform/load (ETL) work of data analytics. Its next big step is accelerating full-blown AI inference jobs.\n\u201cThe partnership with Cloudera and NVIDIA helped us harness GPUs in clusters. When such advances come along, it takes a while to realize their power and develop apps that can use them, so Deb is really charting a new course for us \u2014 she\u2019s definitely the hero of the story,\u201d Tikekar said.\nSpecifically, the team aims to provide this distributed Spark-GPU infrastructure to analysts. Together, they will build large deep learning neural networks to tackle natural language processing and other analytics jobs currently impossible on a single server.\nMany Apps for Machine Learning\nIt\u2019s the kind of transformation many enterprises are seeking today with machine learning.\n\u201cMy personal feeling is that machine learning brings an incredible potential to make things that were difficult to achieve possible,\u201d said Tikekar, a Ph.D. in computer science who spent a decade teaching at Southern Oregon University before joining the IRS more than 13 years ago.\n\u201cFor example, today we scan in forms and then apply optical character recognition to read pieces of them, but with AI we can do a much better job of reading forms and finding patterns that can help find ID theft or reduce waste \u2014 a lot of applications can benefit from AI in numerous ways,\u201d he added.\nTo learn more about accelerating Cloudera\u2019s CDP 7.1.6 with NVIDIA GPUs, watch a GTC talk (free to view with registration) from October 2020, when the two companies announced their partnership.\nAnd view Cloudera\u2019s demo below of a 44x speed increase on a data science workload using NVIDIA GPUs and RAPIDS compared to CPUs.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Data Science | GPU Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | RAPIDS \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At the annual event held in Silicon Valley, he described the work that NVIDIA is doing to enable advancements in AI, with a focus on large language modeling.\nCUDA Is for the Dreamers\nTraining and deploying large neural networks is a tough computational problem, so hardware that\u2019s both incredibly fast and highly efficient is a necessity, according to Catanzaro.\nBut, he explained, the software that accompanies that hardware might be even more important to unlocking further advancements in AI.\n\u201cThe core of the work that we do involves optimizing hardware and software together, all the way from chips, to systems, to software, frameworks, libraries, compilers, algorithms and applications,\u201d he said. \u201cWe optimize all of these things to give transformational capabilities to scientists, researchers and engineers around the world.\u201d\nThis end-to-end approach yields chart-topping performance in industry-standard benchmarks, such as MLPerf. It also ensures that developers aren\u2019t constrained by the platform as they aim to advance AI.\n\u201cCUDA is for the dreamers, CUDA is for the people who are thinking new thoughts,\u201d said Catanzaro. \u201cHow do they think those thoughts and test them efficiently? They need something general and flexible, and that\u2019s why we build what we build.\u201d\nLarge Language Models Are Changing the World\nOne of the most exciting areas of AI is language modeling, which is enabling groundbreaking applications in natural language understanding and conversational AI.\nThe complexity of large language models is growing at an incredible rate, with parameter counts doubling every two months.\nA well-known example of a large and powerful language model is GPT-3, developed by OpenAI. Packing 175 billion parameters, it required 314 zettaflops (1021 floating point operations) to train.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a staggering amount of compute,\u201d Catanzaro said. \u201cAnd that means language modeling is now becoming constrained by economics.\u201d\nEstimates suggest that GPT-3 would cost about $12 million to train and, Catanzaro observed, the rapid growth in model complexity means that, despite NVIDIA\u2019s tireless work to advance the performance and efficiency of its hardware and software, the cost to train these models is set to grow.\nAnd, according to Catanzaro, this trend suggests that it might not be too long before a single model might require more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of computer time to train.\n\u201cWhat would it look like to build a model that took a billion dollars to train a single model? Well, it would need to reinvent an entire company, and you\u2019d need to be able to use it in a lot of different contexts,\u201d Catanzaro explained.\nCatanzaro expects that these models will unlock an incredible amount of value, inspiring continued innovation. During his talk, Catanzaro showed an example of the surprising capabilities of large language models to solve new tasks without being explicitly trained to do so.\nAfter inputting just a few examples into a large language model \u2014 four sentences, with two written in English and their corresponding translations into Spanish \u2014 he then entered an English sentence, which the model then translated into Spanish properly.\nThe model was able to do this despite never being trained to do translation. Instead, it was trained \u2014 using, as Catanzaro described, \u201can enormous amount of data from the internet\u201d \u2014 to predict the next word that should follow a given sequence of text.\nTo perform that very generic task, the model needed to come up with higher-level representations of concepts, such as the existence of languages in general, English and Spanish vocabularies and grammar, and the concept of a translation task, in order to understand the query and properly respond.\n\u201cThese language models are first steps towards generalized artificial intelligence with few shot learning, and that is enormously valuable and very exciting,\u201d explained Catanzaro.\nA Full-Stack Approach to Language Modeling\u00a0\nCatanzaro then went on to describe NVIDIA Megatron, a framework created by NVIDIA using PyTorch \u201cfor efficiently training the world\u2019s largest, transformer-based language models.\u201d\nA key feature of NVIDIA Megatron, which Catanzaro notes has already been used by various companies and organizations to train large transformer-based models, is model parallelism.\nMegatron supports both inter-layer (pipeline) parallelism, which allows different layers of a model to be processed on different devices, as well as intra-layer (tensor) parallelism, which allows a single layer to be processed by multiple different devices.\nCatanzaro further described some of the optimizations that NVIDIA applies to maximize the efficiency of pipeline parallelism and minimize so-called \u201cpipeline bubbles,\u201d during which a GPU is not performing useful work.\nA batch is split into microbatches, the execution of which is pipelined. This boosts the utilization of the GPU resources in a system during training. With further optimizations, pipeline bubbles can be reduced even more.\nCatanzaro described an optimization, recently published, that entails \u201cround-robining each (pipeline) stage among multiple GPUs so that we can further reduce the amount of pipeline bubble overhead in this schedule.\u201d\nAlthough this optimization puts additional stress on the communication fabric within the system, Catanzaro showed that, by leveraging the full suite of NVIDIA\u2019s high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect technologies, this optimization is able to deliver sizable speedups when training GPT-3 style models.\n\nCatanzaro then highlighted the impressive performance scaling of Megatron on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, achieving 502 petaflops sustained across 3,072 GPUs, representing an astonishing 52 percent of Tensor Core peak at scale.\n\u201cThis represents an achievement by all of NVIDIA and our partners in the industry: to be able to deliver that level of end-to-end performance requires optimizing the entire computing stack, from algorithms to interconnects, from frameworks to processors,\u201d said Catanzaro.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She highlighted how AI can fuel technological and creative revolutions around the world.\nKallot also shared how NVIDIA supports developers in emerging markets to build and scale their AI projects, including through the NVIDIA Developer Program, which has more than 2.5 million members; the NVIDIA Inception Program, which offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for AI, data science and HPC startups; and the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, which offers educational resources for anyone who wants to learn about all things AI.\n\u201cI hope to inspire you on ways to fuel your own applications and help advance the African AI revolution,\u201d Kallot said.\nTo do so, she illustrated how the AI revolution is underway in Africa.\nStartups Use AI to Bolster Sustainable Agriculture and Fishing\nSouth African startup Aerobotics is an NVIDIA Inception member using AI to help farmers protect their crops and maximize yields.\nThe company\u2019s AI-powered platform analyzes drone images of trees, telling farmers which are most fruitful. Drones piloted by Aerobotics are deployed in nearly 20 countries, Kallot noted, and have processed over 100 million trees.\nAcross the continent, in Morocco, another Inception member, ATLAN Space, has created an AI-powered drone that scans thousands of square miles of ocean and detects illegal fishing boats and other environmental threats. Used by the island nation of the Seychelles, off the coast of Madagascar, the platform has helped combat poaching and save millions of government dollars in disaster relief.\nAerobotics and ATLAN Space use NVIDIA GPUs to train neural networks and the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge inference.\n\u201cThese are just two examples,\u201d Kallot said. \u201cThere are hundreds of other use cases, from African developers using our AI technology to protect rivers and prevent beehive robbers in Kenya, to enabling contactless COVID patient monitoring in Senegal.\u201d\nMetaverse Boosts African Content Development and Research\nKallot\u2019s keynote also offered a glimpse of the future with the metaverse coming into play.\n\u201cMore content and economics will one day be virtual rather than physical,\u201d Kallot said. \u201cWe will exist both in the physical and virtual worlds.\u201d\nFor example, Kallot said, ARMA \u2014 a leading motion graphics and animation studio in Ethiopia \u2014 has brought the late athlete Abebe Bikila artistically back to life in a 3D rendering of his historic 1960 Olympic marathon win in Rome. To honor what would have been the 89th birthday of the first African to take home Olympic gold, ARMA publicly released the rendering last month.\nImage courtesy of ARMA\nThe graphic contains a stylized depiction of the Arc of Constantine, which was the finish line for the first marathon Bikila won. It also features his iconic bare feet, which he opted to run with after his brand new shoes hadn\u2019t fit well. The rendering, created with NVIDIA Omniverse, accurately reflects the intricate texture of the Arc and night lighting of the race.\nIn sharing the fun model, Kallot encouraged content creators, developers and researchers to dream big when it comes to their own projects.\nAccording to Kallot, NVIDIA GPUs are used by many research groups across Africa \u2014 including the Kenya Education Network Trust, Makerere University, Stellenbosch University and the University of Cape Town \u2014 which enable and nurture the cutting-edge technologies and innovations that are fueling the continent\u2019s AI revolution.\n\u201cThink about the endless possibilities of what you can do with AI, whether you\u2019re a developer, animator or hobbyist,\u201d she said. \u201cExciting, right?\u201d\nJoin the NVIDIA Developer Program.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning Institute | Developer Program | Events | GPU | Inception | Jetson | Metaverse | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your friends think you\u2019re bluffing and demand proof.\nWith GeForce NOW\u2019s content capture tools running automatically in the cloud, you\u2019ll have all the proof you need.\nGeForce NOW members streaming with the native PC and Mac apps can take advantage of tools that let them customize the look of their game, compose the perfect in-game photo and even record every epic game-winning moment. And when you\u2019re ready to show your victory to the world, reviewing the clips and putting together the ultimate highlight reel is just a keystroke away.\nNever Miss a Moment\nNVIDIA Highlights enables automatic capture of key gaming moments, from clutch takedowns to match-winning plays.\nHighlights is supported in popular GeForce NOW titles such as Apex Legends, Destiny 2 and Rocket League. NVIDIA works closely with these game developers to integrate Highlights and choose the variety of highlight types.\nFurthermore, by developing smart pattern and image recognition technology in cloud servers, we can also detect key moments in additional GeForce NOW games. When one of those moments is detected, like a game-winning kill, Highlights saves the clips to your local hard drive for future review or sharing.\nFor the complete list of supported games, open the GeForce NOW app, click the search bar and search for \u201cHighlights.\u201d\n\nTurning on Highlights is easy: when members first launch a supported game, they\u2019re prompted to enable it and select the game-specific moments they want to capture.\n\u201cApex Legends\u201d has many Highlights to choose from like knock downs, kills, double kills, etc.\nSelecting or deselecting these moments, and toggling Highlights on or off, can also be done from the GeForce NOW in-game overlay.\nHit the command Ctrl + G on PC, or Cmd + G on Mac, and the overlay will appear on the left hand side of the display.\nExplore a wide range of Highlights options in \u201cDestiny 2.\u201d\nWant more control over clips? The in-game overlay also lets members manually record moments. All that\u2019s left is to start gaming! During gameplay when key moments happen, Highlights will automatically record them, giving gamers proof of bragging rights to share with friends.\nYour Game, Your Look\nEver explore ancient Greece in Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey and think, \u201cThis would look gorgeous in a sepia tone\u201d? Enter NVIDIA Freestyle: a collection of post-processing filters that lets members dramatically change how graphics look during sessions.\nWith Freestyle, members can control the brightness and contrast of games independent of in-game settings, which is perfect for when a dark, spooky game gets a little too intense. Filters can enhance blurry edges, add depth of field for a more cinematic moment, turn epic boss fights into watercolor-painted moments, apply HDR on the fly, and much more.\nWant to add emojis to dramatic cutscenes? It\u2019s an option. We won\u2019t judge. That hard.\nNearly all GeForce NOW games support Freestyle and can be enabled in game through the overlay. Here, members can configure up to three preset styles using a variety of filters.\nHere we\u2019ve selected three filters; Tilt-shift for increased depth of field, Details with Bloom turned up for brightness, and added crispness with Sharpen, creating a one-of-a-kind screenshot.\nCombine three filters in a single style for a complex and beautiful screenshot.\nCapture vibrant screenshots with Freestyle filters by typing shortcut commands (Ctrl + 1 / Cmd + 1) or manually in the in-game overlay.\n\u201cRocket League\u201d in watercolor. Wild wild stuff.\nTitles that support both NVIDIA Highlights and Freestyle can capture gameplay video with filters turned on, for even more colorful and artistic videos.\nThe Perfect Highlight Reel\nUsing NVIDIA Highlights and existing video clips, members can create custom highlight videos to show off their favorite gaming moments with NVIDIA Montage.\nTo begin, open the GeForce NOW app, click the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the screen and select Gallery. From there, select the video clips you want to use.\nClips can be filtered by game, media and captured Highlights.\nOnce multiple videos are selected, click on the Montage button in the top right corner of the green bar. This will generate a preview where members can review the clips within the montage, remove unwanted sections, add a title and select animations.\nClips can be filtered by game, media and captured Highlights.\nOnce everything is set, click on Create to export the montage.\nThe exported video can be shortened by clicking on Edit, then using the editing arrows on the timeline to shorten as needed. Click Save once done and the montage will either save over the original or as a new clip.\nThat\u2019s it. The montage along with additional videos and screenshots are ready to be shared with friends.\nThe file location for all the great montages, and any other UGC that\u2019s been created, can be found by navigating to the in-game overlay, then clicking on the settings icon and selecting Files and disk space.\nGet Into the Game \u2026 Overlay\nHere members get a preview of recent user-generated content in the Gallery, record video, take screenshots, toggle the microphone and provide feedback.\nThe in-game overlay command automatically appears in the top right corner while games load.\nTo further customize gameplay, click on the gear icon. Two of the most useful selections are Shortcut controls and Heads up display.\nShortcut controls gives gamers instant access to features like recording, capturing, game filters and more with a simple command. Most shortcuts are customizable.\nSimplify and save time by memorizing or creating convenient shortcuts.\nTo change a shortcut, click inside the command field, type an alternative shortcut in and hit enter to save.\nA quick guide of default shortcuts (aka hotkeys). All shortcuts except for \u201cQuit GeForce NOW session\u201d are customizable.\nMeanwhile, Heads up display provides options to add more information to the heads up display, or HUD, during live gameplay.\nCustomize the HUD to add useful information overlaying gameplay.\nThis includes options such as Record, where the user can see if recording is taking place; Microphone, showing if the microphone is on; and so on.\nMembers have the option to add statistics to the HUD to measure ping (ms), packet loss and FPS.\nWe recommend taking five minutes to explore all the unique customization options in GeForce NOW.\nAs GeForce NOW is in the cloud, all in-game overlay and content creation features are automatically updated behind the scenes and instantly accessible, with no setup required.\nNow that you\u2019re a pro, what will you capture today?\nFollow GeForce NOW on Facebook and Twitter and check out the GeForce NOW blog every GFN Thursday to stay up to date on the latest features and game launches.\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | Gaming | How ToTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now users can apply the look and feel or \u201cstyle\u201d of their own images to their final Canvas painting.\n\nSupporting the new Canvas update is the September Studio Driver, ready for download today. The latest Studio driver brings support for the upcoming Windows 11 release, powering creative workflows on the new operating system in addition to a host of GPU-accelerated Windows 11 features.\nThe Studio driver also adds support for Jianying Pro video editing software and an update to the Maxine AR SDK that improves quality and stability of AI-driven body tracking in apps like Notch.\nPopular in China, Jianying Pro added NVIDIA Video Codec support for both encoding and decoding, accelerating video production up to 4.3x now that NVENC and NVDEC are utilized on NVIDIA GPUs.\nIn addition to today\u2019s Canvas update, NVIDIA Omniverse recently expanded the metaverse by millions, while an NVIDIA Broadcast app update earlier this month improved the background noise removal network at the most critical moment in livestreaming.\nNVIDIA GPU users can download the latest Studio driver (release 472.12) with support for all the latest creative app updates through GeForce Experience, NVIDIA RTX Experience or from the driver download page.\nAnd if you need a device to power these amazing apps, new laptops from ASUS are also joining the NVIDIA Studio lineup: the mighty ProArt StudioBook 16, the elegant Zenbook Pro and the versatile VivoBook Pro.\nChoose Your Tools Wisely\nWith a wide range of needs and apps that require differing levels of performance, finding and selecting the right hardware needed to match a project\u2019s needs can be intimidating. What specs are needed? How will hardware perform against challenging creative workflows?\nA laptop that can tackle today\u2019s productions might struggle with tomorrow\u2019s projects, and understanding the technobabble can be a frustrating experience. Keeping the goals of the project in mind, let\u2019s look at a few scenarios and how hardware choices can benefit creators.\nPower to Tell Your Story\nMeet Juan, an aspiring YouTube vlogger who wants to build his portfolio of documentary-style videos that showcase modern life as a college student. Filming his projects on a 4K-supported DSLR camera such as a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, Juan needs to quickly ingest, edit, color-correct and finalize footage for each 20-minute upload on his YouTube channel. His university provides Adobe Creative Cloud, so he plans to run post-production work in Adobe Premiere Pro, including color correction through Adobe\u2019s Lumetri tools.\nRTX GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 3070 in the ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED, are capable of powering almost anything a video editor can throw at it.\nFor creators like Juan, an NVIDIA Studio laptop powered by a GeForce RTX 3060 will help speed his workflow dramatically. When running multiple apps simultaneously or layering assets and filters, a step up to the GeForce RTX 3070 will be beneficial, especially with 8GB of video memory. He can play back footage at full resolution and minimize dependence on creating proxy files, even leveraging the NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) to export final projects in no time. And he will need a factory calibrated, wide gamut color display to view his content, just like his audience will see it.\nJuan\u2019s needs align with the GeForce RTX 3060-powered Dell XPS 17 and the recently launched, GeForce RTX 3070-powered ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED.\nCreate and Collaborate\nAnita wants to help her friends develop a new indie game and is building out environmental scenes in Unreal Engine. While using the in-engine tools to generate scenery in UE4, she also needs to revise textures using Adobe Substance Painter, and manipulate rigs from open-source modeling tool Blender.\nWorkflows this demanding, with multiple tools open at once, mean Anita will be best served by an NVIDIA Studio laptop powered by an RTX 3080 GPU. Available with 8GB or 16GB of VRAM, she\u2019ll be able to render and manipulate game assets in-engine.\nA Studio laptop like the HP ZBook Studio G8 with a beautiful 4K HDR AMOLED display provides both beauty and brawn.\nPowered by up to a GeForce RTX 3080 or an RTX A5000 GPU, the HP Zbook Studio G8 displays sharp and realistic visuals covering 100 percent of sRGB color gamut for precise color accuracy and highly detailed photorealistic visuals.\nAnd if her team is also powered by NVIDIA Studio, they can collaborate in real time with NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\nSpeed to Save You Time\nFor professional photographers, the hardware requirements can be simpler even while the workflow remains demanding. Julia wants to process and edit photos for her friend\u2019s band using Adobe Lightroom. She could use any computer to manually process each photo she\u2019s keeping from the shoot, but that takes time and time is money.\nWith an NVIDIA Studio laptop powered by an RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti, Julia can use the Enhance features tool in Lightroom that uses machine learning to sharpen and improve image quality, and runs up to 5x faster on NVIDIA GPUs. Or she can boost lower-resolution images with Super Resolution, available in Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom, intelligently enlarging photos while maintaining clean edges and preserving important details.\nThese AI-assisted automation tools run smoothly on the HP Envy 15 or the newly announced ASUS VivoBook Pro, powered by the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti, all without putting her over budget.\nThe ASUS Vivobook Pro features a stunning 14-inch NanoEdge display, powerful GeForce RTX 3050 GPU and extremely lightweight at just over 3 pounds for exceptional portability.\nBeyond these examples, there\u2019s a sweet spot for every creator. Learn more about NVIDIA Studio systems and check out the compare GPU page for a deeper dive including options for professionals.\nFind the \u201cjust right\u201d laptop for a wide-range of creative workflows.\nTake It to the MAX\nNVIDIA Studio is heading to the virtual Adobe MAX next month to enlighten artists and creators on how to supercharge their workflows. It all kicks off on Tuesday, Oct. 26, with an opportunity to share the love. For every click on the Studio sponsor page during the show, a $1 contribution (up to $25k) will be made to P.S.

But others have plenty of FPS and instead want to maximize image quality. NVIDIA DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is a new AI-based anti-aliasing mode for users who have spare GPU headroom and want higher levels of image quality. DLAA uses the same technology developed for DLSS, but works on a native resolution image to maximize image quality instead of boosting performance. The first implementation is available today on the Elder Scrolls Online test servers. Try it out and let us know your feedback on the Driver Feedback Forum.\n\u201cNVIDIA DLAA really improves our game by delivering the best anti-aliasing results in Elder Scrolls Online that we have seen to date.\u201d -- Rich Lambert, Creative Director at ZeniMax Online Studios\nThe first implementation is available today on the Elder Scrolls Online test servers.

Today, we have released our Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers for Windows 11\u2019s October 5th official release, having supported Windows 11 preview builds with WHQL-certified drivers since June.\nGamers get full support for DirectX 12 Ultimate on GeForce RTX graphics cards and laptops, G-SYNC HDR monitor owners can enhance SDR games with Microsoft\u2019s Auto HDR, and RTX graphic cards are primed to support DirectStorage.\nCreators and workers receive new ways to organize and manage their desktops using snap tools, enhanced multi-monitor functionality, and advanced support for touch screens, voice controls, and pen input devices.\nFolks relying on web calls and video conferencing will find innumerable improvements, along with integrated Microsoft Teams, and NVIDIA Broadcast enhancements thanks to under the hood Windows 11 changes.\nAnd STEM students will now have access to NVIDIA\u2019s world-leading AI software platform directly on their Windows 11 PCs; CUDA on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) makes it possible for STEM students to run GPU-accelerated AI using a variety of frameworks and applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming Gets Better\nWindows 11 incorporates top gaming features directly into the PC, giving you a superior experience. And from day 1, GeForce RTX GPUs support them all with the launch of our new Game Ready driver.\n\nDirectX 12 Ultimate: DirectX 12 Ultimate codifies several RTX graphics rendering innovations such as Raytracing, Variable Rate Shading, Sampler Feedback, and Mesh Shaders to help developers make bigger, better worlds with faster performance. \nAuto HDR: The majority of games run in Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). Auto HDR evaluates game content and converts it to High Dynamic Range (HDR), boosting the vibrancy of bright lights, making blacks more accurate, and in general emphasizing the details of a scene, making them more realistic and color accurate. If you play on a G-SYNC ULTIMATE or G-SYNC HDR-capable display, your gameplay will be automatically enhanced in your DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 SDR titles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Microsoft\nGears 5 has a fantastic mastered-for-HDR native implementation which makes it a perfect candidate for demonstration purposes showing that while native, game-studio implemented HDR is the best quality experience, for games that don\u2019t have a native implementation, Auto HDR still brings you a vastly improved experience over regular SDR.\nThe left side of the image above is running in SDR, the middle running in Auto HDR, and the right side running in Gears 5\u2019s amazing native HDR. Grayscale is used to represent all the areas of the scene which can be fully represented by traditional SDR displays while the rainbow colors show areas which are only displayable on HDR capable displays.\nNotice on the middle and right-side images that the highlights on the goggles and helmet show an increased amount of detail. HDR and Auto HDR are not just about boosting brightness but really about emphasizing the details in a scene leveraging the increased range: darkening shadows and illuminating highlights. Looking at Auto HDR and native HDR, you can see the similarities in how the details in the shadows and highlights are much improved using luminance ranges beyond SDR. SDR simply doesn\u2019t have the ability to show the same range of color and luminance the way native HDR and Auto HDR can.\n\nDirectStorage: DirectStorage brings a new standardized implementation of next-gen IO technology that developers of DirectX 12 games can utilize to accelerate loading speeds, and render massive worlds using textures and assets streamed from the NVMe SSD. \n\nThe easiest way to get the correct driver for your system is to download and install GeForce Experience. You\u2019ll be immediately notified when a new driver is released, and GeForce Experience will download the right file for your PC or laptop. Then, with just a few clicks, you can install it and get gaming straight away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreators Can Work Faster With New Features\nNVIDIA Studio drivers provide artists, creators and 3D developers the best performance and reliability when working with creative applications, along with support for GPU acceleration, ray tracing and AI technologies in leading apps. Our newest NVIDIA Studio driver launched today for Windows 10 and 11, bringing support for the latest iteration of NVIDIA Canvas, Jianying video editing software, and an update to the Maxine AR SDK that improves quality and stability of AI-driven body tracking in apps like Notch.\nWindows 11 introduces a wealth of new multitasking features and functionality which are tailored to creators. Specifically, this includes:\n\nCustom Desktops, Snap, and More: On Windows 11, you can create and save custom desktop views with windows and apps fixed in place, allowing you to get your optimized layout in mere seconds. And with a press of a button, flick back to your personal desktop, hiding work when the clock strikes 5.  \nEnhanced Multi-Monitor Handling: Windows 11 makes seamless docking and multi-monitor use a reality. Set your docked and undocked laptop views, and Windows 11 will restore them every time. And when you switch multiple monitors on in the morning, everything will be restored to its previous state.  \nAdvanced Input Device Support: Windows 11 includes native, much-improved support for touch screens, voice input, and pen input, making Windows accessible to all, and giving creatives faster workflows and improved results. \n\nNVIDIA will continue delivering NVIDIA Studio drivers for both Windows 10 and 11 - head to the Drivers tab in GeForce Experience, click the three dots to the right of \u201cCheck For Updates\u201d, select \u201cStudio Driver\u201d, and we\u2019ll deliver the correct driver for your system, ready to be installed with a few clicks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Work and Online Communication Enhancements\nWork from both home and the office will be the future for many. Windows 11 has an extensive suite of changes to support this new model, and brings extra peace of mind to employers with Zero Trust security. Online conference and video calls are also part of the new normal, and Windows 11 features several new changes:\n\nFaster NVIDIA Broadcast Performance: NVIDIA Broadcast is the industry\u2019s leading video and audio enhancement app, using the power of AI and our GPU\u2019s Tensor Cores to make audio clearer, eliminate background noise, and improve video quality. In Windows 11, GPU-accelerated hardware scheduling receives numerous improvements and is enabled by default, enabling users to use NVIDIA Broadcast while they livestream and run a game or 3D app seamlessly.\n\n\nWindows Enhance Audio: A new Sound panel enables Windows 11 users to improve and enhance the audio coming out of their speakers and headphones, making dialog clearer.\n\n\nIntegrated Microsoft Teams: Chat, call and conference via Microsoft Teams, which is now integrated into the taskbar, providing a faster way to connect to colleagues, friends, and family. And with our Windows 11 drivers, GPU acceleration is fully supported, and via the Teams options you can route your audio and video via NVIDIA Broadcast to enhance calls and video conferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete Coursework Faster\nStudents in STEM programs benefit from GPU acceleration for dozens of top applications used in engineering, AI, and data science. Now, with NVIDIA CUDA on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), students can access NVIDIA\u2019s world-leading software platform for artificial intelligence directly from their Windows 11 laptop and desktop PCs. WSL is a feature of Windows 11 that allows students and developers to run native Linux tools and applications directly in Windows. NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA on WSL makes it possible to leverage NVIDIA\u2019s rich platform of GPU-accelerated AI libraries and development tools, including:\n\nSupport for top applications and frameworks: Students can leverage GPU acceleration for popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch and WinML, as well as data science applications like NVIDIA RAPIDS.\n\n\nIncludes dozens of containers and pre-trained models: The NGC Catalog is a collection of\u00a0 container and pre-trained models that make it easy for students to launch workloads for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems, and explore the power of GPU accelerated AI. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI On Windows 11 with CUDA for WSL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Is Primed For Windows 11\nAlong with our GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers, we\u2019ve ensured that all of our supported technologies and features are ready for Windows 11.

The Broadcast app has transformed the homes, apartments and dorm rooms of millions of content creators, remote students and workers into home studios through the power of AI\u2014all without the need to purchase specialized equipment.\nThe latest upgrade, NVIDIA Broadcast version 1.3, is available to download today and further improves noise removal, adds more camera compatibility, and reduces the impact on overall system performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s New in NVIDIA Broadcast 1.3\nNVIDIA Broadcast\u2019s noise removal AI effect has been widely praised for its ability to remove background noise while keeping speech clear and crisp. The exception? When someone speaks with a lot of emotion \u2014 typically speaking loudly or at a higher pitch \u2014 and their speech is sometimes inadvertently removed. This rarely happens, but is typically at the peak moments of excitement during a livestream. The new update addresses this with dedicated training sound profiles to retain that speech while removing the unwanted background noise.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community frequently requests more support for video devices. Now many of your favorite professional and virtual cameras, as well as capture cards, are compatible with NVIDIA Broadcast \u2014 including Canon EOS Webcam Utility, Nikon Webcam Utility, Sony Webcam Utility, OBS Virtual Camera, and more.\nWith version 1.2 we added the ability for users to stack effects. VRAM could become limited when multitaskers run AI features for their microphone, speakers and camera simultaneously. Version 1.3 reduces VRAM usage by over 40%, leading to an increase in FPS while gaming.\u00a0\nFinally, we have several new UI elements and bug fixes that round out a better, smoother, NVIDIA Broadcast experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast is an App and an Ecosystem\nNVIDIA partners with the top creative app developers to accelerate and enhance content creation using Broadcast technology.\u00a0\n\nLive streamers get NVIDIA\u2019s noise removal in OBS Studio 27, Streamlabs, XSplit Broadcaster 4.0, or Gamecaster 4, applying effects per audio source, providing more granular control over audio. Add Xaymar\u2019s StreamFX plugin for OBS to get NVIDIA\u2019s auto frame technology.\nVideo editors and podcasters can add NVIDIA noise removal as a VST filter to any compatible apps using Xaymar\u2019s VoiceFX. This works in Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition, or Audacity 64-bit.\nVFX artists explore Notch\u2019s native integration of virtual background, Face Tracking, and 3D Body Tracking, allowing for advanced VFX effects to be seamlessly added.\nOwners of AVerMedia microphones, headsets or cameras get all relevant NVIDIA Broadcast features directly embedded into the device\u2019s software. AVerMedia\u2019s CamEngine and VoiceEngine software can already enable Broadcast features.\n\nIn order to use NVIDIA Broadcast effects in these apps, users must install the NVIDIA Broadcast redistributable package and update apps to the latest version.\nAnd remember, GeForce GPU owners also have direct access to the NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC), an independent section of the GPU where encoding gets offloaded to. It\u2019s used by OBS Studio, XSplit, Streamlabs, Discord and more to improve streaming performance. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Stop...

This will give us a good idea of how these two GPUs compare, and also give us a second chance to sort of re-review the 6600 XT using real retail pricing, which is kind of nice considering the day-one review was based on assumptions made a week before the 6600 XT hit shelves, so pricing and availability were largely unknown.\nSpeaking with retailers, it did sound as though supply was going to be better. Based on the markup we were seeing for 6700 XT at eBay, we expected that the 6600 XT would cost around $570, and three weeks later the actual figure is close to that at $605. At the time, the average sale price for the RTX 3060 was $720 which remains unchanged. So the Radeon RX 6600 XT is a little worse than we estimated before launch, but it's still better value than the RTX 3060, at least based on the 12 game sample used for the day-one review.\n\nToday we'll be taking real-world pricing data and comparing it across a much larger 30 game sample to see which GPU offers gamers the most value. We'll also take a look at ray tracing performance in the new F1 2021, along with Metro Exodus Enhanced which is a follow-on from the Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, Resident Evil Village, and Watch Dogs Legion results which were featured in the original review.\n\nFor all this testing we used our Ryzen 9 5950X test system with 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 dual-rank, dual-channel memory. Both GPUs were tested at 1080p, 1440p and 4K. Of the 30 games tested, we're going to discuss a few of the most relevant results and then we'll take a look at how these two GPUs compare head-to-head across all games in a single graph towards the conclusion.\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Borderlands 3, we have a rare example of an Unreal Engine 4 game that runs exceptionally well with Radeon GPUs. Here the 6600 XT was a massive 28% faster at 1080p, delivering 92 fps on average using the ultra quality settings which is actually the second-highest quality preset in the game. The 6600 XT was also good for 65 fps on average at 1440p and that meant it was still 27% faster than the RTX 3060, so an easy win here for AMD.\n\n\nNext up we have Total War Warhammer II and here the 6600 XT is actually slightly slower than the RTX 3060. Actually, quite a bit slower at 1440p where the GeForce enjoyed a 15% performance advantage. For those of you gaming at 1080p, the RTX 3060 was just 6% faster, but still not a good title for the 6600 XT.\n\nThe 6600 XT jumps back out in front when testing with Death Stranding, though it has to be said both GPUs delivered excellent performance using the highest in-game quality preset. Although the Radeon was 20% faster at 1080p, the RTX 3060 was still good for 132 fps on average. The margin was slightly reduced at 1440p to 18% in favor of the 6600XT, but even so, the GeForce GPU was good for almost 100 fps on average.\n\nThe 6600 XT blasts ahead in Forza Horizon 4, delivering 17% better performance at 1080p with an incredible 180 fps. The margin was ever so slightly reduced at 1440p.\n\nDays Gone, like Warhammer, is another example where the 6600 XT ends up trailing the RTX 3060, and although the margin isn't huge, we saw very few examples of this in the day-one review. Here we're looking at 5% less performance for the Radeon GPU at 1080p, and 8% less at 1440p.\n\nF1 2021 is the latest title to be added to the huge list of games we benchmark with, and this one enables ray tracing by default on supported hardware when using the ultra high quality preset. That being the case we left it enabled. The 6600 XT does surprisingly well relative to the RTX 3060 as both GPUs delivered comparable performance at all three tested resolutions.\n\nMetro Exodus Enhanced requires hardware-accelerated ray tracing support and without it you'll have to play the original version of the game, which frankly isn't a big deal, but since both of these GPUs support ray tracing it makes sense to benchmark with the 'Enhanced' version. Again, performance is fairly similar at all three tested resolutions, the RTX 3060 was just 4% faster at 1080p which we saw identical performance at 1440p.\n\nNext up we have Red Dead Redemption 2. We're using \"high\" quality settings which have to be set manually as this game doesn't have fixed presets which is super annoying. Anyway, at 1080p the 6600 XT was 9% faster than the RTX 3060, so a decent little win there, but at 1440p performance is much the same, and then exactly the same at 4K.\n\nCS:GO really is a CPU benchmark at this point, with any half-decent GPU resulting in heavily CPU-bound testing, but it's always hotly requested, so we feel compelled to include it, and don't mind doing so when there are so many other games to balance out the results. As expected, we're looking at similar performance between these two GPUs at the three tested resolutions.\n\nPerformance in Apex Legends is very competitive, but this title isn't CPU limited, at least not with these GPUs using the maximum in-game quality settings. Both GPUs allowed for solid 144 Hz gaming at 1080p and even at 1440p you're still looking at a high refresh rate experience.\n\nIn Outriders we're looking at very similar performance using either GPU again. The RX 6600 XT was a smidge faster at 1080p, while we're looking at identical performance at 1440p.\n\nUsing our updated Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark pass we find close results in this highly demanding title. Please note ray tracing has not been enabled and we're also not using the highest quality preset, instead, settling for the second-highest option.\nPerformance Summary\nIn our day-one review of the Radeon RX 6600 XT the new AMD GPU was ~10% faster than the RTX 3060 at 1080p and just 5% faster at 1440p. So it will be interesting to see how those margins compare to what we find when testing with 30 games, so let's find out...\n\nAt 1080p we see that the margin has decreased from 10% in favor of the Radeon GPU to just 6%, not a massive change but it's certainly less favorable for AMD. The decline is largely due to the inclusion of titles such as PUBG, Days Gone, Flight Simulator 2020, Warhammer II, Biomutant, and F1 2021.\n\nThen at 1440p the margin is even slimmer, coming from 5% in the original 6600 XT review to just 3% across the 30 game sample, which is basically a tie. The 6600 XT saw its most favorable results in Valorant, Borderlands 3, World War Z, Death Stranding and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\n\nWhat We Learned\nOverall the Radeon RX 6600 XT is the faster GPU, which we already knew from previous testing, but the margin is slimmer than first thought. The delta between the two GPUs will always depend on the games used for testing \u2013 or in your case, the games you actually care about. Ray tracing performance seems fairly even in the few titles we tested, though we'd say the RTX 3060 has better support right now overall.\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 also benefits from DLSS support, which is far more widespread than FSR, and in our opinion works much better at lower resolutions such as 1080p.\n\nThe Nvidia encoder, often referred to as Nvenc, is also commonly pushed as a big plus for GeForce graphics cards, but we've found little difference between ShadowPlay and ReLive for capturing gameplay lately. AMD's solution appears to work very well now, so perhaps Nvenc is no longer a differentiating advantage anymore.\n\nAs for pricing and availability, that's where the Radeon RX 6600 XT appears to offer the biggest advantage of all. To best illustrate that, here's a few cost per frame graphs.\n\nPricing will fluctuate considerably depending on where you live. In Australia the situation is kind of extreme, the 6600 XT can be had for $730 Aussie when looking at in-stock and readily available models, while the RTX 3060 costs $1100, which is a massive 51% premium for the GeForce GPU. In terms of cost per frame, the RTX 3060 is 61% more expensive than the 6600 XT in this market at 1080p and 54% more per frame at 1440p.\n\nIn the US, the situation is far less radical. Looking at eBay listings, the RTX 3060 is 19% more expensive. That still means that the RTX 3060 is 27% more costly per frame than the Radeon at 1080p and 22% at 1440p. Even over at Newegg the RTX 3060 will set you back 28% more per frame and with the 6600 XT you're getting a MSI B550 Tomahawk motherboard included, so it makes much more sense for US shoppers to snap up that deal, rather than shop at eBay.\n\nBottom line, the Radeon RX 6600 XT currently offers gamers significantly more value than the GeForce RTX 3060, and therefore should be the go-to option for those looking this level of performance. Unless you play specific games that are favored by DLSS/RT enhancements, that's our clear recommendation.\nThis situation is unlikely to change for Nvidia GPUs anytime soon after the company stated they expect supply issues for the RTX 3060 series to continue into September, so it's unclear if supply will improve before the end of 2021. Mining has kept driving GPU prices higher, though of course, we'll continue to monitor pricing and availability with monthly updates.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nRadeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5900X on Amazon\nRyzen 5 5600X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 84\n\n\n Got something to say?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Free stock tips and stock research newsletter at https://io-fund.comFollow AuthorSep 02, 2021, 06:43pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.\"Nvidia could surpass Apple in five years as the artificial intelligence economy will be nearly four ... [+] times larger than the mobile economy that drove Apple.\" - Beth Kindig, I/O FundCorbis via Getty Images\nLast week, I wrote that Nvidia could surpass Apple in five years as the artificial intelligence economy will be nearly four times larger than the mobile economy that drove Apple. To get an understanding of how big the AI economy will be, we pointed towards estimates of AI adding $15 trillion in GDP once it reaches maturation in 2030 compared to mobile adding $4.4 trillion to GDP in the current year.\n\n\nThe analysis discussed some of the underlying product strength Nvidia has with its GPUs and its new software suite that allows accelerated AI computing on virtual machines rather than bare metal servers. We also revisited my original thesis around the GPU-powered cloud and developer adoption of CUDA, both of which are still intact three years later.\n\nThere are numerous forward-looking catalysts for Nvidia as enterprises will seek to lower costs and increase production with AI. In fact, while I wrote the AI economy would be four times larger, Jensen Huang predicts that \u201cOmniverse or the Metaverse is going to be a new economy this is larger than our current economy.\u201d \n\n\nWell then, so much for correlating the AI economy to the mobile economy as Huang predicts an entirely separate revenue segment will surpass our current GDP of $84.7 trillion.\n\n\nLet\u2019s Start with Metaverse Basics:\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThe dry definition of the Metaverse is a shared virtual 3D world that is interactive, immersive, and collaborative. The word \u201cMetaphrase\u201d was first coined by American writer Neal Stephenson in his science fiction Snow Crash in the year 1992. However, the word meta dates back to the Greek era, which means \u201cafter\u201d or \u201cbeyond.\u201d\n\nThere are many other articles online that describe the Metaverse in detail, like this one in Forbes by Cathy Hackl. She points out that the Metaverse is described as \u201cdigital realities where people work, play and socialize.\u201d In some ways, social media and gaming are the stepping stones to these virtual realities. How many of us have friends and acquaintances on social media that we have never met, such as on Twitter or on Fortnite, or people we haven\u2019t seen in decade yet feel close to, such as on Facebook or LinkedIn?\n\n\nIf you experience moments where your virtual life online feels as real as your physical life, then you\u2019ve dipped your toe into the idea of a Metaverse.\nThe idea of a virtual economy already exists in many games where you can trade virtual goods and where players are paid for creating content. The idea of crypto mining is also an example of where real-world work is exchanged for virtual currency (and value). Now that Bitcoin at $1 trillion and rivaling the market cap of FAAMG stocks, we have already seen some evidence of a virtual world translating to the real world.\u00a0\nThis new economy will be a combined effort of many companies and users. As mentioned, the term Metaverse is not new and has been used by tech companies over the past few years. Microsoft Xbox head, Phil Spencer made this point four years ago that he is a believer in the Metaverse. In addition to the various gaming and AR/VR tools that the company offers, it also purchased Minecraft maker Mojang Studios. Minecraft could be one of the pioneers of Metaverse in the future due to the digital world games and its large user base.\nRoblox is another company that was early to this concept. On average more than 36 million young people come to Roblox to play, learn, and interact in a 3D virtual space. Neil Rimer, co-founder of Index Ventures which is an early investor in Roblox, rightly said in an interview with CNBC that \u201cNo single company can build a metaverse. It has to be a community.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to point out that there are false starts and early spinouts in technology. I had written at length about why autonomous vehicles were an impossibility by 2020 when the financial news had generated a hornet\u2019s nest worth of buzz. Three years later, and we do not have robotaxis or anything of the sort driving commercially on roads. Similarly, The Metaverse will take time to build.\n\nWhere Will the Metaverse Be Built?\nNvidia\u2019s Omniverse is the simulation and collaboration platform that will be partly used to build the Metaverse. More than 50,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since it opened Beta in December 2020 compared to 2 million that have registered with the CUDA platform. The number of creators is now opened up due to integrations with Blender and Adobe, where it can potentially reach millions of additional users.\nIn the words of CEO Jensen Huang, \u201cWe are thrilled to have launched NVIDIA Omniverse, a simulation platform nearly five years in the making that runs physically realistic virtual worlds and connects to other digital platforms. We imagine engineers, designers and even autonomous machines connecting to Omniverse to create digital twins and industrial metaverses.\u201d\nIt makes sense that Nvidia is early to this market as the company has worked ten years on the ray tracing technology used in the RTX Turing GPUs. The RTX platform was invented by Nvidia to \u201cphysically simulate light behavior in the world\u201d and combines RT cores for ray tracing with Tensor Cores for AI. This drives Nvidia\u2019s professional visualization revenue segment, which was up 156% year-over-year and up 40% sequentially.\nThe company also invented the ability to simulate physics and create architectures in the cloud to build \u201cconnectors.\u201d This led to the development of USD, or Universal Scene Description, which allows for a portal into virtual worlds. These virtual worlds are then used to train robots or to create concerts and theme parks.\nThis year\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference event slides were made from the company\u2019s own Omniverse platform to make the presentation more interactive. The main highlight of GTC 2021 was a perfect virtual replica of Jensen Huang\u2019s kitchen and with a digital clone of the CEO himself. The details given in the video of The Making of the GTC Keynote shows the combined work of NVIDIA\u2019s deep learning and graphics research teams with several engineering teams and the company\u2019s in-house creative team.\nTo create the virtual keynote, the teams had to take several photos of the kitchen and Jensen to create the 3D model that could mimic his gestures. The keynote raised debates as to which parts were rendered and which parts were real. A TechRadar article had said that the entire presentation was not real. However, Nvidia reached out to the company to note that while \u201cJensen's corporeal form may have been rendered during portions of the keynote, it was Jensen Huang himself who was speaking at the presentation.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s post on the making of GTC made sure it was clarified. To be sure, you can\u2019t have a keynote without a flesh and blood person at the center. Through all but 14 seconds of the hour and 48 minute presentation \u2014 from 1:02:41 to 1:02:55 \u2014 Huang himself spoke in the keynote.\n\nOmniverse Use Cases\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise has made it possible for 3D production teams to work seamlessly together on complex projects. Rather than requiring in-person meetings or exchanging and iterating on massive files, design teams can work simultaneously in a virtual world from anywhere.\nNVIDIA is working with various industry leaders using the company\u2019s Omniverse platform in real-time situations. Omniverse enterprise software is in the early access stage and might be available later this year from NVIDIA\u2019s partners, including Dell, HP, and others. Over 500 companies are evaluating Omniverse Enterprise, including BMW, Volvo, Lockheed Martin, Ericsson, and Bentley Systems.\nNvidia pointed out on the earnings call that there is a \u201cFactory of the Future\u201d that was developed on the Omniverse platform and that companies like BMW are using RTX and USD to simulate factories: \u201cWe've got a shared GTC Factory of the Future that is designed completely in Omniverse, robots trading Omniverse with goods and materials that are its original CAD data put into the battery. The logistics plan, like an ERP system, except this an ERP system of physical grids and physical simulation simulated through this Omniverse world, and you could plan the entire factory in Omniverse.\nThis will help BMW to increase the speed in decision-making and improve efficiency. The new approach will help to view their entire factory in simulation mode with photorealistic detail. Another advantage is that data is available immediately and any changes can be made in the planning stage itself, which saves time and money.\nBentley Software is an infrastructure engineering software company that builds complex infrastructure projects. The Bentley iTwin platform allows engineering firms to create and analyze digital twins of infrastructure assets. The result is millimeter-accurate digital content that even allows users to explore and even walk through infrastructure in real time. The digital twins are explored across multiple devices including AR/VR headsets. Foster + Partners, the architectural design and engineering firm that built Apple\u2019s headquarters, is also testing Omniverse to help them render virtual sets in real-time.\n\nBeyond the Omniverse:\nAs stated in the introduction, Jensen Huang said in the earnings call, \u201cI'm fairly sure at this point that Omniverse or the Metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy.\u201d If that\u2019s true, then many companies will be winners in the space. Facebook is certainly trying as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \u201cI expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company\u201d. \nMy personal opinion is that Facebook has too many privacy issues and (frankly) a poor reputation to find much uptake in new markets. We\u2019ve seen the company fail many times at attempts to move into stable coins, dating, Facebook gifts, Parse, among others. Not to mention the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, with its only success outside of the social network being accomplished through acquisitions. Regardless, the company is likely to get the kind of headlines that investors tend to rely on.\nUnity, Epic Games and Roblox have arguably the best audience as they\u2019ll target gamers for the Metaverse. The trick will be recruiting non-gaming audiences to produce a bigger market than what is currently being monetized through gaming.\u00a0\nFor a list of investable Metaverse companies, check out the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF META provides exposure to companies that are involved in Metaverse. NVIDIA is currently its largest holding followed by Microsoft, Roblox, Tencent, Unity and Autodesk.\n\nConclusion:\nIf the Metaverse economy surpasses the real-world economy, as Huang predicts, then one day we may look back at Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote in a fully rendered kitchen and memorialize this moment similar to Steve Jobs keynote in 2007. \nHowever, the beauty of a company like Nvidia is that I don\u2019t have to time the Metaverse in order to see real gains. If the Metaverse thesis takes longer than expected to materialize, I am still bullish on the company due to its AI and GPU-cloud capabilities that is driving many industries. In fact, I am so bullish on Nvidia for AI that I believe the company can outpace even Apple, which I covered here.\n\n\nAs stated in the article, Beth Kindig and I/O Fund currently own shares of NVDA.

That\u2019s why DBSS flats are considered a rare breed on the HDB resale market. What sets DBSS flats apart is that they were built by private developers, and their first owners purchased them directly from the developer rather than the HDB. However, as DBSS flats are still considered HDB flats, buyers are eligible for CPF housing grants and are also required to fulfil HDB\u2019s eligibility criteria.  DBSS flats are one of the most expensive HDB flat types available on the resale market and are sought after for their relative spaciousness. For instance, 5-room DBSS flats typically have four bedrooms, in comparison with regular 5-room HDB flats, which have just three. Some DBSS flats also have a balcony. Just recently, a 5-room DBSS flat in Bishan was sold for a record-breaking $1.295 million, indicating that demand for this unique flat type endures.

Collectively, over 20 million hours of gameplay are streamed each month via GeForce NOW, from 30 data centers in more than 70 countries.\n\u201cGeForce NOW expands the reach of the GeForce PC gaming experience to reach millions of underserved gamers on new devices and in new regions,\u201d said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of the GeForce business at NVIDIA. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for Electronic Arts to get some of their most beloved franchises into the hands of a rapidly growing global audience instantly.\u201d\nThe Cloud Catalyst to EA\u2019s Next Massive Audience\r\nGeForce NOW allows Electronic Arts games to be played with legendary GeForce\u00ae performance by gamers who may not have a gaming PC\u2014 that includes more than 1 billion underpowered PCs and incompatible devices, like phones, tablets and Chromebooks. Nearly 80 percent of the devices that currently access GeForce NOW would not otherwise be capable of playing the latest PC games.\nGeForce NOW is connected to the most popular game stores \u2014 including Steam and Epic Games Store \u2014 a win-win for developers and gamers. No additional development work or porting is required of developers, while gamers get access to hit titles from their library without having to purchase the games again, or having to deal with hefty downloads, patches and updates. Electronic Arts games can be added quickly to GeForce NOW through regular \u201cGFN Thursday\u201d releases.\nStream It Now\r\nFive games from some of Electronic Arts\u2019 most popular franchises are available on GeForce NOW, starting today. Members can stream Battlefield 1 Revolution to experience immersive untold stories of World War I; become a heroic leader and restore order against agents of chaos in Dragon Age: Inquisition; solve puzzles with the family-friendly Unravel Two; or dive into a fast-paced, free-running adventure with Mirror\u2019s Edge Catalyst.\nThese additions from Electronic Arts join one of the most-played games on GeForce NOW, Apex Legends. The high-speed hero shooter has already been streamed by more than 1 million members.\nGlobal Availability\r\nThe initial set of Electronic Arts games is streaming today in more than 70 countries, including through the GeForce NOW Alliance network \u2014 a partnership of operators using NVIDIA RTX\u2122 Servers and NVIDIA cloud-gaming software to expand and provide the GeForce NOW cloud gaming experience globally.\nAlliance partners in Russia, Turkey, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia were recently joined by new regional operators in Australia, Singapore, Brazil and select other South American countries.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

To people from anywhere else in the world, nothing in Singapore is really cheap except the bus, MRT and hawker food. But if you\u2019ve been trawling through property listings in search of a condo, at some point any property under the $1 million mark starts to look like it could be sold at Daiso. To weed out the best deals in the bargain bin, here are the cheapest condos currently available on 99.co. (Disclaimer: MoneySmart is not being paid by 99.co. They don\u2019t even know we\u2019ve been trawling through their site for this article. All photos are grabbed from 99.co listings.) 9 cheapest condos in Singapore under $600,000  CondoNearest MRTPrice The HillfordBeauty World$505,000 Parc RosewoodWoodlands / Woodlands South$528,000 Kovan GrandeurKovan$538,000 High Park ResidencesThanggam LRT / Sengkang MRT$549,000 Pavilion SquareAljunied$550,000 Sol AcresTeck Whye LRT / Bukit Panjang MRT$568,000 StratumPasir Ris$570,000 Glasgow ResidenceKovan$588,000 Avila GardensTampines East$580,000  1. The Hillford    There\u2019s a reason The Hillford is so cheap. It was conceived as a \u201cretirement resort\u201d composed of 1- and 2-bedroom apartments, and comes with a lease of only 60 years. That said, there is no age requirement for buyers or residents. At $505,000 for this 398 sq ft one-bedroom apartment, you might even have some money left over to actually retire.  The 2017 condo is located at Jalan Jurong Kechil in the Upper Bukit Timah area about 8 minutes\u2019 walk from Beauty World MRT and within walking distance of the area\u2019s food and lifestyle area along Cheong Chin Nam Road. It\u2019s also a good location for those who\u2019ve morphed into nature lovers during Covid, as both the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Nature Park are only 15 minutes\u2019 walk away. Price: $505,000 ($1,268.84 psf) 2. Parc Rosewood    Parc Rosewood is an example of a condo that is cheap because of its far-flung location in Woodlands. This 431 sq ft unit is just $528,000, with the potential for further cost savings if you do your groceries in JB when borders reopen. In non-Covid times, this location would have been ideal for people who spent lots of time in JB and wanted to do everyday stuff like go to the dentist across the Causeway. Right now, the condo\u2019s saving grace is that it\u2019s got access to two MRT lines, Woodlands on the North South Line and Woodlands South on the Thomson-East Coast Line, if you don\u2019t mind walking over 15 minutes to get to them. Price: $528,000 ($1,225.06 psf)   Story continues 3. Kovan Grandeur  Don\u2019t mind squeezing into a shoebox studio apartment? Then this 366 sq ft studio at Kovan Grandeur might be for you. While \u201cgrandeur\u201d is most certainly false advertising, at $538,000, you can\u2019t really ask for more.While the location in the Hougang area isn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d call central, it\u2019s not really boondock-level ulu and Kovan MRT is a comfortable 11 minutes\u2019 walk away.Price: $538,000 ($1,469.95 sq ft)4. High Park Residences  This 388 sq ft studio apartment is yet another example of how you can always find cheap condo units in ulu locations. The unit, which costs $549,000, is located in Sengkang, which doesn\u2019t sound that bad, until you discover that you\u2019ll have to take the LRT.Thanggam LRT station is only 5 minutes\u2019 walk away, but if you want to skip the LRT and get to the MRT straight away, you\u2019ll need to factor in almost 30 minutes of walking to Sengkang MRT.Price: $549,800 ($1,417.01 psf)5. Pavilion Square  Living in Geylang isn\u2019t that bad. You get to eat durian whenever you want, amongst other things. Another advantage of living smack in the middle of the red light district is that properties tend to be quite cheap, considering you\u2019re living on the city fringe.Take this 1-bedroom, 398 sq ft condo unit in Pavilion Square, for example. Located on Geylang Road by Lorong 16, it\u2019s a friggin\u2019 freehold apartment for just $550,000, located 8 minutes\u2019 walk from Aljunied MRT.Price: $550,000 ($1,381.91 psf)6. Sol Acres  Sol Acres is actually an Executive Condo (EC) whose first owners moved in in 2019. So, the property still has 8 years to go before it gets converted to private property. But hey, that means you\u2019ll get to apply for CPF grants if you buy it now.This 1-bedroom unit costs just $568,000 and measures 495 sq ft, which is practically palatial as far as 1-bedroom condos go.However, you\u2019ll have to be content with living quite a distance from the nearest MRT station, Bukit Panjang, which is about 21 minutes\u2019 walk away. Alternatively, Teck Whye LRT station is only 6 minutes\u2019 walk away, but everybody in that area hates the LRT so that\u2019s perhaps not really a plus.Price: $568,000 ($1,147.47 psf)7. Stratum  Studio apartments usually mean the sleeping and living areas are not separate, but at this newly-renovated studio apartment at Stratum, a partition has been built between the two. At 474 sq ft, it\u2019s quite spacious, so you\u2019re essentially buying a 1-bedroom apartment for the price of a studio.Situated on Elias Road across the road from Elias Mall and a short walk from Pasir Ris Park, it\u2019s in a rather nice location. Pasir Ris MRT is a bit far away at 18 minutes, but given the low psf price, I think it\u2019s still worth it.Price: $570,000 ($1,202.53 psf)8. Glasgow Residence  Glasgow Residence is a small 5-storey apartment block located in a low-density pocket in the Hougang/Kovan area, 11 minutes\u2019 walk from Kovan MRT. The property has basic facilities like two small swimming pools and barbecue pits, and that\u2019s about it. The upside of living in a smaller condo is of course that you don\u2019t have to share the common areas with thousands of noisy neighbours and their kids.This 420 sq ft, 1-bedroom unit is one of the more expensive condos on this list, but it\u2019s still quite cheap considering it\u2019s a 999-year leasehold property, ie. virtually freehold. Actually, it\u2019s marked as a 1-bedroom unit but based on the pictures it looks more like a studio. Best to book an appointment if you really want to know the truth.Price: $588,000 ($1,400 psf)9. Avila Gardens  Avila Gardens is located in a low density area in the east, very near Changi Airport which has been relegated to being nothing more than a big shopping mall since 2020.The main downside is that the nearest MRT, Tampines East, is a sweat-inducing 20 minutes\u2019 walk away, making it less troublesome to take a plane to a neighbouring country than to get to work in the CBD.This freehold studio apartment costs just $580,000 and is quite spacious at 463 sq ft\u2014big enough to separate the sleeping area with a screen, as the owners have done.Price: $580,000 ($1,252.70 psf)Can you afford the condo downpayment?When buying a condo, your only financing option is a bank loan \u2014 the HDB loan is, of course, not applicable.As with all bank loans, borrowing restrictions apply. You\u2019ll need to put down a condo downpayment of at least 25%, of which at least 5% must be in cash. The remaining 20% can be paid in cash and/or with CPF Ordinary Account savingsRead more: Downpayment for Condo: How Much Do First-Timers Need in Singapore?So, to buy a $600,000 condo, you need to fork out at least $30,000 in cash, and at least $150,000 in CPF OA. Not enough in your CPF? You\u2019ll need to top up the balance in cash.You\u2019ll also need to factor in extra costs like legal fees and registration fees, which should cost you anywhere from about $1,000 to $2,000, as well as stamp duty, which for a $600,000 would cost you $12,600 provided you are a Singaporean who doesn\u2019t own any other properties.Finally, assuming you manage to borrow the maximum of 75%, you\u2019re looking at monthly repayments of $1,500 for a 25 year loan, not including any interest.Save a bit of cash by picking a home loan with an attractive interest rate with the help of MoneySmart\u2019s home loan wizard.Things to note before you buy a condoOther than the price and the location, you might want to consider the following factors before splashing out on a condo:Size: Condos are priced at a premium, so you\u2019ll get much less per square foot than you would with an HDB flat. Something to think about if you think you might need more space in future.HDB eligibility: If you decide to buy an HDB flat one day, you\u2019ll have to sell your condo at least 30 months before. If you successfully ballot for a BTO flat, you can time the sale of the condo for 30 months before picking up the keys to the flat, but if you buy a resale flat you\u2019ll have to arrange for alternative accommodation for 30 months before moving into your new place.Lease: Freehold or leasehold? If you have kids you want to inherit your wealth, freehold property retains its value much better but is more expensive.Found this article useful?

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Let\u2019s look at the Chime benefits listed in the reviews      Nik   10 September 2021 8 min read            Laura Klein   Chime has received a great deal of good press recently. But is that good press to be believed? Are the Chime reviews singing the banking and technology company\u2019s praises really telling the whole story? Here, we play the part of a reviewer and look at all the reasons we can confidently answer \u201cyes\u201d. Chime is as good as the reviews claim. We\u2019ll do so by answering some frequently asked questions about Chime and its services. What is a Chime account? First, though, it is beneficial to go over exactly what Chime is and the services it offers. In short, Chime offers digital personal finance services to people, wherever they are. There is no need to access their services through a physical location or even a desktop computer. The idea behind Chime was to create an alternative to traditional banks. As a result, customers can expect no monthly fees, no overdraft fees, early access to direct deposits, and access to a large ATM network.  Their hope is to make financial peace of mind a reality for everyone. Managing money through Chime is easy, simple, and effective. The company ensures that it puts its customers first. So, unlike banks of old who once profited from selling products to customers, Chime wants to improve customers\u2019 lives. That\u2019s why there are no fees and why they allow customers to access a paycheck two days early with direct deposit features. Perhaps most importantly, Chime helps customers save automatically, helping them grow their wealth. Users can set up their account with a direct deposit so that part of their paycheck goes directly into their savings account. Plus Chime helps its users build credit with their Chime Credit Builder Card. Carrying no annual fee and requiring no credit check, it\u2019s a great way to start building credit in a secure and easy manner. Is Chime FDIC insured? While Chime itself is not FDIC insured, its partner banks are, which is great news as it makes it far more secure to use than some other online banking competitors. Being FDIC insured means that Chime\u2019s customer\u2019s funds are insured up to $250,000 through the Bancorp Bank, or Stride Bank, N.A. That\u2019s crucial to know since it means that all your cash will be protected up to $250,000 in your savings account in the unlikely event that there is a run on the banks. FDIC-insured status is vital for a financial institution to have as a customer. It means that you do not have to purchase deposit insurance in addition to any fees that a bank may charge you (though Chime has no monthly fees for its accounts). It is also vital as it means that should your bank fail, the FDIC can protect you. The insurance amount is for each account ownership category you have at the insured bank. The FDIC covers traditional bank deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts \u2013 two account types that Chime offers its customers. It may sound like a lot of money that the FDIC has to cover, but since it was established in 1933, no depositor has lost any money at FDIC-insured banks.   Story continues Is Chime safe?Thanks to its state-of-the-art security features and its bank partners being FDIC-insured, Chime can be considered safe. Those that use the mobile app to stay on top of their financial affairs often proclaim that due to its ease of access, they can quickly see if anything has happened on their account, and it is far quicker than with a traditional bank, plus chime user\u2019s can also block their card from the app, meaning it will no longer be useable.Safe and quick withdraws from your Chime savings accountAnd with Chime, you can receive direct deposits and can also provide the ability to make pre-authorized withdrawals and ACH transfers. While it also offers free transactions as a standard \u2013 as well as free person-to-person transfers \u2013 it also integrates with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. These also have the highest security features to ensure that it is safe to make financial transactions. Finally, Chime has teamed up with several ATM providers so that customers can safely withdraw money from more than 60,000 fee-free locations at everyday stores like Walgreens, CVS, and 7Eleven.So, just because it does not have the traditional brick and mortar outlets does not make it less safe than a bank with a branch. In fact, since it does not have a complicated array of products, it is arguably better to use thanks to a more simplified business model. There are no certificates of deposits or money market accounts offered at Chime. Instead, it provides debit cards, credit cards, a spending account, and a savings account. The savings account offers a competitive rate compared to the rest of the market. Plus, it encourages saving through many features that allow for automated and regular savings. Those savings are safe thanks to its partners being FDIC -insured.Is Chime bank legit?Chime Bank is absolutely a legitimate service. Its services are based around using phones to manage money through its app \u2013 but that does not make it any less legitimate than another bank where you can only access your money at a physical branch. Plus, it does not charge any hidden fees, For example, there are no overdraft fees \u2013 in fact, customers can spend up to $200 on a debit card even if they do not have the funds to back it up. Chime will cover the money spent on the card and not charge you any overdraft fees for the privilege. Plus, there is no minimum balance required and no monthly fees. Typically, those two fees cut into a customer\u2019s account balance, but you will be able to save more money without them. Perhaps most important of all, the company does not charge any foreign transaction fees. That is an incredibly unique offering since foreign transactions are typically where banks make a lot of money. But Chime puts users first, and, as review, after review says, they will do everything they can to help you avoid loans and save more money.Can you get scammed on Chime?It is hard to get scammed on Chime. The reason why is because Chime alerts you whenever you make a transaction with your account. That\u2019s key to keeping fraud to a minimum. It means that you are notified whenever money is used from your account \u2013 so you will know if money was spent that wasn\u2019t verified. You are always in the know about what is going in and out of your account. Plus, with daily balance alerts, you can keep track of how much money you have in your account \u2013 again a great way to know whether any fraudulent activity has unexpectedly occurred.Security measures for your Chime savings accountHowever, that fraudulent activity will be highly unlikely to happen given how seriously Chime takes its security. Given that it is an online app, there is an assumption made by many that such apps are more prone to identity theft.However, that is not the case with Chime since it uses secure processes to ensure that your information is protected. Its procedures mean that any unauthorized use is prevented. And, should you find yourself, victim, to an identity theft scheme, the bank is quick to react. Such thefts can occur at even traditional banks, so it is not just a challenge for online financial service companies. How companies respond to identity theft is the key. If you report that money was stolen from your Chime account, it will be reimbursed by the bank in no time at all. Often under 48 hours.Can you trust Chime?Chime can be trusted. While it can be tough to believe all the five-star reviews the company has received, it really can provide its customers with the best banking experience.Chime can be a great option if you have had issues in the past with your credit history. This innovative company looks past the history of a customer and considers all applications for a bank account on a case-by-case basis. It does not immediately write off potential customers simply because they have had difficulty managing their finances previously. That is one reason Chime started \u2013 it wanted to empower customers to build financial wealth, health, and resilience.Finally, having FDIC-insured partner banks is key to establishing trust with customers. As its partner banks are FDIC-insured, customers can be sure that their accounts, up to $250,000 in value, are covered should there be a reason for the bank to fail.Chime reviews \u2013 In summaryIt can be so easy to dismiss a 5-star review after a 5-star Chime review. It often makes a product seem too good to be true. However, in the case of Chime, the stars, comments, and reviews are true. The company has a stellar product with effective, streamlined, and efficient technology at its heart. It makes staying on top of your financial affairs easy so that finally reaching financial independence is achievable. Even for those who have, in the past, had money problems.This article Is Chime as good as chime reviews say?

The sale was brokered by exclusive marketing agent CBRE.  Read also: En bloc sale of The Asteria for $27.1 mil According to a property title search, the property was owned by The Lady Superior of the Convent of The Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) in Penang. The buyer, Cyberpoint Capital Pte Ltd, is one of the companies under Lee Rubber Co. Pte Ltd. Why would Lee Rubber be interested in the property? It is a great addition to its landbank, for the house at 12 Martia Road is adjacent to a property that Lee Rubber already owns: a building that sits on a land area of 60,442 sq ft, according to EdgeProp Inspector. The building now houses the campus of Odyssey The Global Preschool.    Source: EdgeProp Inspector    Exterior of the conservation building at 25 Still Road South where Odyssey The Global Preschool campus is located (Source: GoogleMaps) Lee Rubber owns the property on the opposite side of the road too, namely 26 Still Road South, which is now Pat\u2019s Schoolhouse Katong. The property has a land area of 46,738 sq ft, according to EdgeProp Inspector. Both Pat\u2019s Schoolhouse and Odyssey The Global Preschool are part of UK childcare services provider Busy Bees, which leased both properties from Lee Rubber in 2016. Busy Bees spent $5 million renovating both buildings.    Source: EdgeProp Inspector Built in 1917, the two historic buildings at Still Road South were once part of a grand Victorian-style mansion of Indian cattle merchant, Moona Kadir Sultan. He had named it Karikal Mahal. However, when he went into debt and was made bankrupt in 1936, the property was seized and sold. After the war, the property was refurbished and opened as the 20-room Grand Hotel, which at that time was within walking distance of the seaside. In 1947, the hotel was taken over by Lee Rubber.  The government had acquired part of the land to build a new extension for Still Road, namely Still Road South in 1973. That was when the property was cut into two. Land reclamation for the development of Marina Parade town meant that the Grand Hotel was no longer within walking distance of the seaside.    The conserved building at 26 Still Road South which now houses Pat Schoolhouse was part of the former Grand Hotel (Photo: GoogleMaps) Still, the Grand Hotel remained in operation until 2000. The buildings were then left vacant, although part of the premises was used as a temporary storage space for unwanted furniture. The two buildings at Still Road South were given conservation status by URA in 2009.   Story continues Sitting behind Pat's Schoolhouse is a row of 40 single-storey, pre-war semi-detached houses at No. 1 to 40 Kuo Chuan Avenue. The houses were said to be built in the 1920s by businessman and philanthropist Lee Kong Chian and the founder of Lee Rubber. They reportedly use to house the employees of Lee Rubber.In June this year, written permission was received for the demolition of the existing houses, according to EdgeProp Inspector. The houses occupy a land area of 74,467 sq ft.  Source: EdgeProp Inspector  The existing pre-war housea at Kuo Chuan Avenue (Source: GoogleMaps)Meanwhile, the house at Martia Road does not have conservation status. The site is zoned for residential development of up to five storeys, and is located near top schools such as CHIJ Katong Primary School and Tao Nan School as well as amenities such as the Marine Terrace MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast Line and Parkway Parade shopping centre. The property will be sold with vacant possession, says Michael Tay, CBRE head of capital markets, the exclusive marketing agent who brokered the sale.  Source: EdgeProp InspectorThe transaction at 12 Martia Road has excited interest of its neighbours, particularly owners of the row of eight terraced houses at 10, 10A to 10G Martia Road next door. The intermediate terraced house at 10A which sits on a land area of 1,620 sq ft changed hands for $2.95 million ($1,821 psf) last December. Eight months later at the end of August, the intermediate terraced house at 10E sitting on a land area of 1,630 sq ft fetched $3.88 million ($2,381 psf) or 31.5% higher.

Mention cyber attacks in Singapore and the IHiS, Singtel and the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) data breach incidents will come to mind. One might think that due to the size and amount of data that they hold, these large organisations will be prime targets for attackers.  However, that does not seem to be the case. A new study by networking company Cisco, which surveyed 3,700 small and medium businesses (SMBs) across Asia Pacific, has shown that a significant percentage of small companies are facing cyber attacks as well. In the last 12 months, about 40% of SMBs in Singapore suffered a cyber incident. As a result of these incidents, 56% lost customer information to the hands of malicious actors. Furthermore, these attacks have a tangible financial impact. More than half (51%) of SMBs in Singapore that suffered cyber incidents in the past 12 months said the financial impact of those incidents on the business was US$500,000 or more, with 11% claiming that the impact was at least US$1 million. Understandably, SMBs are worried about such risks as they have been \u201cdigitalising rapidly over the last 18 months, driven by the need to leverage technology to survive and thrive in this challenging environment,\u201d says Andy Lee, managing director for Cisco in Singapore and Brunei.  This increased digitalisation has led to an increase in the \u201cattack surface\u201d that can be exploited since SMBs may not have the financial muscle to employ the multiple layers of security that larger corporations have. Malware attacks have been the most common way, with 79% of SMBs surveyed saying they have experienced such attacks in the past year. Beyond the attack itself, disruptions caused by cyber incidents can have serious implications for SMBs. The majority (93%) of SMBs in Singapore said that downtime of more than an hour results in severe operational disruption, and 90% claimed it would result in loss of revenue. Furthermore, over a third of SMBs (36%) cited that a downtime of more than a day would result in a permanent closure of their organisation. In spite of these significant implications to business, only 8% of respondents in Singapore are confident of detecting a cyber incident within an hour. The number of those who are able to remediate a cyber incident within an hour is even lower at 5%.  The good news is that SMBs in Singapore are actively taking steps to understand and improve their cybersecurity posture. Cisco found that most local SMBs have completed scenario planning and/or simulations for potential cybersecurity incidents (72%) in the past 12 months, and have cyber response (78%) and recovery plans (81%) in place.   Story continues 82% of respondents who completed scenario planning and/or simulations uncovered weak points or issues in their cyber defences.Of those that identified weaknesses, 94% said they had the right technologies in place, but lacked employees with the right skills to leverage them. A similar number found that they had too many technologies and struggled to integrate them.The good news is that SMBs are increasing their cybersecurity budget. Across the board, 80% of SMBs in Singapore have increased their investment in cybersecurity since the start of the pandemic.However, Juan Huat Koo, who is Cisco\u2019s director for cybersecurity for the ASEAN region, points out that \u201ccyber security is not just about investing money to buy solutions and blocking certain threats that come along your way.\u201d Instead, he sees communication as key in helping SMBs strengthen their cybersecurity.Similar to hackers, SMBs need to stay on top of evolving threats by communicating not only internally, but also externally.\u201cSMBs that are well-equipped to meet a security event [are those that] talk about the issue more frequently. Talking about cyber threats more frequently [can help them find] ways to respond to cyber attacks [swiftly and effectively] to mitigate their impacts,\u201d Koo says.In addition, he advises SMBs to find \u201ca more holistic integrated platform approach\u201d that can simplify cybersecurity in their IT environment. Koo observes that the \u201ctraditional method\u201d of having one solution to address one cyber threat means that SMBs end up with a huge variety of cybersecurity solutions, which may not be able to integrate with each other and other IT systems effectively.The report also recommended organisations to constantly train and educate employees from all departments, instead of just the IT department, on good cyber hygiene practices. This will ensure that everybody in the organisation practises the right thing to do when it comes to cybersecurity, given that the nature of connectivity does not just lie with the IT department.Besides that, organisations should find the right technology partner that can help better secure their operations. \u201cGone are the days where cyber security is just about putting a firewall, or endpoint antivirus.\u201dKoo says. Instead, with the larger attack surface that digitalisation has brought to companies, they need a technology partner that can protect their networks end-to end, even with things like remote working and devices out of the office.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore Fighting cyber crime with AI Singapore SMEs lead APAC in terms of digital transformation, DBS survey indicates  ISP ViewQwest enables log in via Singpass Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

Now, a test mule of the bike has been spied during a TVC shoot, revealing key design details. It will have a teardrop-shaped fuel tank, split-style seats, and chrome embellishments on various parts. It will run on a 298cc, liquid-cooled, parallel-twin engine. Here are more details.  Exteriors: The bike will have full-LED illumination and blacked-out wheels  The Haojue TR300 will sport a teardrop-shaped fuel tank, a lengthy exhaust, split-style seats, high-set handlebars, an oblong-shaped headlight, and matte-finished black paintwork. The motorcycle will pack a full-LED setup for lighting and an LCD instrument cluster. It will ride on designer blacked-out wheels wrapped in bulbous tires. However, its fuel storage capacity and curb weight are yet to be revealed.  Fact: It will run on a 29hp, 298cc engine  The Haojue TR300 is likely to be powered by a 298cc, liquid-cooled, parallel-twin engine that generates a maximum power of 28.8hp and a peak torque of 27.8Nm. Its gearbox info will be disclosed later.  Safety: The vehicle will get telescopic front forks  To ensure the safety of the rider, the Haojue TR300 will be equipped with disc brakes on both the front and rear wheels. ABS for better handling should also be offered. Suspension duties on the motorcycle will be taken care of by telescopic forks on the front side and twin shock absorbers on the rear end.  Fact: Haojue TR300: Availability  In China, the Haojue TR300 cruiser bike will take on rivals such as the Benda Jinjila 300 and Honda Rebel 300. However, the two-wheeler is unlikely to arrive in India as the brand has no presence here.  The news article, Ahead of launch, Haojue TR300 cruiser bike spied in China appeared first on NewsBytes.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

A number of retailers have some available if you\u2019re willing to pay a bit extra. We recently saw it on sale on Amazon in the US, albeit over $800. And, the Newegg Shuffle has more consistently had a wide range of RTX graphics cards available in the raffle, though they still come with an uptick in price because they\u2019re bundling in extra products with the purchase. In the UK, Overclockers has shown ready availability of a surprising range of graphics cards, including the RTX 3060 (though updates of \u00a3500), so be sure to check there ASAP.\u00a0For now, the easiest way to find yourself an RTX 3060 is through pre-built gaming PCs. Many are available with the graphics card slotted in and ready to, and they generally have the closest price to fair market value.

The company specializes in locating ultra exotic vehicles that traditional orthodox car dealerships do not have access to. This exclusive access that Malik and his organization at Status Auto Group possesses has made them a well known service provider that is a go to for ultra exotic high end vehicle inquiries.  Also Read | PLI Scheme for Auto Sector and Drone Industries: PM Narendra Modi Govt Approves Rs 26,000 Crore To Boost Production The company also offers services for all types of make and model vehicles, not just exotic vehicles. When speaking to Faisal he made it clear that \u201cAs an organization we do cater to high end luxury clients, but a majority of our customers come to us for all makes and models. Our customers love feeling the same level of appreciation and novelty that you would receive from a luxury buying experience.\u201d Current Market Conditions Also Read | 2021 Mahindra XUV700 SUV Launched in India; Priced From Rs 11.99 Lakh Regarding current market shortages in manufacturing, Faisal stated that current prices are inflated due to the unavailability of vehicle parts and the current market sentiment surrounding this niche market. The entrepreneur hinted that a crisis like this can linger for more than the next annual business year. Faisal has been able to maintain success through this shortage by keeping an open mind and continuing to think long term.  He says that many competitors do not keep a long term mindset, which can be detrimental if manufacturers aren\u2019t operating at full speed. This mindset along with Faisal\u2019s connections and reputation has allowed Status Auto Group to continue to provide its exclusive services throughout the shortage. With no telling when manufacturers will be able to meet the demand of the market, Faisal and Status Auto Group remain a top name in the industry. Starting The Business Faisal started Status Auto Group with the vision of supplying the average consumer with outstanding and affordable service. He saw how dealerships were taking advantage of their customers and capitalized on it. Initially Faisal didn\u2019t work with high end luxury vehicles until about three years ago when he saw an opportunity to break into the ultra high end luxury market, due to the lack of savvy competitors. Rebranding a used car lot as a luxury auto boutique posed a challenge, but with perseverance and a growing reputation Faisal was successful in becoming a top service provider in his niche. Although Status Auto Group is well established as a trusted company, Faisal continues to take action in expanding his business and reputation nationally for the future of his company.   Story continues Finding Niche CarsWhen attempting to locate ultra exotic and high end vehicles, Faisal states that having connections and contacts with different dealerships and individuals is imperative. Thanks to these connections, he has been able to search nationally and locate exclusive inventory. Without these contacts a transaction that would be a matter of minutes for Faisal could take days or even weeks. Not only can it be tiring for a normal service provider to make these deals, they oftentimes will have trouble even finding the vehicles Faisal can locate with ease. Building a reputation and contacts like Faisal takes years of successful work in the industry. These contacts and knowledge make Faisal and Status Auto Group invaluable to anyone seeking out niche or exotic vehicles.

Gates' statement has won praise across social media with many users agreeing with the philanthropist's view. Here are more details.  Details: 'I've become obsessed with things like Malaria and HIV'  Gates' comment came when host James Corden thanked him for being the \"one billionaire who is not trying to escape planet Earth on a spaceship at the moment.\" \"I have become obsessed with things like Malaria and HIV and getting rid of those diseases,\" Gates said. \"Space? You know, we have a lot to do here on Earth,\" the billionaire continued.  Fact: 'Don't know why billionaires are obsessed with space tourism'  When asked why billionaires were obsessed with space tourism, Gates said, \"I don't know...I would probably bore people at cocktail parties talking about diseases.\" Corden praised Gates' jibe at other billionaires, describing it as the \"classiest burn.\"  Fact: You can watch the video here   Other remarks: We have to act together: Gates on climate change  Notably, the show was about climate change, and Gates spoke at length about the issue. He also discussed the changes that individuals can make to combat climate disasters. \"We are going to have to act together, and we are going to have to innovate at a very rapid pace. This will be the hardest thing humanity has ever done,\" he added.  Fact: 'We can come together to avoid climate disaster'  In light of the Youth4Climate event in Milan, Italy, climate change dominated late-night shows in the US on Wednesday. On Twitter, Gates thanked all \"late-night hosts for focusing on this critical challenge,\" adding, \"I'm optimistic that we can come together to avoid a climate disaster.\"  Context: Billionaires in race to travel to space  Billionaires have recently been channeling all their wealth to travel to space. Billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX recently launched four people into space on a three-day mission. Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos flew to space in July. Similarly, Virgin Group billionaire Richard Branson, too, flew over 50 miles above the New Mexico desert in his Virgin Galactic rocket plane.

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Edgar Su)  \u00b7 Edgar Su / Reuters By Ishika Mookerjee (Bloomberg) \u2014 Singapore\u2019s City Developments Ltd. is selling its stake in Chongqing Sincere Yuanchuang Industry Co. for US$1, as it ends the tumultuous backing of the cash-strapped Chinese developer. The real estate group will sell a 63.75% equity interest in HCP Chongqing Property Development Co. \u2014 which owns an 80.01% stake in Sincere, according to a statement published late Friday. The buyer is Sure Spread Ltd., an unrelated third party incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles.  City Developments, led by Chief Executive Officer Sherman Kwek, had already written down almost all of its S$1.9 billion (US$1.4 billion) investment in Chongqing Sincere. It acquired a majority stake in Sincere last April but the pandemic and China\u2019s \u201cthree red lines\u201d policy increased liquidity constraints at the unit, forcing losses on the broader Singaporean company. The transaction takes into account \u201cthe current liquidity issues and potential bankruptcy reorganisation of Sincere,\u201d City Developments said. It also said it\u2019s increasing its stake in a technology park in Shenzhen by transferring Sincere\u2019s 15.4% holding in Shenzhen Tusincere Technology Park Development Co. to a wholly-owned subsidiary. The transfer is being considered a partial repayment of a loan. The Sincere divestment and the Shenzhen Tusincere agreement \u201callow the Group to exit its investment in Sincere, and avoid being engaged in a possibly long drawn bankruptcy reorganisation of Sincere,\u201d according to the statement. All City Developments nominee directors and officers will resign from Sincere and its related companies after the divestment. The group said it will continue to assess the recoverability of the remaining balance of its financial exposure to Sincere.

CGS-CIMB Research analysts Raymond Cheng, Will Chu and Steven Mak are keeping \u201cadd\u201d on Hongkong Land Holdings after the property group announced, on Sept 6, that it would spend up to US$500 million ($672.0 million) in share buybacks.  See: Hongkong Land to spend up to US$500 million in share buybacks The analysts are also keeping their target price estimate unchanged at HK$5.70, which still based on a 45% discount to net asset value (NAV) The announcement marks the first time in over 15 years that Hongkong Land announced beforehand, that it was buying shares back from the market. \u201cWe think this reflects management\u2019s positive response to investors\u2019 concerns on Hongkong Land\u2019s persistently deep discount to book value (BV) and NAV,\u201d write the analysts in a Sept 7 report. The last share buyback conducted by the group was in 2018, when it purchased 18.9 million shares from the secondary market, which is around 0.8% of Hongkong Land\u2019s share capital at the time. Based on the group\u2019s share price of $4.22 as at market close on Sept 6, the share buyback programme is worth 5.1% of its market value, note the analysts. In addition, the group is one of the cheapest Hong Kong landlords, with its current price trading at a 59% discount to end-FY2021 NAV.  \u201cAs one of the largest office landlords in Hong Kong, its premium office portfolio in Central accounts for 51% of its end-FY21F gross annual value (GAV), based on our estimates,\u201d they write. \u201cHongkong Land is trading at an FY2021 dividend yield of 5.2%, higher than the average of 4.6% for other Hong Kong-based landlords and REITS.\u201d Potential re-rating catalysts include stronger rental growth in its investment property portfolio, while a prolonged Covid-19 outbreak is a key downside risk. Shares in Hongkong Land closed 11 US cents higher or 2.3% up at US$4.84 on Sept 8, with an FY2021 P/B of 0.27 times and dividend yield of 5.24%.

(PHOTO: Secretlab)  \u00b7 Secretlab By Lyn Chan SINGAPORE \u2014 Ian Ang, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Secretlab, the Singaporean gaming chair company, represents one of those stories people love: someone who got bitten by the idea bug, and turned the thought into a business that\u2019s both fun and successful. So successful that the 29-year-old in June put down S$51 million for two property purchases \u2014 S$36 million for a Good Class Bungalow and S$15 million for a triplex penthouse, according to a report by EdgeProp. Last year, Ang became the youngest ever winner of Singapore's EY Entrepreneur of the Year award.  The company recently moved into its new S$10 million, 44,000 square feet global headquarters and research and development centre in Braddell. Secretlab plans to invest S$50 million in R&D over the next few years. The Braddell headquarters currently houses more than 200 staff, with room for another 100 as the company continues to expand, Ang said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Singapore. Not bad for a fervent gamer who, instead of merely lamenting the lack of an ideal gaming chair, decided to take matters into his own hands \u2014and make his own. He pulled in fellow gamer Alaric Choo to create a solution for the industry. The duo started out as rivals at a local esports tournament, but gaming over Diablo, World of Warcraft, Destiny, Dota, Overwatch, PUBG and Rust cemented their friendship. \u201cI knew Alaric to be someone insanely proficient with technical aspects and how things are physically constructed, as well as people, so when I came up with the idea for Secretlab, he was naturally the first person I thought of,\u201d Ang said. Choo is now the company's chief strategy officer.  In 2014, with S$50,000, mostly from their savings, the duo started Secretlab. They have since turned a local gaming chair company which was building prototypes in a small room into a global brand used on the biggest international esports stages. The company now makes over a million chairs annually for 60 countries, with North America and the European Union making up 60 per cent of global sales, according to Ang. \u201cThat said, these are still growth markets for us, just like the rest of the world.\u201d Ang reckons that the perfectionistic streak inherent within Secretlab team has propelled the company to the global phenomenon it is today. \u201cOur entire company is wholly focused on developing the best chairs. Everyone on the team is specialised in either making gaming chairs, selling gaming chairs, or servicing people who have gaming chairs, and we've been at this for years. It\u2019s a matter of life and death. To stagnate is to acquiesce, to decline.\u201d Obsession pays off, it seems.   Story continues   Esports arena at Secretlab Global HQ and R&D Center in Braddell. (PHOTO: Secretlab)  \u00b7 SecretlabIt may be one of the reasons that Heliconia Capital Management was drawn to Secretlab in 2019, taking a minority stake. Reports following the announcement valued the company at between S$200 million and S$300 million. Ang declined to comment on the numbers, saying only that \u201cthe valuation numbers you find online (other than Heliconia\u2019s) are just hearsay or simply estimates\".\u201cWe don\u2019t have an updated valuation number either until we go through a next round. We\u2019ve been working hard on global expansion and product expansion, and our earnings have grown more than 10 times since Heliconia\u2019s investment,\u201d he said.Ang reveals that other investors have been sniffing around. Although he is not actively on the hunt for more backing, he doesn\u2019t discount their interest. Meanwhile, an external adviser manages such discussions.As for going public, that\u2019s not on the cards. However, he is quick to add, \u201cNever say never.\"As Secretlab steamrolls ahead towards long-term sustainable growth \u2013 increasing R&D, faster customer deliveries and further market expansion, for instance \u2013 how does Ang squeeze in time for gaming?\u201cAlaric and I still try to find pockets of time to game with our friends. We use that time to test out new prototypes. Thanks for reminding me of the resolution to game more \u2013 I think I\u2019m maybe one-third there, so, more work to be done!\u201dAng shares his thoughts on his entrepreneurial experience:What made you drop out of university to pursue the business?We were quite successful soon after launching Secretlab, and I realised I probably needed to spend 16 hours daily on building the business. How far it would go depended on how much time and energy I invested into it. I thought I had a once in a lifetime opportunity and would regret it if I didn\u2019t give it my all, even if it meant going without completing my university degree.For me, it was a calculated risk so I have no regrets. Not everything will work out the way you want it but that\u2019s okay as long as you\u2019ve weighed your options. It\u2019s the same as poker, and also something that I learnt from gaming, which actually helped me a lot with running a business. Most people only look at the results and regret their decisions retrospectively but there is a right choice in that moment. If the odds are in your favour, you should play them.What challenges did you face setting up the company?Back in 2015, few paid attention to the gaming chair industry. We were also a digitally native brand and sold our chairs directly to consumers. Everything was very new; there was no playbook for us to follow, no guide for us to refer to in the hope of overtaking an established player. We decided to set our sights on becoming the first giant the industry has ever known.We weren\u2019t satisfied with the options for gaming chairs then, so we started from scratch. This meant exhausting every resource to source for components and premium quality materials. We eventually set up our own unique global supply chain which put us in full control over our entire supply chain and global operations, and enabled us to better adapt and respond quickly to the needs of our customers.What advice would you give to people who are thinking of dropping out of school or leaving their jobs to strike out on their own?I think dropping out of school for entrepreneurs is overblown and romanticised. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for most people. Ninety per cent of startups fail. Factor that number in when making your decision, consider what stage of life you\u2019re in (if you have family to support, for example), and why you\u2019re really considering striking out on your own.What inspires you?Rather than stories of inspiration, it is stories of failures that push us harder. It doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019ve now sold more than 1 million units of the same product, or that we\u2019re the only ones to have successfully done so. For us, it\u2019s \u2018grow or die\u2019. It\u2019s always Day 1 no matter how big we become. We have to keep innovating and improving, or we will one day become irrelevant, like many giants before us. It has happened to mobile phone manufacturers, search engines and many others who were huge but crashed and disappeared within just one or two years.What are some of your favourite books?Rolf Dobelli\u2019s The Art of Thinking Clearly, Andrew S.

And I hear it has nothing to do with his spatula or leather jacket collections, claiming the spot instead as one of today's top innovators.It's all to do with artificial intelligence, says Andrew Ng's write-up about Huang for Time. You know, those algorithms and neural networks that are accelerating in complexity at a stupendous rate and will one day likely change the lives of billions.\u00a0And at the centre of the push for AI adoption is an Nvidia GPU, so says Ng.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun Huang's net worth dropped by a reported $20,800,000,000 after DeepSeek fears shook the AI market to its core earlier this week\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is Nvidia's biggest AI chip buyer of the year, and it's not even close. With ByteDance and Tencent coming out ahead of Zuck, Bezos, and Musk's outfits, too\n\n\n\nAnd it's true that the gaming GPU company has pivoted once again to focus more on deep learning and AI in recent years. Or as Huang put it in 2019: \u201cWe were a GPU company and then we became a GPU systems company. We became a computing company which started from the chip up, now we are extending ourselves into a datacenter computing company.\u201dTips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021And Huang's been leading the charge at Nvidia for all of it\u2014as the company's share price has gone from $15 in 2016 to $223 today, up 1,322% in the past five years.Another innovator on the Time influential persons list for 2021 that gamers might know is Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.So I wonder who's next going to make the leap from semiconductors to the world's most influential\u2026 I can think of a good few options, that's for sure. No doubt the role of chip designers and manufacturers has become altogether more important as the world starts to realise how precious chip supply can be, which might push the top CEOs even further into the limelight.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Even when they can be sourced, the prices are sky-high. With recent trends showing that GPU availability and cost is about to get worse, things are not looking too good for the tech world. However, a recent analysis is showing that, come 2023, the opposite could become a reality. \nAccording to analysts, the semiconductor market is set to grow this year, and could potentially be \"overcapacity\" by 2023. Given this information, there is a possibility that supplies of Nvidia and AMD products could become abundant by this point. At the very least, the analysis suggests that the shortages that are currently plaguing the tech and gaming world will mend itself. The downside to it is that it's still going to be awhile before this is likely to occur, at least according to the report.\nRELATED: Nvidia Allegedly Using Recycled Silicon From Previous GPUs for Upcoming RTX 3060 Variant\nThis also corroborates with Nvidia CEO saying that shortages would be ongoing for most of 2022. Given that semiconductors are a vital part in many pieces of hardware, technology manufacturers are going to finally be able to source them for their products. However, according to a report from PC Gamer, companies will need to be cautious about not going overboard, despite many hoping to make up for the lack of output that's been occurring since the end of last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As it stands, AMD and Nvidia are still looking to put out new graphics cards, even though the market is experiencing a deficit and hiked prices. Leaks about Nvidia's upcoming RTX 3080 Super have recently been doing the rounds, and it seems as though AMD may also be getting ready to launch a new GPU. Not to mention Intel has also recently decided to join the graphics card arms race by announcing the launch of its first product sometime next year. Let's just hope customers are able to get hold of any of it.\nWhile much of the shortages have been blamed on the lack of semiconductors being available, some of it has also been attested to cryptomining companies and bots bulk-buying hardware and leaving hardly any for anyone else. This problem has dropped off recently, most likely because there are so few products available, so it may be that cryptominers may strike again in 2023 when Nvidia, AMD, and soon Intel, GPUs start flooding the market again.\nMORE: Making Some Sense of the Codenames In Nvidia's GeForce Now Leak\nSource: PC Gamer, IDC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming

DLAA is a new spin on Nvidia\u2019s existing DLSS (Deep Learning Super-Sampling): whereas DLSS involves rendering a game at a lower resolution then upscaling, reducing the performance hit of the AA it applies, DLAA skips the upscaling part and keeps the resolution native.\r\n\n\n\r\n It still applies an AA algorithm developed through machine learning, but is intended more for those with one of Nvidia's best graphics cards: i.e. systems that can already run games at high frame rates without the help of upscaling. Does it work? The comparison video does show one advantage over The Elder Scrolls Online\u2019s alternative TAA option, with less shimmering on objects viewed at a distance. DLAA appears slightly harsher on the frame rate, though, and to my eyes TAA still looks a little sharper in motion. Have a squint for yourself:\r\n\n\n\n\nElder Scrolls Online DLAA vs DLSS vs TAA | RTX 3080 | i7 10700F\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\n\r\nSince ESO is also getting DLSS support, we can see how all three compare. Sticking with native resolution does help DLAA and TAA overall \u2013 some textures lack relative detail on DLSS \u2013 but I do think TAA wins out on sheer crispness. Barely. But then there\u2019s less shimmering! But then TAA is consistently running at least 10fps faster! Oh, it\u2019s just so hard to choose.\r\n\n\r\nEven DLSS doesn\u2019t look half bad, and because of its upscaling sleight of hand it still provides its signature performance boost over TAA and DLAA, which face the full brunt of the 4K resolution. Without DLAA serving up major visible improvements over other native-res AA solutions, I\u2019d personally be inclined to use DLSS even with the loss of detail, but then I usually tend towards speed over fidelity. \r\n\n\r\nIf you\u2019re more willing to sacrifice frames for sharpness, DLAA could still prove a worthy alternative. Like DLSS it\u2019s very possible that the implementation of DLAA will vary across different games, so some might look better than others. ESO is showing its age nowadays, too \u2013 I\u2019d be interested to see DLAA on something more recent. \r\n\n\r\nDLSS, for its part, is on the up and up. The number of DLSS-supporting games recently hit the 100 mark, following a burst of indie releases.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Starfield's \"are planets planets\" debate recalls the amazingly weird cosmology of Elder Scrolls\n          \n\n\n\n            The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are currently free to keep on the Epic Games Store\n          \n\n\n\n            The Elder Scrolls Online's tentacle-packed expansion, Necrom, has wiggled out\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

But the rapid innovations in 3D hardware for gaming were a big part of why it became the world\u2019s most extensive entertainment industry.\nMore recently, Nvidia tapped the parallel processing for its graphics processing units (GPUs) to do non-graphics compute tasks. That turned into a massive application in AI, where Nvidia\u2019s chips are becoming the brains of computers, robots, and self-driving cars.\nIn the over 25 years since the company\u2019s first chip, scene complexity in computer graphics has increased around 500 million times, Huang said.\nMoore\u2019s Law, which predicts chip performance will double every couple of years, would have increased only 100,000 times in the same period if unaided by better chip design.\nUnder Huang's watch, Nvidia is now worth $555 billion on the stock market and employs 20,000 people. Much of that growth came as Nvidia saw huge success in AI.\n\u201cHuang\u2019s gamble paid off largely because he is among the world\u2019s most technically savvy CEOs\u201d, wrote Ng. \u201cHe\u2019s also a compassionate steward of his employees and a generous supporter of education in science and technology. With still\u202femerging AI technologies creating an insatiable hunger for more computation, Huang\u2019s team is well-positioned to keep driving technological advances for decades to come.\u201d \n\n\n\nLast modified on 16 September 2021\t\t\t\n\n\nRate this item\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n(3 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this category:\n\n\t\t\t\u00ab Samsung starts flogging OLED displays\t\t\n\n\t\t\tApple faces another charge of employee hassling \u00bb\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\n\nMusk\u2019s Starlink in nepotism row\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard soap opera ends in tragedy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei about to lose Windows licence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope\u2019s tech industry wants radical action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about:\nNvidia boss warns x86 is becoming fragmented \nNvidia wants to employ 50,000 Workers \nNvidia boss should buy Intel \n\n\n"

Things like Project Scorpio (Xbox One X) and Xbox Scarlett (Xbox Series X), or Project Athia (Forspoken) and Project A (Valorant), are recent examples of consoles and games discovered beforehand. Of course, all of those examples are thanks to leaks or reports that discover them beforehand. One recent major leak is courtesy of a datamine from Nvidia GeForce Now's library, comprised of several thousand upcoming and unannounced PC titles. While there are several interesting potential revelations in the leak, the codenamed projects are the most perplexing. \nAmong potentially exciting leaks like Final Fantasy 9 Remake or God of War's PC port, there were several games from high profile studios listed under codenames. Ranging from studios and publishers like Activision Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft, 2K, Xbox Game Studios, and more, this Nvidia leak could potentially be hiding several hints towards upcoming games. However, \"potentially\" is being particularly generous; Nvidia has since stated that this list is real, but is filled with \"speculative titles.\" To some extent, that is true, as there are some since-cancelled projects still on this list. That being said, that doesn't entirely rule out the accuracy of the unidentified projects.\nRELATED: AMD And Nvidia Availability Set to Worsen, Despite Signs of Recent Improvements \n                        Nvidia's GeForce Now Leak And Codenames/Projects\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire list of titles found in the Nvidia GeForce Now datamine is comprised of thousands of games, some of which have already released on various platforms, while others are upcoming. Some of these titles are announced and headed for PC, like the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, a previous PlayStation exclusive. This is why there is some degree of accuracy related to this leak, even if there are some titles that seem unlikely, like a remaster of Half-Life 2. There's been plenty of speculation on the accuracy of the confirmed titles on the list of games, but the list of codenames and temporarily titled projects present the most intriguing mystery thus far.\nSome of these codenames and projects line up with previous reports and leaks: One example is \"Codename Coda,\" which was leaked previously as a cross between Marvel and XCOM games, now confirmed as Marvel's Midnight Suns. Nvidia also issuing a statement confirming the list is real does at least add some credence to this list, even if some of the games listed in the datamine likely don't exist (currently or at all). That's what makes the codenames and project titles particularly interesting among the rest, as some of these are unheard of, while others match up with existing leaks.\nIf Nvidia's leaked list is \"real,\" why include these codenames/projects at all? Yes, they could be under the umbrella of \"speculative titles,\" but some of these titles were leaked previously while some were not. There are several titles from AAA publishers/devleopers in this list, both revealed and unannounced, that could be leaked here.\nRELATED: Why Chrono Cross Deserves A Remaster \n                        Codenames and Project Names From AAA Publishers\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Microsoft and Bethesda's camp, there are several familiar names among some new codenames for upcoming projects. Many of the Arkane Studios project names have been heard before: \"Project Omen\" has since been revealed as Redfall, the vampiric co-op action game which saw its own leaked playtest earlier this month. \"Project BlackSky\" is likely the Arkane Austin project in development with Dishonored's co-creator Harvey Smith, who left Arkane Lyon after Dishonored 2 to work on this project. \"Relic\" is supposedly in development with MachineGames, separate from \"Platinum,\" which is supposedly the codename for the Indiana Jones game teased earlier this year.\nAs for Microsoft, there were a few confirmations: \"Project Holland\" (the new Fable), \"Project Typhoon\" (Contraband), and \"Project Woodstock\" (Forza Horizon 5). The only unknown is \"Project Indus,\" which is reportedly a 4X strategy game in devleopment with Oxide Games. Additionally, Ninja Theory has something in development known as \"Project H2,\" which is separate from the previously shown Project Mara, as well as Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2.\n2K had a few codenames listed in this leak, most of which have been connected to existing rumors or announcements. The aforementioned \"Codename Coda\" is Marvel's Midnight Suns, while \"Codename Parkside\" is supposedly the next BioShock game in development at Cloud Chamber Studios. There's also \"Codename Vault/Volt,\" which could be the rumored \"Cthulhu meets Saints Row\" project in development at Hangar 13, or could be another separately rumored action game. There's also the \"Project Dio,\" though that's all that's been leaked and there's no further details at this time.\nOn the Activision Blizzard side, there were a couple project names revealed that hint at upcoming titles from the publisher. First is \"Project Fenway,\" which is potentially a new IP that was spotted on a Blizzard Producer's LinkedIn earlier this year, right around when BlizzConline 2021 was about to kick off. Then there's \"Project Cortez,\" a codename that notable Call of Duty leaker Tom Henderson has confirmed as 2022's Call of Duty project, since corroborated by another report by VGC.\nSpeaking of leaks by Henderson, \"Project QD Next\" is potentially the Quantic Dream Star Wars game recently rumored to be in development. However, Henderson's tease was vague, so it's unclear at this time what \"QD Next\" is actually referring to. Same deal for a few other leaks in this list: Ubisoft has a \"Project AETHER\" and \"Project Q\" in development, details of which are unknown (potentially Ubisoft Stockholm's upcoming project, though not confirmed).\nBeyond that are several other leaked games from various publishers/developers: An unknown 505 Games title called \"Project Pugwash\" could be the leaked \"Grow: Song of the Evertree,\" Bandai Namco has a \"Project Apollo\" and \"Project LEO\" in development, EA has \"Project Jetson\" and \"Project Phoenix\" in development, and Warner Bros. Interactive has \"Project Freelancer\" and \"Codename Legacy\" in development as well. The rest of these are hard to connect to any previous leaks, other than one of EA's projects potentially being Motive's new IP, or Warner Bros. Interactive's \"Project Freelancer\" being related to its latest games-as-a-service development initiative.\nThere are several other project names in the full leaked list, ranging from AAA studios to indie and mobile developers. This is without even mentioning the known quantities included in the Nvidia leak, like God of War supposedly coming to PC, or Kingdom Hearts 4. Again, it's important to emphasize that this list may not confirm/de-confirm anything. There are even some cancelled games on this list (like Square Enix's \"Project Prelude Rune\"), so this list has likely been around for some time. For now, many of these codenames will likely remain secret as intended, but some of them can be connected back to major leaks that have come out previously.\nMORE: Kingdom Hearts 4 Fans Shouldn't Expect the Game Soon, Despite Nvidia Leaks\nSource: Windows Central, Ighor July \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGR Originals\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMonopoly GO: What Happens to Extra Shamrock Tokens Once St. Paddy's Partners Ends\n\t\t\n\n\nMonopoly Go!\n\nWondering what happens to extra Shamrock tokens when the St. Paddy's Partners minigame wraps up in Monopoly GO?

A robotic hand that could manipulate objects as we do would be enormously useful in factories, warehouses, offices, and homes.\nYet despite tremendous progress in the field, research on robotics hands remains extremely expensive and limited to a few very wealthy companies and research labs.\nNow, new research promises to make robotics research available to resource-constrained organizations. In a paper published on arXiv, researchers at the University of Toronto, Nvidia, and other organizations have presented a new system that leverages highly efficient deep reinforcement learning techniques and optimized simulated environments to train robotic hands at a fraction of the costs it would normally take.\n\nTraining robotic hands is expensive\nOpenAI trained an AI-powered robotic hand to solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube (Image source: YouTube)\nFor all we know, the technology to create human-like robots is not here yet. However, given enough resources and time, you can make significant progress on specific tasks such as manipulating objects with a robotic hand.\nIn 2019, OpenAI presented Dactyl, a robotic hand that could manipulate a Rubik\u2019s cube with impressive dexterity (though still significantly inferior to human dexterity). But it took 13,000 years\u2019 worth of training to get it to the point where it could handle objects reliably.\nHow do you fit 13,000 years of training into a short period of time? Fortunately, many software tasks can be parallelized. You can train multiple reinforcement learning agents concurrently and merge their learned parameters. Parallelization can help to reduce the time it takes to train the AI that controls the robotic hand.\nHowever, speed comes at a cost. One solution is to create thousands of physical robotic hands and train them simultaneously, a path that would be financially prohibitive even for the wealthiest tech companies. Another solution is to use a simulated environment. With simulated environments, researchers can train hundreds of AI agents at the same time, and then finetune the model on a real physical robot. The combination of simulation and physical training has become the norm in robotics, autonomous driving, and other areas of research that require interactions with the real world.\nSimulations have their own challenges, however, and the computational costs can still be too much for smaller firms.\nOpenAI, which has the financial backing of some of the wealthiest companies and investors, developed Dactyl using expensive robotic hands and an even more expensive compute cluster comprising around 30,000 CPU cores.\nLowering the costs of robotics research\n\nIn 2020, a group of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and New York University proposed an open-source robotic research platform that was dynamic and used affordable hardware. Named TriFinger, the system used the PyBullet physics engine for simulated learning and a low-cost robotic hand with three fingers and six degrees of freedom (6DoF). The researchers later launched the Real Robot Challenge (RRC), a Europe-based platform that gave researchers remote access to physical robots to test their reinforcement learning models on.\nThe TriFinger platform reduced the costs of robotic research but still had several challenges. PyBullet, which is a CPU-based environment, is noisy and slow and makes it hard to train reinforcement learning models efficiently. Poor simulated learning creates complications and widens the \u201csim2real gap,\u201d the performance drop that the trained RL model suffers from when transferred to a physical robot. Consequently, robotics researchers need to go through multiple cycles of switching between simulated training and physical testing to tune their RL models.\n\u201cPrevious work on in-hand manipulation required large clusters of CPUs to run on. Furthermore, the engineering effort required to scale reinforcement learning methods has been prohibitive for most research teams,\u201d Arthur Allshire, lead author of the paper and a Simulation and Robotics Intern at Nvidia, told TechTalks. \u201cThis meant that despite progress in scaling deep RL, further algorithmic or systems progress has been difficult. And the hardware cost and maintenance time associated with systems such as the Shadow Hand [used in OpenAI Dactyl] \u2026 has limited the accessibility of hardware to test learning algorithms on.\u201d\nBuilding on top of the work of the TriFinger team, this new group of researchers aimed to improve the quality of simulated learning while keeping the costs low.\nTraining RL agents with single-GPU simulation\nThe researchers trained their models in the Nvidia Isaac Gym simulated environment and transferred the learning to a remote Europe-based robotics lab\nThe researchers replaced the PyBullet with Nvidia\u2019s Isaac Gym, a simulated environment that can run efficiently on desktop-grade GPUs. Isaac Gym leverages Nvidia\u2019s PhysX GPU-accelerated engine to allow thousands of parallel simulations on a single GPU. It can provide around 100,000 samples per second on an RTX 3090 GPU.\n\u201cOur task is suitable for resource-constrained research labs. Our method took one day to train on a single desktop-level GPU and CPU. Every academic lab working in machine learning has access to this level of resources,\u201d Allshire said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the paper, an entire setup to run the system, including training, inference, and physical robot hardware, can be purchased for less than $10,000.\nThe efficiency of the GPU-powered virtual environment enabled the researchers to train their reinforcement learning models in a high-fidelity simulation without reducing the speed of the training process. Higher fidelity makes the training environment more realistic, reducing the sim2real gap and the need for finetuning the model with physical robots.\nThe researchers used a sample object manipulation task to test their reinforcement learning system. As input, the RL model receives proprioceptive data from the simulated robot along with eight keypoints that represent the pose of the target object in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The model\u2019s output is the torques that are applied to the motors of the robot\u2019s nine joints.\nThe system uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a model-free RL algorithm. Model-free algorithms obviate the need to compute all the details of the environment, which is computationally very expensive, especially when you\u2019re dealing with the physical world. AI researchers often seek cost-efficient, model-free solutions to their reinforcement learning problems.\nThe researchers designed the reward of robotic hand RL as a balance between the fingers\u2019 distance from the object, the object\u2019s destination location, and the intended pose.\nTo further improve the model\u2019s robustness, the researchers added random noise to different elements of the environment during training.\nTesting on real robots\n\n\n\nOnce the reinforcement learning system was trained in the simulated environment, the researchers tested it in the real world through remote access to the TriFinger robots provided by the Real Robot Challenge. They replaced the proprioceptive and image input of the simulator with the sensor and camera information provided by the remote robot lab.\nThe trained system transferred its abilities to the real robot a seven-percent drop in accuracy, an impressive sim2real gap improvement in comparison to previous methods.\nThe keypoint-based object tracking was especially useful in ensuring that the robot\u2019s object-handling capabilities generalized across different scales, poses, conditions, and objects.\n\u201cOne limitation of our method\u2014deploying on a cluster we did not have direct physical access to\u2014was the difficulty in trying other objects. However, we were able to try other objects in simulation and our policies proved relatively robust with zero-shot transfer performance from the cube,\u201d Allshire said.\nThe researchers say that the same technique can work on robotic hands with more degrees of freedom. They did not have the physical robot to measure the sim2real gap, but the Isaac Gym simulator also includes complex robotic hands such as the Shadow Hand used in Dactyl.\nThis system can be integrated with other reinforcement learning systems that address other aspects of robotics, such as navigation and pathfinding, to form a more complete solution to train mobile robots. \u201cFor example, you could have our method controlling the low-level control of a gripper while higher level planners or even learning-based algorithms are able to operate at a higher level of abstraction,\u201d Allshire said.\nThe researchers believe that their work presents \u201ca path for democratization of robot learning and a viable solution through large scale simulation and robotics-as-a-service.\u201d\n\nLike this:Like Loading... \n\n\nTAGSAI research papersArtificial intelligence (AI)robotics \n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nReddIt\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n Previous articleWhat to do when only one of your AirPods is workingNext articleAmazon\u2019s Astro robot: A feat of science or a successful product?

While Intel is also going to be launching its own brand of GPUs, it's the latter two that have been head-to-head for some time. While much of it may come down to personal tastes, Nvidia is generally regarded as the stronger of the two, and some recent information regarding Steam may confirm that. \nIn a recent analysis by Tom's Hardware, it seems that Nvidia is quite ahead of its rival in terms of what hardware Steam players are currently using. The data that's been extracted shows that more people are using Nvidia GPUs than AMD, and that these numbers have been increasing over the last few months, with seemingly no way the latter company can catch up.\nRELATED: AMD Allegedly Developing RX 6900 XTX To Rival Nvidia\nOne thing the report notes is just how many new graphics cards have been tallied by the Steam survey, despite the ongoing shortages in tech and gaming hardware. The chart shows that users have an RTX 3080 Ti, or the laptop RTX 3050. For this reason, the analysis may be called into question, with the possibility that the survey may be churning out inaccurate information. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's wholly wrong, and it does portray a very clear picture, that more gamers are using Nvidia cards than AMD or even Intel integrated chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Another thing that was spotted is that the majority of the lion's share seems to go to the RTX 10-series, which accounts for 26.54% of overall GPU usage for last month. A quick look on the Steam stats page does indeed appear to line up with this. The table shows that the most used graphics card is the Nvidia GTX 1060. In second place is the RTX 2060 which the company has been planning to bring back while the world still experiences a chip deficit.\nOf course, it's perhaps worth taking the finer details with a grain of salt. What seems to be clear is that one company is outselling its rival quite significantly. Though that's not to say the runner-up is not doing well. With both Nvidia and AMD reporting a 35% increase in sales for Q1 2021, the fact that Nvidia is outperforming the latter does not detract from how well both are doing, despite the tumultuous time that the tech industry is currently going through.\nMORE: Intel Has a Chance to Hit the Ground Running With Its Arc GPUs\nSource: Tom's Hardware \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Now is The Perfect Time to Get a Steam Deck\n\t\t\n\n\nSteam Deck\n\nThe Steam Deck is one of the best handheld consoles out there, and there's never been a better time to pick one up than right now.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCameron Swan\n\n\n21 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEpic Games Store User Who Has Never Bought a Game Shows Off Their Incredible Collection\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDiana Vel\u00e1squez Vargas\n\n\nDec 28, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSwitch 2 Marks the End of an Era for Super Mario\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nFeb 14, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNintendo Patent Approved in August Could Be What It Uses Against Palworld\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDominik Bo\u0161njak\n\n\nSep 20, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tXbox Game Pass Already Has 6 Games Confirmed for April 2025\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\n3 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJuly 29 Is Going to Be a Sad Day for Xbox 360 Fans\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nJul 9, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: How to Get Keys and Resolves\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nTired of dying to enemies in Reignbreaker?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is rumoured to be resurrecting the GeForce RTX 2060 with 12GB of memory, in what appears could be a response to today's ongoing graphics card shortages.According to anonymous sources speaking with Videocardz, Nvidia is planning to roll out a graphics card built around the same TU106-300 GPU found within the original RTX 2060, which was first released in January 2019.\u00a0This follows on from rumours in January of this year that alluded to a similar rerun of Turing graphics cards, with both the RTX 2060 and RTX 2060 Super.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nSpecs for Nvidia's new RTX 5050, 5060, and 5060 Ti GPUs leak out and that 5060 might actually be half decent. If it's priced right\n\n\n\nThis 'new' RTX 2060 would come with a new 'KX' suffix and be paired with 12GB of GDDR6 memory, which is double that of the 2019 model. Otherwise, the 'new' RTX 2060 is said to be a match for the older card, which almost certainly will mean it's built using TSMC's 12nm process.The 12nm process is a few generations behind the cutting-edge nodes from TSMC or Nvidia's new manufacturing buddy, Samsung. However, it is likely higher yield, cheaper, and less in-demand than others, which would help Nvidia produce chips at a greater volume and, ideally, at a lower price.Similarly, the TU106 GPU within the RTX 2060 wasn't the full chip. That was found in the RTX 2070, which means Nvidia needn't use perfect GPUs for the RTX 2060.That said, there still are potential supply constraints for other components required to build a modern GPU, such as those for power delivery or memory chips. The RTX 2060 may have a relatively sparse PCB compared to an RTX 3080 Ti, but nonetheless it will require plenty of in-demand parts.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Nvidia is said to have told board partners to expect the card to be ready to roll by the end of the year, perhaps January, Videocardz also mentions.There's no word on price for the rumoured card. The RTX 2060 launched at $349, although was later dropped to $299, and you'd expect a stay from that sort of pricing for a card that's a bit long in the tooth nowadays. Similarly, with the RTX 3060 12GB starting at $329 (if you could find one at MSRP), an RTX 2060 would have to a much more affordable proposition to entice gamers.And the reason for this rumoured re-release would be in response to ongoing graphics card shortages. Almost a year on from the launch of the RTX 30-series graphics cards and we're yet to see a steady supply of these cards on the shelves.\u00a0The RTX 3060 is the cheapest desktop graphics card in Nvidia's Ampere generation, starting at $329. (Image credit: Future)The Ampere generation has been selling extremely well, Nvidia has confirmed, but demand is outstripping supply.To resurrect the RTX 2060 would be very telling for how Nvidia sees the coming year in terms of GPU availability. And it's not good news. Kicking the RTX 2060 out of retirement would suggest the green team is not expecting a drop in demand anytime soon, nor a sudden influx of supply.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021That's in line with most in-the-know CEOs, including Intel's Pat Gelsinger, who have repeatedly stated that supply will not return to normality until 2022/23, if not later. Nvidia's own forecast for supply has also become increasingly worrying as the year progresses.Nvidia will be cautious to lean in to high demand, though. It was bitten in 2018 by catering to a sudden influx of crypto-mining demand that dissipated almost overnight, leaving the company's share value to crumble.Still, I find myself cautiously optimistic about the prospect of a graphics card to address the entry-level market. I'd really much rather a cheap and cheerful RTX 3050 Ti or RX 6000-series GPU to arrive on desktop\u2014but with the right price, enough volume to make the MSRP stick, and liberal use of upscaling technologies and cryptocurrency mining limiters, perhaps a rerun of the RTX 2060 could keep the wolves from the door a little while longer.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

It is exceptional at detecting and classifying images and videos, providing support for around 300 AI models. FuriosaAI expects Warboy to become an efficient solution for data centers and high-performance edge computing segments.MLPerf is a global annual AI semiconductor benchmark event hosted by MLCommons, a non-profit organization set up by global companies including Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel, Qualcomm and Microsoft alongside universities such as Stanford and Harvard.\u00a0In 2019, FuriosaAI became the first Asia-based startup to be verified by MLPerf. And two years later, the company has become the only startup to submit results from its own silicon chip, Warboy.\n\nMLPerf\u3000v1.1\u3000single-stream\u3000performance\u3000comparison\u3000between\u3000Warboy\u3000and\u3000T4\u3000(Courtesy\u3000of\u3000FuriosaAI)\n\nIn the first half of next year, FuriosaAI plans to commercialize the first-generation chip Warboy, which will be mass-produced via Samsung Electronics\u2019 foundry. The company has been testing Warboy in various areas including metaverse, cloud data centers, autonomous driving, live streaming and smart retail.The company is also developing next-generation chips that provide high-performance support for hyperscale AI models. FuriosaAI is looking to unveil the new chips during the first half of 2023.\u201cWe're planning on expanding our team to create a powerful server AI chip that will be second to none in the global market,\" said June Paik, the chief executive of FuriosaAI.According to Paik, the company plans to inject over 100 billion won in next-generation chip development to dominate all of MLPerf's categories.Founded in 2017, FuriosaAI has been committed to developing hardware and software used to make high-performing AI chips. The company\u2019s team is made up of seasoned experts from Samsung Electronics, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Google and Amazon.\nTo date, the company has attracted 80 billion won ($68 million) from investors including Naver D2SF, DSC Investment and the Korea Development Bank -- noted as the largest amount raised for an AI chip company.Write to Han-gyeol Seon at always@hankyung.comDanbee Lee edited this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#FuriosaAI\n#Warboy\n#MLPerf\n#Nvidia\n#AIchips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore to Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean fabless startups take center stage, attracts VCs\n\n\nAug 12, 2021 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMin read\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups\n\nAI chip startup Furiosa AI wraps up $70 mn Series B round\n\n\nMay 31, 2021 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMin read\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups\n\nNaver-invested startups' combined valuation increases sixfold; tops $1 bn\n\n\nJun 09, 2021 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMin read\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartup\n\nAI chip venture set to challenge Nvidia, Intel, Google\n\n\nNov 01, 2019 (Gmt+09:00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMin read\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment 0\n\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0/300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY GLOBAL EDITION\nBRANDED CONTENT\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\nCompanies Home\nLatest on Korean Startups\nFuture Unicorns\nHidden Champions \nBranded Content\nGet It Made In Korea\nCompanies A to Z\n\n\n\nKorean Investors\n\nKorean Investors Home\nBest Asset Managers by Korean Investors\n\n\n\nDeals\n\nM&A\nECM/DCM\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\nCulture & Trends\n\n\nPerspectives\n\n\nHidden Champions\n\n\nFuture  Unicorns\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily Site\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily\nThe Korea Economic TV\nThe Korea Economic Daily Magazine\nHankyung BP\nTen Asia\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\nHelp Center\nContact us\nAdvertise with KED Global\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright Policy\nEditorial Policy & Code of Practice\nOnline newspaper registration No: \uc11c\uc6b8, \uc54453319 Date of registration: Oct 7 2020\n\n\nPublisher & Managing Editor: Yoo Byungyun | Address: 14F The Korea Economic Daily Bldg., 463, Cheongpa-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul, Korea 04505 | Business registration No: 796-87-01625 | Contact: kedglobal@hankyung.com, +82-2-360-4319\n              | Juvenile Protection Manager: Yun Dongbeom | \n              \n              Sitemap\n              \n              | \n              \n              Company list\n              \n              | \n              \n              News topic\n              \n\nCopyright\u00a9 2025 KED Global News Network .\u00a0All Rights reserved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cookies on KED Global\nWe use cookies to provide the best user experience.

According to the green team, the NVIDIA GeForce 472.12 WHQL driver is optimized for Far Cry 6, Alan Wake Remastered, Diablo II: Resurrected, Hot Wheels Unleashed, New World, and World War Z: Aftermath.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA GeForce 472.12 WHQL driver is the first official Windows 11 driver. Not only that, but NVIDIA has announced that 28 indie games, using Unreal Engine 4 and Unity, now support its DLSS tech.

According to the leak, here are some of the big titles that might come to PC:\"God of War\" (2018)\"Gran Turismo 7\"\"Returnal\"\"Demon's Souls\"\"Sackboy: A Big Adventure\"\"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart:\"Ghost of Tsushima\"\"Horizon Forbidden West\"As you can see, these are not mere PlayStation exclusives: they are the PlayStation exclusives that made names for themselves this generation.The leak was courtesy of a user named Ighor July, a developer who found the alleged unreleased games on the platform while tinkering with the NVIDIA GeForce Now client software.Aside from these big AAA exclusives, other games which were purportedly on the list, including remastered versions of \"Chrono Cross,\" \"Final Fantasy Tactics,\" \"Mirror's Edge,\" \"Batman Arkham Knight,\" and \"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.\"You can find the entire list of games on PushSquare.NVIDIA GeForce Now Leak: How Did This Happen?July said that he stumbled into the leak while wanting to find a full list of every game available on the NVIDIA game streaming service. The current GeForce Now client doesn't let users get any list, so he found older versions of the client and checked the log and cache files of those programs.Eventually, July managed to get a hold of the list from the NVIDIA GeForce Now servers. This all happened around six months ago, according to him.Read also :\nNVIDIA GeForce Now Announces Increase in Subscription Fee, Gaming Service Costs $10 a MonthHow Did NVIDIA React?Safe to say, NVIDIA didn't react to this the way many PC gamers might have hoped. According to the company, they were aware of the \"unauthorized published game list,\" but they made it clear that all of them are \"speculative titles,\" reports WCCFTech.NVIDIA then went out and said that the games being on the list is \"not a confirmation nor an announcement of any game.\" They then removed the list ASAP. This could mean that any Sony PlayStation exclusive that was included in the leak are probably only there for internal testing, and could never even see an official launch on PC.It's Still Not Impossible, ThoughAs you might know, big Sony PlayStation exclusives have already been released on the PC recently. Two perfect examples are \"Days Gone\" and \"Horizon Zero Dawn,\" which officially launched on Steam during the past two years.\n\n\nSteam \n\nBut if you say you're willing to wait for these former PlayStation exclusives to come to PC, you're going to be waiting for a while. For instance, \"Horizon Zero Dawn\" didn't release on Steam until three years after its initial launch on the PS4.With that, it could be safe to say that years of waiting will have to pass before you see a game like \"God of War\" or \"The Last of Us Part II\" on Steam.Related :\nSony is Allegedly Planning to Release 'Uncharted 4' On PC, According to a Leaked Investor ReportThis article is owned by Tech Times Written by RJ Pierce   \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

It's the same AI technology that powers Nvidia's deep learning super sampling (DLSS), but instead of being used for better performance, it's being used to create a better-aliased image. Instead of more frames, you get a clearer, crisper view of Elder Scrolls Online. \nNow we have a good look at just what DLAA can do in ESO. Benchmarks have been released showing a comparison between Elder Scrolls Online running on DLSS, DLAA, and regular TAA.\nIn general, you won\u2019t see much of a difference until you dial up the resolution to 4K. DLSS produces the best framerate, but can also produce a blurry, fuzzy image--especially when the benchmark zooms in on textures in the distance. You can see that some aspects of the tree get distorted and blown out, while DLAA and TAA show everything in exacting detail.\nRelated: Deathloop's Nvidia Reflex Update Reduces System Latency\nDLAA, conversely, forgoes framerate for better image quality. It might be difficult to see the difference between TAA and DLAA even at 4K, but there\u2019s a clear difference between DLAA and DLSS. \n\n\nTAA seems to offer a sort of middle ground between the two--not as many frames as DLSS, not as clear a picture as DLAA, but falling squarely in between the two extremes.\nAt 1080p it\u2019s almost impossible to tell the difference between the three graphics settings, and even at 1440p, it can be tricky to spot appreciable differences. With such high hardware performance and such low resolutions, even at max graphics settings, the benchmark PC is pushing out 200+ frames, with the only true difference between the three modes being another 40 or 70 frames.\nBut at 4K and with higher textures, DLSS can be a godsend, sometimes offering almost double the framerate with a minimal loss in image quality. DLAA, meanwhile, seems like a technology that would be more useful when you have frames to spare.\nSo far, DLAA is only available on The Elder Scrolls Online, but expect DLAA to start hitting other games in the very near future.\nNext: Death Stranding: Director's Cut Has A New PT Reference \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame News\n\n\n\n\nLive-Service Games\n\n\n\n\nTriple-A Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRoblox: SpongeBob Tower Defense - How To Get The Hunt Mega Edition Token\n\t\t\n\n\nLive-Service Games\n\nGrab the Hunt Mega Edition token in Roblox's SpongeBob Tower Defense.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 Needs To Take Inspiration From Relic's Cancelled Sequel\n\t\t\n\n\nTriple-A Games\n\nWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 3 was nearly very different.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEA Sports FC 25: Low Driven Shot PlayStyle, Explained\n\t\t\n\n\nEA Sports FC 25\n\nThe Low Driven Shot has been re-introduced in EA Sports FC 25.

Don't get too excited, though: Nvidia says the titles were just speculative entries for \"internal tracking and testing.\"The database contains a list of games and applications maintained by the developers of GeForce Now, Nvidia's cloud streaming platform. Software developer Ighor July figured out how to see everything in the database, including stuff that wasn't meant for public consumption, simply by requesting the information with a proxy server. At the end of a blog post about his method, he shows that he tried to alert Nvidia about the issue before publishing his findings, but apparently got no response.\"Nvidia is aware of an unauthorized published game list, with both released and/or speculative titles, used only for internal tracking and testing,\" the company said in a statement sent to PC Gamer on Monday. \"Inclusion on the list is neither confirmation nor an announcement of any game. Nvidia took immediate action to remove access to the list. No confidential game builds or personal information were exposed.\"\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nValve's Steam page currently lists a second mystery game alongside Deadlock, sending Half-Life 3 theorists into another frenzy of speculation\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Nvidia RTX 50-series placeholders have appeared on the EEC database, although I wouldn't get too excited about a hypothetical 'RTX 5090 Ti Super' if I were you\n\n\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't explain what the entries are used for, it's likely that developers add faux entries to test features, such as UI or functionality. Something like the PS4-exclusive God of War could eventually come to PC (it seems more likely than ever), but in this instance, it might have just been a made-up entry for testing purposes.A recent Reddit post compiled a list of the database entries exposed in the leak. Among them are the aforementioned PS5 games as well as entries like Titanfall 3, Resident Evil 4 Remake, and Monster Hunter 6.As for Half-Life 2 Remastered, another entry in the database, we've asked Valve whether or not it means anything, but haven't heard back. Don't read too much into that: Whether or not Valve responds to questions has not historically indicated anything at all. Just Valve being Valve.New Super Mario Bros Wii is also listed on Ighor's blog, and unless we've flipped to a bizarro world where the Canucks are going to win the Stanley Cup next year and Nintendo puts games on PC, we're pretty sure Nvidia's telling the truth about it being meaningless.

Many of the games appear to be PC ports of PlayStation titles, including Returnal and Demon's Souls. \nNvidia GeForce Now is a streaming service that connects to the many digital PC storefronts, offering thousands of games to play instantly. It operates similarly to Xbox Cloud Gaming with Game Pass, or PlayStation Now, where users subscribe to the service and are immediately given access to the library without jumping through any additional hoops.\nRELATED: PlayStation Reveals New Action-RPG Asterigos for PS4 and PS5\nOver the past year or so, PlayStation has slowly brought some of its console-exclusive games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Death Stranding, and Days Gone to PC, with supposed plans of bringing more in the future. If the leaks are to be believed, it looks like many more PC ports of beloved PlayStation titles could be on the way.\nRecently, a user by the name of Ighor July on Medium revealed listings for a multitude of PlayStation games from the Nvidia GeForce Now store. In an attempt to recover some deleted games, July stumbled upon the list of PlayStation titles, including: \n\nUncharted: Legacy of Thieves Edition\n\n\nHELLDIVERS 2\n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West\n\n\nGT7\n\n\nD\u00e9racin\u00e9\n\n\nGod of War\n\n\nReturnal\n\n\nDemon's Souls\n\n\nRatchet and Clank\n\n\nSackboy: A Big Adventure\n\n\nGhost of Tsushima\n\n\nAccording to July, the listings of these games should be taken with salt as they can be either old, canceled, or serving as testing data for new developments in these franchises. Notable missing titles are the rumored Bloodborne PC port, as well as Insomniac's Spider-Man games, and Naughty Dog's The Last of Us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interestingly, despite the ambiguous nature of why some of these titles are listed here, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is significant. The Legacy of Thieves Collection was announced at the PlayStation Showcase 2021 last week, a bundle bringing Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Lost Legacy to the PS5 and PC. For the collection to appear alongside unannounced PC ports like Returnal and Demon's Souls makes it seem the games, at the very least, are being tested on GeForce Now. Maybe they will eventually receive formal PC treatments. Of course, it could've been added to lend it some false credence.\nUnfortunately, for the time being, there is not much more that can be done to verify the truthfulness of the leak. On the internal PlayStation side, there have been previous suggestions that PlayStation was working on more PC ports like the PlayStation Studios Steam page. However, considering how infrequently PlayStation has been bringing its games to PC, with three or four titles in the past two years, it may be quite a while before any of these games make it to a PC storefront.\nMORE: Tchia and Kena: Bridge of Spirits Prove Sony Cares About Non-AAA Titles\nSource: Medium \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

The AD102 GPU will power the flagship lineup of graphics cards whether they be for gamers or workstation users. It will be the successor to the existing GA102 GPU & as such, we can definitely expect some killer specifications.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPBased upon previous rumors, there have been whispers that NVIDIA would utilize TSMC's N5 (5nm) process node for its Ada Lovelace GPUs. This includes the AD102\u00a0 SKU too which will be an entirely monolithic design. In his latest tweet which talks about the specific GPU configurations, the AD102 GPU is said to feature a clock speed as high as 2.2 GHz. The specific tweet states that the GPU clock for Ada Lovelace 'AD102' could be 2.2 GHz or greater so let's take that as a baseline and previously leaked specifications to figure out where the performance should land.\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1439486792332308481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1439486792332308481%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D1294334action%3Dedit\nThe NVIDIA AD102 \"ADA GPU\" appears to have 18432 CUDA Cores based on the preliminary specs (which can change) provided by Kopite. This is almost twice the cores present in Ampere which was already a massive step up from Turing. A 2.2 GHz clock speed would give us 81 TFLOPs of compute performance (FP32). This is more than twice the performance of the existing RTX 3090 which packs 36 TFLOPs of FP32 compute power.\n\nThe 125% performance jump looks huge but one should remember that NVIDIA already gave a big jump in FP32 numbers this generation with Ampere. The Ampere GA102 GPU (RTX 3090) offers 36 TFLOPs while the Turing TU102 GPU (RTX 2080 Ti) offered 13 TFLOPs. That's over a 150% increase in FP32 Flops but the real world gaming performance increase for the RTX 3090 averaged at around 50-60% faster over the RTX 2080 Ti. So one thing we shouldn't forget is that Flops don't equal GPU gaming performance these days. Furthermore, we don't know if 2.2 GHz is the average boost or the peak boost with the former meaning that there could be even higher compute potential for AD102.\nAside from that, the leaker also states that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 flagship would retain a 384-bit bus interface, similar to the RTX 3090. What's interesting is though that the leaker mentions G6X which means that NVIDIA won't be moving to a new memory standard until after Ada Lovelace and utilize the higher pin-speeds of G6X (20 Gbps+) for its next-generation cards before we see a newer standard (e.g. GDDR7).\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:\n\n\n\nGPUTU102GA102AD102\n\n\n\n\nFlagship SKURTX 2080 TiRTX 3090 TiRTX 4090?\n\n\nArchitectureTuringAmpereAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcessTSMC 12nm NFFSamsung 8nmTSMC 4N?\n\n\nDie Size754mm2628mm2~600mm2\n\n\nGraphics Processing Clusters (GPC)6712\n\n\nTexture Processing Clusters (TPC)364272\n\n\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SM)7284144\n\n\nCUDA Cores46081075218432\n\n\nL2 Cache6 MB6 MB96 MB\n\n\nTheoretical TFLOPs 16 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs?\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6XGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Capacity11 GB (2080 Ti)24 GB (3090 Ti)24 GB (4090?)\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps21 Gbps24 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth616 GB/s1.008 GB/s1152 GB/s?\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nPCIe InterfacePCIe Gen 3.0PCIe Gen 4.0PCIe Gen 4.0\n\n\nTGP250W350W600W?\n\n\nReleaseSep. 2018Sept. 202H 2022 (TBC)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will power the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards that will go head-on with AMD's RDNA 3 based Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards. There's still some speculation regarding the use of MCM by NVIDIA. The Hopper GPU, which is primarily aimed at the Datacenter & AI segment, is\u00a0allegedly taping out soon\u00a0and will feature an MCM architecture. NVIDIA won't be using an MCM design on its Ada Lovelace GPUs so they will keep the traditional monolithic design.\nAMD on the other hand is going on board with offering both MCM and Monolithic chips in its RDNA 3 and CDNA 2 families. The CDNA 2 GPUs will be MCM only while RDNA 3 will feature a mix of MCM and monolithic design as detailed here. It isn't confirmed which process node each company will be relying on but based on speculation,\u00a0AMD's RDNA 3 & CDNA 2 family\u00a0is going to be a mix of 6nm & 5nm nodes featuring\u00a0new and refreshed GPUs\u00a0while NVIDIA is expected to utilize\u00a0TSMC's 5nm process node for its Ada Lovelace GPUs\u00a0though it is not confirmed if those will be fabricated on the N5 or N5P node. Intel, on the other hand, may also rely on\u00a0TSMC's 6nm process node\u00a0for its own ARC Alchemist lineup of GPUs\u00a0which enter mass production later this year and launch in Q1 2022.\n\n\n\nWhich next-generation GPUs are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X Radeon RX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (GeForce RTX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist  (ARC Graphics Cards)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: 3DCenter\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n116\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

This titanic graphics card is the most advanced consumer model yet produced by the company, and it boasts a truly mighty specification - along with a price tag to match.This card is astonishingly expensive, even by the usual standard of computer hardware - you could buy a moderately capable workstation for the price of this GPU alone. Of course, when we talk about price, we\u2019re referring to the RRP, but at time of writing, you\u2019d have better luck finding the lost city of Atlantis than finding a 3090 selling for the recommended price. In fact, you\u2019d be lucky to find one at all. For the purpose of this review, however, we\u2019ll be using the RRP as a benchmark.The specific card on review is Gigabyte\u2019s GeForce RTX 3090 GAMING OC 24G - a partner card with all of the usual hallmarks of such, including a modest overclock, a snazzy design and some advanced cooling features. Performance should be largely the same across all variants, however.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review: DesignNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: Big things in a small package Nvidia takes aim at Intel with first data centre CPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review: A GPU worth waiting forPartner cards often try and stand out from the crowd with flashy, eye-catching designs, but while Gigabyte has injected a little visual personality into this GPU\u2019s appearance, the overall effect is comparatively sedate. There\u2019s a few angular flourishes to the body, but garish colour schemes are mercifully absent, and the only RGB lighting is the company\u2019s logo on the side. It also feels sturdier and more robust than any other GPU we\u2019ve tested, thanks to a solid metal backplate protecting the circuitry.All in all, it\u2019s about as sober and professional-looking as you could reasonably expect a consumer graphics card to be, which is doubly impressive considering how much space there would be for fancy design gimmicks. Appropriately for the top of the RTX range, it\u2019s a bit of a monster in terms of size, at 320mm long and 55mm thick. However, while that\u2019s certainly sizeable, it\u2019s actually slightly smaller than Zotac\u2019s RTX 3080. Technically it takes up three PCIe slots, rather than the two and a half demanded by Zotac\u2019s card, but there\u2019s minimal difference in practicality.For cooling, Gigabyte has used seven copper heat pipes, fin-stack aluminium heatsinks and a large copper plate for heat dissipation. That\u2019s in addition to the fans. There are two 90mm fans at the front and rear of the card which spin anticlockwise, and one 80mm fan in the middle which spins in the opposite direction. This, according to Gigabyte, makes the fans more stable and increases air pressure for more efficient cooling.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review: Specs and performanceAll that cooling is going to be necessary for this graphics card to live up to its promises in the power department. It\u2019s got a staggering spec, with 10,496 CUDA cores, a jaw-dropping 24GB of GDDR6X memory and a base clock speed of 1,755MHz. Sadly, those promises turned out to be somewhat insubstantial when we ran it through our tests, conducted on our test machine (provided by Chillblast) with 32GB of RAM and an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X processor.It racked up meaty enough scores in the Octanebench 2020 and Luxmark 3.1 GPU rendering tests - 673 and 18,913 respectively, compares to 565 and 16,093 for the 3080. It put in an extremely proficient performance in SPECviewPerf 2020\u2019s more enterprise-focused tests as well.Scores of 195.16 for 3dsmax-07, 391 for solidworks-05 and 529 for maya-06 are some of the highest we\u2019ve ever seen, so media professionals and creatives will be extremely happy. Performance for the rest of the engineering, medical and scientific workloads were unimpressive compared to professional cards like Nvidia\u2019s Quadro line, but that\u2019s de rigeur for a consumer card, and only to be expected.That\u2019s a seriously powerful performance, and one befitting the RTX 3090\u2019s place at the top of Nvidia\u2019s lineup - so why did it leave us disappointed? As with many things, the answer comes down to cost. The 3090 costs more than twice as much as the 3080, and that\u2019s just based on recommended prices, without taking current fluctuations into account. For that money, you\u2019d expect the 3090 to be twice as good as the next model down, but that\u2019s not the case.Instead, the biggest difference between it and the 3080 was in the 3dsmax-07 test - where it managed a 25% lead - and in some tests, the performance advantage was less than 10%. Admittedly, this does make the 3090 the fastest of the RTX range by a clear margin, but that\u2019s a poor argument for dropping so much money on a single component. Although it possesses overwhelming firepower, the price you\u2019re paying for it is somewhat outsized.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review: Specs and featuresYou could, on the other hand, make the argument that it\u2019s the features that differentiate this card from its stablemates. It\u2019s the only RTX that supports multi-GPU configurations via SLI, for example, and it\u2019s also sporting two HDMI 2.1 ports in addition to three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs, while the rest of the 3000-series only include one.Otherwise, however, it\u2019s pretty much the same as the rest of the line. It includes second-generation ray tracing cores and third-generation tensor cores, OpenGL 4.6 support, DLSS for AI-based framerate boosting, and support for four monitors and a 7,680 x 4,320 maximum resolution.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review: VerdictIf you want the very best, you\u2019ll usually have to pay the price, and that\u2019s certainly true with Nvidia\u2019s top-tier consumer GPU. However, while the RTX 3090 is inarguably the most capable card in the company\u2019s non-professional stable, we can\u2019t recommend it outside of a handful of very specific niche use-cases.If you\u2019re after a workstation with the grunt to blaze through media, modelling and rendering workloads, then the 3080 is almost as powerful but costs half as much, while those seeking optimum performance for engineering and scientific workloads will find much more suitable speeds for those applications with a Quadro card.The only practical way in which the RTX 3090 sets itself apart is its support for multi-GPU deployment via SLI. If you\u2019re looking to bridge the gap between a standard workstation and a GPU compute server, then cramming two 3090s into the same box may fit the bill - but for virtually every other conceivable workload, one of its stablemates will likely make a better bet.Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 GAMING OC 24G specificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyStream processors10,496Base clock1,395MHzBoost clock1,755MHzMemory24GBConnectivityPCIe 4.0 16xDisplay outputs3x DisplayPort 1.4, 2x HDMI 2.1Max resolution7680 x 4320 @60HzTDP350WPower connections2x 8-pinSupported APIsMicrosoft DirectX 12 Ultimate, Vulkan RT API, OpenGL 4.6\n\n\nAdam ShepherdSocial Links NavigationAdam Shepherd has been a technology journalist since 2015, covering everything from cloud storage and security, to smartphones and servers.

GPUs are no exception, and MSRP is a term that has lost its meaning as there are no signs that retailers will sell graphics cards at that price for the foreseeable future. \nEarlier this year, it looked like there was a general downward trend in GPU prices. Last month, Ethereum mining saw a lower-than-expected hit even after the rollout of the EIP1559 protocol upgrade that was supposed to make it somewhat less profitable. But as NFTs bloomed, mining activity saw a comparable increase which has kept demand for GPUs well above supply.\nFollow up: TechSpot GPU Update September 2021\nAccording to new data from 3DCenter, GPU availability and pricing are once again taking a turn for the worse, with Radeon cards from AMD now sitting at an average of 74 percent above MSRP, while Nvidia GeForce graphics cards models are commanding a 70 percent premium over their supposed manufacturer-recommended price. As you know, we also track GPU pricing on a monthly basis and are coming out with our September report later this week (now live).\n\nThis is the pricing situation observed at German retailers, but there are separate reports that confirm this is reflective of a global trend. Despite their best efforts, retailers aren't getting anywhere nearly enough units of either Nvidia's RTX 3060 or AMD's RX 6600 XT. And these will likely be the most sought-after cards for reasons that are explained in Steven's extensive review.\nTop-end models like the GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080, Radeon RX 6900 XT, and Radeon RX 6800 XT are even harder to find. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n OpenAI rolls out GPT-4.5 to Pro users only, faces shortage of GPU horsepower \n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\nReports indicate that Nvidia has started using faulty GA104 dies from would-be RTX 3070 Ti GPUs and turning them into RTX 3060 GPUs to alleviate supply and yield issues. As for AMD, the company says it will prioritize high-end GPUs in the coming months, but supply could still remain tight until next year.\nFurther compounding these issues is the recent TSMC price hike, which is close to 20 percent for some of its customers, but only three percent for Apple according to reports. Beyond silicon, there's an even bigger threat to the affordability of anything with electronics in it \u2013 rare earth metal prices have exploded recently, and there's no immediate solution for that.\n\n\n\n\n 27 comments\n \n452 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

It could advance many fields of science, as well as the design for everything from lighter cars to more effective drugs.\nThe code, available in the group\u2019s open source repository, got a 20x speedup in just 18 months thanks to GPUs.\nA Journey to the Summit\nIn mid-2018 the team was getting ready to release a version of the code running on CPUs when it got an invite to a GPU hackathon at Oak Ridge National Lab, the home of Summit, one of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\n\u201cWe thought, let\u2019s go see what we can achieve,\u201d said Gavini, a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science.\n\u201cWe quickly realized our code could exploit the massive parallelism in GPUs,\u201d said Sambit Das, a post-doc from the lab who attended the five-day event.\nBefore it was over, Das and another lab member, Phani Motamarri, got 5x speedups moving the code to CUDA and its libraries. They also heard the promise of much more to come.\nFrom 5x to 20x Speedups in Six Months\nOver the next few months, the lab continued to tune its program for analyzing 100,000 electrons in 10,000 magnesium atoms. By early 2019, it was ready to run on Summit.\nTaking an iterative approach, the lab ran increasing portions of its code on more and more of Summit\u2019s nodes. By April, it was using most of the system\u2019s 27,000 GPUs, getting nearly 46 petaflops of performance, 20x prior work.\nIt was an unheard-of result for a program based on density functional theory (DFT), the complex math that accounts for quantum interactions among subatomic particles.\nDistributed Computing for Difficult Calculations\nDFT calculations are so complex and fundamental that they currently consume a quarter of the time on all public research computers. They are the subject of 12 of the 100 most-cited scientific papers, used to analyze everything from astrophysics to DNA strands.\nInitially, the lab reported its program used nearly 30 percent of Summit\u2019s peak theoretical capability, an unusually high efficiency rate. By comparison, most other DFT codes don\u2019t even report efficiency because they have difficulty scaling beyond use of a few processors.\n\u201cIt was really exciting to get to that point because it was unprecedented,\u201d said Gavini.\nRecognition for a Math Milestone\nIn late 2019, the group was named a finalist for a Gordon Bell award. It was the lab\u2019s first submission for the award that\u2019s the equivalent of a Nobel in high performance computing.\n\u201cThat provided a lot of visibility for our lab and our university, and I think this effort is just the beginning,\u201d Gavini said.\nIndeed, since the competition, the lab pushed the code\u2019s performance to 64 petaflops and 38 percent efficiency on Summit. And it\u2019s already exploring its use on other systems and applications.\nSeeking More Apps, Performance\nThe initial work analyzed magnesium, a metal much lighter than the steel and aluminum used in cars and planes today, promising significant fuel savings. Last year, the lab teamed up with another group exploring how electrons move in DNA, work that could help other researchers develop more effective drugs.\nThe next big step is running the code on Perlmutter, a supercomputer using the latest NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. Das reports he\u2019s already getting 4x speedups compared to the Summit GPUs thanks to the A100 GPUs\u2019 support for TensorFloat-32, a mixed-precision format that delivers both fast results and high accuracy.\nThe lab\u2019s program already offers 100x speedups compared to other DFT codes, but Gavini\u2019s not stopping there. He\u2019s already thinking about testing it on Fugaku, an Arm-based system that\u2019s currently the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting to see how far you can get, and there\u2019s always a next milestone. We see this as the beginning of a journey,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: CUDA | Customer Stories | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | New GPU Uses | Parallel Computing | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Above that GPU sits the GA104, which is used primarily for the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and mobile RTX 3080, among other workstation cards.But according to TechPowerUp's GPU database editor, we could soon see the GA104 GPU find its way within the RTX 3060 as well.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nSpecs for Nvidia's new RTX 5050, 5060, and 5060 Ti GPUs leak out and that 5060 might actually be half decent. If it's priced right\n\n\n\nRecycled GA104s used in unannounced RTX 3060shttps://t.co/ma9XHreCc3 new dev ID 2487September 17, 2021It's not all that unusual for Nvidia to repurpose a chip this way. In fact, the RTX 2060 can be found with both TU106 and TU104 GPUs at its core. That was only within one manufacturer's card, the EVGA RTX 2060 KO, as far as we know.So GPU jostling is in the realms of possibility. That said, such a change shouldn't amount to much by way of specification for the RTX 3060, despite the larger GPU's greater potential core counts and ROPs. The GPU should be as much a match as the GA106 version, although there's the possibility of some fringe disparities between the two depending on how the larger chip is chopped up.Instead, what this move would likely achieve is handing Nvidia a little more freedom and flexibility in supply.Your next machine(Image credit: Future)Best gaming PC: the top pre-built machines from the pros\nBest gaming laptop: perfect notebooks for mobile gamingIdeally, for us lot, that would translate to greater availability of the cheaper card, but that really depends on how many GA104 GPUs end up filtering into the RTX 3060 production line, if any\u2014Nvidia wouldn't just throw more expensive GPUs into a cheaper graphics card for the fun of it.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.No, these chips are likely to be up to the standard required by any of the current GA104 graphics cards, even the relatively slim core count of the RTX 3060 Ti, hence why they might find a home elsewhere.\u00a0We've no word on availability yet though, and it's likely in the grand scale of graphics card supply most GA104 RTX 3060 cards will go unnoticed by their owners\u2014if any are made, of course.It's worth mentioning that Nvidia may have a more substantial shake-up on the cards for next year.

Since the list\u2019s debut, gamers have been debating its authenticity, and now NVIDIA has weighed in on the situation. In a statement provided to Wccftech, the company stated that some of the games are in development, though some are \u201cspeculative,\u201d meaning that some of the games listed might not actually be in development. That answer will no doubt lead to continued speculation from fans, particularly as games on the list are announced in the coming weeks and months.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\tVideos by ComicBook.com\t\t\n\n\u201cNVIDIA is aware of an unauthorizedpublished game list, with both released and/or speculative titles, usedonly for internal tracking and testing. Inclusion on the list is neitherconfirmation nor an announcement of any game,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cNVIDIA took immediate action to remove access to the list. No confidential game builds or personal information were exposed.\u201c\nAt least one game on the list has been confirmed, ironically from an entirely different leak! The list contained a remake for Destroy All Humans! 2, which was confirmed through a trailer posted on the official PlayStation Twitter account earlier today. That Tweet has since been deleted, but the cat is already out of the bag. NVIDIA will likely see that being the case for the rest of the games that were on the list; while access might have been removed by the company, there are still a number of places that it can be found online, even if we don\u2019t know which items are accurate and which ones were added based on NVIDIA\u2019s speculation. \nFor now, video game fans will just have to wait and see what the future might hold! The NVIDIA leak hints at a possible Final Fantasy IX remake, a new Final Fantasy Tactics, the rumored GTA remasters, and a lot more games that fans would love to see happen. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get answers to some of those rumors sooner, rather than later. \nWhat do you think of the list that was published? Do you think most of these are based on speculation?

The software that enables computers to do things that once required human perception and judgment depends largely on hardware made possible by Jensen Huang. In 2003, amid great skepticism, Huang directed his company Nvidia to adapt chips designed to paint graphics on computer screens, known as graphics processing units or GPUs, to perform other, more general-purpose computing tasks. The resulting advancements\u2014and powerful chips\u2014laid a foundation that could accommodate much bigger neural networks, the programs behind much of today\u2019s AI. In the process, he has helped enable a revolution that allows phones to answer questions out loud, farms to spray weeds but not crops, doctors to predict the properties of new drugs\u2014with more wonders to come. \n Huang\u2019s gamble paid off largely because he is among the world\u2019s most technically savvy CEOs. He\u2019s also a compassionate steward of his employees and a generous supporter of education in science and technology. With still\u202femerging AI technologies creating an insatiable hunger for more computation, Huang\u2019s team is well-positioned to keep driving technological advances for decades to come. Ng is founder of DeepLearning.AI, founder and CEO of Landing AI, and chairman and co-founder of Coursera \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRamona Rosales for TIME\n\n \n Get a print of the 2021 TIME100 cover featuring Jensen Huang \n\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n\n\n Inside Elon Musk\u2019s War on Washington Meet the 2025 Women of the Year The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\u00a0 Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone Cecily Strong on Goober the Clown Column: The Rise of America\u2019s Broligarchy \n Contact us at letters@time.com. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nSHARE THIS STORY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        MORE FROM\n                  \n                    The 100 Most Influential People of 2021\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kate Winslet\nKenneth Branagh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cathy Park Hong\nAli Wong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\nPrince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billie Eilish\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Simone Biles\nSerena Williams\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n EDIT POST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Home\n                  \n\n\n\n                    U.S.\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Politics\n                  \n\n\n\n                    World\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Health\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Business\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Tech\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Personal Finance by TIME Stamped\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Shopping by TIME Stamped\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Future of Work by Charter\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Entertainment\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Ideas\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Science\n                  \n\n\n\n                    History\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Sports\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Magazine\n                  \n\n\n\n                    The TIME Vault\n                  \n\n\n\n                    TIME For Kids\n                  \n\n\n\n                    TIMECO2\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Coupons\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    TIME Edge\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Video\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Masthead\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Newsletters\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Subscribe\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Digital Magazine\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Give a Gift\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Shop the TIME Store\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Careers\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Modern Slavery Statement\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Press Room\n                  \n\n\n\n                    TIME Studios\n                  \n\n\n\n                    U.S. & Canada Customer Care\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Global Help Center\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Contact the Editors\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Reprints and Permissions\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Site Map\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Media Kit\n                  \n\n\n\n                    Supplied Partner Content\n                  \n\n\n\n                    About Us\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n         \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

It's nice then to see that Nvidia Broadcast is receiving a big update that further improves audio filtering and more.Nvidia Broadcast's 1.3 update's big addition is improved noise reduction for high or loud voices. Nvidia notes that Broadcast previously had issues with streamers (especially those with \u00a0naturally high-pitched voices) being accidentally filtered during louder moments. Say you just defeated a raid boss in Destiny 2 and want to shout out your triumph, or that you just got spooked by the new ghost in Phasmophobia and cried out like someone dropped ice down your back. 1.3 adds in dedicated training sound profiles to better learn your voice patterns while still filtering out unwanted noise.Of course the other half of video calls or streams is actually getting to see your coworkers/adoring fans/adoring coworkers. Nvidia Broadcast 1.3 adds in support for more pro cameras, virtual cameras, and capture cards: Canon EOS Webcam Utility, Nikon Webcam Utility, Sony Webcam Utility and (perhaps most importantly) OBS Virtual Camera.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's latest 572.16 driver isn't just for the RTX 50-series, as 20, 30 and 40-series cards are also gifted with significant updates\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's impressive AI-based computer tuneup tool G-Assist launches next month but the best bit is missing\n\n\n\nIf you're worried about having another app to slow down your struggling rig, Broadcast's 1.3 update is also further reducing VRAM usage by an additional 40% in addition to its previous update's VRAM requirement cut. That'll come in handy when you're using multiple parts of Broadcast's AI features, like the auto-framing that will follow your face as you move around.Keep in mind that Broadcast will only work on RTX cards.

They, and I, were staring at a black-and-green storefront, mashing F5 until a \u201cNotify me\u201d button changed to read \u201cOut of stock\u201d. This was the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 launch, and what initially looked like a one-off failure of Nvidia\u2019s anti-bot measures ended up heralding the worst year in memory to upgrade a graphics card.\r\n\n\n\r\nTwelve months later, the roster of RTX 30 series GPUs \u2013 all built on Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture \u2013 has grown to nine models, including more powerful Ti versions of the original RTX 3080 and RTX 3070. Actually buying one, sadly, is only a marginally less awful experience than it was on the RTX 3080\u2019s big day. Considering Nvidia\u2019s tendency to launch new architectures every two years, is it even worth holding out for RTX 30-series stock? Or should you wait a while longer to upgrade?\r\n\n\n\n\nThe PC Gaming Weekspot: Deathloop Impressions! The Artful Escape Review! PC at PlayStation Showcase!\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t been following graphics cards news this past year \u2013 understandable, as doing so has repeatedly made me want to eat glass \u2013 here\u2019s a basic recap of what\u2019s gone wrong. It was immediately apparent that Nvidia\u2019s supply of RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and even \u00a31,399 RTX 3090 GPUs wasn\u2019t matching buyer demand, but while this made for a disappointing launch, it wasn\u2019t all that surprising. The then-new range was promising drastically improved performance over the RTX 20 series at mostly restrained prices, so why wouldn\u2019t people want to get on board? Resellers were no doubt adding unwelcome strain, and Nvidia\u2019s store rightly took flak for a lack of effective protection against retail bots, but surely more stock would be on its way.\r\n\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t. Or at least, it was, but only in sporadic, tiny amounts. What initially looked like a ho-hum paper launch was in fact the sum of multiple overlapping demand and supply issues that continue to limit graphic cards supplies today. And CPU supplies, and games console supplies, and even the supplies of some cars. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nThe biggest of these issues is that Nvidia have been facing their own parts shortage, as higher industry demand for silicone and substrates has been compounded by pandemic-induced disruption to the production of these components. The result is that Nvidia can\u2019t simply make more cards to keep up with demand, which itself has exploded for far more diverse reasons than a bunch of tasty-looking GPUs. Again, there\u2019s the influence of bot-wielding resellers, and cryptocurrency mining re-emerged to spoil everything just like it did a few years ago. Less annoyingly, there\u2019s also been a much wider need for PCs and PC components now that more people are staying at and working from home, adding to the demand for silicone even if not the Nvidia cards specifically.\r\n\n\r\nFor the most part, the only way to secure an RTX 30 card for yourself has been to wait until someone on Twitter (shout out to RPS contributor Will, who diligently runs the Digital Foundry Deals account) catches a restock in progress, at which point you can attempt to pounce before it too is depleted by retail bots, miners, and other frame rate-starved PC owners. Recently, and with a bit of luck, it\u2019s also been possible to just rock up to an online retailer and find some RTX 30 cards in stock. Sadly, this usually introduces yet another headache: vastly inflated prices. In classic capitalistic fashion, low supply multiplied by desperate demand equals gouging. One generally reputable UK site I literally just checked has several RTX 3060 Ti cards available for \u00a3700 apiece, \u00a3300 more than the RRP. Elsewhere, the original, \u00a3649 RTX 3080 regularly sells for over a grand.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps, then, the question needs wording differently. Maybe it\u2019s not so much about how long you should hold out for, it\u2019s a matter of how much bullshit you\u2019re prepared to wade through in exchange for a good GPU. And that\u2019s the biggest shame \u2013 these are good GPUs! We\u2019ve got three RTX 30 models in our best graphics card rankings, and even if you don\u2019t go for the Ti models, the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 have hardly aged when it comes to high-resolution performance. The lack of real entry-level/1080p models is unfortunate, but under normal circumstances, most of the existing RTX 30 series would get a recommendation in a heartbeat. Yes, even with the rumoured RTX 40 series seemingly arriving next year.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\n(Speaking of rumours, there may also be an RTX 3080 Super and RTX 3070 Super coming in 2022, but so far these pretty much just exist in the form of social media gossip. If anything like the old RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super they\u2019d also be more expensive, which doesn\u2019t sound appealing given the inflation situation, so I\u2019m not convinced they\u2019re worth considering if you\u2019re weighing up a GPU upgrade right now.)\r\n\n\r\nIn these very much abnormal circumstances, though, not even the RTX 30 series\u2019 brawniness necessarily makes for a worthwhile upgrade. Going restock-chasing might be justified if the cards were being sold at RRP, or slightly above for a quality partner card model, but when they\u2019re hundreds of pounds over as a matter of course? Even if you beat the resellers and the miners to available stock, outside of some truly obscene luck, all you\u2019d ultimately be winning is the opportunity to get ripped off. And there\u2019s no refuge to be found in the equivalent AMD Radeon RX 6000 series either, as it\u2019s facing the same perfect storm of supply and demand problems as Nvidia\u2019s lineup, right down to the inflated prices. \r\n\n\r\nI know the allure of the new shiny thing as well as anyone, but considering both the miserable state of the GPU market and the likelihood of that misery extending well into next year, I do think the smarter move is to wait. Yeah, it sucks to make that call on purely economic reasoning, regardless of the quality of the cards, and especially when ray tracing and DLSS support is on the rise. Still, it\u2019s better to be patient than to be taken advantage of, no matter how bouncy the light rays are.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

The more worrying part is that we won't have to wait for next-gen graphics cards to arrive in order to see single GPUs pushing over 400 watts \u2013 the mid-generation hardware refreshes look hotter and more power hungry than ever. \nWhen our own Steve Walton tested Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, he couldn't help but ask himself what the intended audience of this product was. The RTX 3080 Ti has proven to be a powerful member of the Ampere family, but at the same time it was an expensive, poorly-timed release with only half as much VRAM as the RTX 3090.\nRumors have been circulating for months about an RTX 3080 refresh with 20 gigabytes of VRAM, but when the RTX 3080 Ti arrived, it left Nvidia fans disappointed with a mere 12 gigabytes, less than any of AMD's high-end Radeon 6000 series cards. Still, both Asus and Gigabyte had slip ups last year where they revealed unreleased RTX 3080 Ti SKUs with 20 gigabytes of video memory, so it was only a matter of time before they surfaced again.\n\nThis week, an anonymous user uploaded what appears to be the firmware for a Gigabyte Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Xtreme (GV-N308TAORUS X-20GD) graphics card, which was spotted by @momomo_us. The device ID also appears to be different than the existing 12 gigabyte model that was released in June, indicating this could indeed turn out to be the long-awaited 20 gigabyte model.\nOther than that, the new model looks to be equipped with the same 19 Gbps GDDR6X memory over a slightly smaller, 320-bit memory bus. If true, this would mean the new RTX 3080 Ti will have 17 percent less memory bandwidth than the current model. Be that as it may, a more worrying aspect is the power target of 420 watts, which could be a troubling sign of things to come.\n\n(A Russian YouTuber is already exploring the card's crypto mining capabilities.)\nIf this doesn't convince you, apparently there's a Russian retailer called HARDVAR that is already selling this new graphics card in Saint Petersburg for 225,000 rubles \u2013 the equivalent of $3,071. Another one called ZSCOM is also jumping in on the action. As usual, cryptocurrency miners have already gotten their hands on it to test its ability to turn watts into millions of hashes that certify transactions on the Ethereum network. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Nvidia RTX 50 series supply woes extend to system builders as scalpers drive up prices \n\n\n\nOne such miner shared his results on YouTube, and by the looks of it, the card doesn't appear to have a hash rate limiter. After some tweaking, he was able to get 94 MH per second, which is lower than an RTX 3090 but significantly better than the existing RTX 3080 Ti, which is only able to reach around 65-66 MH per second. The YouTuber also explained that he's been able to get close to 98 MH per second but the card was less stable at that speed.\n\nGiven the fact that one Russian retailer is already selling the RTX 3080 Ti 20GB and another is already listing the new model on its website, we won't have to wait much longer before we see it popping up in more places. As for the price, it's possible the MSRP will be somewhere between that of the RTX 3080 Ti 12GB and the RTX 3090, which carry an MSRP of $1,200 and $1,500, respectively \u2013 not that you can expect to find this new RTX 3080 Ti model at anywhere near its recommended price.\nRumors are also picking up about a monstrous RTX 3090 Super being in the works, and that too will have an inflated TGP of over 400 watts. If anything, it looks like the era of single GPUs demanding in excess of 400 watts is already here, despite indications that it will be ushered by next-generation models from Nvidia and AMD.\nIn the meantime, Intel is working hard on its Alchemist GPUs, but they're far from ready to battle the beasts coming out of the dungeons of the other two manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\n 16 comments\n \n408 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

We recently covered the market share state for the GPU market and also reported on the AIB figures yesterday and in all reports, NVIDIA has outpaced the red team.\nNVIDIA GeForce Outpaces AMD Radeon In Discrete Graphics Card & AIB Market Share Report For Q2 2021\nIn their report, JPR (Jon Peddie Research) states that the AIBs (Add-in-boards), worth $11.8 Billion, were shipped in Q2 2021. This marked an increase of 179% year over year & was primarily due to increased prices for consumer graphics cards because graphics cards were in huge demand and despite the market slowing down in terms of growth, the average retail prices were much higher, leading to a higher price share. So despite fewer units being shipped, everyone was able to profit from the GPU market share leading to a higher AIB market value.\nRelated Story AMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 CoresAs for AMD and NVIDIA specific market shares, NVIDIA GeForce discrete GPUs climbed to 83% ( versus 81% in Q1 2021) while AMD Radeon discrete GPUs declined to 17% (versus 19% in Q1 2021). As for the AIB market share which only includes graphics cards, NVIDIA's share remained steady at 80% while AMD retained its 20% market share.\nA breakdown of the current GPU market segment consisting of Intel, AMD, NVIDIA GPUs. (Image Source: 3DCenter)\n3DCenter has posted a detailed breakdown of the share of the discrete GPUs from AMD & NVIDIA. NVIDIA's GeForce Mobility GPUs led with a 43% market share and were followed by the AIB cards which grabbed a 40% market share hold. AMD's Radeon AIB cards had a higher market share than the mobility segment, standing at 10% while the mobility chips only amounted to a 7% GPU share.\nNVIDIA GeForce & AMD Radeon discrete graphics card market share progress through the years. (Image Source: 3DCenter)\nYou can also see the market share trend of NVIDIA's desktop discrete graphics cards with GeForce RTX 30 series maintaining a steady position around the 80% mark while AMD's Radeon RX 6000 has not been able to break past the 20% market share for a while. NVIDIA's graphics cards have been generally available in much better stock than AMD's Radeon GPUs but despite that, the supply isn't enough to meet the demand.\n\n\n\n\nQ2'20\nQ1'21\nQ2'21\n\n\nAMD\n20%\n19%\n17%\n\n\nNVIDIA\n80%\n81%\n83%\n\n\nPC dGPU shipment market shares\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has managed to allocate its resources to ramp up the production of Ampere GPUs featured in the GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards while AMD is having a tough time due to constraints on TSMC's 7nm node which is being gobbled up by other products from AMD and competitors.

Got test data? Need to create a model? Everything you need can be found in a public cloud like AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. But look out, cloud fans. There may be a revival of on-premises computing for AI coming to an enterprise near you.Saying that the democratization of AI is necessary for widespread adoption, GPU chip giant Nvidia has rolled out software called Nvidia AI Enterprise into general availability. The company has also built on its partnership with VMware (vSphere) and Domino Data Labs to create a stack of AI-specific software to enable enterprise organizations to put their AI deployments onto industry-standard servers in on-premises data centers. The Nvidia announcement is essentially acknowledging that the biggest AI hardware and infrastructure growth over the next several years will be on-premises.That\u2019s backed up by a recent market research report from analyst firm Omdia. While the cloud accounts for 88% of cloud and data center AI processor market revenue, with on-premises data centers responsible for just 12%, that on-premises market growth is expected to pick up the pace in the years ahead, according to Jonathan Cassell, principal analyst for advanced computing at Omdia.\u201cUp until now it\u2019s been easier for companies to deploy AI projects in the cloud,\u201d Cassell says. \u201cYou can get it up and running quickly. But the on-premises data center isn\u2019t going away.\u201dOmdia is forecasting that on-premises data center AI processor revenue will expand at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 78% from 2020 through 2026, more than double the rate expected (36%) for the cloud sector. Certainly, the small initial base of on-premises implementations accounts for some of that high growth rate on the on-premises side.Other driving factors are the need for certain industries to move forward with AI projects while keeping that work on site. For instance, some industries such as finance or healthcare\u00a0may be faced with strict regulatory environments that make it preferable to keep data and AI processing on-premises. In other cases, privacy and security concerns may influence organizations to choose an on-premises deployment of AI. For some industries, data latency could play a factor in companies\u2019 decisions to keep AI workloads in-house. The cloud is too far removed from where the data is generated, so it's better to do the AI processing at the edge where the data lives.The Nvidia announcement provides an easier path for organizations that want to deploy their AI on-premises, Cassell says.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of challenges to implementing AI in a data center environment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt requires a fair degree of expertise. Nvidia is trying to make the whole process simpler for enterprise customers \u2026 the company wants to bring the whole AI deployment process into the realm of standard virtualization that you see in data centers.\u201dManuvir Das is the head of enterprise computing at Nvidia. In a briefing about the company\u2019s enterprise AI software, he said it\u2019s aimed at two personas: data scientists, who get all the tools and frameworks they expect for AI; and IT administrators who will be working in the familiar VMware environment. An SDK (software development kit)\u00a0called Rapids Data Science optimizes frameworks including TensorFlow and Pytorch for the Nvidia GPUs so they can run faster.The partnership with Domino Data Labs, which provides an MLOps platform, will offer the tools needed to do end-to-end AI workflow, from the acquisition of data to deployment and production of models.This includes governance and reporting; model operations; reproducibility and collaboration; and self-serve, scalable infrastructure. Domino Data Labs provides a layer in between the Nvidia software and any number of other tools, packages, languages, data sources and other systems an enterprise may already have in place, including Python, R, SAS, Snowflake, SQL, Jupyter, DataRobot, Spark, and Amazon SageMaker.But Nvidia is a hardware company, right? Nvidia's specialty and foundation has been on graphical processing units -- co-processors originally developed for better graphics processing and also used for the intensive compute required by artificial intelligence and other similar technologies.\u00a0Wouldn't developing software for AI be just a side project for a company like that to help them sell more GPUs? Not according to Das.\u201cThis is not a side project at all,\u201d Das says. \u201cWe believe this is a significant business for Nvidia going forward\u2026We think there is a significant opportunity here that is separate from the hardware.\u201dWhat to Read Next:\u00a0Finding High-Value AI Use CasesData and Analytics Salaries Heat Up in Recovery EconomyWhat CIOs Need to Know About Graph Database TechnologyAbout the AuthorJessica DavisSenior EditorJessica Davis is a Senior Editor at InformationWeek.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorSep 22, 2021, 08:22pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Materials handling robot using AI perceptionNvidia\nNvidia and Open Robotics announced a partnership to enhance the ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) development suite. The partnership essentially combines the two most powerful robotics development environments and the two largest groups of robotics developers.\n\n\nFirst released in 2010, ROS has been a key open-source platform for robotics developers supported by various companies in a variety of industries and government research organizations like DARPA and NASA. While the platform has continued to grow and includes the Ignition simulation environment, it has been primarily targeting traditional CPU computing models. Over the past several years, however, Nvidia has pioneered heterogeneous and AI computing for IoT and edge applications through the development of its Jetson platforms, software development kits (SDKs) like Isaac for robotics, toolkits like Nvidia TAO (Train, Adapt, and Optimize) for simplifying AI model development and deployment, and Omniverse Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation and robotics simulation. Both environments are open to developers, provide valuable code, models, data sets, and simulation resources. Now the two can be combined into Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse collaborative development environment to allow developers to simultaneously develop everything from the physical robot to synthetic data sets to train the robot.\nThe Jetson product family and Isaac Robotics platformNvidia\n\nFor the ROS developers, this opens a world of possibilities. Pulling ROS into the Nvidia environment offers the developer the ability to leverage offload/acceleration engines like a GPU, shared memory, and predesigned hardware acceleration algorithms Nvidia calls Isaac Gems. Thus far, Nvidia is offering three Gems for image processing and DNN-based perception models, including SGM Stereo Disparity and Point Cloud, Color Space Conversion and Lens Distortion Correction, and AprilTags Detection. The performance lift from offloading depends on the specific algorithm, but Nvidia expects that some will result in an order of magnitude improvement in performance versus the same implementation on a CPU. In addition, the Isaac Sim includes support for ROS and ROS2 algorithms, including ROS April Tag, ROS Stereo Camera, ROS Services, Movelt Motion Planning Framework, Native Python ROS Usage, and ROS2 Navigation. The Isaac Sim can also be used to generate synthetic data to train and test perception models. The predesigned algorithms combined the synthetic data allow even the most novice developer or startup to quickly develop robotic platforms.\n\nROS developers seeking to add AI technologies to their products will also be able to leverage other Nvidia SDKs, such as Fleet Command for remote system management, Riva for conversational AI, and Deepstream for video streaming analytics. Most importantly, from Tirias Research\u2019s perspective is the ability to leverage the Omniverse environment, which allows multiple simultaneous users with seamless interaction between tools, and the massive amounts of new data and machine learning (ML) models being developed by Nvidia.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nAlthough, Nvidia has SDKs for various applications, such as Isaac for robotics, Clara for healthcare, and Drive for autonomous vehicles, the ML models for each of these segments are increasingly overlapping. When discussing this point the Nvidia\u2019s General Manager of Robotics Murali Gopalakrishna, Mr. Gopalakrishna indicated that there is considerable crossover in the development of the SDKs and models for many of the applications. According to Mr. Gopalakrishna \u201cthe only difference is the data; the decisions are still the same.\u201d As a result, the advances in one market or application typically benefits multiple markets and applications.\nWorldwide forecast for robots Nvidia, Statisa\n\n\nAccording to data from Statista, the robotics market is projected to grow at over a 25% rate annually, an increase from approximately 20% prior to COVID. COVID is pushing the use of robotics in everything from healthcare and manufacturing to agriculture and food delivery. Leveraging the advancements in AI, sensors, wireless communications (5G), and semiconductor technology, robotics is rapidly moving into the mainstream of society. By 2025, the global robotics market will reach $210 billion, but that is a fraction of the value of the products and services that will be generated by robotics. Having evaluated various development platforms and tools, I can attest to the value of the resources that the Nvidia Isaac and ROS platforms offer developers. Both make it easy for developers to begin developing new robotic platforms but the combination of the two, for lack of a better way to describe it, democratizes robotic development and AI for robotics. The joining of the two environments also brings together the two largest robotics develop communities, both focused on open-source collaboration.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.The author and members of the TIRIAS Research staff do not hold equity positions in any of the companies mentioned.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT Pro Verdict\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n+Brilliant value\n+Outstanding media performance\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n-Large footprint\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 1 of 6Nvidia\u2019s latest family of graphics cards, the RTX 3000 series, has become a hot commodity lately, and none more so than the RTX 3080. Amongst global component shortages and historic surges in demand, the 3080 has proven even more difficult to get hold of than the rest of Nvidia\u2019s lineup.There\u2019s good reason for that; occupying the comfortable middle-ground between price and performance, it offers extremely capable horsepower without the faintly staggering price of the top-end RTX 3090. It\u2019s the perfect card for high-performance workstations that still want to maintain some semblance of affordability.The specific card on test is Zotac\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 AMP Holo which, like most Nvidia partner GPUs, has been somewhat overclocked and fitted with slightly different cooling mechanisms compared to Nvidia\u2019s stock cards. While they differ aesthetically and in a handful of aftermarket features, partner cards are broadly representative of the platform\u2019s overall performance.Scan 3XS RTX Studio Pro G132R review: Silent but deadly Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: Big things in a small package Chillblast Fusion Threadripper Pro RTX 3975WX Workstation review: Big name, big specsWe should also note that we\u2019ve quoted the RRP above. For the reasons stated previously, you won\u2019t currently be able to find an RTX 3080 at that price, but we\u2019ve used it as the basis for comparisons throughout this review in the hopes that the price will return to normal levels at some point in the future.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: DesignIf you\u2019ve seen Zotac\u2019s RTX 3070 Holo, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the 3080 essentially looks like a scaled-up version. It\u2019s got three fans instead of two, and it\u2019s larger overall, measuring 60mm thick and 318mm long. That\u2019s compared to the 291mm length of Zotac\u2019s 3070, so it\u2019ll require an even larger chassis than that already-chunky card. They do, however, both take up two and a half PCIe expansion slots.The visual design is largely the same too, with a vaguely iridescent purple and turquoise casing that only just tips over the line into tackiness. The various RGB lighting elements can, thankfully, be turned off via Zotac\u2019s Firestorm control software. You can also tweak the cooling from this console, which in addition to the aforementioned fans, is handled with copper heat pipes and aluminium fin-stack heatsinks. You\u2019ll need a 750W PSU to run this beast, and it\u2019s connected by two eight-pin connectors, with a maximum power consumption of 340W.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: Specs and performanceLooking at the specifications, it\u2019s not hard to see where all that power\u2019s going. This PCIe 4 GPU features 8,704 CUDA cores and 10GB of GDDR6X RAM, not to mention a 1,770MHz maximum boost clock. That\u2019s a significant step up from the 3070 in terms of graphics memory and cores, although interestingly, the boost clock is actually slightly slower.RELATED RESOURCEIT Pro 20/20: The end of the remote work dreamIssue 20 of IT Pro 20/20 examines whether a new industry policy to pay workers based on location is likely to catch onFREE DOWNLOADHappily though, this doesn\u2019t impact performance, and the 3080 is as much of a stormer as you\u2019d expect. We tested the 3080 on our Chillblast-supplied test rig with 32GB of RAM and an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X processor. In the LuxMark 3.1 OpenCL GPU rendering test, it scored a meaty 16,093 points - roughly 25% better than the 3070 - and it achieved similar gains in the Octanebench 2020 test, with a total score of 565.Moving on to SPECviewPerf\u2019s enterprise workload tests, the 3080 put in a confident showing, with strong results in both the 3dsmax-07 and maya-06 tests. Its results of 157 and 493 respectively indicate extremely capable rendering and 3D modelling performance, with a roughly 15 to 20% jump over the next model down in the range. A 344 score in the solidworks-05 test, meanwhile, represents a notable 20% increase over the 3070. It was also less than 10% behind the 3090 in the Maya test, although the gap was more pronounced with 3DSMax.However, while modelling and content creation is a strength, lacklustre scores of less than 100 in the energy, medical and Siemens NX portions of the benchmark demonstrate that scientific and engineering workloads are as much of a stumbling-block for this card as they are for the rest of Nvidia\u2019s non-professional lineup. You\u2019ll need a Quadro card for those, although as ever, media and content creation professionals will be fabulously well-served by this model.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: Ports and featuresYou can expect the 3080 to share the same core set of features as the rest of its stablemates; it supports OpenGL 4.6, a 7,680 x 4,320 maximum resolution on up to four displays, improved tensor and ray tracing cores, and DLSS framerate-boosting technology.There\u2019s no SLI capability which means no multi-GPU configurations, and USB-C ports are out, but you do get a trio of DisplayPort 1.4a ports and a single HDMI 2.1 port, which should be plenty for connecting all the monitors you need for the average workstation.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: VerdictNvidia\u2019s upper-midrange RTX 3080 has proven to be overwhelmingly popular with consumers, and looking at its price-performance ratio, it\u2019s not hard to see why. For professional media workstations, this GPU will be phenomenally powerful, and manages to crunch through the most challenging of workflows with relative ease. It\u2019s understandably not quite as powerful as the 3090, but this is more a question of future-proofing; there\u2019s little that\u2019s likely to trouble this card over the next three to five years, but the 3090 will last even longer before it needs replaced.The 3080 does come with the usual caveat that it\u2019s not suitable for high-end scientific modelling, but organisations undertaking these workloads will likely need the driver stability and ISV support offered by Nvidia\u2019s professional GPUs anyway. For content creation tasks, however, there\u2019s little that can touch this card, and it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on stock levels and prices for anyone that wants to outfit a workstation with supreme staying power.Zotac GeForce RTX 3080 AMP Holo specificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyStream processors8,704Base clock1,440MHzBoost clock1,770MHzMemory10GBConnectivityPCIe 4.0 16xDisplay outputs3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.1Max resolution7,680 x 4,320 @60HzTDP340WPower connections2x 8-pinSupported APIsMicrosoft DirectX 12 Ultimate, Vulkan RT API, OpenGL 4.6\n\n\nAdam ShepherdSocial Links NavigationAdam Shepherd has been a technology journalist since 2015, covering everything from cloud storage and security, to smartphones and servers.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorSep 15, 2021, 05:50pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.The company\u2019s Xe GPU for HPC looks pretty good, but will it be good enough to catch up to AMD and Nvidia?\nIntel has adopted a \"Domain-Specific Architecture\" strategy espoused by John L. Hennessy, Alphabet Chairman and former President of Stanford University.\u00a0Consequently, the company has at least one of everything: CPU, GPU, various ASICs, and FPGAs. While this may appear to be a strategy of throwing everything against the wall and see what sticks, it does offer some appeal in shaping the epitome of heterogeneous computing. However, this approach is capital intensive, requiring a lot of engineering, and places a significant burden on the software developer. Let\u2019s talk about one of these architectures that is a net-new addition to Intel: high performance GPUs.\n\n\nIntel recently announced details on their forthcoming data center GPU, the Xe HPC, code named Ponte Vecchio (PVC). Intel daringly implied that the peak performance of the PVC GPU would be roughly twice that of today\u2019s fastest GPU, the Nvidia A100. PVC and Sapphire Rapids (the multi-tile next-gen Xeon) are being used to build Aurora, the Argonne National Lab\u2019s Exascale supercomputer, in 2022, so this technology should finally be just around the corner.\n\nPonte Vecchio Xe HPC GPU\nIntel is betting on this first-generation datacenter GPU for HPC to finally catch up with Nvidia and AMD, both for HPC (64-bit floating point) and AI (8 and 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating point). The Xe HPC device is a multi-tiled, multi-process-node package with new GPU cores, HBM2e memory, a new Xe Link interconnect, and PCIe Gen 5 implemented with over 100-billion transistors. That is nearly twice the size of the 54-billion Nvidia A100 chip. At that size, power consumption could be an issue at high frequencies. Nonetheless, the Xe design clearly demonstrates that Intel gets it; packaging smaller dies helps reduce development and manufacturing costs, and can improve time to market.\n\nPonte Vecchio is a multi-tile, multi-process node package.Intel\nPonte Vecchio is expected to start shipping early next year to the Argonne National Laboratory for Aurora, with tens of thousands of GPUs installed to deliver at least 1.1 exaflops in the first HPC Exascale supercomputer, funded by the US DOE.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nPonte Vecchio promises a major step function in Intel HPC and AI performance.Intel\n\nInitial performance claims are quite impressive, roughly doubling Nvidia A100 performance with 45 trillion FP32 flops per second from the vector engine and 1,468 INT8 TOPS from the matrix-processing units. The monster chip is rumored to consume some 600 watts, which puts it into rare air indeed. The slide below was shared at the Intel Architecture Day event in August. While the slide is missing an X axis, and surely reflects peak performance, this seems to reinforce the \u201ctwice A100\u201d claims. \u00a0\n\n The Xe platform includes on-die interconnect links and a switch that enables efficient scaling up to ... [+] eight GPUs.Intel\nIt will be interesting to see how Intel positions Xe HPC versus the Habana Labs Gaudi. A likely bifurcation would be to focus Ponte Vecchio in HPC supercomputing, and Gaudi as a scalable training platform for Cloud Service Providers. A lot will depend on Intel\u2019s ability to get software teams lined up for both.\nSoftware: OneAPI\nPerhaps more important than all the specs and competitive comparisons, Intel should be able to leverage Aurora to begin to build the credibility and community around development for the Ponte Veccio GPU, including serious use of oneAPI for AI as well as HPC. A lot has been said about Intel\u2019s ambitious goal to provide a single abstraction to high performance computing and AI, and the company has not given up on this noble but difficult goal. In the recent briefings, the company reiterated its intentions, and provide some pretty compelling evidence that oneAPI is getting market traction.\u00a0We remain concerned that Habana is not yet supporting the software, but putting this into perspective, it is not and should not be the priority at this point.Intel says over 80 HPC and AI applications now support oneAPI on early Ponte Vecchio chips. Thats ... [+] impressive, but keep in mind that NVIDIA supports many hundreds on CUDA.Intel\nConclusions\nI am very impressed with what Intel has accomplished on the GPU front. However, Ponte Vecchio will be an alternative to AMD and Nvidia only if the platform has reasonable power consumption, and is complemented with the software that can assure ease of use and optimization. The latter point is critical; performance matters a lot, and Intel will need to make it simple and effective to optimize code and models to produce the claimed performance level.\nIn my mind, there is no doubt that Ponte Vecchio has a good shot to become the poster child for the New Intel under Pat Gelsinger\u2019s leadership.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It's as if the Silicon Gods got angry at mere mortals for holding too much hope that things will go well sooner than expected.Now, the 18% price jump in China could very well herald another increase in street pricing because more cryptocurrency miners are going to be encouraged to mine Ethereum yet again. Analysts have discovered that overall profitability from mining has almost doubled since early August.VideoCardz compiled a list of the price increases for major NVIDIA RTX 3000 cards from ASUS and Gigabyte, and they're not looking good:ASUSRTX 3070 Ti: + $92 (600 Yuan)RTX 3080, 3070: +$46-$62 (300-400 Yuan)RTX 3060 Ti, 3060: +$31-$54 (200-350 Yuan)GigabyteRTX 3090, 3080 Ti: +$31-$62 (200-400 Yuan)RTX 3070 Ti, 3070: +$15-$46 (100-300 Yuan)RTX 3060 Ti, 3060: +$46 (300 Yuan)Heck, even the RTX 2060, GTX 1660, GTX 1650, and the lowly GTX 1050 Ti have experienced price increases ranging from at least $12 to as much as $54, which is crazy since 1660, 1650, and the 1050 Ti aren't even good cards for mining cryptocurrency.Read also:\nNVIDIA RTX 4000 GPUs Already Finalized for Possible 2022 LaunchNVIDIA Cards Also Getting More Expensive in EuropeBut apparently, it's not just China who's experiencing a return to the GPUpocalypse. According to data compiled by the German site 3DCenter, NVIDIA cards have broken their price decline trend and are now going back up again, alongside AMD RX 6000 series cards:Graphics Card Prices in \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9 Aug 29, 2021\ud83d\udc49 Availability is still good, but lose a step.\ud83d\udc49 AMD prices slightly up (again).\ud83d\udc49 nVidia breaks its trend, prices now going up as well.https://t.co/CFEsLahDYW pic.twitter.com/cLSwn6f80v\u2014 3DCenter.org (@3DCenter_org) August 30, 2021\nThis is a big blow to people who have been hoping to get an NVIDIA RTX 3000 series GPU for so long. Notably, the past few months have been a little bit positive in terms of graphics card prices. NVIDIA cards are among those who have experienced the most price drops compared to AMD ones, especially in Europe, where they dropped from a high of 304% markups to as low as 144%.What Is Happening?A few interesting tidbits can actually be derived from these numbers. Case in point: the data presented by 3D Center. According to them, prices seem to climb despite supply actually remaining good (although it took a minor hit). This could mean that demand might not outweigh supply just yet, though it's only a matter of time.As for China, supplies for AMD cards appear to remain steady, while NVIDIA seems to have the most trouble keeping up with demand. Furthermore, RTX 2060 and GTX 1660 Super deliveries are becoming rarer. But perhaps one can attribute this to things such as temporary closures of graphics card assembly lines due to new coronavirus case surges caused by the Delta variant. This has already forcibly closed a port after an infection was detected.Related:\n\u00a0NVIDIA LHR GPUs Just Got Their Mining Limiters CrackedThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by RJ Pierce  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Inclusion on the list is neither confirmation nor an announcement of any game.\nNVIDIA took immediate action to remove access to the list. No confidential game builds or personal information were exposed.\n\nAs we suspected, most of the games listed there probably were only used on GeForce NOW for internal testing and may never see the light of day on PC. Still, we maintain that some eventually will, such as God of War, other PlayStation exclusives (Final Fantasy VII Remake, Death Stranding Director's Cut, Demon's Souls, Returnal, Ghost of Tsushima), the rumored GTA remasters, as well as the most obvious ones like Dragon Age 4, Gears 6, Forza Motorsport 8, Avowed, Crysis 4, and Payday 3. The RTX remasters may also turn out to be true, given that two years ago NVIDIA kicked off a program to do just that.\nFor the record, we've included the highlights of the GeForce NOW leaked list below.\n\n\nAlan Wake Remastered\u00a0(Steam)\n\n\nAvowed\n\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight RTX Remaster\n\n\nBatman Citybuilder\n\n\nBayonetta 3\n\n\nBioshock 2022\n\n\nBioShock RTX Remaster\n\n\nChrono Cross Remaster\n\n\nCrysis 4\n\n\nDeath Stranding Director's Cut\n\n\nDemon's Souls\n\n\nDragon Age 4\n\n\nDragon's Dogma 2\n\n\nEarth Defense Force 6\n\n\nFable 4\n\n\nFight for Middle-Earth\n\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE\n\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI\n\n\nForza Motorsport 8\n\n\nGears 6\n\n\nGhost of Tsushima\n\n\nGoat Simulator 2\n\n\nGod of War\n\n\nGran Turismo 7\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto 3 - Remastered\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City - Remastered\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Remastered\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\n\n\nHalf-Life 2 Remastered\n\n\nHalo 5: Guardians\n\n\nHangar 13 unannounced game\n\n\nHelldivers 2\n\n\nHomefront CTP\n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West\n\n\nHuman: Fall Flat 2\n\n\nIndiana Jones\n\n\nInjustice 3: Gods Will Fall\n\n\nJudgment\n\n\nKingdom Hearts IV\n\n\nMarvel Ultimate Alliance 3\n\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID 2 SONS OF LIBERTY HD\n\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER HD\n\n\nMetro Next\n\n\nMirror's Edge RTX Remaster\n\n\nMonster Hunter 6\n\n\nMyst Remaster\n\n\nNew strategy game\u00a0(Square Enix)\n\n\nPayday 3\n\n\nProject FPS\u00a0(Paradox Interactive)\n\n\nRatchet & Clank\n\n\nResident Evil 4 Remake\n\n\nReturnal\n\n\nSackboy: A Big Adventure\n\n\nSniper Elite 5\n\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R Android\n\n\nSystem Shock 3\n\n\nTekken 8\n\n\nTest Drive Unlimited 3\n\n\nTimesplitters 2 (Remastered)\n\n\nThe Talos Principle 2\n\n\nTomb Raider 25th Anniversary (2021)\n\n\nTotal War 9\n\n\nTropico Next\n\n\nUnannounced Dungeon Tactics Game\n\n\nUnannounced title by Square Enix\n\n\nUnannounced Card Game 2\n\n\nUntitled iNxile Game\n\n\nUntitled Marvel Game 2020 & Walking Dead Game\u00a0(Daybreak)\n\n\nUntitled Respawn Game\n\n\nUntitled The Initiative Game\n\n\nVanquish RE-MASTER\n\n\nWreckfest sequel\n\n\nWorms Next\n\n\nXCOM 3\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Breaks 2,000 Games Milestone, Will Support Black Myth: Wukong at Launch\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Has Been Integrated in Xbox Game Pages; Premium Memberships Are Discounted, and There\u2019s New Games, Too\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Streaming Seems to Be Available Directly on Xbox Game Pass for Certain Games\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Adds Granblue Fantasy: Relink, Day Passes, and Cloud G-SYNC + NVIDIA Reflex Support for 60/120 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of Grand Theft Auto VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n28\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n27\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Scroll down to the AU section below to find out more.When you want a computer with a ton of graphics muscle, you want the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. This graphics card has a stunning amount of power thanks to its combination of ample CUDA cores combined with plenty of Tensor and RT cores. It\u2019s enough to drive games at 4K without suffering from abysmal framerates.Until recently, it was incredibly difficult to find an RTX 3080 to buy without an astronomical mark-up. Thankfully, Even we're now starting to see a return to something resembling normalcy as 3080 stock becomes more readily available. We see options available from Newegg in the US, Scan and Ebuyer in the UK, and Mwave in Australia, and their prices aren't too bad, either.\u00a0Of course, you always had the option of purchasing a pre-built gaming PC, which was a cost-effective alternative to buying the card alone. That said, we think it's now possible to buy an RTX 3080 card at a decent price, meaning you no longer have to resort to that option.Check out our Nvidia RTX 3080 stock tracker to get live Twitter updatesHere's where to buy Nvidia RTX 3070\u00a0Nvidia RTX 3080 stock: try these retailersUS RTX 3080 retailers: Nvidia | Best Buy | Amazon | Micro Center | Adorama | B&H | NeweggUK RTX 3080 retailers: Nvidia | Scan | EbuyerAU RTX 3080 retailers: Scorptec | Mwave | Amazon | Landmark Computers | Kogan | Dick Smith | Computer AllianceIf you want to try your luck at the more powerful card, we show you where to buy the RTX 3090 as well - but it looks like stock is just as scarce with that GPU as well at the moment.The latest Nvidia RTX 3080 deals available nowWe'll list all the latest Nvidia RTX 3080 stock below as soon as it's available.

Today we\u2019re pitting the first two \u201csweet spot\u201d 1080p graphics cards from this generation in an epic head-to-head showdown: Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 versus the AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT.\nMainstream options like these have historically been priced competitively to garner the attention of as many gamers as possible. With recent MSRP and street pricing raging out of control, are they still attractive choices? Which is the best graphics card for you: The RTX 3060 or the Radeon RX 6600 XT? Let\u2019s look at their pricing, performance, and more to answer those questions.\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nRTX 3060 vs RX 6600 XT price\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$299.99 at  Newegg  | \n$469.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6600 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have to start with the biggest question. The $329 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 and $379 AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT really put an emphasis on the suggested part of the manufacturer\u2019s retail pricing. Due to the still-humming-along crypto mining boom, together with high gamer demand and ongoing logistics problems stemming from the pandemic, this is a one-two punch that can deliver a surprising knockout your wallet at checkout.\nHow much can you expect to pay? If you\u2019re lucky enough to snag them in a proper store selling at MSRP, the RTX 3060 will typically range from $399 to as high as $529. Find yourself having to jump on eBay to secure one? You\u2019ll quickly be in the $650 to $750 range depending on model.\n\n\n\nThings aren\u2019t looking much better over on the AMD 6600 XT side. The base $379 MSRP quickly turns into $450 to $490 at a store. Hop on eBay, you\u2019ll be paying as much as $660.\nWhat\u2019s going on with prices above? You may have guessed it \u2013 the RTX 3060 is popular for both gamers and crypto miners. Its hashing performance was nerfed at released, but that was quickly bypassed by enterprising miners. The 6600 XT has also been found to be efficient at mining, but with lower profit returns.\nRTX 3060 vs. RX 6600 XT performance\nThese brawlers are squarely aimed at 1080p gamers. They also hope to catch a few 1440p afficionados in the mix, too. Let\u2019s compare some of their stats in the ring. For a much deeper dive into how these graphics cards handle, check out our reviews of the RTX 3060 and 6600 XT.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRound 1: Brute force. We\u2019re talking high FPS and maxed out graphics. No fancy tricks or DLSS. In Watch Dogs: Legion, the Radeon RX 6600 XT outperforms the GeForce RTX 3060 in both 1080p and 1440p. This is generally representative in most popular games, especially ones built on the newer DirectX 12 and Vulkan APIs. The Radeon RX 6600 XT is faster than the RTX 3060 for general gaming.\n\nBut what if we add ray tracing?\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRound 2: Bring out the special effects! In Metro Exodus, with ray tracing on and Hairworks off, the tides turn in the favor of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060. DLSS is also a great Nvidia-only advantage over AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution offering currently, with support in many more titles due to its two-year head start.\nRTX 3060 vs RX 6600 XT power and other factors\nPrice and performance aren\u2019t the only factors you might want to consider.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nAll Radeon RX 6600 XT models consume similar amounts of energy, and notably less than the RTX 3060. Note that this graph measures the entire power draw of our locked test system, and not the GPU alone.\n\n\nThe Radeon RX 6600 XT is more power efficient than Nvidia\u2019s GPU\u2014in a stunning turn from the last few GPU generations\u2014but individual models can have higher temperatures depending on the cooler design. Even power-hungry GPUs can be kept cool if you throw enough metal at them.\n\nThere\u2019s also the difference in memory capacity. Does the Radeon RX 6600 XT\u2019s 8GB of VRAM matter vs the RTX 3060\u2019s 12GB? As a practical matter, no, as the Radeon RX 6600 XT\u2019s average 1080p gaming performance is better (and often far better). If you want to play on a 1440p monitor, the 6600 XT\u2019s 8GB buffer should still be fine, especially since you may need to dial some graphics options down at the higher resolution. These cards really target 1080p gaming though.\nNvidia also offers some video-friendly features that make their GPUs much more appealing to content creators, such as Nvidia Broadcast and NVENC encoding. If you need them, you need them.\nAnd the winner is\u2026\nIt\u2019s hard to fully recommend either of these 1080p-centric graphics cards in 2021 given their high prices. But if you don\u2019t mind spending up and your main purpose is high refresh rate 1080p gaming, you\u2019ll likely want the Radeon RX 6600 XT\u2014especially since it may be slightly easier to find one, too, and for a lower price.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat cooler, dual-BIOS switch\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nSpeedster Merc 308 Radeon RX 6600 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$420 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSoftware makes it faster\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nPulse Radeon RX 6600 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$399 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve reviewed a trio of Radeon RX 6600 XT variants if you want to dig more deeply into individual models: The Asus ROG Strix, the XFX Speedster Merc 308, and the Sapphire Pulse. XFX\u2019s offering is a great pick for enthusiasts who demand their graphics cards run in cool silence, while the Pulse is also whisper-quiet, with a more value-oriented design that ramps up frame rates with the help of Sapphire\u2019s exceptional Trixx Boost software. Asus\u2019s ROG offers the best cooling of all\u2014by far\u2014but that\u2019s balanced out by higher noise levels than the other cards and a significantly higher $550 MSRP.\n\nPeople who want peak ray tracing performance, plus Nvidia software goodies like DLSS, Nvidia Reflex, and NVENC encoding, should steer towards the GeForce RTX 3060. We\u2019ve reviewed EVGA\u2019s entry-level Black XC Gaming model.\nBut as (if?) GPU prices eventually come down to normal, you may even want to skip both the 6600 XT and the RTX 3060 to opt for the spectacular GeForce RTX 3060 Ti instead, especially if you\u2019re interested in 1440p gaming. It\u2019s a very attractive mining card as well, however, so prices for it are through the roof.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Bethesda)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has a fresh trick up its sleeve in the form of DLAA, which as you might guess from the acronym is a sibling tech of DLSS, and it\u2019s being tested with the Elder Scrolls Online MMO.DLAA stands for Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (in the same way that DLSS means Deep Learning Super Sampling), and it employs the exact same machine learning tech to hone and provide an impressive form of anti-aliasing (smoothing over a game\u2019s visuals).AMD vs Nvidia: which should be your next graphics card?We'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCThe Elder Scrolls 6 trailer, news and rumorsAs PC Gamer spotted, Rich Lambert, Creative Director at ZeniMax Online Studios, enthused that: \u201cYou won\u2019t get a performance boost out of this, but what you will get is absolutely incredible anti-aliasing.\u201d\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia releases stats that prove DLSS and Frame Generation are here to stay - sorry, angry gamers\n\n\n\n\nI saw Nvidia's new DLSS 4 in action on the RTX 5090 and it's a true game changer \u2013 here's why\n\n\n\nWhen can you experience these (hopefully) improved visuals in Elder Scrolls Online? Well, as you may have seen, Nvidia released a new graphics driver today, and along with a whole load of extra games rocking DLSS and some important additions for titles supported by Windows 11 including Deathloop, the driver adds DLAA and it\u2019s being enabled on the Elder Scrolls Online test server as of today.Elder Scrolls Online testers should note that aside from the new Nvidia GPU driver, they\u2019ll need to be running an RTX 2000 or RTX 3000 series graphics card to get DLAA. The feature debuts with Update 32 for the MMO, which also arrives today, and you\u2019ll find the DLAA option alongside DLSS as you might expect.Analysis: Seriously smooth anti-aliasing, with any luckLet\u2019s take a deeper dive into exactly what DLAA actually is. As Alex Tardif, lead graphics engineer at ZeniMax Online Studios, explains in a tweet, it\u2019s basically using Nvidia\u2019s deep learning tech, but ditching the upscaling component. Streamlining it, if you like, and doing nothing involving upscaling the resolution, but just using AI to remove jaggies and generally get smoother edges with a game\u2019s graphics (otherwise known as anti-aliasing).In short, nothing happens with any resolution trickery, this just applies an effective form of anti-aliasing at the current resolution; and apparently this pure anti-aliasing option works very well.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If this proves to be as slick an implementation of anti-aliasing as promised, it really could make a big difference to how clean and realistic games look, while minimizing any performance hit.As it\u2019s still in testing, we should temper expectations for now \u2013 it\u2019s obviously not clear how the results of DLAA might pan out, particularly in any initial incarnation. But this is certainly a potentially very exciting development, and hopefully something that comes to other games which already support DLSS in short order, perhaps.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for you\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

The leaker is well known and has been accurate on several leaks in the past, in fact even SKUs that didn't make it in the retail segment did end up showing in one form or another.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 SUPER Desktop Graphics Card Lineup Gets Alleged Specs - Includes RTX 3090 SUPER, RTX 3080 SUPER, RTX 3070 SUPER, And RTX 3060 SUPER\nThe thing about these specifications is that NVIDIA is always testing various configurations for new SKUs. Sometimes, these SKUs see the light of day while sometimes, certain SKUs are replaced by different ones. It all depends on GPU production, supply, and yields. With the GeForce RTX 30 GPU lineup, we saw several Ampere SKUs that were planned out but never made it in retail.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nLet's make a summary. 3090S 10752 24GB G6X3080S 8960 12GB G6X3070S 5888 8G G6X3060S 5632 12G G6Although I doubt the specs of some of them and the name of 90S. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) September 22, 2021\n\nThis doesn't mean that the previously reported SKUs were fake, they were very real but they were never utilized for a proper release and were forgotten. NVIDIA shares plans with their AIB partners of such SKUs and even shares board & certain qualification chip supplies with them. That's how the 20 GB 3080 Ti, which was never meant to be, ended up in some Russian retail outlet. So remember that these are possible SKU configurations that we might see in the upcoming RTX 30 SUPER lineup but not 'Confirmed' ones yet. NVIDIA even ended up changing specs weeks prior to launch for few cards so these might change as we get closer to launch too.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER 'Alleged' Specifications\nFirst up, we have the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER and this is expected to be a Titan-class card once again. Kopite says that he doesn't think NVIDIA will use the 3090 SUPER naming convention & go with something else considering that this is one of their top-tier product. As for the specs, 3090 SUPER is expected to rock the full GA102 GPU core with 10752 cores and 24 GB GDDR6X memory. The memory will be faster-clocked thanks to improved dies from Micron, pushing speeds past 20 Gbps. The pricing may be kept the same at $1499 US (MSRP) but overall, we are looking at a minor 5% improvement.\nA previous rumor also stated that the GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER\u00a0 graphics card will feature a TGP of over 400W. That's 50W more than the existing 3090 which means that we could be looking at faster clocks on GPU and VRAM.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER 'Alleged' Specifications\nFor the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER, NVIDIA is expected to use 70 SMs for a total of 8960 CUDA cores. Now there are rumors of a GA103 GPU been going around for a while now & the RTX 3080 SUPER may end up using that but we can't say for sure. The card will rock a 12 GB GDDR6X memory along with a 384-bit bus interface and will also feature faster-clocked DRAM modules.\n\nThe card seems to be positioned between the RTX 3080 and the RTX 3080 Ti with a 3% core count increase over the Non-Ti variant. It will be nice to have 2 extra gigs of memory over the 10 GB of the Non-Ti variant, especially if it's priced at $699 US (MSRP). In terms of performance, the card will be slightly below the 3080 Ti (say around 95% of the performance). If true, the RTX 3080 Ti would make very little sense to purchase since the 3080 SUPER will offer similar performance for $500 US less. The card will be positioned against the AMD Radeon RX 6800 as that's the main opponent in this segment.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER 'Alleged' Specifications\nMoving over to the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER, this is going to be a slightly less interesting part as NVIDIA only plans to update the card to the faster GDDR6X memory while retaining the core specs such as 5888 CUDA cores. Again, this would push the card little in terms of performance but it may end up getting close to its Ti counterpart, the 3070 Ti, for a lower price point.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 SUPER 'Alleged' Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 SUPER might be the biggest upgrade in the SUPER lineup. Same was the case with the RTX 2060 SUPER which saw a much-needed core and memory bump. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 SUPER is expected to offer specifications better than the RTX 3060 Ti with 5632 CUDA Cores in 44 SM units and 12 GB of GDDR6 memory. So you are getting 4 GB more memory over the RTX 3060 Ti along with 16% more CUDA cores which could lead to performance right on par with a GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card.\n\nNVIDIA may retain the same price too at $399 US as that would be highly competitive against AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT and RX 6600 XT graphics cards which cost $479 & $379 US, respectively. Once again, these are the specifications we have got so far from a reliable leaker but based on the previous leaks, these might change too. The RTX 30 SUPER lineup is expected to be introduced by the end of this year or early Q1 (most probably during CES 2022).\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 SUPER Graphics Card Specifications (Alleged):\n\n\n\nGraphics CardGPU NameSM / CoresMemory CapacityMemory BusTGPPrice (MSRP)\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti?GA102-350?84 / 1075224 GB GDDR6X384-bit~400W$1499 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090GA102-30082 / 1049624 GB GDDR6X384-bit350W$1499 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TIGA102-22580 / 1024012 GB GDDR6X384-bit350W$1199 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER?GA102-22070 / 896012 GB GDDR6X384-bit~320W$699 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080GA102-20068 / 870410 GB GDDR6X320-bit320W$699 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiGA104-40048 / 614416 GB GDDR6X256-bit~290W$599 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiGA104-40048 / 61448 GB GDDR6X256-bit290W$599 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070GA104-30046 / 58888 GB GDDR6256-bit220W$499 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 SUPERGA104?44 / 563212 GB GDDR6X192-bit~200W$399 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiGA104-20038 / 48648 GB GDDR6256-bit200W$399 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060GA106-30028 / 358412 GB GDDR6X192-bit170W$329 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiGA106-250/200?24 / 3072?8 GB GDDR6128-bit~120W$259 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050GA106-15020 / 2560?8 GB GDDR6128-bit~100W$209 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050GA106-14018 / 2304?4 GB GDDR6128-bit~90W$179 US?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n87\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n16\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n16\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n14\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1528\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

See our ethics statement.Tom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia is updating its Broadcast app to improve noise removal, support more cameras, and reduce the amount of VRAM used by the app. Nvidia Broadcast is primarily used by streamers and content creators to filter out background noise from a microphone, or blur a backdrop for a webcam. Nvidia is focusing on improving these main use cases with version 1.3 today.While Nvidia Broadcast has become a popular choice for streamers, the app would sometimes filter out high-pitched voices when someone was speaking excitedly. \u201cThe new update addresses this with dedicated training sound profiles to retain that speech while removing the unwanted background noise,\u201d says Nvidia. That should mean any screaming or shock moments on stream will no longer be inadvertently removed.Nvidia\u2019s Broadcast app filters out background noise and more. Image: NvidiaNvidia is also updating Broadcast to support a range of camera apps, including Canon EOS Webcam Utility, Nikon Webcam Utility, Sony Webcam Utility, and OBS Virtual Camera. This will make it a lot easier for streamers and broadcasters to tweak their camera image, while also adding a background blur or other effects.Nvidia\u2019s last 1.2 update to Broadcast added stacking for effects, but if you used a number of them across a microphone, speakers, and camera at the same time then performance and frame rates during gaming took a hit. This latest 1.3 update dramatically reduces VRAM usage by more than 40 percent, which will greatly improve performance while gaming.We\u2019ve run into a number of bugs and issues with Nvidia Broadcast in the past, but Nvidia says it has several new UI elements and bug fixes \u201cthat round out a better, smoother, Nvidia Broadcast experience.\u201d You can download Nvidia\u2019s latest 1.3 Broadcast update over at the company\u2019s website.See More: CreatorsEntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

An A100 GPU equipped server with an ARM and x86 CPU were found to have very similar performance (although x86 still had higher peak performance).\nThe eternal problem is of course the fact that while ARM beats the socks off of x86 in low power/high-efficiency scenarios (think smartphones), it is not able to scale that power efficiency to high clocks. Leakage is in fact one of the reasons why Apple's new A15 chips have been a relative disappointment so far. Servers being the absolute edge of high-performance compute then are an area where x86 has typically reigned supreme, although NVIDIA would love to change the narrative as far as that goes. We see that ARM-based A100 server actually managed to beat x86 in the niche 3d-Unet workload while more common ones like ResNet 50 remain x86 dominated.\n\u201cArm, as a founding member of MLCommons, is committed to the process of creating standards and benchmarks to better address challenges and inspire innovation in the accelerated computing industry,\u201d said David Lecomber, a senior director of HPC and tools at Arm.\n\u201cThe latest inference results demonstrate the readiness of Arm-based systems powered by Arm-based CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs for tackling a broad array of AI workloads in the data center,\u201d he added.\nOf course, when you are talking inference, GPUs remain the king. NVIDIA did not hold back any punches when it pointed out that an A100 GPU is a 104x faster than a CPU in MLPERF benchmarks.\nInference is what happens when a computer runs AI software to recognize an object or make a prediction. It\u2019s a process that uses a deep learning model to filter data, finding results no human could capture.\nMLPerf\u2019s inference benchmarks are based on today\u2019s most popular AI workloads and scenarios, covering computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and more.\n\nEverything from the popular Image Classification ResNet-50 benchmark to Natual Language Processing was tested and the A100 GPU reigned supreme in everything. With NVIDIA facing final regulatory hurdles in their acquisition of ARM, we are going to start to see Jensen push for ARM domination in the server space and the surrounding ecosystem spring into space. While it won't happen overnight, the first real threat to x86 as the premier compute architecture, might well be underway.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nIntel AI Chip Breakthrough To Compete With NVIDIA Unlikely Before 2027 \u2013 Report\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s A20 Arriving To The iPhone 18 Lineup Will Reportedly Stick With TSMC\u2019s 3nm \u2018N3P\u2019 Process, But It Could Differentiate Itself By Using A More Advanced Packaging\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1147\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
