AMD shares lagged the market in the earlier part of the year before stepping on the gas in the past few months. Does this make Nvidia a better growth stock going into the New Year? Or will AMD turn the tables and outperform its bigger rival?\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia announced its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results on Nov. 17, which made it clear that it is on track to close the year on a high. The company is set to end the fiscal year with $26.7 billion in revenue, which would be an increase of 60% over the prior year. Its earnings are expected\u00a0to jump to $4.34 per share from $2.50 per share in fiscal 2021.\nHowever, analysts estimate that Nvidia's growth rate will taper off in fiscal 2023, which starts in February 2022. The company's earnings are expected to increase to $5.20 per share in fiscal 2023, which would be an increase of nearly 20% from this year's estimate. But Nvidia could clock a faster pace of growth since its two biggest businesses are firing on all cylinders, and they are expected to keep getting better in 2022 and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nThe discrete graphics card market, for instance, is expected\u00a0to grow from $23.6 billion in 2020 to $54 billion in 2025, according to Jon Peddie Research. Nvidia is in a terrific position to take advantage of this massive growth, since it commands\u00a083% of the discrete graphics card market. Meanwhile, the company's 80% share in the market for data center-focused graphics cards will be another notable catalyst, since this is another fast-growing niche, clocking 42% annual growth and expected to hit $20 billion revenue by 2027.\nThe gaming and data center markets together produced nearly 87% of Nvidia's revenue last quarter. As both these markets have a lot of room for growth, they should help Nvidia outpace Wall Street's expectations and deliver stronger growth. That could help Nvidia stock maintain its outstanding momentum and fly higher in 2022.\nThe case for AMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices is on track to finish 2021 with revenue growth of 65% over last year, according to the guidance issued by the company in October. That would translate into stronger growth compared to Nvidia. AMD's earnings are expected to more than double in 2021 to $2.63 per share, as compared to $1.29 per share in 2020.\nAnalysts expect AMD to maintain its outstanding pace of earnings growth in 2022 as well, estimating that its earnings could jump close to 27% next year to $3.34 per share on a 19% jump in the revenue. So AMD's pace of growth is also expected to taper off next year, as in the case of Nvidia -- but it is expected to deliver faster bottom-line growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, just like Nvidia, AMD has a lot going for it that could help it crush Wall Street's expectations, as it has done in the past four quarters. The gaming console market, for instance, is expected to grow at a faster pace in 2022. That should give AMD a nice shot in the arm, as it is supplying semi-custom chips\u00a0to both Microsoft and Sony for their consoles.\nSales of Sony's PlayStation 5 console could hit 33.5 million units next year as per third-party estimates, up significantly from this year's estimate of 17.9 million units. This, however, is just one of the many catalysts for AMD stock. The company's share\u00a0of the server-processor market is expected to more than double in 2022 to 25% from an estimated 10% to 11% in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe server CPU market is expected to generate $19 billion in revenue by 2023, and cornering a quarter of this space could substantially boost AMD's total revenue. So AMD also has notable catalysts like Nvidia that could help it remain a growth stock in 2022 and beyond. This makes choosing one of the two a difficult proposition -- but there is a tiebreaker that could help investors decide which of these chipmakers may be worth buying.\nThe verdict\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see both Nvidia and AMD deliver impressive gains to investors once again next year. However, AMD is way cheaper than Nvidia, which is why investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios may consider buying the former.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD trades at 45 times trailing earnings, compared to Nvidia's multiple of nearly 91. AMD's sales multiple of 12 is also way cheaper than Nvidia's multiple of 30. So investors looking for a more affordable growth stock can go for AMD, since it is clocking really impressive growth and trades at substantially lower multiples when compared to its bigger rival.\n\n\n\nTeresa Kersten, an employee of LinkedIn, a Microsoft subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.\u00a0Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\u00a0The Motley Fool owns and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

Under the name RandomDesign, he has specialized in case mods and prop making since 2014. For him case modding has become more than a hobby, it\u2019s his passion and way of bringing something fantastic to everyday life.\nFor this project, Stefan was paired up with Digital Storm. Together they wanted to create a PC that looked lived-in and had experience in the Matrix universe, as if Morpheus\u2019 crew themselves found an abandoned Digital Storm Aventum and modified it with everything needed to broadcast into the Matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Specs\n\n\nChassis\nDigital Storm Aventum X\n\n\nGPU\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\nCPU\nRyzen 9 5950X\n\n\nMotherboard\nROG Maximus Crosshair VIII Formula\n\n\nRAM\n32GB DDR4 HyperX Fury RGB\n\n\nStorage\n1TB m.2\n\n\nPSU\n1200W 80 Plus Gold\n\n\nCooling\nEKWB Custom Liquid Cooling\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNZXT Nebuchadnezzar\nDave Cathey or Insolent Gnome has been tearing cases apart since 2014 and has several modding contest podium finishes under his belt. By day, he runs a fiberglass repair business in the Midwest and he's been using that knowledge to combine old school modding techniques and new composites into unique builds.\nPartnering with NZXT, together they designed an H710i inspired by the Nebuchadnezzar. On the outside, several Sentinel arms wrap around the case offering the user their own choice between the red or blue pill, while multiple nods to franchise on display inside- from the mysterious white rabbit that starts Neo\u2019s journey adorned on the Kraken\u2019s display to the mirrored cable bar representative of the reflective ripple effect after taking the red pill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Specs\n\n\nChassis\nNZXT 710i\n\n\nGPU\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\nCPU\nAMD 5800X\n\n\nMotherboard\nNZXT N7 B550\n\n\nRAM\n32GB (2x16) DDR4 TEAM T-Force\n\n\nStorage\nWD 1TB m.2\n\n\nPSU\nNZXT C850\n\n\nCooling\nNZXT Z73 Kraken AIO\n\n\nFans\nNZXT AER LED Fans\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Breacher\nStaszek \"Tips\" Wiertelak is a professional modder who has been working with GeForce Garage since 2015.\nTips\u2019 creation for this project is a broadcast station jury-rigged to emit a pirate signal that impersonates a hacked sentinel.

The ET5 is a software-defined vehicle with a unified compute architecture built on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, delivering continuous customer value and opening up new business models.\nThis combination of high-performance compute and software-defined, intelligent capabilities enhances supply chain management and redefines the customer experience.\nThe ET5 is built on the NIO Adam supercomputer, with four NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip (SoC) at its core.\nIn addition to centralized compute, the ET5 incorporates high-performance sensors into its sleek design, equipping it with the hardware necessary for advanced AI-assisted driving features.\nThe sedan also embodies the NIO concept of vehicles serving as a second living room, with a luxurious interior and immersive augmented reality digital cockpit.\nThese cutting-edge features are built to go the distance. The ET5 achieves more than 620 miles of range with the 150 kWh Ultralong Range Battery and a lightning-fast acceleration from zero to 60 mph in about four seconds.\nA Truly Intelligent Creation\nThe ET5 and its older sibling, the ET7 full-size sedan, rely on a centralized, high-performance compute architecture to power AI features and continuously receive upgrades over the air.\nThe NIO Adam supercomputer is built on four DRIVE Orin SoCs, making it one of the most powerful platforms to run in a vehicle, achieving a total of more than 1,000 TOPS of performance.\n\nOrin is the world\u2019s highest-performance, most-advanced AV and robotics processor. It delivers up to 254 TOPS to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles and robots while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nAdam integrates the redundancy and diversity necessary for safe autonomous operation by using multiple SoCs.\nThe first two SoCs process the eight gigabytes of data produced by the vehicle\u2019s sensor set every second.\nThe third Orin serves as a backup to ensure the system can operate safely in any situation.\nWhile the fourth enables local training, improving the vehicle with fleet learning and personalizing the driving experience based on user preferences.\nWith high-performance computing at its core, Adam is a major achievement in the creation of automotive intelligence and autonomous driving.\nGoing Global\nAfter beginning deliveries in Norway earlier this year, NIO will expand worldwide in 2022.\nThe ET7, the first vehicle built on the DRIVE Orin-powered Adam supercomputer, will become available in March, with the ET5 following in September.\nNext year, NIO vehicles will begin deliveries in the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.\nBy 2025, NIO vehicles will be in 25 countries and regions worldwide, bringing one of the most advanced AI platforms to even more customers.\nWith the ET5, NIO is showing no signs of slowing as it charges into the future with sleek, intelligent EVs powered by NVIDIA DRIVE.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On January 14th, the PC edition goes live, featuring enhanced graphics, exclusive PC features, and HDR. And if you play on a GeForce RTX GPU, desktop or laptop, you can enhance God of War with our AI-powered performance accelerating NVIDIA DLSS technology, and the latency-optimizing NVIDIA Reflex, which makes gameplay even more responsive.\nToday, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Santa Monica Studio have unveiled a new PC features trailer with new footage and they\u2019ve shared system requirements so you can get your system ready for God of War on PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod of War On PC, Featuring NVIDIA DLSS\nNVIDIA DLSS is our groundbreaking AI-powered tech that accelerates performance on GeForce RTX GPUs. Using dedicated GPU Tensor Cores, DLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images in your favorite games.\nTo date, NVIDIA DLSS has accelerated performance in over 140 games and apps, enabling GeForce RTX players to play with maxed out graphics and high resolutions. And when God of War launches on PC in January, you can use DLSS to boost your frame rate, allowing you to enjoy this amazing game with graphics maxed out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Makes God of War On PC More Responsive\nGod of War is a fast action game with spectacular combos that are key to overcoming the game\u2019s most difficult challenges.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\n2021 was a busy year for Nvidia, one which came with its fair share of successes and excitement; but it was also a difficult time for the company in many respects.\u00a0In this article, we\u2019re going to look at the big victories for Team Green this year \u2013 like the RTX 3080 Ti, and the strides forward taken with GeForce Now, to mention a couple \u2013 as well as the trickier aspects of 2021, like GPU stock levels and the continued notable absence of low-end Ampere graphics cards.These are the\u00a0best graphics cards\u00a0around(Image credit: Nvidia)Desktop dominance maintainedIt\u2019ll be no surprise to anyone to learn that Nvidia was the dominant force in the discrete GPU world throughout 2021. Going by figures from analyst firm Jon Peddie Research, Team Green held a market share of around 80% \u2013 sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less \u2013 throughout the year (with AMD having the remainder).\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\n\nAMD in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\nThe status quo, then, was very much maintained in this respect, although Intel still remained easily dominant with laptop GPUs (thanks to integrated graphics on the majority of laptops that don\u2019t have discrete graphics, of course). Team Blue could upset the apple cart next year with its Arc Alchemist GPUs which are expected to seriously challenge Nvidia, particularly at the budget end of the market, but we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves.Nvidia kept its big lead in desktop graphics cards this year thanks to the quality and powerful performance delivered by Ampere, both in its existing range of GPUs that came out during 2020, and one new model in particular which turned up in 2021.In total, Team Green launched three fresh Ampere offerings this year, namely the RTX 3060 which was unveiled as a lower-end option at CES in January, and the pepped-up RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti which followed in May.That RTX 3060 was admittedly a welcome fresh option at the more affordable(ish) end of the spectrum, but it represented something of a slightly shaky value proposition \u2013 particularly when you consider stock shortages and price inflation, something we\u2019ll come back to later in this article. And as we pointed out in our RTX 3060 review, its 3060 Ti sibling (launched at the end of 2020) really made more sense for not a lot more money (and still does: for any extra outlay, you\u2019re getting a good whack of extra performance).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Similarly, the RTX 3070 Ti didn\u2019t add up very well in terms of value, in fact arguably even more so than the RTX 3060. In our review we declared that it didn\u2019t provide enough extra oomph over the vanilla RTX 3070, and that the RTX 3080 offered a lot more punch for not much more money (in terms of MSRPs, that is).So, while there was some disappointment with the new desktop Ampere launches, the jewel in the crown proved to be the RTX 3080 Ti. This was basically as capable as the mighty RTX 3090 in gaming, but not as expensive (but still, of course, very pricey). It was the big winner for Nvidia\u2019s desktop GPUs in 2021, for sure, although that said, if you were hunting for a good graphics card, you\u2019d probably have taken any of the top-end products at a (relatively) decent price if you could get them (again, as mentioned, we\u2019ll come back to those availability and stock issues).(Image credit: HP)Ampere hits gaming laptops2021 also saw the release of RTX 3000 GPUs for gaming laptops, with the emergence of the RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 mobile versions (with Max-Q variants) at the start of the year in January, followed by the RTX 3050 Ti and 3050 in May.Broadly speaking, the first clutch of mobile GPUs were seen as a laudable step up in performance from last-gen Turing laptop graphics cards, so thumbs-up there. The complication with these new offerings was the variety of different power configurations within the same models of GPU, meaning that the same graphics card gave different performance levels based on thermals, cooling and so on of the notebook. Indeed, a well-cooled laptop could conceivably offer better performance than a badly-cooled one where the latter has an RTX 3000 GPU which is a tier higher.The RTX 3050 followed down the line, and was regarded as a decent stab at an affordable laptop GPU. More so than the 3050 Ti which seemed to not offer all that much more in terms of overall performance \u2013 and crucially, to be lagging behind the RTX 3060 mobile by some way (meaning it was better to push the budget a little bit further to get the 3060 if at all feasible).Overall, Nvidia made solid progress with mobile GPUs to beef up gaming laptops considerably, albeit with some models not being quite so compelling.(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS keeps up momentumDLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is Nvidia\u2019s nifty tech which uses upscaling (and AI) to reduce the demands made on your GPU, essentially boosting frame rates with not much impact on visual quality (broadly speaking).Team Green pushed forward considerably with DLSS in 2021, bringing it to loads more games, and some big-name titles at that. These included Battlefield 2042, Call of Duty: Warzone, Rainbow Six Siege, Doom Eternal, Red Dead Redemption 2, Back 4 Blood, Outriders, Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy, Diablo 2 Resurrected, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more (Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 got DLSS in early access, too).In total, at the end of 2021, Nvidia counts over 140 games (and apps) which now support DLSS (remember, it has to be baked into the game by the developer in order for it to be supported). Nvidia also made further moves to drive DLSS adoption by implementing a plug-in for Unreal Engine, and the Unity engine, so devs can easily incorporate the tech when working with these game engines.Furthermore, DLSS support for Vulkan and then DX11 plus DX12 games came to Proton, which is Valve\u2019s compatibility layer that allows Windows games to be played under Linux (and will be the driving force behind the Steam Deck). This represents a potentially sizeable boost in performance for DLSS games that might suffer with some slight headwinds due to running via said compatibility layer.On top of all that, we saw DLSS speed up the first virtual reality games, and it came to ARM-based laptops too (with ray tracing in tow). So there were a number of firsts throughout the year, as well as a hefty increase in supported games, and continued AI-powered refinement of DLSS itself (which is up to version 2.3 now).What\u2019s also very noteworthy is that in September, Nvidia revealed a new AI-powered GPU twist in the form of DLAA, which is Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing. It basically does the same thing as DLSS to provide a souped-up form of anti-aliasing (smoothing over jaggies in graphics). DLAA has only thus far been used in testing with the Elder Scrolls Online MMO, but we can expect to hear a lot more about this tech next year if it proves to be an effective way to smooth over visuals and give a more realistic overall look to games with a minimal performance hit.(Image credit: Nvidia)Not-so-blank CanvasNvidia unleashed Canvas on the world in June, a free app (in beta) which uses an RTX graphics card in a really clever way for creatives. You simply sketch and doodle rough shapes on the left side of the screen using different material brushes (like \u2018stone\u2019 or \u2018river\u2019), and on the right, the application fills in AI-generated imagery. The end result is that it\u2019s easy to swiftly create photorealistic images, and if you\u2019ve not seen this in action, it\u2019s one of the coolest things Nvidia achieved during 2021 away from gaming.Another interesting development for creatives came earlier in the year, in April, when the GeForce Experience software received the ability to quickly and conveniently optimize settings in various creative apps, including Adobe Lightroom and Illustrator. (This is in much the same vein as the optimal settings Nvidia provides for different supported games).(Image credit: ARM)ARM deal stalledLast year, Nvidia purchased ARM for $40 billion in a huge deal (both literally and figuratively), but in 2021, this big acquisition effectively stalled. Various regulators launched investigations on competition grounds (like the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority watchdog, and the EU), and there have been widespread concerns from tech giant rivals (such as Microsoft, Google and Qualcomm) that an Nvidia buyout could mean that it might become a great deal more difficult to use ARM\u2019s intellectual property.Most recently in December, in the US the FTC has filed a lawsuit to block the big deal due to it being \u2018anticompetitive\u2019, with Director of the Bureau of Competition, Holly Vedova, stating that: \u201cThis proposed deal would distort ARM\u2019s incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia\u2019s rivals.\u201dThat\u2019s the latest frustration to hit Nvidia with this acquisition, and probably the biggest stumbling block yet \u2013 all eyes are on how this case pans out. Team Green has insisted from the very beginning that it will \u201cmaintain ARM\u2019s licensing model and customer neutrality\u201d which is \u201cessential to ARM\u2019s success.\u201d(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce Now dream streamNvidia\u2019s streaming service forged ahead this year, ending 2021 with a total of over 1,100 games available to play, and bringing out a new flagship membership with some considerable benefits.To put this in perspective, that library of 1,100+ titles is up from 500 games which were present when GeForce Now officially kicked off and left beta. You may recall that a number of major publishers exited stage left post-beta, too, and there are signs that some big names might return to the fold. For example, in October we saw a handful of EA games go live for GeForce Now, and so further products may follow (previously, only Apex Legends was available to stream).It was a big year for extending coverage in terms of device support, too, as Nvidia introduced GeForce Now to LG smart TVs and Google\u2019s Chrome web browser, along with support for M1 Macs. Further improvements were made to the macOS app in December, in particular to get it to run games in the right aspect ratio for MacBooks, meaning the service can now effectively turn a MacBook into a gaming laptop.The biggest news, though, was the flagship subscription tier which began to roll out in the US in November (and December in the UK). The RTX 3080 membership delivers resolutions of up to 1440p running at up to 120 frames per second (on PC), and we recently tested it out, finding that it worked really well, running smoothly with a good level of visual detail (when we cranked the graphics settings, with no detriment to the gameplay).We were seriously impressed on the whole, although it should be noted that you have to pay a fair bit more (double) for the RTX 3080 tier (as you might expect), and that it demands a 70Mbps internet connection for 1440p at 120 fps.Cloud gaming, then, is starting to look like a genuine alternative to buying a pricey gaming PC, or indeed upgrading your ailing gaming rig with a new graphics card \u2013 seeing as buying a GPU has become such an uphill battle. A stupidly steep uphill battle at that; let\u2019s talk about this next\u2026(Image credit: ShutterStock)Stock crisis and GPU price inflationGraphics cards were scarce throughout 2021 \u2013 continuing the theme of last year \u2013 and whatever end of the spectrum you were looking at, it was a struggle to find a GPU. And if you did find one, the odds are stacked that the retailer was asking a fair chunk more than the recommended price, or maybe even twice as much (or more).Bots and scalpers reselling cards on the likes of eBay were clearly part of the problem, but the root cause was the ongoing component shortage which was a major issue last year, and will continue to be a blight on the GPU landscape next year, sadly. Nvidia simply couldn\u2019t make enough graphics cards to supply the considerable demand, and CEO Jensen Huang admitted that these production shortfalls and inventory woes are going to continue through until 2023 (although CFO Colette Kress later hinted that the situation could improve in the second half of 2022).The themes of scarce stock, scalping and inflated pricing have defined the graphics card market in 2021. Looking at 3D Center, a useful source of regularly updated GPU pricing levels based on major German retailers, asking prices are now double the recommended level.Yes, as of the latest report for December 2021, you pay twice the MSRP \u2013 double what you should \u2013 for a current-gen Nvidia graphics card (well, any Ampere model save the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti, newer cards which the report doesn\u2019t include, but which are impacted by similar problems). The same is true of AMD GPUs, by the way, in terms of doubled asking prices, and of course Team Red is facing all the exact same issues with stock shortages and price inflation.Note that there was a point where GPU pricing fell mid-year, but that was more a case of a correction from stupidly ridiculous prices in May, when Nvidia pricing reached triple the MSRP (again, all this is going by 3D Center, and just one set of figures, but the overall gist of huge price inflation is clearly visible in all regions, not just Europe).There\u2019s no two ways about it: 2021 was a terrible year to try to buy a graphics card from Nvidia (or indeed AMD), as if you could find the model you wanted \u2013 we\u2019ve got plenty of help resources to that end, in terms of our current stock level guides, incidentally \u2013 your wallet would be battered for the privilege. And that was the case for higher-end graphics cards and cheaper boards alike \u2013 indeed, let\u2019s talk about the budget market next, which was in even worse shape, in many respects.(Image credit: Future)Budget GPU gapBudget graphics cards remained a very sore point in 2021, not just for Nvidia either, but obviously it\u2019s Team Green we\u2019re focused on here. With current-gen Ampere, the lowest-end desktop card was the RTX 3060, and as we\u2019ve already discussed, it\u2019s a shaky value proposition compared to the 3060 Ti \u2013 and with a recommended price of $329 / \u00a3299, it isn\u2019t a \u2018budget\u2019 option (and of course, you can\u2019t get one that cheap anyway). We still remember the days when a few hundred notes got you a next-to-flagship tier GPU\u2026Anyway, there were RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti laptop GPUs released as outlined above, but no desktop models, so anyone looking for a cheap Ampere graphics card was on a hunt for a non-existent board, basically. (As it stands at the time of writing, the desktop RTX 3050 (maybe even two versions of it) is rumored to be in the pipeline for the near future, in theory turning up in January 2022).During this year, those wanting to buy a budget GPU from Nvidia have been left scrabbling around at the bottom of the barrel in a manner which would not have been imaginable pre-pandemic. Buyers have been looking at grabbing something like a GTX 1650 Super, a GPU from two years back; and paying through the nose for the privilege, too. Seriously overpaying, in fact (like double or even perhaps pushing towards triple the original launch price).Sadly, 2021 was the year when, in some scenarios, it made sense, at least for more enterprising buyers, to buy a full PC just to strip out the GPU for their existing rig, and sell that new computer immediately on the used market (with their old GPU inside) to get a good chunk of their outlay back that way.Pricing for even last-gen Nvidia GPUs being hugely inflated due to sheer demand led to some people looking further back to second-hand cards from older generations still (like GeForce 10 series, or even 900 series models), which represented better value for money as a stopgap solution.In short, it\u2019s been a terrible year to need a cheap graphics card, or any graphics card at all for that matter.(Image credit: Asus)Turning to TuringSo, it\u2019s no wonder we saw Nvidia trying some decidedly leftfield tactics late in 2021, namely resurrecting an old Turing model: the RTX 2060. Admittedly with double the video RAM and a bolstered core count (it\u2019s loaded with the same amount of CUDA cores as the old RTX 2060 Super, in fact, although it has slower memory than the latter).The broad idea was to relieve the pressure on RTX 3000 demand, and frustration about there not being nearly enough cards out there, by turning to an older-gen GPU which could theoretically be produced in numbers alongside cutting-edge Ampere boards as it\u2019s an older (12nm) process.This fudge tactic didn\u2019t pan out, however. Nvidia launched the RTX 2060 12GB version quietly in early December, with cards just coming from third-party manufacturers. The problem being that there was no stock available right out of the gate. At the time of writing, we still haven\u2019t seen the revamped RTX 2060 hit the shelves \u2013 by the time you read this, the GPU may have started to trickle out though, as Nvidia has promised availability from late December. So, in short, the GPU rereleased to help mitigate stock shortages suffered from an immediate stock shortage.To make matters worse, what we\u2019ve glimpsed of initial pricing makes it look like the RTX 2060 12GB is going to end up seriously expensive, and just not worth it anyway. We\u2019ll have to see how pricing settles down, but in a world where the GTX 1650 Super commands a serious premium above its launch price as we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re not holding out much hope for anything sensible to happen here.Particularly as there\u2019s another dark cloud here, and that\u2019s the chatter that crypto-miners may fancy this GPU, which could hit availability even harder. This is because the 2060 12GB looks to be at least a serviceable prospect for mining Ethereum (the coin which gained serious traction this year), and doesn\u2019t have the hash rate limiting imposed on RTX 3000 LHR (lite hash rate) models.LHR was Nvidia\u2019s bid to artificially hamstring Ampere graphics cards for miners this year, in an effort to make sure they got into the hands of gamers instead. But there have already been hacks that partially work around LHR restrictions (and mean that while miners lose some performance, the penalty is no longer as much as Nvidia intended).Elsewhere in high-end Nvidia GPU land, firmware tweaks made by EVGA in December (and possibly other card makers in the future) have boosted mining performance (even though that wasn\u2019t the intention). Any additional mining demand, of course, has only made things worse for gamers trying to buy an Nvidia GPU.Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that Nvidia\u2019s efforts to produce cryptomining processors\u00a0(CMPs) as an alternative to miners buying GeForce cards proved rather ineffectual, and sales of these CMPs slumped badly as 2021 rolled onwards.(Image credit: Future / Ubisoft)Concluding thoughtsNvidia held fast with its grip on the GPU market this year, continuing to dominate AMD in discrete desktop products \u2013 to no one\u2019s surprise, of course \u2013 and strengthening its range of Ampere graphics cards principally through the launch of the excellent 3080 Ti. Of course, the RTX 3000 series was strong already, so it didn\u2019t really matter that the other desktop additions (RTX 3070 Ti, 3060) were arguably much less effective.On the mobile front we witnessed a whole slew of fresh RTX 3000 offerings which represented a very welcome step up for gaming laptops, and Nvidia backed this up by taking considerable strides forward with DLSS, spreading it further (to some big-name games, and various popular game engines) and wider (to Linux gamers via Proton, plus VR gamers). DLAA was revealed, too, and looks like a compelling sibling for DLSS.Where things fell down was with the woeful stock levels of RTX 3000 graphics cards, which \u2013 compounded by scalpers, and miners \u2013 sparked huge price inflation. Of course, we can\u2019t blame Nvidia for a global component shortage, and rival AMD was in the same boat here.What was more frustrating, though, was the disappointing lack of any movement at all in the budget GPU sector. RTX 3050 models came out for laptops, but despite desktop versions being rumored since the very start of the year, they never emerged \u2013 which is quite possibly tied in with production capacity being stretched too thin as it was, we can speculate.The RTX 3050 is expected to be just around the corner now, finally, possibly arriving in January 2022, but we really could\u2019ve used it \u2013 and some quantity of the revamped RTX 2060 12GB for the matter \u2013 at the tail end of this year, just to give folks more options at the cheaper end of the scale. (Although doubtless RTX 3050 price tags would have been considerably inflated, it\u2019s all relative \u2013 and would certainly beat paying through the nose for a GTX 1650 Super, which is what it came down to for some gamers as 2021 drew to a close).If you couldn\u2019t find a new GPU to bring a fresh lease of life to your gaming PC, mind, there was always another option: play Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing (or other super-taxing titles) on your Chromebook, MacBook, or anything \u2013 like your smartphone \u2013 with GeForce Now. Nvidia\u2019s streaming service really impressed us, particularly the flagship RTX 3080 membership which rolled out this year, representing a whole new level of cloud gaming.We can\u2019t wait to see how Nvidia pushes forward with this streaming offering \u2013 hopefully bringing the likes of EA and other big-name publishers fully back into the fold \u2013 next year, coupled with what\u2019s next for DLSS combined with DLAA, and of course next-gen RTX 4000 (\u2018Lovelace\u2019) cards which are expected to debut later in 2022.The other fascinating point of focus for the GPU arena early next year will be that purported RTX 3050, and how it will fare against AMD\u2019s rumored RDNA 2 budget cards, and perhaps more importantly, Intel\u2019s new Arc Alchemist products \u2013 with Team Blue thought to be preparing a big attack on the budget sector.

roles in the US, many with six-figure salaries.\u00a0\nLindsey Duran, VP of recruiting, said she looks for project experience and humility in candidates.\nThe tech company has a reputation for transparency in its hiring process.\nThis article is part of the 'Careers 2.0' series, focused on helping job seekers learn more about getting jobs at notable companies.\nJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, is the best recruiter for the tech company.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\"He's the first one to call a candidate, send an email, whatever's needed,\" said Lindsey Duran, the vice president of recruiting for Nvidia, the largest chipmaker in the US by market value. \"He's a huge advocate of bringing on great talent.\"\u00a0\nFinding new, innovative team members is essential for Nvidia, as the company continues to expand into new markets like artificial intelligence, audiovisual, and 3D design. There are currently 1,918 roles open on the career portal, and Duran hinted that there will be even more openings in 2022.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia's recruitment push comes on the heels of a strong third-quarter, making $7.1 billion in sales, a new record for the company and a 50% jump from last year, according to its November 17 earnings statement.\nAn Insider analysis of federally disclosed 2021 H-1B visa data revealed that employees across teams like engineering, sales, and marketing make well over a $100,000 salary, including for college graduates. Duran told Insider that professional experience in internships or apprenticeships outside of school is key to helping candidates stand out.\u00a0\nTransparency in the process\u00a0\nAfter submitting an application, candidates can expect a phone screening and up to five virtual interviews, split across one-on-one chats, small groups, and panel interviews with team members. Duran emphasized that interviews are an opportunity for job seekers to get candid answers about \"the good, the bad, and the ugly\" when it comes to working for Nvidia.\u00a0\n\n\nShe said transparency about the hiring process makes Nvidia unique. The company website also has lots of information about what candidates can expect and suggestions for how to prepare.\u00a0\n\"In today's market, you need to be able to move quickly,\" Duran said. \"Candidates today, they've got multiple offers. We have to be able to move at the speed of light but move without jeopardizing quality.\"\u00a0\nCurrent employees also play a key role in hiring, Duran says, as 40% of new hires come from employee referrals, either directly or through social media networks.\u00a0\n\n\nOpportunities to work on groundbreaking projects\nWhether you're passionate about self-driving cars, health care, or robotics, Nvidia has projects across a wide range of technologies, Duran said. Across teams, she described working for Nvidia as an opportunity to do interesting, challenging work with smart team members.\u00a0\n\n\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \n\n\n\n\"Come to Nvidia to do your life's work,\" she said. \"We look at our opportunities not just to come fill a role, but to look at where you can find yourself for your career.\"\nWhen she's meeting candidates, Duran said she looks for savvy, innovative thinkers who can set ego aside.\u00a0\n\n\nThe best candidates have more than a computer science degree, Duran said. She looks for candidates with project experience in internships, and she also emphasizes leadership and communication skills that come across in interviews.\u00a0\n\"You have to be passionate about the technology, and you have to want to work on really complex problems,\" she said. \"We're really driven by the project. It's not about the title, it's about the work.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLegal & Privacy\n\nTerms of Service\nTerms of Sale\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nCode of Ethics Policy\nReprints & Permissions\nDisclaimer\nAdvertising Policies\nConflict of Interest Policy\nCommerce Policy\nCoupons Privacy Policy\nCoupons Terms\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nContact Us\nCompany News\nMasthead\n\n\nOther\n\nSitemap\nStock quotes by finanzen.net\n\nInternational Editions\n\nAT\nDE\nES\nJP\nNL\nPL\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 \n    Insider Inc.

Edge AI solutions can be used as a bridge between humans and machines, enabling improved forecasting, worker allocation, product design and logistics.\nHere are the top five edge AI trends NVIDIA expects to see in 2022:\n1. Edge Management Becomes an IT Focus\nWhile edge computing is rapidly becoming a must-have for many businesses, deployments remain in the early stages.\nTo move to production, edge AI management will become the responsibility of IT departments. In a recent report, Gartner wrote, \u201cEdge solutions have historically been managed by the line of business, but the responsibility is shifting to IT, and organizations are utilizing IT resources to optimize cost.\u201d1\nTo address the edge computing challenges related to manageability, security and scale, IT departments will turn to cloud-native technology. Kubernetes, a platform for containerized microservices, has emerged as the leading tool for managing edge AI applications on a massive scale.\nCustomers with IT departments that already use Kubernetes in the cloud can transfer their experience to build their own cloud-native management solutions for the edge. More will look to purchase third-party offerings such as Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu, Wind River Cloud Platform and NVIDIA Fleet Command.\n2. Expansion of AI Use Cases at the Edge\nComputer vision has dominated AI deployments at the edge. Image recognition led the way in AI training, resulting in a robust ecosystem of computer vision applications.\nNVIDIA Metropolis, an application framework and set of developer tools that helps create computer vision AI applications, has grown its partner network 100-fold since 2017 to now include 1,000+ members.\nMany companies are deploying or purchasing computer vision applications. Such companies at the forefront of computer vision will start to look to multimodal solutions.\nMultimodal AI brings in different data sources to create more intelligent applications that can respond to what they see, hear and otherwise sense. These complex AI use cases employ skills like natural language understanding, conversational AI, pose estimation, inspection and visualization.\nCombined with data storage, processing technologies, and input/output or sensor capabilities, multimodal AI can yield real-time performance at the edge for an expansion of use cases in robotics, healthcare, hyper-personalized advertising, cashierless shopping, concierge experiences and more.\nImagine shopping with a virtual assistant. With traditional AI, an avatar might see what you pick up off a shelf, and a speech assistant might hear what you order.\nBy combining both data sources, a multimodal AI-based avatar can hear your order, provide a response, see your reaction, and provide further responses based on it. This complementary information allows the AI to deliver a better, more interactive customer experience.\nTo see an example of this in action, check out Project Tokkio:\n\n3. Convergence of AI and Industrial IoT Solutions\nThe intelligent factory is another space being driven by new edge AI applications. According to the same Gartner report, \u201cBy 2027, machine learning in the form of deep learning will be included in over 65 percent of edge use cases, up from less than 10 percent in 2021.\u201d\nFactories can add AI applications onto cameras and other sensors for inspection and predictive maintenance. However, detection is just step one. Once an issue is detected, action must be taken.\nAI applications are able to detect an anomaly or defect and then alert a human to intervene. But for safety applications and other use cases when instant action is required, real-time responses are made possible by connecting the AI inference application with the IoT platforms that manage the assembly lines, robotic arms or pick-and-place machines.\nIntegration between such applications relies on custom development work. Hence, expect more partnerships between AI and traditional IoT management platforms that simplify the adoption of edge AI in industrial environments.\n4. Growth in Enterprise Adoption of AI-on-5G\u00a0\nAI-on-5G combined computing infrastructure provides a high-performance and secure connectivity fabric to integrate sensors, computing platforms and AI applications \u2014 whether in the field, on premises or in the cloud.\nKey benefits include ultra-low latency in non-wired environments, guaranteed quality-of-service and improved security.\nAI-on-5G will unlock new edge AI use cases:\n\nIndustry 4.0: Plant automation, factory robots, monitoring and inspection.\nAutomotive systems: Toll road and vehicle telemetry applications.\nSmart spaces: Retail, smart city and supply chain applications.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s first full stack AI-on-5G platforms, Mavenir Edge AI, was introduced in November. Next year, expect to see additional full-stack solutions that provide the performance, management and scale of enterprise 5G environments.\n5. AI Lifecycle Management From Cloud to Edge\nFor organizations deploying edge AI, MLOps will become key to helping drive the flow of data to and from the edge. Ingesting new, interesting data or insights from the edge, retraining models, testing applications and then redeploying those to the edge improves model accuracy and results.\nWith traditional software, updates may happen on a quarterly or annual basis, but AI gains significantly from a continuous cycle of updates.\nMLOps is still in early development, with many large players and startups building solutions for the constant need for AI technology updates. While mostly focused on solving the problem of the data center for now, such solutions in the future will shift to edge computing.\nRiding the Next Wave of AI Computing\n\nThe development of AI has consisted of several waves, as pictured above.\nDemocratization of AI is underway, with new tools and solutions making it a reality. Edge AI, powered by huge growth in IoT and availability of 5G, is the next wave to break.\nIn 2022, more enterprises will move their AI inference to the edge, bolstering ecosystem growth as the industry looks at how to extend from cloud to the edge.\nLearn more about edge AI by watching the GTC session, The Rise of Intelligent Edge: From Enterprise to Device Edge, on demand.\nCheck out NVIDIA edge computing solutions.\n1\u00a0Gartner, \u201cPredicts 2022: The Distributed Enterprise Drives Computing to the Edge\u201d, 20 October 2021.

They scaled with NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and our software stack to deliver the fastest time to train on Selene, our in-house AI supercomputer based on the modular NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs delivered the best per-chip training performance in all eight MLPerf 1.1 tests.\nA Cloud Sails to the Top\nWhen it comes to training AI models, Azure\u2019s NDm A100 v4 instance is the fastest on the planet, according to the latest results. It ran every test in the latest round and scaled up to 2,048 A100 GPUs.\nAzure showed not only great performance, but great performance that\u2019s available for anyone to rent and use today, in six regions across the U.S.\nAI training is a big job that requires big iron. And we want users to train models at record speed with the service or system of their choice.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re enabling NVIDIA AI with products for cloud services, co-location services, corporations and scientific computing centers, too.\nServer Makers Flex Their Muscles\nAmong OEMs, Inspur Electronic Information set the most records in single-node performance with its eight-way GPU systems, the NF5688M6 and the liquid-cooled NF5488A5. Dell and Supermicro set records on four-way A100 GPU systems.\nA total of 10 NVIDIA partners submitted results in the round, eight OEMs and two cloud-service providers. They made up more than 90 percent of all submissions.\nThis is the fifth and strongest showing to date for the NVIDIA ecosystem in training tests from MLPerf.\nOur partners do this work because they know MLPerf is the only industry-standard, peer-reviewed benchmark for AI training and inference. It\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI platforms and vendors.\nServers Certified for Speed\nBaidu PaddlePaddle, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo and Supermicro submitted results in local data centers, running jobs on both single and multiple nodes.\nNearly all our OEM partners ran tests on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, servers we validate for enterprise customers who want accelerated computing.\nThe range of submissions shows the breadth and maturity of an NVIDIA platform that provides optimal solutions for businesses working at any scale.\nBoth Fast and Flexible\nNVIDIA AI was the only platform participants used to make submissions across all benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating versatility as well as high performance. Systems that are both fast and flexible provide the productivity customers need to speed their work.\nThe training benchmarks cover eight of today\u2019s most popular AI workloads and scenarios \u2014 computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and more.\nMLPerf\u2019s tests are transparent and objective, so users can rely on the results to make informed buying decisions. The industry benchmarking group, formed in May 2018, is backed by dozens of industry leaders including Alibaba, Arm, Google, Intel and NVIDIA.\n20x Speedups in Three Years\nLooking back, the numbers show performance gains on our A100 GPUs of over 5x in just the last 18 months. That\u2019s thanks to continuous innovations in software, the lion\u2019s share of our work these days.\nNVIDIA\u2019s performance has increased more than 20x since the MLPerf tests debuted three years ago. That massive speedup is a result of the advances we make across our full-stack offering of GPUs, networks, systems and software.\nNVIDIA AI delivers more than 20x improvements over three years.\nConstantly Improving Software\nOur latest advances came from multiple software improvements.\nFor example, using a new class of memory copy operations, we achieved 2.5x faster operations on the 3D-UNet benchmark for medical imaging.\nThanks to ways you can fine-tune GPUs for parallel processing, we realized a 10 percent speed up on the Mask R-CNN test for object detection and a 27 percent boost for recommender systems. We simply overlapped independent operations, a technique that\u2019s especially powerful for jobs that run across many GPUs.\nWe expanded our use of CUDA graphs to minimize communication with the host CPU. That brought a 6 percent performance gain on the ResNet-50 benchmark for image classification.\nAnd we implemented two new techniques on NCCL, our library that optimizes communications among GPUs. That accelerated results up to 5 percent on large language models like BERT.\nLeverage Our Hard Work\nAll the software we used is available from the MLPerf repository, so everyone can get our world-class results. We continuously fold these optimizations into containers available on NGC, our software hub for GPU applications.\nIt\u2019s part of a full-stack platform, proven in the latest industry benchmarks, and available from a variety of partners to tackle real AI jobs today.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA DGX | Parallel Computing | Recommender Systems \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And, while you can find the RTX 3060 for even less, the RTX 3060 Ti provides better value, since it offers more performance for the price.In particular, the 3060 Ti improves upon the 3060\u2019s solid 1080p performance by letting you dive into the latest AAA games at 1440p on ultra settings. And, if you use DLSS, you may even be able to squeeze some 4K gaming out of it.Jump toPrice and availability\nFeatures and chipset\nPerformance\nShould I buy?\nAlso considerNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti at Amazon for $546.26In some instances, it also outperforms the RTX 2080 Super, a GPU that was almost double the price when it came out, showing you the power of the new Nvidia Ampere architecture.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: nearly perfect, but with one major flaw\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: nearly RTX 4090 performance for a whole lot less\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti may not be the speediest or most robust GPU out there, but it provides excellent performance at a reasonable price. That makes it among the best graphics cards on the market right now.\u00a0And, it\u2019s an ideal GPU for those who consider flagship cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or the pricier Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 too expensive. It is possibly the best Nvidia GeForce graphics card for most gamers and easily holds off the resurgent competition from the best AMD graphics cards in its class.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: price and availability(Image credit: Nvidia)How much is it? MSRP listed at $399 (about \u00a3299, AU$540)When is it out? It was released in December 2020Where can you get it? You can buy it from retailers in the US, UK, and AustraliaThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is available starting December 2, 2020, and you can pick it up starting at $399 (about \u00a3299, AU$540). This largely falls in line with what we\u2019d expect a graphics card in this segment to cost, especially considering the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super started at the same $399 (about \u00a3315, AU$580) and the RTX 2060 was $349 (about \u00a3260, AU$475).The RTX 3060 Ti falls right around the same price as the RTX 2060 Super, while being as powerful as the RTX 2080 Super, a card that retailed for $699 (about \u00a3560, AU$990). That card was a 1440p Ultra machine, and so it follows that the 3060 Ti will be as well, and now it\u2019s way cheaper.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: features and chipset(Image credit: Nvidia)3rd-generation ray tracing coresMore than double the CUDA cores of RTX 2060 SuperGreater power draw (TGP) over RTX 2060 SuperThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is based on the same Ampere architecture as the RTX 3080, and gives us a look at what the Ampere lineup will look like in the mid-range and budget segment of the GPU market. This isn\u2019t exactly going to be the graphics card that\u2019ll push Watch Dogs Legion with ray tracing at 4K, but it is definitely up to doing it at 1080p.With this graphics card, you\u2019re getting 8GB of the same GDDR6 memory found in the RTX 3070, paired with 38 Ampere Streaming Multiprocessors (SM). However, because of changes Nvidia has made to its SM since Turing, each of these now has 128 CUDA cores, double that of the 64 in each Turing SM. That means there are now 4,864 CUDA cores in the RTX 3060 Ti, up from the 2,176 found in the RTX 2060 Super.Power consumption sees an increase over the RTX 2060 Super, but it\u2019s not as pronounced as other cards in the Nvidia Ampere lineup. The total graphics power (TGP) is 200W for the RTX 3060 Ti, up from the 175W of the RTX 2060 Super. It\u2019s more, but it shouldn\u2019t be so much more that you\u2019ll need to worry about upgrading your power supply to accommodate \u2013 assuming you have a competent one in the first place, that is.Back in Turing, each SM had two datapaths \u2013 one dedicated to Floating Point (FP32) workloads, and the other dedicated to Integer. With Ampere, and thus the RTX 3060 Ti, Nvidia was able to engineer the SM to have one of the datapaths essentially able to pull double duty, which is why the amount of CUDA cores has effectively doubled per SM with Ampere.Outside of CUDA cores, each SM also has Tensor Cores for AI workloads like Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), and dedicated ray tracing cores. Each SM has one RT core and four Tensor Cores. The dedicated among you might have noticed that\u2019s half the amount of Tensor Cores in each SM than Turing had, but there\u2019s a good reason for that \u2013 they\u2019re more than twice as fast this time around.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti key specsGPU: Nvidia GA104\nStreaming multiprocessors: 38 (Ampere)\nCUDA Cores: 4,864\nTensor cores: 152\nRay tracing cores: 38\nPower Draw (TGP): 200W\nBoost clock: 1,665MHz\nVRAM: 8GB GDDR6\nMemory Speed: 14Gbps\nInterface: PCIe 4.0 x16\nPower connector: 1 x 12-pinThe RT core is what\u2019s responsible for the ray tracing that everyone is talking about. The whole point is to offload the massive computational load that any kind of ray tracing entails, in order to be able to produce playable framerates.Basically, when a light ray is cast in a game engine, the SM will send that information over to the RT core, where it will calculate where that ray bounces, and report that back to the SM so it can render the image. This doesn\u2019t make ray tracing computationally free, though, as you\u2019ll see from the massive hit in performance that having RT on in Metro Exodus entails.However, without these dedicated RT cores, the performance hit would turn the game into a slideshow.Luckily, the other dedicated type of core, the Tensor Core is the other part of the equation that makes it somewhat sensible to enable ray tracing when playing the best PC games. Through the Tensor Core, developers can integrate DLSS in games, which is essentially an AI-enabled upscaling tech. This helps boost performance by having the SM render a scene in a lower resolution, then having the Tensor Core use data from Nvidia\u2019s Supercomputers to intelligently scale that scene up to full resolution.With DLSS, you\u2019re able to make up much of the performance difference that ray tracing brings to the table, so you can have the awesome image quality benefits of ray tracing, without sacrificing too much in the way of performance. In fact, without DLSS, ray tracing simply wouldn\u2019t be worth it.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti also brings a wealth of features to the table too. Esports players are going to love Nvidia Reflex, which aims to cut system latency, RTX IO works alongside Microsoft DirectStorage to load data straight from your system storage to your VRAM and Nvidia Broadcast allows for you to filter out background noise and images while streaming or video chatting, regardless of the software you\u2019re using. And, while it\u2019s definitely true that a lot of software, like Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams all allow for similar functionality, having all the settings in one place is a huge time-saver.(Image credit: Nvidia)The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition is, well, almost exactly the same as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition. The two cards are exactly the same size, with the same amount of fans, and the same exposed fins on the back of the card that helps shoot hot air out of the graphics card up and out of the system.The only core difference here is that it\u2019s a lighter gray color than the RTX 3070. And, just like the rest of the Founders Editions in the Ampere lineup, Nvidia has absolutely delivered some of the best-looking graphics cards we\u2019ve ever seen.And the best part? The stylish cooler is also effective. Throughout our entire testing suite, we saw temperatures peak at 72C, which is about the same temperature seen by the RTX 2060 Super, but while consuming 10% more power. \u00a0It\u2019s not all sunshine and roses though. While the cooler itself is amazing, shrinking down the GPU board to accommodate it brings the same drawback here as the rest of the lineup. Namely, the RTX 3060 Ti is using the same 12-pin power connector. Nvidia does include an adapter in the box, which lets you connect one 8-pin PCIe cable to the 12-pin port, but it does make cable management a little more of a trouble. Luckily, PSU manufacturers have already started working on dedicated 12-pin PCIe cables, so hopefully that problem goes away as time goes on.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: performance(Image credit: Nvidia)Exceptional 1440p performanceActually enjoyable ray tracingNot quite capable of full 4K gamingWhat we love about new mid-range graphics cards like the RTX 3060 Ti is that they bring the baseline of PC gaming performance up, due to how accessible they are to everyone. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti absolutely blows the RTX 2060 Super out of the water, just like the rest of the Ampere lineup has done to its predecessors.In 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, for instance, which is a test geared towards 4K gaming performance in DirectX 12 \u2013 which current gen games will mostly be using \u2013 the RTX 3060 Ti is 38% faster than the 2060 Super. And, in the Port Royal test, which tests raw ray tracing performance, Nvidia\u2019s new GPU is 39% faster than its Turing equivalent.But what\u2019s more impressive is how the RTX 3060 Ti compares to the RTX 2080 Super. Nvidia is claiming that the RTX 3060 Ti is faster than the RTX 2080 Super, but that\u2019s a little bit of an overstatement. However, the RTX 3060 Ti is around the same level of performance as the RTX 2080 Super, which is still incredibly impressive, given the price of this new card.Test system specsThis is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti:CPU:\u00a0AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16-core, up to 4.9GHz)\nCPU Cooler:\u00a0Cooler Master Masterliquid 360P Silver Edition\nRAM:\u00a064GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 3,200MHz\nMotherboard:\u00a0ASRock X570 Taichi\nSSD:\u00a0ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB\nPower Supply:\u00a0Corsair AX1000\nCase:\u00a0Praxis WetbenchIn those two synthetic benchmarks we mentioned earlier, the RTX 3060 Ti is 7% and faster and 0.5% faster in Time Spy Extreme and Port Royal, respectively.In actual games, the RTX 3060 Ti obviously kills it. In Metro Exodus without ray tracing and on the Ultra quality preset at 1440p, the RTX 3060 Ti manages 69 fps to the RTX 2080 Super\u2019s 68 fps \u2013 which is within margin of error. When you turn on ray tracing however, the third-generation RT Cores get to stretch their wings, with a wider 8% performance lead.Throughout most of the games we tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti in, the graphics card showed its strength in 1440p gaming, with only Red Dead Redemption 2 and Total War: Three Kingdoms resulting in framerates less than 60 fps at max settings. And, considering just how heavy those two games are, the RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s scores of 55 fps and 59 fps, respectively, is damn impressive.The Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060 Ti brings game-changing 1440p performance to the mid-range market, and should remain a go-to 1440p card for quite a while, considering how both AMD and Nvidia have set their sights on 4K as the new Flagship battleground.Image 1 of 31(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)(Image credit: Infogram; Future)And, when it comes to straight 1440p performance, the RTX 3060 Ti absolutely stands completely on its own in the marketplace when you consider both the performance and the price. This graphics card is around the same price as the AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, but is around 35% faster throughout our testing.We\u2019re sure AMD has something in the cards to make this recommendation a little more complicated, but at the time of writing, Team Red has nothing that can touch the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti from a sheer value perspective, which is definitely a weird place to find AMD in.It\u2019s definitely going to be interesting to see how this graphics card matures over the next generation of gaming, however. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X having just hit the streets, graphics requirements for games are about to become a lot more demanding. Right now the RTX 3060 Ti definitely feels like it\u2019s ready for the big time, but only time will tell how this graphics card handles this next generation of games.In the here and now, however, anyone looking for a mid-range graphics card to handle 1440p gaming is going to find a lot to love. At that resolution, you\u2019re easily going to be able to just crank settings up to max and forget about them. That\u2019s not something you\u2019ve really been able to do before now in this price segment. The best part? There\u2019s enough performance headroom here to take a peek at what 4K gaming has to offer with the best PC games out there right now \u2013 just don\u2019t expect that buttery-smooth 60fps experience that the RTX 3080 can offer.Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti?(Image credit: Nvidia)Buy it if\u2026You\u2019re comfortable staying at 1080p\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is definitely capable of some entry-level 4K gaming, where this graphics card really shines is at the lower 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The RTX 3060 Ti will be able to deliver high-framerate gaming at 1080p for years.You don\u2019t want to spend a whole lot of money\nBecause the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is just $399 (about \u00a3299, AU$540), you don\u2019t have to worry about emptying your piggy bank just to get the latest graphics card.You want ray tracing at a reasonable price \nAt 1080p, the RTX 3060 Ti is an absolute champion at ray tracing, and you don\u2019t have to worry about unplayable frame rates at 1080p, or really even 1440p with DLSS enabled.Don\u2019t buy it if\u2026You\u2019re looking for 4K gaming\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti can do a bit of 4K gaming, but if that\u2019s the main resolution you\u2019re going for, you\u2019re better off going for a more capable graphics card, like the RTX 3070 or RTX 3080.You can afford to move up the product stack\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a fantastic performer for the price, but if money isn't really an issue, it still pales in comparison to the RTX 3080.Also considerNvidia GeForce RTX 3060\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 might not be as powerful as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, but it's still got plenty to offer at a slightly better price. There's no Founders Edition card, however, so you'll have to look for third-party board partners for this one.\nRead the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 reviewAMD Radeon RX 6600XT\nThe AMD Radeon RX 6600XT is a very strong alternative to the RTX 3060 Ti, but only up to a point. It is slightly cheaper, but it is also about 20% to 30% in some tasks, so we'd still recommend you go with the RTX 3060 Ti. But if you can't find that card anywhere and need something to hold you over, the RX 6600XT isn't outrageously expensive and will definitely get you solid performance.\nRead the full AMD Radeon RX 6600XT reviewFirst reviewed in December 2020Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: Price Comparison274 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $546.26View $1,352.52View No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\nJackie ThomasSocial Links NavigationJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.

Welcome NVIDIA LaunchPad.\nIntroducing NVIDIA LaunchPad!\nNVIDIA recently announced LaunchPad \u2013 a hands-on environment where enterprise users can use NVIDIA AI Enterprise servers in a vSphere 7 environment free of charge for 2-4 weeks. Although enterprises are more than welcome to use this service with workloads they are considering deploying on an NVIDIA environment, they can also go through labs that NVIDIA has created that allow IT professionals to become comfortable with using NVIDIA-enabled servers. If you prefer, we also have a podcast where Brian Beeler has a conversation with Luke Wignall from NVIDIA on how LaunchPad came to be and what goes on inside.\n\nNVIDIA AI LaunchPad is hosted in an Equinix facility. The platform allows enterprises to speed the development of complex AI models using DGX SuperPOD, NVIDIA Base Command,\u00a0NVIDIA Fleet Command, and pre-trained models from NVIDIA NGC. It also supports scaling mainstream AI on NVIDIA-Certified servers distributed across the network. These industry-standard servers are ideal for running the NVIDIA AI Enterprise\u00a0software suite on VMware vSphere to scale AI workloads in the modern hybrid cloud.\nAccessing NVIDIA LaunchPad\nAfter completing a profile form, the user is presented with a detailed overview screen. The process is straightforward, providing instruction on setting up the environment to access AI software and infrastructure. The goal for NVIDIA LaunchPad is to speed up application development and deployment.\n\nNVIDIA feels that some companies are not using more AI is the unfound fear in the complexity of setting up an environment where AI can run. With this in mind, NVIDIA created labs designed to address these fears with two different AI professionals in mind; IT administrators and managers that need to stand up and support AI environments and AI practitioners that need to use them. Offering this service will help build confidence in supporting and using AI before investing an IT budget building out a specific infrastructure to run those AI applications. Furthermore, deploying AI workloads in this environment, with familiar tools, allows developers to realize the value of their AI project with an NVIDIA GPU.\n\nNVIDIA LaunchPad WorkFlow\nGPU-Optimized Software Hub for AI, ML, and High-Performance Computing\nThe NGC catalog is a hub of GPU-optimized AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and data analytics software that simplifies and accelerates end-to-end workflows. With enterprise-grade containers, pre-trained AI models, and industry-specific SDKs that can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge, enterprises can build and deliver solutions quickly and with confidence.\n\nThe systems may be equipped with an NVIDIA A30 or a T4 GPU at this time, though that may change as new cards are released. Regardless of the hardware, all systems use NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which NVIDIA describes as:\n\u201can end-to-end, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software,\u202foptimized, certified, and supported by NVIDIA to run on VMware vSphere\u202fwith NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\u202f It includes key enabling technologies\u202ffrom NVIDIA for rapid deployment, management, and scaling of AI workloads in the modern hybrid cloud.\u201d\nThe labs have vSphere preinstalled with access to a vSphere client from the URL provided by NVIDIA.\n\nIT administrators have labs that walk them through the steps involved in configuring VMs to use GPUs. AI practitioners have access to labs built on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite that includes applications, frameworks, and tools that AI researchers, data scientists, and developers use for creating their AI and Machine Learning applications.\n\nOne of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise LaunchPad journeys walks you through a Jupyter lab notebook, using NVIDIA RAPIDS\u00a0and the New York City taxi dataset to predict ride fares in Manhattan. The dataset contains columns like pickup points, dropoff points, fare amount, number of passengers. The data in this lab is used to train an XGBoost model on GPU. The labs provided by NVIDIA take from 30 minutes to several hours. NVIDIA will provide the appropriate environment for each lab.\nSeparate from the NVIDIA lab environment is the ability to establish a working AI model. Applying for the complete AI LaunchPad environment is similar to requesting a Lab.\nOnce logged into the NVIDIA LaunchPad, there are detailed instructions for setting up the VM through creating an Ubuntu VM, associating an NVIDIA GPU to it, acquiring and adding an NVIDIA driver to the OS, acquiring an NVIDIA API key and software, and licensing the VM to use the GPU. Since AI software is container-based, the lab includes installing Docker, NVIDIA container tool kit, Tensor flow, and running AI examples. This is a total working environment allowing you to build and deploy your own AI project.\nStep-By-Step Approach\nConfiguring the VM is well documented, and input screens have the necessary help if needed. NVIDIA, working with VMware, has created a simple interface to implement the required configuration and install the appropriate tools to get the proof-of-concept environment up and running with minimal stress. Let\u2019s be clear on this point as well. These are very well-appointed machines. Our environment had a Dell PowerEdge R750, with an NVIDIA A30 and plenty of DRAM and cores.\n\nOnce the sign-up request has been approved, NVIDIA sends a URL, including username and temporary password. As noted, our environment was a Dell NVIDIA-Certified System with A30 GPUs. However, specific configuration options are available to customize the experience to meet the needs of the user.\n\nNeed to make a change? NVIDIA LaunchPad has been designed to allow the user to step back if changes are required along the way. The menu is always accessible with detailed instructions.\n\nThe VM is created based on the hardware and software requirements input during the configuration process.\n\nFollowing the Docker container installation and running the Docker Utility Engine for NVIDIA GPU configuration, the final step is to install AI and Data Science Applications and Frameworks.\n\nMoving between the vSphere screen and the VM console is also seamless and accessed from the main menu. Some recommended browsers seem to work better than others.\u00a0 Safari might give you some heartburn, but there are ways to work around them.\n\nFinally, installing the AI application and further VM configurations completes the process. NVIDIA is very responsive if you run into issues. In fact, we ran into some self-inflicted problems and required aid. We were back in action with very little downtime. To be fair, we are a media organization evaluating LaunchPad, but NVIDIA is highly motivated to ensure everyone testing LaunchPad has a productive time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe NVIDIA LaunchPad is a robust proof-of-concept tool that\u2019s impressively easy to use.\u00a0 In the end, the collaboration between NVIDIA, VMware, and Equinix provides a robust environment for testing real AI and ML applications against some of NVIDIA\u2019s most popular GPUs.\nBetter yet, NVIDIA has made this work well for two key personas that need to collaborate, the IT admin and the data scientist/AI practitioner. So often these modern AI workloads cause stress on the traditional IT stack. The workloads are complicated, run on expensive hardware and cause support headaches for IT. By putting LaunchPad in the well-understood confines of vSphere, many of IT\u2019s typical concerns go away. On the other hand, AI practitioners get all of the tools they need, with a robust GPU and compute environment to boot. When complete, the VMs are easily portable, if an organization wishes to take their work with them.\nWe are excited about this free offering from NVIDIA as it reminds us of VMware Hands-on-labs and VMware TestDrive as well as the added benefit of allowing you to work with your own AI project on it. In our time in NVIDIA LaunchPad, we found the documentation to be quite deep and the support to be excellent when we accidentally eradicated our poor environment. With up to four weeks to play around on LaunchPad, organizations serious about growing their AI chops definitely need to check this out immediately.\nFor more information on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, click here.

And when you add in AI, you can get superhuman results \u2014 better circuits than anyone could design by hand,\u201d said Dally, who leads a team of more than 200 people at NVIDIA Research.\nGains Span Circuits, Boards\nDally cited improvements GPUs and AI deliver across the workflow of chip and board design. His examples spanned the layout and placement of circuits to faster ways to render images of printed-circuit boards.\nIn one particularly stunning example of speedups with GPUs, he pointed to research NVIDIA plans to present at a conference next year. The GATSPI tool accelerates detailed simulations of a chip\u2019s logic by more than 1,000x compared to commercial tools running on CPUs today.\nGATSPI, a GPU-accelerated simulation tool, completes work in seconds that currently takes a full day running on a CPU.\nA paper at DAC this year describes how NVIDIA collaborated with Cadence Design Systems, a leading provider of EDA software, to render board-level designs using graphics techniques on NVIDIA GPUs. Their work boosted performance up to 20x for interactive operations on Cadence\u2019s Allegro X platform, announced in June.\n\u201cEngineers used to wait for programs to respond after every edit or pan across an image \u2014 it was an awkward, frustrating way to work. But with GPUs, the flow becomes truly interactive,\u201d said Dally, who chaired Stanford University\u2019s computer science department before joining NVIDIA in 2009.\nReinforcement Learning Delivers Rewards\nA technique called NVCell, described in a DAC session this week, uses reinforcement learning to automate the job of laying out a standard cell, a basic building block of a chip.\nThe approach reduces work that typically takes months for a 10-person team to an automated process that runs in a couple days. \u201cThat lets the engineering team focus on a few challenging cells that need to be designed by hand,\u201d said Dally.\nIn another example of the power of reinforcement learning, NVIDIA researchers will describe at DAC a new tool called PrefixRL. It discovers how to design a circuit such as an adder, encoder or custom design.\nPrefixRL treats the design process like a game where the high score is in finding the smallest area and power consumption for the circuit.\nBy letting AI optimize the process, engineers get a device that\u2019s more efficient than what\u2019s possible with today\u2019s tools. It\u2019s a good example of how AI can deliver designs no human could.\nLeveraging AI\u2019s Tool Box\nNVIDIA worked with the University of Texas at Austin on a research project called DREAMPlace that made novel use of PyTorch, a popular software framework for deep learning. It adapted the framework used to optimize weights in a neural network to find the best spot to place a block with 10 million cells inside a larger chip.\nIt\u2019s a routine job that currently takes nearly four hours using today\u2019s state-of-the-art techniques on CPUs. Running on NVIDIA Volta architecture GPUs in a data center or cloud service, it can finish in as little as five minutes, a 43x speedup.\nGetting a Clearer Image Faster\nTo make a chip, engineers use a lithography machine to project their design onto a semiconductor wafer. To make sure the chip performs as expected, they must accurately simulate that image, a critical challenge.\nNVIDIA researchers created a neural network that understands the optical process. It simulated the image on the wafer 80x faster and with higher accuracy, using a 20x smaller model than current state-of-the-art machine learning methods.\nIt\u2019s one more example of how the combination of accelerated computing and AI are helping engineers design better chips faster.\nAn AI-Powered Future\n\u201cNVIDIA used some of these techniques to make our existing GPUs, and we plan to use more of them in the future,\u201d Dally said.\n\u201cI expect tomorrow\u2019s standard EDA tools will be AI-powered to make the chip designer\u2019s job easier and their results better than ever,\u201d he said.\nTo watch Dally\u2019s keynote, register for a complimentary pass to DAC using the code ILOVEDAC, then view the talk here.\n\n\nCategories: ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Research | Volta \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And if you\u2019ve got the ray tracing beta version of Minecraft for Windows installed, I can heartily recommend you too take a wander through the Nvidia RTX Winter World: a vast, Christmassy and very, very pretty custom map that has you helping Santa throw a festive shindig while you trade sweets with his elves.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nA little walk around my Minecraft cave pyramid (feat. polar bear)\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nCommissioned by Nvidia and mine-crafted by competitive builder Ushio Tokura, the snowy, glowy wonderland is obviously intended to show off ray tracing capabilities of Nvidia\u2019s best graphics cards. But there\u2019s a charitable aspect too, and it was all put together \u2013 all 30- million-plus blocks of it \u2013 in support of Great Ormund Street Hospital for Children and their Christmas fundraising campaign.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nAlong with Santa\u2019s grotto, an outrageously elaborate banquet hall and multiple festive fairground attractions, you can visit a replica of GOSH itself, to read up on the hospital\u2019s history or scan a VR code that will take to you the campaign\u2019s donation page. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nIt\u2019s lovely stuff, and there\u2019s more to do besides. A short series of fetch quests sees you and an appropriately rectangular Saint Nick lay on a Christmas feast, and if you wander off the beaten path you can explore a hedge maze, ride a rollercoaster or just chill with some friendly penguins. There\u2019s also a functioning Christmas market, and a good one too \u2013 not like the ones I\u2019m used to here in London that charge \u00a314 for a hot dog. And I love how the different areas are contained within colossal snowglobes, connected a rail line you can ride in a choo-choo-train reskin of the standard minecart. No wonder it apparently took Tokura over 300 hours to build.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t gone through the (admittedly rather fiddly) process of enabling RTX features in Minecraft, or you don\u2019t have a graphics card that can support ray tracing, you can always donate to GOSH directly. To play RTX Winter World, download the .mctemplate file from Planet Minecraft, plonk it in Minecraft's world_templates folder, then choose it as a template when starting a new world.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Minecraft is getting two theme parks, with the first due in 2026\n          \n\n\n\n            Minecraft: Bedrock Edition's hardcore mode and pocketable bags are now live in the Bundles Of Bravery update\n          \n\n\n\n            Minecraft is getting a new biome and The Creaking, a creepy mob that only moves when you look away\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor. He has over a decade\u2019s experience in testing/writing about tech and games, something you can probably tell from his hairline.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nView comments (1)    \n\n\nIn this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft\n\n\nAndroid, \n            iOS, \n            PS4, \n            PS5, \n            Xbox One, \n            Xbox Series X/S, \n            PC, \n            Nintendo Switch\n\n\n  Follow\n \n\n\n\n\nRelated topics\n\nCharity\nNvidia\nNvidia RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n        Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in\n      \n\n        Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.\n      \n\n\n\n\nSign in with Google\n\n\nSign in with Facebook\n\n\nSign in with Twitter\n\n\nSign in with Reddit\n\n\n\nSign in with email    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest On Minecraft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Minecraft Bedrock seeds                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Minecraft seeds 1.21.4 2025                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Minecraft shaders for 1.21.4                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft house ideas                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 30 best survival games on PC                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Minecraft mods (2025)                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to find Diamonds in Minecraft 1.21                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make Potions in Minecraft                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n                    Spiritfarer devs release 33 Immortals, the early access co-op hellraiser that plays like an MMO raid\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Koei Tecmo know your Rise of the Ronin save file might be borked, promises they're trying to figure out why\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Moroi is a top-down meatgrinder that stinks of Little Nightmares and American McGee's Alice\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Metro 4 will \"inevitably\" be shaped by Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Guides\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to get pets\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to smuggle resources\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to parry and deflect\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to change characters\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    How to use photo mode in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    How to turn on Guaranteed Assassination in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    What is the Animus Hub in Assassin's Creed Shadows?\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nTop Discussions\n\n\n\n\n                    Power up your Gamer Network ID with our Steam Integration\n                  \n\n\n119 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Ubisoft warn staff not to celebrate Assassin's Creed Shadows launch as part of \u201canti-harassment plan\u201d\n                  \n\n\n79 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows review\n                  \n\n\n24 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    It's a worryingly perfect time to revive Assassin's Creed's old social stealth multiplayer\n                  \n\n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    The Half-Life 2 RTX demo proposes a nice visual upgrade and not much else\n                  \n\n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    R.E.P.O. is Steam's latest viral horror despite its high mate requirement - but the devs are working on matchmaking\n                  \n\n\n10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Total War: Warhammer 3's next updates will tackle \"anti-player bias\" and self-destructive AI\n                  \n\n\n9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock Paper Shotgun is owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis.\n  \u00a9 2025 Gamer Network Limited, 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

\u2014 and His Toy Counterpart \u2014 Together With Stunning Demos at GTC\u00a0\n\nDecember 21, 2021 by Brian Caulfield \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  It could only happen in NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 the company\u2019s virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows.\nAnd it happened during an interview with a virtual toy model of NVIDIA\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\u201cWhat are the greatest \u2026\u201d one of Toy Jensen\u2019s creators asked, stumbling, then stopping before completing his scripted question.\nUnfazed, the tiny Toy Jensen paused for a moment, considering the answer carefully.\n\u201cThe greatest are those,\u201d Toy Jensen replied, \u201cwho are kind to others.\u201d\nLeading-edge computer graphics, physics simulation, a live CEO, and a supporting cast of AI-powered avatars came together to make NVIDIA\u2019s GTC keynote \u2014 delivered using Omniverse \u2014 possible.\nAlong the way, a little soul got into the mix, too.\nThe AI-driven comments, added to the keynote as a stinger, provided an unexpected peek at the depth of Omniverse\u2019s technology.\n\u201cOmniverse is the hub in which all the various research domains converge and align and work in unison,\u201d says Kevin Margo, a member of NVIDIA\u2019s creative team who put the presentation together. \u201cOmniverse facilitates the convergence of all of them.\u201d\nToy Jensen\u2019s ad-lib capped a presentation that seamlessly mixed a real CEO with virtual and real environments as Huang took viewers on a tour of how NVIDIA technologies are weaving AI, graphics and robotics together with humans in real and virtual worlds.\nReal CEO, Digital Kitchen\nWhile the CEO viewers saw was all real, the environment around him morphed as he spoke to support the story he was telling.\nViewers saw Huang deliver a keynote that seemed to begin, like so many during the global COVID pandemic, in Huang\u2019s kitchen.\nThen, with a flourish, Huang\u2019s kitchen \u2014 modeled down to the screws holding its cabinets together \u2014 slid away from sight as Huang strolled toward a virtual recreation of Endeavor\u2019s gleaming lobby.\n\u201cOne of our goals is to find a way to elevate our keynote events,\u201d Margo says. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for those special moments when we can do something novel and fantastical, and that showcase NVIDIA\u2019s latest technological innovations.\u201d\nIt was the start of a visual journey that would take Huang from that lobby to Shannon\u2019s, a gathering spot inside Endeavor, through a holodeck, and a data center with stops inside a real robotics lab and the exterior of Endeavor.\nVirtual environments such as Huang\u2019s kitchen were created by a team using familiar tools supported by Omniverse such as Autodesk Maya and 3ds Max, and Adobe Substance Painter. \u00a0\nOmniverse served to connect them all in real-time \u2014 so each team member could see changes made by colleagues using different tools simultaneously, accelerating their work.\n\u201cThat was critical,\u201d Margo says.\nThe virtual and the real came together quickly once live filming began.\nA small on-site video team recorded Huang\u2019s speech in just four days, starting October 30, in a spare pair of conference rooms at NVIDIA\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters.\nOmniverse allowed NVIDIA\u2019s team to project the dynamic virtual environments their colleagues had created on a screen behind Huang.\nAs a result, the light spill onto Huang changed as the scene around him changed, better integrating him into the virtual environment.\nAnd as Huang moved through the scene, or as the camera shifted, the environment changed around Huang.\n\u201cAs the camera moves, the perspective and parallax of the world on the video wall responds accordingly,\u201d Mago says.\nAnd because Huang could see the environment projected on the screens around him, he was better able to navigate each scene.\nAt the Speed of Omniverse\nAll of this accelerated the work of NVIDIA\u2019s production team, which had most of what they needed in-camera after each shot rather than adding elaborate digital sets in post-production.\nAs a result, the video team quickly created a presentation seamlessly blending a real CEO with virtual and real-world settings.\nHowever, Omniverse was more than just a way to speed collaboration between creatives working with real and digital elements hustling to hit a deadline. It also served as the platform that knit the string of demos featured in the keynote together.\nTo help developers create intelligent, interactive agents with Omniverse that can see, speak, converse on a wide range of subjects and understand naturally spoken intent, Huang announced Omniverse Avatar.\nOmniverse brings together a deep stack of technologies \u2014 from ray-tracing to recommender systems \u2014 that were mixed and matched throughout the keynote to drive a series of stunning demos.\nIn a demo that swiftly made headlines, Huang showed how \u201cProject Tokkio\u201d for Omniverse Avatar connects Metropolis computer vision, Riva speech AI, avatar animation and graphics into a real-time conversational AI robot \u2014 the Toy Jensen Omniverse Avatar.\n\nThe conversation between three of NVIDIA\u2019s engineers and a tiny toy model of Huang was more than just a technological tour de force, demonstrating expert, natural Q&A.\nIt showed how photorealistic modeling of Toy Jensen and his environment \u2014 right down to the glint on Toy Jensen\u2019s glasses as he moved his head \u2014 and NVIDIA\u2019s Riva speech synthesis technology powered by the Megatron 530B large language model could support natural, fluid conversations.\nTo create the demo, NVIDIA\u2019s creative team created the digital model in Maya Substance, and Omniverse did the rest.\n\u201cNone of it was manual, you just load up the animation assets and talk to it,\u201d he said.\nHuang also showed a second demo of Project Tokkio, a customer-service avatar in a restaurant kiosk that was able to see, converse with and understand two customers.\nRather than relying on Megatron, however, this model relied on a model that integrated the restaurant\u2019s menu, allowing the avatar to smoothly guide customers through their options.\n\nThat same technology stack can help humans talk to one another, too. Huang showed Project Maxine\u2019s ability to add state-of-the-art video and audio features to virtual collaboration and video content creation applications.\n\nA demo showed a woman speaking English on a video call in a noisy cafe, but she can be heard clearly without background noise. As she speaks, her words are transcribed and translated in real-time into French, German and Spanish.\nThanks to Omniverse, they\u2019re spoken by an avatar able to engage in conversation with her same voice and intonation.\nThese demos were all possible because Omniverse, through Omniverse Avatar, unites advanced speed AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines, facial animation and graphics technologies.\nOmniverse Avatar\u2019s speech recognition is based on NVIDIA Riva, a software development kit that recognizes speech across multiple languages. Riva is also used to generate human-like speech responses using text-to-speech capabilities.\nOmniverse Avatar\u2019s natural language understanding is based on the Megatron 530B large language model that can recognize, understand and generate human language.\nMegatron 530B is a pretrained model that can, with little or no additional training, complete sentences, answers questions involving a large domain of subjects. It can summarize long, complex stories, translate to other languages, and handle many domains that it is not trained specifically to do.\nOmniverse Avatar\u2019s recommendation engine is provided by NVIDIA Merlin, a framework that allows businesses to build deep learning recommender systems capable of handling large amounts of data to make smarter suggestions.\nIts perception capabilities are enabled by NVIDIA Metropolis, a computer vision framework for video analytics.\nAnd its avatar animation is powered by NVIDIA Video2Face and Audio2Face, 2D and 3D AI-driven facial animation and rendering technologies.\nAll of these technologies are composed into an application and processed in real-time using the NVIDIA Unified Compute Framework.\nPackaged as scalable, customizable microservices, the skills can be securely deployed, managed and orchestrated across multiple locations by NVIDIA Fleet Command.\nUsing them, Huang was able to tell a sweeping story about how NVIDIA Omniverse is changing multitrillion-dollar industries.\nAll of these demos were built on Omniverse. And thanks to Omniverse, everything came together \u2014 a real CEO, real and virtual environments, and a string of demos made within Omniverse as well.\n\nSince its launch late last year, Omniverse has been downloaded over 70,000 times by designers at 500 companies. Omniverse Enterprise is now available starting at $9,000 a year.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning | Explainer | SoftwareTags: GTC 2021 | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Then, he blocks scenes in Omniverse, using simple shapes and meshes to fill the space before taking a first pass at lighting.\nAfter experimenting with a scene\u2019s different layers, Skiejka replaces his blocked prototypes with high-resolution assets \u2014 perfecting the lighting and tweaking material textures as final touches.\nWatch a stunning example of his creative process in this video, which was recognized in the NVIDIA Omniverse #CreateYourRetroverse contest:\n\nAccording to Skiejka, the main challenges he previously faced were long rendering times and slow software feedback when lighting and shading.\n\u201cNow, with NVIDIA RTX technology, render time is greatly decreased, and visual feedback occurs in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Omniverse Kit framework and the Omniverse Nucleus server are superb game-changers and perfect additions to my workflow.\u201d\nSkiejka\u2019s favorite feature of the platform, however, is the Omniverse Create scene composition application. He said it\u2019s \u201cpacked with valuable extensions, like PhysX and Flow,\u201d which he used while designing the retroverse scene above.\n\u201cI hope I showed the spirit of childhood in my #CreateYourRetroverse video, and that this artistic time tunnel between the past and present will inspire others to showcase their experiences, too,\u201d Skiejka said.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Art | Creators | GPU | Meet the Omnivore | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Whether it\u2019s an aerial search for someone off the side of a road, a quick look at a rooftop for hotspots or getting eyes above an active fire to track progress and plan resources, Sigma employs computer vision to send information directly to a tablet, with photogrammetry capabilities and real-time situational awareness.\nFotokite is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology assistance for startups working in AI, data science and high performance computing.\n\nFighting Fire With Data\nFirefighters depend on accurate, timely information to help them make important situational decisions.\nFotokite Sigma\u2019s thermal camera can determine where a fire is, as well as where the safest location to enter or exit a structure would be. It can highlight hotspots that need attention and guide firefighters on whether their water is hitting the right areas, even through heavy smoke or with limited visibility at night.\nOnce the fire is under control, Sigma can monitor the area for potential flare-ups, so firefighters can prioritize resources to act quickly and efficiently.\n\u201cEverything from autonomous flight and real-time data delivery to the user interface and real-time streaming is made as simple as pushing a button, which means first responders can focus on saving lives and keeping people safe,\u201d said Chris McCall, CEO of Fotokite.\nFire departments across the U.S. and Europe are using Fotokite Sigma, in both major cities and rural areas.\n\u201cThe next area of focus for us is increasing the situational awareness and decision-making power in an emergency situation,\u201d said McCall. \u201cUsing NVIDIA technology, we can easily introduce new capabilities to our systems.\u201d\nIn addition to rolling out availability of Sigma across more geographies, Fotokite is working with partners to deliver data in real time, something that might have previously taken several hours to accomplish.\nProviding a 3D render of an active emergency situation, tracking first responders, and supplying other intelligent data layers, for example, could be invaluable to first responders, helping them visualize a scene as it unfolds.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA partners Lockheed Martin and OroraTech are using accelerated computing technology to fight wildfires.\u00a0\u00a0\nLearn more about NVIDIA Inception and the NVIDIA Jetson platform.

From traditional banks to new fintechs, the financial services industry is powering use cases with AI such as preventing payments fraud, automating insurance claims, and accelerating trading strategies.\nThe latest episode in the I AM AI video series brings these technology stories to life by featuring global financial enterprises and startups transforming banking, insurance and payments.\n\nAutomating Insurance Claims and Document Processing\nPing An, China\u2019s largest property and casualty insurer, uses NVIDIA GPU-powered image analysis and AI to rapidly calculate damages caused by vehicle collisions, automate claims handling for simple and clean cases, estimate costs and identify fraudulent claims. This automated experience leads to better customer service, fewer cases of insurance fraud and more efficient delivery of services.\nCAPE Analytics, a computer vision startup, is transforming the property insurance industry by analyzing geospatial data to inform more accurate underwriting decisions and mitigate wildfire disasters. The NVIDIA Inception member uses AI to produce detailed data on the vegetation density, roof material and proximity to surrounding structures \u2014 more accurately calculating risk and helping homeowners take actions to reduce potential property damage.\nApplica, a fintech, deploys progressive AI to streamline text-based workflows that deliver better-than-human performance. Its robotic text automation platform uses NVIDIA GPUs for training machine learning models and inference in production. This eliminates up to 90 percent of manual errors, boosts document turnover rate to less than one second, and reduces physical workforce effort by up to 75 percent.\nBanks Adopt AI to Accelerate Model Training and Cut Costs\nBank of Montreal runs complex derivative models to find fair prices for financial contracts used in valuation and risk management. These AI-informed models \u2014 trained by Riskfuel, a Toronto-based startup and member of NVIDIA Inception, on 650 million data points and deployed for inference on NVIDIA A100 or T4 Tensor Core GPUs \u2014 can drive higher trade flows, generate new risk insights and lead to better product design and selection for Riskfuel\u2019s clients.\nCapital One uses Dask and RAPIDS, a suite of GPU-optimized libraries for accelerating data science and analytics pipelines, to achieve 100x improvement in model training times and reduce costs by nearly 98 percent. Its team of data scientists and machine learning engineers use accelerated and distributed data processing for financial and credit analysis.\nAI Virtual Assistants Improve the Customer Experience\nSquare, a global leader in payments, powers its virtual assistant, Square Assistant, using conversational AI to schedule appointments with new and returning customers. These AI models are trained using large hyperparameter jobs running on NVIDIA GPUs in AWS. Once they\u2019re trained and ready for deployment, Square found that inference jobs on large models such as RoBERTa run 10x faster on the AWS GPU service than on CPUs.\nIntuit uses conversational AI and intelligent AI assistants to empower financial futures for individuals, self-employed workers and small business owners. The company uses AI technologies, such as knowledge engineering, machine learning and natural language processing and understanding, to provide targeted and personalized assistance with virtual experts, automate financial documents processing, and even forecast cash flow for small businesses.\nFunding the Future of Financial Services with AI\nNVIDIA\u2019s full-stack accelerated computing platform enables banks, traders, payments providers, insurers and fintechs to deliver enhanced offerings that boost lifetime value for customers and reduce operational costs across their and their customers\u2019 businesses.\nExplore NVIDIA solutions for financial services and learn from more industry leaders, such as American Express and PayPal.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Financial Services \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For FirstEnergy, those assets include tens of millions of devices mounted on millions of poles across more than 269,000 miles of distribution lines.\nBucket Trucks Become Smart Cameras\nRicciuti said his startup aimed to turn every truck in a utility\u2019s fleet into a smart camera that takes pictures of every pole it passes. What\u2019s more, Noteworthy AI\u2019s software would provide the location of the pole, identify the gear on it and help analyze its condition.\n\u201cI saw right away that this could be a game changer, so I called him,\u201d said McCluskey.\nIn the U.S. alone, utilities own 185 million poles. They spend tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars a year trying to track the transformers, fuses and other devices on them, as well as the vegetation growing around them.\nUtilities typically send out workers each year to manually inspect a fraction of their distribution lines. It\u2019s an inventory that can take a decade, yet the condition of each device is critical to delivering power safely.\n5x More Images in 30 Days\nIn a pilot test last summer, Noteworthy AI showed how edge computing gets better results.\nIn 30 days, two FirstEnergy trucks, outfitted with the startup\u2019s smart cameras, collected more than 5,000 high-res images of its poles. That expanded the utility\u2019s database more than fivefold.\n\u201cPeople were astounded at what we could do in such a short time frame,\u201d said McClusky.\nWhat\u2019s more, the pictures were of higher quality than those in the utility\u2019s database. That would help eliminate wasted trips when actual line conditions vary from what engineers expect to find.\nThe startup\u2019s camera system can be mounted on a utility truck in less than an hour.\nUse Cases Multiply\nNews of the pilot program spread to other business units.\nA team that inspects FirstEnergy\u2019s 880,000 streetlights and another responsible for tracking vegetation growth around its lines wanted to try the technology. Both saw the value of having more and better data.\nSo, an expanded pilot is in the works with more trucks over a larger area.\nIt\u2019s too early to estimate the numbers, but McCluskey \u201cfelt right away we could find some significant cost savings with this technology \u2014 in a couple years I can imagine its use expanded to all our states,\u201d he said.\nAn Inside Look at Edge Computing\nIn a unit the size of a small cake box that attaches to a truck with magnets or suction cups, Noteworthy AI packs two cameras and communications gear. It links to a smaller unit inside the cab that processes the images and AI on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.\n\u201cWe developed a pretty sophisticated workflow that runs at the edge on Jetson,\u201d Ricciuti said.\nIt uses seven AI models. One model looks for poles in images taken at 30 frames/second. When it finds one, it triggers a higher res camera to take bursts of 60-megabyte pictures.\nOther models identify gear on the poles and determine which images to send to a database in the cloud.\nDesigning a fast, resilient camera was even more challenging than implementing AI, said Ricciuti.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing all this AI compute at the edge on Jetson, so we don\u2019t have to send all the images to the cloud \u2014 it\u2019s a huge cost savings,\u201d Ricciuti said.\n\u201cWith customer use cases growing, we\u2019ll graduate to products like Jetson AGX Orin in the future \u2014 NVIDIA has been awesome in computing at the edge,\u201d he added.\nSoftware, Support Speeds Startup\nThe startup uses NVIDIA TensorRT, code that keeps its AI models trim, so they run fast. It also employs the NVIDIA JetPack SDK with drivers and libraries for computer vision and deep learning as well as ROS, an operating system, now accelerated on Jetson.\nIn addition, Ricciuti ticks off three benefits from being part of NVIDIA Inception, a program designed to nurture cutting-edge startups.\n\u201cWhen we have engineering questions, we get introduced to technical people who unblock us; we meet potential customers when we\u2019re ready to go to market; and we get computer credits for GPUs in the cloud to train our models,\u201d he said.\nAI Spells Digital Transformation\nThe GPUs, software and support help Ricciuti do the work he loves: finding ways AI can transform legacy practices at large, regulated companies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg of what we can do as people are being forced to innovate in the face of problems like climate change, and we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from utilities with large distribution networks,\u201d he said.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA is accelerating innovation in the energy industry. And discover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Customer Stories | Energy | GPU Computing | Inception | Inference | Jetson | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Have you ever wondered how your system\u2019s latency may be affecting your accuracy, or what it feels like to play on high or low system latency?\nStarting today, for one week only, the NVIDIA System Latency Challenge powered by NVIDIA Reflex will give you the opportunity to find out just how good you can be. Just download Kovaak\u2019s, the world\u2019s best aim trainer by The Meta, and try out the NVIDIA System Latency Challenge.\u00a0 Not only will you get to experience the benefits of latency reduction, but you have the chance to walk away with one of many prizes, including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card.\nIn a special partnership with NVIDIA, KovaaK\u2019s has added several \u201csystem latency challenge\u201d modes and will be free to download from Steam December 14th to December 21st 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is System Latency?\nHave you ever played a game and its responsiveness didn\u2019t feel quite right? You\u2019re likely feeling high system latency. System latency is the delay between your mouse or keyboard actions and the resulting pixel changes on the display, say from a gun muzzle flash or character movement. The higher the system latency, the more delayed the player experiences will be in game.\nResponsiveness is key to precision.\nIf you were to play a first person shooter with high system latency, you may see an enemy in your crosshairs but when you click to fire it somehow misses. This would be an example of experiencing a delayed gamescape as the enemy has already moved locations in the midst of that delay. The lower your latency, the better your hitreg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA System Latency Challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a chance to win:\n\nPlay the NVIDIA System Latency Challenge in KovaaK\u2019s under NVIDIA Experiments\nPost a screenshot of your score from the leaderboard on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #FramesWinGames\n\nWinners will be chosen randomly so if you don\u2019t make your best score you are still in the hunt to win.\nFrom December 14th to December 21st 2021 players can compete in KovaaK\u2019s for free in different latency scenarios for leaderboard glory, as well as chances to win one of these:\n\n(9) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Graphics Cards\n(9) Logitech Pro X Superlight Mice\n(9) MSI Oculux NXG253R 360 Hz Gaming Monitors\n\n\nTAKE THE NVIDIA SYSTEM LATENCY CHALLENGE\n\nFind the full terms and conditions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex\nWant to improve your system\u2019s latency but don\u2019t know where to begin?

But last spring, the kitchen faded away to reveal a realistic digital replica \u2014 one that not only surprised viewers, but also showcased the powerful capabilities of the NVIDIA Omniverse virtual world simulation and collaboration platform.\nNow, audiences can get a closer look at all the scenes from the latest virtual kitchen in the Virtual Kitchen Tone Poem,\u00a0a cinematic homage to the elaborate, painstaking work that went into recreating every detail of the kitchen, from its glistening chrome water fixtures to its earthenware salt cellar.\nTo accomplish the feat, a team of highly skilled artists collaborated across multiple continents and time zones using Omniverse.\n\nIt\u2019s All in the Details\nThe virtual kitchen got its start during the video shoot for GTC in the fall of 2020, when an onsite crew captured high-resolution images of Huang\u2019s kitchen. The lead environment artist used this footage as the main reference to build a virtual set.\n\nThe creative team\u2019s project lead researched detailed references of everything in the kitchen, including the appliance models, oil tins, salt box brands, and even the screws within the cabinets.\n\nA team of eight NVIDIA artists and 10 freelance creators built the cinematic with an Omniverse workflow. In Omniverse, each artist worked within their preferred software, then used Omniverse Connectors to bring all the models and data together, leading to a much smoother animation pipeline and publishing workflow.\nFor the scene, there were 57 unique 3D assets and 6,240 total objects that were modeled in Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya and Pixologic Zbrush. The artists used Adobe Substance Painter and Photoshop for texturing, and the rigging and animation was done in Maya. The team used Nuke for scene composition, while the editing was done with DaVinci Resolve.\nOmniverse was where everything converged for lighting and rendering. Omniverse Nucleus acted as the universal exchange and collaboration hub for all the USD-based assets, which helped it all come together. Nucleus facilitated remote access, smart local caching and built-in versioning.\n\nProducing the Virtual Kitchen Tone Poem was also an opportunity to further develop Omniverse Farm \u2014 a newly released systems layer that connects multiple computer systems to jointly execute batch operations \u2014 and Shot Manager extensions across multiple teams.\nWith Omniverse Farm, a team of artists can iterate on rendering in an organized, repeatable fashion, bringing flexibility and structure to the rendering process \u2014 similar to what animation and visual effects studios would expect.\nOmniverse Farm enabled the team to easily batch render 40,000 frames for GTC totaling four terabytes of content, rendered across disparate workstations, on-premises data centers, and cloud servers with a peak of 1,200 GPUs running simultaneously. With the ability to easily contribute a workstation or new server to Farm, the teams could scale to meet their needs.\nVisualizing the Future of VFX and Animation\nThe Virtual Kitchen Tone Poem showcases how it\u2019s possible to have a workflow that\u2019s iterative, scalable and streamlined under short deadlines. These are some of the biggest requirements for artists working in animation and VFX production studios.\nOmniverse provided all the tools that enabled the creative team to efficiently render high-quality content for the latest GTC keynote, which shifted across virtual environments, including Huang\u2019s kitchen, a data center, and NVIDIA\u2019s campus in Silicon Valley. NVIDIA technology provided a new level of collaboration for people across the globe that wasn\u2019t available before.\nNVIDIA technology also allowed for a non-destructive workflow, which was crucial to a project of this nature and scale, as it helped the team streamline remote and cross-platform collaboration.\nThe Tone Poem showcases the potential of Omniverse, and how animation and VFX studios can use the platform to enhance workflows, including for production-style projects.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse for professional media & entertainment teams and individual creators.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Creators | GTC 2021 | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Rendering | Simulation and Design | Virtual Reality | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For over 20 years, the company has worked to provide its customers with deep learning-based insights to optimize their manufacturing processes.\nThe vision AI platform, called Spyglass Visual Inspection, or SVI, helps manufacturers detect the defects they couldn\u2019t see before. It\u2019s built on the NVIDIA Metropolis intelligent video analytics framework and powered by NVIDIA GPUs.\nSVI is installed in factories and used by customers like Sage Automotive Interiors to enhance their defect detection in cases where traditional, rules-based machine vision systems often pinpoint false positives.\nReducing Waste with AI\nAccording to David Dewhirst, vice president of marketing at Mariner, up to 40 percent of annual revenue for automotive manufacturers is consumed by producing defective products.\nTraditional machine vision systems installed in factories have difficulty discerning between true defects \u2014 like a stain in fabric or a chip in glass \u2014 and false positives, like lint or a water droplet that can be easily wiped away.\nSVI, however, uses AI software and NVIDIA hardware connected to camera systems that provide real-time inspection of pieces on production lines, identify potential issues and determine whether they are true material defects \u2014 in just a millisecond.\nThis speeds up factory lines, removing the need to slow or stop the workflow to have a person inspect each potential defect. SVI results in a 20 percent increase in line speed and 30x reduction of incorrect defect classification over traditional machine vision systems.\nThe platform can be integrated with a factory\u2019s existing machine vision system, giving it a boost with AI-based analysis and processing. It offers a factory an average annual savings of $2 million, Dewhirst said.\nSVI uses a deep learning model that analyzes images, identifies a defect, and then labels the defects by type \u2014 which are all tasks that require powerful graphics processors.\n\u201cNVIDIA GPUs guarantee that SVI can handle almost any pixel combination and processing speed, which is why it was our choice of hardware on which to standardize our platform,\u201d Dewhirst said.\nMariner is on track to revolutionize the defect detection process by expanding the use of its platform, which can identify defects in metal, plastic or virtually any other surface type.\nLearn more about how the Spyglass system works:\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Computer Vision | Customer Stories | GPU | Industrial and Manufacturing | Metropolis \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It reached more than 5 million 4KB IOPS and from 7 million to over 20 million 512B IOPS for NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF), a common method of accessing storage media, with TCP networking, one of the primary internet protocols.\nTo accelerate AI, big data and high performance computing applications, BlueField provides even higher storage performance using the popular RoCE network transport option.\nIn testing, BlueField supercharged performance as both an initiator and target, using different types of storage software libraries and different workloads to simulate real-world storage configurations. BlueField also supports fast storage connectivity over InfiniBand, the preferred networking architecture for many HPC and AI applications.\nTesting Methodology\nThe 41.5 million IOPS reached by BlueField is more than 4x the previous world record of 10 million IOPS, set using proprietary storage offerings. This performance was achieved by connecting two fast Hewlett Packard Enterprise Proliant DL380 Gen 10 Plus servers, one as the application server (storage initiator) and one as the storage system (storage target).\nEach server had two Intel \u201cIce Lake\u201d Xeon Platinum 8380 CPUs clocked at 2.3GHz, giving 160 hyperthreaded cores per server, along with 512GB of DRAM, 120MB of L3 cache (60MB per socket) and a PCIe Gen4 bus.\nTo accelerate networking and NVMe-oF, each server was configured with two NVIDIA BlueField-2 P-series DPU cards, each with two 100Gb Ethernet network ports, resulting in four network ports and 400Gb/s wire bandwidth between initiator and target, connected back-to-back using NVIDIA LinkX 100GbE Direct-Attach Copper (DAC) passive cables. Both servers had Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 8.3.\nFor the storage system software, both SPDK and the standard upstream Linux kernel target were tested using both the default kernel 4.18 and one of the newest kernels, 5.15. Three different storage initiators were benchmarked: SPDK, the standard kernel storage initiator, and the FIO plugin for SPDK. Workload generation and measurements were run with FIO and SPDK. I/O sizes were tested using 4KB and 512B, which are common medium and small storage I/O sizes, respectively.\nThe NVMe-oF storage protocol was tested with both TCP and RoCE at the network transport layer. Each configuration was tested with 100 percent read, 100 percent write and 50/50 read/write workloads with full bidirectional network utilization.\nOur testing also revealed the following performance characteristics of the BlueField DPU:\n\nTesting with smaller 512B I/O sizes resulted in higher IOPS but lower-than-line-rate throughput, while 4KB I/O sizes resulted in higher throughput but lower IOPS numbers.\n100 percent read and 100 percent write workloads provided similar IOPS and throughput, while 50/50 mixed read/write workloads produced higher performance by using both directions of the network connection simultaneously.\nUsing SPDK resulted in higher performance than kernel-space software, but at the cost of higher server CPU utilization, which is expected behavior, since SPDK runs in user space with constant polling.\nThe newer Linux 5.15 kernel performed better than the 4.18 kernel due to storage improvements added regularly by the Linux community.\n\nRecord-Setting DPU Storage Performance Enables Storage Performance With Security\nIn today\u2019s storage landscape, the vast majority of cloud and enterprise deployments require fast, distributed and networked flash storage, accessed over Ethernet or InfiniBand. Faster servers, GPUs, networks and storage media all tax server CPUs to keep up, and the best way to do so is to deploy storage-capable DPUs.\nThe incredible storage performance demonstrated by the BlueField-2 DPU enables higher performance and better efficiency across the data center for both application servers and storage appliances.\nOn top of fast storage access, BlueField also supports hardware-accelerated encryption and decryption of both Ethernet storage traffic and the storage media itself, helping protect against data theft or exfiltration.\nIt offloads IPsec at up to 100Gb/s (data on the wire) and 256-bit AES-XTS at up to 200Gb/s (data at rest), reducing the risk of data theft if an adversary has tapped the storage network or if the physical storage drives are stolen or sold or disposed of improperly.\nCustomers and leading security software vendors are using BlueField\u2019s recently updated NVIDIA DOCA framework to run cybersecurity applications \u2013 such as a distributed firewall or security groups with micro-segmentation \u2013 on the DPU to further improve application and network security for compute servers, which reduces the risk of inappropriate access or data modifications on the storage attached to those servers.\nView more detailed results from the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU tests:\nNVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU tests using NMe-oF on TCP.

See workers ratcheting down nuts to bolts. Hear the whirring of air tools. Watch pristine car bodies gliding along the line and robots rolling up with parts.\nNow, fire up its digital twin in 3D online. See animated digital humans at work in the exact same, but digital version of the plant. Drag and drop in robots to move heavy materials, and run simulations for optimizations, taking in real-time factory floor data for improvements. That\u2019s a digital twin.\nA digital twin is a virtual representation \u2014 a true-to-reality simulation of physics and materials \u2014 of a real-world physical asset or system, which is continuously updated.\nDigital twins aren\u2019t just for inanimate objects and people. They can be a virtual representation of computer networking architecture used as a sandbox for cyberattack simulations. They can replicate a fulfillment center process to test out human-robot interactions before activating certain robot functions in live environments. The applications are as wide as the imagination.\n\nDigital twins are shaking up operations of businesses. The worldwide market for digital twin platforms is forecast to reach $86 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. Its report cites COVID-19 as a catalyst for the adoption of digital twins in specific industries.\nWhat\u2019s Driving Digital Twins?\u00a0\nThe Internet of Things is revving up digital twins.\nIoT is helping to enable connected machines and devices to share data with their digital twins and vice versa. That\u2019s because digital twins are always on and up-to-date computer-simulated versions of real-world IoT-connected physical things or processes they represent.\nDigital twins are virtual representations that can capture the physics of structures and changing conditions internally and externally, as measured by myriad connected sensors driven by edge computing. They can also run simulations within the virtualizations to test for problems and seek improvements through service updates.\nRobotics development and autonomous vehicles are just a couple of the growing number of examples used in digital twins to mimic physical equipment and environments.\n\u201cAutonomous vehicles at a very simple level are robots that operate in the open world, striving to avoid contact with anything,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and Simulation Technology at NVIDIA. \u201cEventually we\u2019ll have sophisticated autonomous robots working alongside humans in settings like kitchens \u2014 manipulating knives and other dangerous tools. We need digital twins of the worlds they are going to be operating in, so we can teach them safely in the virtual world before transferring their intelligence into the real world.\u201d\nDigital Twins in 3D Virtual Environments\u00a0\u00a0\nShared virtual 3D worlds are bringing people together to collaborate on digital twins.\n\nThe interactive 3D virtual universe is evident in gaming. Online social games such as Fortnite and the user-generated virtual world of Roblox offer a glimpse of the potential of interactions.\nVideo conferencing calls in VR, with participants existing as avatars of themselves in a shared virtual conference room, are a step toward realizing the possibilities for the enterprise.\nToday the tools exist to develop each of these shared virtual worlds in a shared virtual collaboration platform within this environment.\nOmniverse Replicator for Digital Twin Simulations\nAt GTC, NVIDIA unveiled Omniverse Replicator to help develop digital twins. It\u2019s a\u00a0 synthetic-data-generation engine that produces physically simulated data for training deep neural networks.\nAlong with this, the company introduced two implementations of the engine for applications that generate synthetic data: NVIDIA DRIVE Sim, a virtual world for hosting the digital twin of autonomous vehicles, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a virtual world for the digital twin of manipulation robots.\nAutonomous vehicles and robots developed using this data can master skills across an array of virtual environments before applying them in the real world.\n\nBased on Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description and NVIDIA RTX technology, NVIDIA Omniverse is the world\u2019s first scalable, multi-GPU physically accurate world simulation platform.\nOmniverse offers users the ability to connect to multiple software ecosystems \u2014 including Epic Games Unreal Engine, Reallusion, OnShape, Blender and Adobe \u2014 that can assist millions of users.\nThe reference development platform is modular and can be extended easily. Teams across NVIDIA have enlisted the platform to build core simulation apps such as the previously mentioned NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robotics and synthetic data generation, and NVIDIA DRIVE Sim.\nDRIVE Sim enables recreating real-world driving scenarios in a virtual environment to enable testing and development of rare and dangerous use cases.\u00a0 In addition, because the simulator has a perfect understanding of the ground-truth in any scene, the data from the simulator can be used for training the deep neural networks used in autonomous vehicle perception.\nAs shown in BMW Group\u2019s factory of the future, Omniverse\u2019s modularity and openness allows it to utilize several other NVIDIA platforms such as the NVIDIA Isaac platform for robotics, NVIDIA Metropolis for intelligent video analytics, and the NVIDIA Aerial software development kit, which brings GPU-accelerated, software-defined 5G wireless radio access networks to environments as well as third-party software for users and companies to continue to use their own tools.\nHow Are Digital Twins Coming Online?\nWhen building a digital twin and deploying its features, corralling AI resources is necessary.\nNVIDIA Base Command Platform enables enterprises to deploy large-scale AI infrastructure. It optimizes resources for users and teams, and it can monitor the workflow from early development to production.\nBase Command was developed to help support NVIDIA\u2019s in-house research team with AI resources. It helps manage the available GPU resources, select databases, workspaces and container images available.\nIt manages the lifecycle of AI development, including workload management and resource sharing, providing both a graphical user interface and a command line interface, and integrated monitoring and reporting dashboards. It delivers the latest NVIDIA updates directly into your AI workflows.\nThink of it as the compute engine of AI.\nHow Are Digital Twins Managed?\nNVIDIA Fleet Command provides remote AI management.\nImplementing AI from digital twins into the real world requires a deployment platform to handle the updates to the thousands, or even millions, of machines and devices of the edge.\nNVIDIA Fleet Command is a cloud-based service accessible from the NVIDIA NGC hub of GPU-accelerated software to securely deploy, manage and scale AI applications across edge-connected systems and devices.\nFleet Command enables fulfillment centers, manufacturing facilities, retailers and many others to remotely implement AI updates.\nHow Are Digital Twins Advancing?\nDigital twins enable the autonomy of things. They can be used to control a physical counterpart autonomously.\nAn electric vehicle maker, for example, might use a digital twin of a sedan to run simulations on software updates. And when the simulations show improvements to the car\u2019s performance or solve a problem, those software updates can be dispatched over the air to the physical vehicle.\n\nSiemens Energy is creating digital twins to support predictive maintenance of power plants. A digital twin of this scale promises to reduce downtime and help save utility providers an estimated $1.7 billion a year, according to the company.\nPassive Logic, a startup based in Salt Lake City, offers an AI platform to engineer and autonomously operate the IoT components of buildings. Its AI engine understands how building components work together, down to the physics, and can run simulations of building systems.\nThe platform can take in multiple data points and make control decisions to optimize operations autonomously. It compares this optimal control path to actual sensor data, applies machine learning and learns improvements about operating the building over time.\nTrains are on a fast track to autonomy as well, and digital twins are being developed to help get there. They\u2019re being used in simulations for features such as automated braking and collision detection systems, enabled by AI run on NVIDIA GPUs.\nWhat Is the History of Digital Twins?\nBy many accounts, NASA was the first to introduce the notion of the digital twin. While clearly not connected in the Internet of Things way, NASA\u2019s early twin concept and its usage share many similarities with today\u2019s digital twins.\n\nNASA began with the digital twin idea as early as the 1960s. The space agency illustrated its enormous potential in the Apollo 13 moon mission. NASA had set up simulators of systems on the Apollo 13 spacecraft, which could get updates from the real ship in outer space via telecommunications. This allowed NASA engineers to run situation simulations between astronauts and engineers ahead of departure, and it came in handy when things went awry on that mission in 1970.\nEngineers on the ground were able to troubleshoot with the astronauts in space, referring to the models on Earth and saving the mission from disaster.\nWhat Types of Digital Twins Are There?\nSmart Cities Sims\nSmart cities are popping up everywhere. Using video cameras, edge computing and AI, cities are able to understand everything from parking to traffic flow to crime patterns. Urban planners can study the data to help draw up and improve city designs.\n\nDigital twins of smart cities can enable better planning of construction as well as constant improvements in municipalities. Smart cities are building 3D replicas of themselves to run simulations. These digital twins help optimize traffic flow, parking, street lighting and many other aspects to make life better in cities, and these improvements can be implemented in the real world.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes has helped build digital twins around the world. In Hong Kong, the company presented examples for a walkability study, using a 3D simulation of the city for visualization.\nNVIDIA Metropolis is an application framework, a set of developer tools and a large ecosystem of specialist partners that help developers and service providers better instrument physical space and build smarter infrastructure and spaces through AI-enabled vision. The platform spans AI training to inference, facilitating edge-to-cloud deployment, and it includes enterprise management tools like Fleet Command to better manage fleets of edge nodes.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nEarth Simulation Twins\u00a0\nDigital twins are even being applied to climate modeling.\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang disclosed plans to build the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting climate change.\nNamed Earth-2, or E-2, the system would create a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse.\nSeparately, the European Union has launched Destination Earth, an effort to build a digital simulation of the planet. The plan is to help scientists accurately map climate development as well as extreme weather.\nSupporting an EU mandate for achieving climate neutrality by 2050, the digital twin effort would be rendered at one-kilometer scale and based on continuously updated observational data from climate, atmospheric and meteorological sensors. It also plans to take into account measurements of the environmental impacts of human activities.\nIt is predicted that the Destination Earth digital twin project would require a system with 20,000 GPUs to operate at full scale, according to a paper published in Nature Computational Science. Simulation insights can enable scientists to develop and test scenarios. This can help inform policy decisions and sustainable development planning.\nSuch work can help assess drought risk, monitor rising sea levels and track changes in the polar regions. It can also be used for planning on food and water issues, and renewable energy such as wind farms and solar plants. The goal is for the main digital modeling platform to be operating by 2023, with the digital twin live by 2027.\nData Center Networking Simulation\nNetworking is an area where digital twins are reducing downtime for data centers.\nOver time, networks have become more complicated. The scale of networks, the number of nodes and the interoperability between components add to their complexity, affecting preproduction and staging operations.\nNetwork digital twins speed up initial deployments by pretesting routing, security, automation and monitoring in simulation. They also enhance ongoing operations, including validating network change requests in simulation, which reduces maintenance times.\nNetworking operations have also evolved to more advanced capabilities with the use of APIs and automation. And streaming telemetry \u2014 think IoT-connected sensors for devices and machines \u2014 allows for constant collection of data and analytics on the network for visibility into problems and issues.\nThe NVIDIA Air infrastructure simulation platform enables network engineers to host digital twins of data center networks.\n\u00a0\n\nRolling Out 5G With Twins\nEricsson, a provider of telecommunications equipment and services, is combining decades of radio network simulation expertise with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\nThe global company is building city-scale digital twins to help accurately simulate the interplay between 5G micro cells and towers and their environment to maximize performance and coverage.\nAutomotive Manufacturing Twins\nBMW Group, which has 31 factories around the world, is collaborating with NVIDIA on digital twins. The German automaker is relying on NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise to run factory simulations to optimize its operations.\n\nIts factories provide more than 100 options for each car, and more than 40 BMW models, offering 2,100 possible configurations of a new vehicle. Some 99 percent of the vehicles produced in BMW factories are custom configurations, which creates challenges for keeping materials stocked on the assembly line.\nTo help maintain the flow of materials for its factories, BMW Group is also harnessing the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform to deploy a fleet of robots for logistics to improve the distribution of materials in its production environment. These human-assisting robots, which are put into simulation scenarios with digital humans in pre-production, enable the company to safely test out robot applications on the factory floor of the digital twin before launching into production.\n\u00a0\n\nVirtual simulations also enable the company to optimize the assembly line as well as worker\u00a0 ergonomics and safety. Planning experts from different regions can connect virtually with NVIDIA Omniverse, which lets global 3D design teams work together simultaneously across multiple software suites in a shared virtual space.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise is enabling digital twins for many different industrial applications.\nArchitecture, Engineering and Construction\nBuilding design teams face a growing demand for efficient collaboration, faster iteration on renderings, and expectations for accurate simulation and photorealism.\nThese demands can become even more challenging when teams are dispersed worldwide.\nCreating digital twins in Omniverse for architects, engineers and construction teams to assess designs together can quicken the pace of development, helping contracts run on time.\nTeams on Omniverse can be brought together virtually in a single, interactive platform \u2014 even when simultaneously working in different software applications \u2014 to rapidly develop architectural models as if they are in the same room and simulate with full physical accuracy and fidelity.\nRetail and Fulfillment\nLogistics for order fulfillment is a massive industry of moving parts. Fulfillment centers now are aided by robots to help workers avoid injury and boost their efficiency. It\u2019s an environment filled with cameras driven by AI and edge computing to help rapidly pick, pull and pack products. It\u2019s how one-day deliveries arrive at our doors.\nThe use of digital twins means that much of this can be created in a virtual environment, and simulations can be run to eliminate bottlenecks and other problems.\nKinetic Vision is reinventing intelligent fulfillment and distribution centers with digital twins through digitization and AI. Successfully implementing a network of intelligent stores and fulfillment centers needs robust information, data, and operational technologies to enable innovative edge computing and AI solutions like real-time product recognition. This drives faster, more agile product inspections and order fulfillments.\n\n\u00a0\nEnergy Industry Twins\u00a0\nSiemens Energy is relying on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to create digital twins to support predictive maintenance of power plants.\nUsing NVIDIA Modulus software frameworks, running on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, Siemens Energy can simulate the corrosive effects of heat, water and other conditions on metal over time to fine-tune maintenance needs.\n\nHydrocarbon Exploration\u00a0\nOil companies face huge risks in seeking to tap new reservoirs or reassess production stage fields with the least financial and environmental downside. Drilling can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. After locating hydrocarbons, these energy companies need to quickly figure out the most profitable strategies for new or ongoing production\nDigital twins for reservoir simulations can save many millions of dollars and avoid environmental problems. Using technical software applications, these companies can model how water and hydrocarbons flow under the ground amid wells. This allows them to evaluate potentially problematic situations and virtual production strategies on supercomputers.\nHaving assessed the risks beforehand, in the digital twins, these exploration companies can minimize losses when committing to new projects. Real-world versions in production can also be optimized for better output based on analytics from their digital doppelganger.\nAirport Efficiencies\nDigital twins can enable airports to improve customer experiences. For instance, video cameras could monitor the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, and apply AI to look for ways to analyze bottlenecks at peak hours. Those could be addressed in digital models, and then moved into production to reduce missed flights. Baggage handling video can be assessed to improve ways in the digital environment to ensure luggage arrives on time.\n\u00a0\n\nAirplane turnarounds can benefit, too. Many vendors service arriving planes to get them turned around and back on the runway for departures. Video can help airlines track these vendors to ensure timely turnarounds. Digital twins can also analyze the services coordination to optimize workflows before changing things up.\nAirlines can then hold their vendors accountable to quickly carrying out services. Caterers, cleaners, refueling, trash and waste removal and other service providers all have what\u2019s known as service-level agreements with airlines to help keep the planes running on time. All of these activities can be run in simulations in the digital world and then applied to scheduling in production for real-world results to help reduce departure delays.\nNVIDIA Metropolis helps to process massive amounts of video from the edge so that airports and other industries can analyze operations in real time and derive insights from analytics.\nWhat\u2019s the Future for Digital Twins?\nDigital twin simulations have been simmering for half a century. But the past decade\u2019s advances in GPUs, AI and software platforms are heating up their adoption amid this higher-fidelity era of more immersive experiences.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nIncreasing penetration of virtual reality and augmented reality will accelerate this work.\nWorldwide sales of VR headsets are expected to increase from roughly 7 million in 2021 to more than 28 million in 2025, according to analyst firm IDC.\nThat\u2019s a lot more headset-connected, content-consuming eyeballs for virtual environments.\nAnd all those in it will be able to access the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for AI, human and robot interactions, and infinite simulations, driving a wild ride of advances from digital twins.\n\u201cThere has been talk of virtual worlds and digital twins for years. We\u2019re right at the beginning of this transition into reality, much as AI became viable and created an explosion of possibilities,\u201d said NVIDIA\u2019s Lebaredian.\nBuckle up for the adventure.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse.\nDive deeper into digital twins on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Explainer | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Digital Twin | Energy | GPU | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Transportation | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Skip the sign-in process and stream your favorite Ubisoft games this week.\nThe update also includes a fix for streaming at the correct aspect ratio on the Apple MacBook Pro M1 Max, as well as improvements to the countdown timer when viewed on the in-game overlay.\nPC Gaming on a Mac? Here\u2019s How It Works\nIt used to be a difficult choice: do you want to be a Mac user or a PC gamer? With GeForce NOW, you can have your Mac and PC game, too.\nGeForce NOW transforms nearly any Mac into a high-end gaming rig, thanks to the power of the cloud. NVIDIA data centers do the heavy lifting, rendering games at full quality and streaming them down to Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, iMac and iOS. Get all the benefits of PC gaming, without leaving the Apple ecosystem.\nFor the full RTX 3080 experience, connect your Macbook or other laptop via Displayport to a gaming monitor. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\nOn GeForce NOW, you play the real PC versions of your games, without having to worry if something has been ported to Mac. Software compatibility for the new M1 Mac isn\u2019t a problem either, since the native PC version of games streams straight from the cloud.\nGeForce NOW also handles game saves for supported games, so members can play on their Macs, as well as any other supported device, without losing progress.\nThat means the next time your squad readies up in Apex Legends, you can join the fray from your iMac. Jealous of your friends building their ultimate Viking community in Valheim? With GeForce NOW, you can join them without leaving your Mac. Build your gaming library with weekly free games from the Epic Games Store, with offers like Dead By Daylight.\nPlus, GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members can now play at native resolution on their M1 Macbook Air or Macbook Pro, at glorious 1600p. Stream with even longer sessions lengths \u2014 up to eight hours. And with RTX ON for both RTX 3080 and Priority members, experience games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Control with real-time ray tracing, without upgrading to a PC.\nPlaying PC games with GeForce NOW on a Mac is like having your cake and eating it, too.\nYes, Your Mac Can Run Crysis Now\nCan it run Crysis Remastered? Yep. Get the game for free with a six-month Priority sign-up or GeForce NOW RTX 3080 order.\nReady for the ultimate battle on your Mac? For a limited time, get a copy of Crysis Remastered free with select GeForce NOW memberships. Purchase a six-month Priority membership, or the new GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership, and get a free redeemable code for Crysis Remastered on the Epic Games Store. Terms and conditions apply.\nDo Pass Go. Do Collect New Games.\nRediscover the Monopoly game you love, in a way you\u2019ve never seen before, in Monopoly Madness.\nGFN Thursday always means new games coming to the cloud. Six titles are being added to the GeForce NOW library this week, including two day-and-date releases:\n\nA-Train: All Aboard! Tourism (new game launch on Steam, December 7)\nWhite Shadows (new game launch on Steam, December 7)\nMonopoly Madness (new game launch on Ubisoft Connect, December 9)\nAnno 1404 History Edition (free on Ubisoft Connect, December 6-14)\nPrison Architect (free on Epic Games Store, December 9-16)\nSuper Magbot (Steam)\nUntitled Goose Game (Epic Games Store)\n\nWe make every effort to launch games on GeForce NOW as close to their release as possible, but, in some instances, games may not be available immediately.\nAlso, we had hoped to add both Syberia: The World Before in December. However, these games have shifted their release dates to next year and will be coming to the cloud in the future.\nFinally, in case you missed it \u2013 Fortnite flipped. Explore new locations, take on enemies with new weapons, and discover what\u2019s new on the Island in Fortnite Chapter 3 \u2013 streaming now!\nFor the members who have experienced the magic of PC gaming on a Mac, we\u2019ve got a question for you. Tell us on Twitter or down below in the comments.\n\ndescribe how it felt to play a PC game on a Mac for the first time using \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude42\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude68\n\u2014 \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f NVIDIA GeForce NOW (@NVIDIAGFN) December 8, 2021\n\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Singapore takes the top spot for artificial intelligence (AI) readiness in Asia Pacific, according to the most recent Asia Pacific AI Readiness Index by customer relationship management (CRM) solutions provider Salesforce.  The city-state was ranked first in terms of how ready its government, businesses and consumers are to adopt AI technologies, ahead of 10 other markets in the region. It rated most highly in government readiness, scoring 81.5 points, followed by Australia (74.2) and Japan (71.6). Its strong commitment, robust policy and regulatory framework for AI put it in an ideal position to maximise the impact of AI on its economy. As for business readiness, Singapore scored 49.7 points, followed closely by Japan (48.4) and India (47.3). Indicators measured include digital adoption by businesses, business sophistication as well as knowledge and creative outputs. Companies in financial services, healthcare, tourism, and transport and logistics sectors in Singapore were found to be well-equipped to adopt AI. Consumers in Singapore were also found to be more aware, have a better understanding, and are more keen to adopt AI products and services than their peers. As such, Singapore scored 65.9 points, ahead of Thailand (63.9) and Hong Kong (63.1), in terms of consumer readiness for AI.  AI is expected to contribute approximately US$15.7 trillion to the world\u2019s GDP by 2030, a US$2 trillion increase from 2019. In Singapore, the AI market is projected to reach US$960 million in 2022, and US$16 billion by 2030. \u201cIn Singapore, whole-of-government strategies are guiding the development of AI ecosystems, and the use of AI is becoming ubiquitous,\u201d says Sassoon Grigorian, senior director of Government Affairs & Public Policy, APAC and Japan, Salesforce. He continues: \u201cThe report recommends a number of measures to boost economies\u2019 effective use of AI. These include having a national AI strategy backed by robust principles; growing AI ecosystems and investing in talent; ensuring trust, as well as applying AI for social good.\u201d Yeong Zee Kin, assistant chief executive, Data Innovation and Protection of Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), and deputy commissioner of the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) in Singapore, says: \u201cAmidst an upward trend in AI-enabled products and services\u2026trustworthy AI needs to also transit from principles to practice. The development of standards for trustworthy AI will sustain a progressive environment for the benefit of consumers.\u201d   Story continues \u201cThe report mentions that international cooperation on AI frameworks, principles, and standards is growing. Singapore will continue to actively support the adoption of AI while balancing both innovation and public trust through a multi-stakeholder approach,\" he adds.Photo: UnsplashSee Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in Singapore iBuying algorithms and the end of home flipping What companies can do to prepare for AI regulations  NTU Singapore and AMD to jointly groom more data science and AI talents Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the World Get in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trends Follow the market issue situation with our daily updates Or want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

However, the stock came under pressure in the last few days over bad news surrounding its pending acquisition of leading chip designer Arm Holdings from Softbank Group.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nSo what\nNvidia's revenue growth has remained consistently high through the pandemic. In the most recent quarter, the company posted a top-line rate of 50% year over year,\u00a0which is on par with its year-ago growth rate of 57%.\u00a0\nCEO Jensen Huang said, \"Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies.\"\u00a0\nDuring the recent GTC 2021 presentation, Nvidia unveiled Omniverse Avatar,\u00a0a platform for creating interactive avatars for 3D virtual worlds powered by artificial intelligence. In these metaverse worlds, personal avatars will be a huge market that could fuel billions in revenue from sales of virtual clothing, shoes, and luxury goods that are licensed from consumer brands.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Omniverse, Nvidia is positioning itself to be the engine that powers the physical movements and graphics fidelity behind those digital caricatures, which could become prevalent one day on Meta Platforms' Facebook or Roblox, among other social media and gaming platforms.\nNow what\nNvidia previously estimated its long-term addressable market at $100 billion, but that was primarily the estimate of the data-center market.\u00a0Software presents another level of growth potential that could stretch into the billions over the next five years.\u00a0\nThe adoption of Nvidia's software solutions should pad profits, which is one reason contributing to the stock's performance recently.\nHowever, investors shouldn't get too exuberant. The stock already trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 70 at the time of writing, and it came under pressure just recently over news that the Federal Trade Commission was filing a lawsuit to block Nvidia's pending deal to acquire Arm. The acquisition was a big growth catalyst, although some analysts have been skeptical about the deal surviving the regulatory approval process.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has a bright future, but investors should be prepared for volatility in the share price, as investors weigh the near-term probabilities of the Arm deal going through, along with the long-term opportunities in software.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Right now, according to DigiTimes, this is more of a threat to companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Skyworks Solutions, rather than Nvidia per se. It does, however, play into a broader trend of Apple bringing the design of ever more kinds of chips in-house. In the long term, that could be bad for Nvidia if it shrinks the market for graphics chips in general.\nAnd now comes a new threat.\u00a0As TechRadar reported this morning, Intel (INTC 0.84%) is moving to fight back against Nvidia's growing dominance of the chip sector, setting aside $2.4 billion in cash and stock grants with which to raise employee salaries in 2022. Across Intel's 110,000-person payroll, that works out to an average of $21,000 per person in pay boosts, TechRadar said. But the money will be targeted toward Intel's best-performing employees, in an effort, as Intel said, to \"win the fierce battle for talent in today's competitive market, while strengthening our execution.\"\nNow what\nNvidia investors seem a little spooked by Intel's move. But according to TechRadar, the bulk of the pay raises being contemplated will come in the form of stock grants. And with Intel stock up only 9% over the past year, and Nvidia stock up more than 108% -- despite recent weakness -- I suspect rational high-tech workers looking for the best chance of profiting from stock options will still gravitate to Nvidia, and shy away from Intel.\n\n\n\nRich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns and recommends Apple, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The Motley Fool recommends Broadcom Ltd and Skyworks Solutions and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel, long March 2023 $120 calls on Apple, short January 2023 $57.50 puts on Intel, and short March 2023 $130 calls on Apple.

But what's most interesting to me is that, in wrapping up his remarks on Nvidia, Meeks managed to keep a straight face while explaining that \"Nvidia stock [isn't] particularly expensive right now,\" simply because it \"had been more expensive\" a month ago.\nGranted, it's true that Nvidia shares today cost 11% less than when they were at their recent high in November. But even so, the fact that this analyst could assert that a stock selling for 93 times trailing earnings is cheap -- and that his interviewer on CNBC accepted the statement without batting an eye -- tells me that irrational exuberance about Nvidia stock is still alive and well. In the near term, that's probably \"bullish\" for Nvidia's stock price, which may continue to rally so long as investors believe a near-triple-digit P/E can be cheap.\nIt's the long term I worry about, because it sure looks to me like Nvidia is priced for perfection -- and no stock is perfect, not even Nvidia.\n\n\n\nRich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

I am passionate about pensions, recessions, IRAs and retirement.Follow AuthorDec 08, 2021, 12:09pm ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.With tax law changes on the horizon, it's time to maximize year-end giving strategies to offset ... [+] capital gains.getty\nTo say 2021 has been an interesting year in the market is an understatement. The Total Return on the S&P 500 for 2021 through 11/26/21 has been over 25%. Some stocks, like Moderna (MRNA), Ford (F), NVIDIA\nNVDA\n (NVDA) or Nucor\nNUE\n (NUE) are up over 100%. The pressing question is what to do with a big gain?\n\n\nYou have some options:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sell it, and take your lumps in capital gain taxes\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gift it to charity and get a write off\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gift it to charity and replace it (the \u2018Charity Swap\u2019)\u00ad\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gift it to charity and do a Roth conversion (the \u2018Roth Offset\u2019)\nSell it: Simplest of all options is to just sell some or all of the stock. If you hold it in your name in a taxable account, you will pay taxes. There is a substantial difference between assets held more than one year and those held one year or less. Assets held longer than one year are long-term capital assets are subject to long-term capital gain tax rates. The long-term capital gain rates can be pretty attractive, if you look at the 2021 rates below:Current IRS long-term capital gains rates.Leon LaBrecque\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that your capital gains tax rate for a married couple is 15% all the way up to $501,600 of taxable income. Assets held for one year or less are short-term capital assets and any gains are subject to ordinary income tax rates. There is also a Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) of 3.8% on investment income (including capital gains) if your modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI is over $250,000 (married filing jointly) or $200,000 (Single). Thus, the maximum rate is 23.8%, plus applicable state taxes. Selling can be a good option, considering a bad market can easily erase gains.\n\nDonate it: Donating appreciated property held more than one year can have a double tax advantage: you don\u2019t pay capital gains tax on the donation, and you can get a deduction for the fair market value. Suppose you own some Tesla shares you paid about $400 per share for in October of 2020. You donate it to your Donor Advised Fund at a price of $1,100. \u00a0You save capital gain taxes on $700, including potential state taxes. You then also potentially get a deduction for the fair market value, presuming you can itemize deductions. If you are in a higher bracket, the tax savings would be about $166 per share of capital gain taxes (not counting state taxes), plus about $330 of income tax savings. Total tax savings is about $496 per share.\n\n\nThere are some rules: First, the fair market value deduction applies only to assets held over one year. Second, you only get the benefit if you itemize deductions: that is, your itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction ($25,100 for married filing jointly, and $12,950 for single). Third, you have to make the donations to a qualified charity. An easy way to donate to a qualified charity is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). Three of the largest DAFs are Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard. Fourth, you can only use donated property up to 30% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). If the value of the donated asset exceeds 30% of your AGI, you can carryover the remaining donation for up to five years.\nCharity Swap: If you\u2019ve donated assets to charity, but still like the security, you can re-buy it. Although there are \u2018wash-sales\u2019 loss rules, there are no \u2018wash gains\u2019 rules. In the above example, if you still like Tesla, you could buy it back immediately and your basis would reset to your new price. The basis reset is advantageous in a subsequent sale.\nRoth Charity Offset: An interesting version of the charity swap is the Roth Charity Offset. You make a charitable donation of appreciated property, perhaps to a DAF. You now have a large deduction. You convert some of your IRA to a Roth IRA, which creates income which is in turn offset by the donation. Then, potentially, you can buy whatever you want back in the Roth, maybe even the same stock. So, if Tom and Marsha had 100 shares of Tesla, they could donate that to a DAF and get a $110,000 deduction (more or less) and avoid capital gains. They could convert part of their IRA to a Roth and offset the deductions, noting the 30% of AGI rule, and then buy whatever they want in the Roth, possibly even Tesla. Note that the Roth has now potentially tax-free growth, no RMD, and an investment horizon 10 years after the death of both spouses.\nBottom Line: Year-end in a volatile market can provide interesting opportunities for gain harvesting or gain \u2018tempering.\u2019 Look at your portfolio in your taxable accounts soon. You\u2019ll want to process your donations according to your institution\u2019s specific year-end giving deadlines.

Rather than GPUs based on a new architecture or with a substantially different set of specs, a refreshed RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 are on the menu and may include significantly more VRAM than the versions of the cards currently on the market. A recently discovered submission to the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) shows what appears to be new versions of RTX GPUs (via momomo_us on Twitter).Before diving into the apparent specs of the new cards, it's worth noting that submissions to the EEC don't always line up with products that become publicly available. Additionally, our review of the submission was assisted with Microsoft Edge's translation tool, which leaves the potential for mistranslation. However, if the listings prove accurate and are aligned with the aforementioned claims, then the new cards could be among the best graphics cards available.In the event the filings line up with cards that see the light of day, the new RTX 3080 could max out with two more gigabytes of VRAM than the current version. To compare against the competition, the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT has 16GB of VRAM.The RTX 3070 Ti could see a more significant jump from 8GB of VRAM to 16GB.If NVIDIA does release new RTX 30-Series GPUs with increased VRAM, it would line up with what the company has done with the RTX 2060. Earlier this week, NVIDIA partners re-released the RTX 2060 via a souped-up 12GB model. Pricing and availability for it remain unknown, even though it \"launched\" on December 7, 2021.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nSean EndicottSocial Links NavigationNews Writer and apps editorSean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

software-defined smart grid chip in collaboration with NVIDIA. The chip will be powered by NVIDIA's AI platform and embedded in smart meters to enhance grid resiliency, integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) \u2014 including solar, storage, and electric vehicles (EVs) \u2014 and accelerate the transition to a decarbonized grid. \nThe U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will be among the first to test the software-defined smart grid chip as a way to scale and commercialize the lab's Real-Time Optimal Power Flow (RT-OPF) technology, with support from the Solar Energy Technologies Office Technology Commercialization Fund. Originally developed with funding from DOE's Advanced Research Projects \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E) program, RT-OPF enables highly localized load control to seamlessly integrate an increasing number of DERs while ensuring stable and efficient grid operations. \n\"To date, the scalability and commercial potential of technologies like RT-OPF have been limited by single-use hardware solutions,\" said Santosh Veda, Group Manager for Grid Automation and Controls at NREL. \"By developing a smart grid chip that can be embedded in one of the most ubiquitous utility assets \u2013 the smart meter \u2013 this approach will potentially enable wider adoption and commercialization of the technology and redefine the role of edge computing for DER integration and resiliency. Enhanced situational awareness and visibility from this approach will greatly benefit both the end customers and the utility.\" \nThe complexity of the power grid will grow exponentially as more distributed energy resources and intermittent renewables come online. Current meters lack the computing power necessary to support real-time, autonomous grid operations that will help achieve decarbonization goals and improve grid resiliency.\nUtilidata is a leader in meter-based software solutions, having developed on-meter applications for the biggest meter companies in the world. The company's patented machine learning software leverages real-time data from smart meters and other distribution grid devices to detect anomalies that are precursors to system failures and outages, optimize grid operations, and integrate exponentially more DERs onto the utility system. The company is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program designed to nurture cutting-edge startups. \n\"To maximize the value of DERs and integrate these resources into grid operations, utilities are going to need decentralized solutions, like RT-OPF,\" said Marissa Hummon, Chief Technology Officer at Utilidata. \"Existing meters don't have the computational power or communications bandwidth to support this kind of real-time operation. But combining our real-time grid software solutions with NVIDIA's advanced edge computing capabilities unlocks new value from the meter and offers a path to scale for solutions like NREL's RT-OPF.\"\nBringing AI to the Grid Edge with NVIDIA Built on\u00a0Utilidata's expertise in real-time grid operations, as well as the NVIDIA\u00ae Jetson\u2122 edge AI platform and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, the software-defined smart grid chip will enable smart meters to deliver greater value to utilities and their customers, while also unlocking new opportunities for clean energy companies and third-party market participants, including incumbent meter manufacturers.\nNVIDIA Jetson is the leading AI-at-the-edge computing platform, used by over 850,000 developers. Pretrained AI models, developer SDKs, and support for cloud-native technologies across the full Jetson lineup allow developers to build and deploy high-quality, software-defined features on embedded and edge devices targeting robotics, AIoT, smart cities, healthcare, energy, industrial applications, and more. Cloud-native support for Jetson will help Utilidata implement frequent improvements in accuracy and quickly deploy new algorithms throughout an application's lifecycle, at scale, while minimizing downtime.\n\"Our collaboration with Utilidata and NREL to bring AI to grid edge operations will increase resiliency and reduce energy consumption and costs to consumers through new capabilities in meters,\" said Marc Spieler, Head of Global Energy Business Development at NVIDIA. \"With the availability of an open, software-defined meter platform, utilities and consumers will no longer be locked into closed, proprietary systems that hamper innovation by limiting third-party applications.\"\nAbout Utilidata\u00a0Utilidata is a leading energy technology company that is digitizing the grid edge to unleash the full potential of clean energy.

ICARUS supports Ray Tracing Global Illumination, as well as NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s FSR. As such, we\u2019ve decided to benchmark them and share some comparison screenshots.\nFor these benchmarks, we used an Intel i9 9900K with 16GB of DDR4 at 3600Mhz and NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 3080. We also used Windows 10 64-bit, the GeForce 497.09 driver.\n\nICARUS is the first game that supports a new RTXGI feature, called Infinite Scrolling Volumes. RTXGI Infinite Scrolling Volumes uses ray tracing to constantly update the Global Illumination lighting volume around the player as they move through Icarus\u2019 world.\nBelow you can find some comparison screenshots between RT On (left) and RT Off (right). Pay attention to the light that bounces on the objects, especially on trees. You can easily notice this in most comparisons. However, there are occasions in which there is only a tiny difference (like in the snowy area).\n\n       \nNow the good news here is that these Ray Tracing effects are not that demanding. For instance, the performance difference between them at both 1080p and 1440p is only 10fps. Still, and even without its Ray Tracing effects, ICARUS is one of the most demanding PC games we\u2019ve seen to date.\n\nOur NVIDIA GeForce RTX3080 was only able to push a constant 60fps experience at\u00a0 native1080p. At 1440p, and even without the Ray Tracing effects, there were some drops to 58fps. Thankfully, those with G-Sync/FreeSync monitors will be able to enjoy the game, even when the framerate drops to 55fps.\nAs said, ICARUS supports NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s FSR techs. Below you can find some comparison screenshots. Native 4K is on the left, DLSS is in the middle and FSR is on the right. DLSS looks better than FSR and native 4K when it comes to eliminating aliasing. DLSS also runs slightly better than FSR. What\u2019s also awesome here is that both DLSS and FSR come with a Sharpening filter, meaning that you can adjust the sharpening to your liking. As such, you can get crisper visuals (than native 4K) with both DLSS and FSR.\n   \n\nGraphics-wise, ICARUS looks amazing in still images. However, the game suffers from MAJOR pop-in issues. Not only that, but you will see animals spawning right next to you, and stones transforming to plants when you get close to them. And then there are the awful artifacts from screen-space reflections. ICARUS is a buggy mess right now. The fact that this is NOT an Early Access game, but a full release makes things even worse. ICARUS can be as buggy as Cyberpunk 2077 or GTA The Trilogy \u2013 The Definitive Edition.\nPC gamers can eliminate some of the game\u2019s pop-in issues by following this guide. We\u2019ve tested and yes, it works. However, there are still some annoying tessellation and shadow pop-ins. Not only that, but distant textures look noticeably worse in lower resolutions. Below you can find a comparison between native 1080p, 1440p and 4K. As you can clearly see, the distant textures in the 4K image look noticeably sharper than the 1080p image. Hell, even at 1440p you can notice the blurry textures.\n\nMy guess is that the game has tied both tessellation and mipmaps to its internal resolution, something that can negatively affect the whole image when running at lower resolutions (even when you\u2019ve set Tessellation/Draw Distance/Textures to Epic).\nAll in all, ICARUS suffers from numerous technical issues. This is one of the most demanding games on PC, even without its Ray Tracing effects. And while in still images the game looks great, everything falls apart once you start moving. Additionally, the game suffers from some truly awful stuttering issues. At least the game\u2019s RT effects are not that demanding. Furthermore, both the DLSS and FSR implementations appear to be great. For RTX owners, we highly recommend using DLSS. As for all other players, you can at least give FSR a go!\nJohn PapadopoulosJohn is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.

More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.\r\n\n\r\nEmphasis on the \u201cquietly\u201d, mind \u2013 even if you\u2019ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won\u2019t have even noticed there\u2019s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what\u2019s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?\r\n\n\n\n\n\nYear In Review | Mystery Steam Reviews (2021 Video Games)\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nIt is, after all, still based on the old Turing architecture, so while you\u2019d still get DLSS and basic ray tracing support, the 12GB RTX 2060 won\u2019t deliver overall performance on par with Ampere GPUs like the RTX 3060. Then again, there is a certain logic to bringing back old GPUs: with production costs long recouped, they can (in theory) sell at lower prices than the RTX 30 series or AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6000 series. A potential tonic for the massive inflation that other models are suffering \u2013 maybe not one of the best graphics cards right now, but a capable bit of kit for most games.\r\n\n\r\nSadly, the 12GB RTX 2060 immediately has a different yet still familiar problem: there\u2019s hardly any stock for it. After spending probably too much time looking, I have found precisely one UK listing that actually has a price, via Punch Technology. Scan has the same Zotac-made model, without a given price. Both are out of stock.\r\n\n\r\nIt\u2019s tempting to blame this on the usual scalper bots and cryptocurrency miners, though it\u2019s also unclear how many 12GB RTX 2060s have been produced in the first place. Again, Nvidia really, really hasn\u2019t made a song and dance of the release, with its official UK site not even acknowledging the new spec exists.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nBut even if new stock was leaving the factory in droves, the 12GB RTX 2060 isn\u2019t actually that cheap. Punch Technology\u2019s asking price is \u00a3515, nearly twice what the original 6GB RTX 2060 cost at launch, while in the US it\u2019s available (yay) for $772 (aww). The only positive thing I can think to say about this is that the original RTX 2060 is hardly in a better place, costing anywhere between the $700 to $1000 range, depending on how willing you are to import. The souped-up RTX 2060 Super, with its 8GB of VRAM, is even pricier, though back in the UK you can at least get a 6GB RTX 2060 for under \u00a3450. \r\n\n\r\nIt\u2019s a situation that makes one wonder if the new model was ever really meant to be an affordable gaming GPU to begin with. Perhaps tellingly, the 12GB RTX 2060 doesn\u2019t come with Nvidia\u2019s usual hash rate limiter, which is commonly included on their newer GPUs to kneecap crypto mining effectiveness. My understanding is that the RTX 2060 was never an amazing mining card to begin with, though it does look likely that the 12GB version was designed to feed the crypto crowd as much as hard-up PC builders. \r\n\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. If miners are buying mining cards, it means they\u2019re buying fewer GPUs focused specifically on gaming, leaving more of the latter to go around. There\u2019s clearly not much of a benefit, though, if there\u2019s next to no stock to begin with.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\nIt\u2019s all quite the shame, especially since the 6GB RTX 2060 can still hold up reasonably well on performance. At 1080p, we\u2019ve recorded it coasting past 60fps averages in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Warhammer II, Monster Hunter: World and The Witcher III, all on their maximum graphics settings. Same for Assassin's Creed Odyssey on its Very High setting, while the RTX 2060 Super usually added around 10fps to each of these when Katharine tested it.\r\n\n\r\nLike (apparently) most other tech hacks, I haven\u2019t had any luck sourcing a 12GB RTX 2060 for review, though since it presumably wouldn\u2019t perform any worse than these two other GPUs it should make a decent 1080p option as well.

MX570 and MX550 coming too.\n\n\nBy Mark Tyson\nDec 20, 2021, 09:00 GMT \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\nTwitterFacebookReddItWhatsAppEmail\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Nvidia launched a trio of new laptop GPUs that it says will start to be featured in laptops starting from spring 2022. It announced the GeForce RTX 2050, MX570, and MX550 GPUs, aimed at providing \u201cmore GeForce laptop choices for gamers and creators.\u201d It is great to get more choice, but Nvidia\u2019s post was quite useless, with no specs discussed or performance targets hinted at.\n\nAs tech sites scrambled to cover the news ahead of the weekend, the blog post and product pages provided by Nvidia were woefully light on detail. It wasn\u2019t until Saturday that some key questions were cleared up. For example, AnandTech Editor-in-Chief, Ryan Smith, received confirmation that both the GeForce RTX 2050 and MX570 are based on the A107 Ampere GPU (Samsung 8nm). Meanwhile, the MX550 is going to be TU117 Turing GPU based (TSMC 12nm). The RTX 2050 specs have also now been added to the official 20-series gaming laptops comparison tables on the GeForce site.\nIn the table below I have tabulated the specs of the new GeForce RTX 2050, MX570, and MX550 and thrown in some existing relations to contextualise their standing.\n\u00a0RTX 3060Laptop GPURTX 3050Laptop GPURTX 2050Laptop GPUMX570MX550MX450CUDA Cores3,8402,0482,048>1,024?1,024?896ROPs483232?32?32?32Boost Clock1,283 \u2013 1,703MHz1,057 \u2013 1,740MHz1,155 \u2013 1,477MHz??1,395 \u2013 1,575MHzMemory Clock14Gbps GDDR614Gbps GDDR614Gbps GDDR612Gbps GDDR6?12Gbps GDDR6?10Gbps GDDR6Memory Bus Width192-bit128-bit64-bit64-bit64-bit64-bitVRAM6GB4GB4GB??2GBTDP Range60 \u2013 115W35 \u2013 80W30 \u2013 45W<30W?<30W?<30WGPUGA106GA107GA107GA107TU117TU117ArchitectureAmpereAmpereAmpereAmpereTuringTuringManufacturing ProcessSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmTSMC 12nmTSMC 12nmLaunch Date01/26/202105/11/2021Spring 2022Spring 2022Spring 2022August 2020\nTable compiled from Nvidia, AnandTech, and NotebookCheck data\nGiven its Ampere pedigree, it is quite strange how Nvidia has introduced the RTX 2050 for laptops. Of course, there is already an RTX 3050/Ti, and it traditionally releases ##40 GPUs as part of the GT line, so this is what it came up with as a compromise. You can see from the table the RTX 2050 for laptops is a boost clock/power-constrained RTX 3050 using half the bus width (64-bit). \nAnother interesting thing to observe is that the MX570 and MX550 are likely to have the same cores/memory and power configuration but vary only by architecture. There are reports that the MX570 will have the advantage of supporting DLSS, but this isn\u2019t mentioned by the official product page.\n\nThere have already been some 3DMark Timespy scores for the new mobile GPUs spotted by HXL on Twitter. The non-final test systems achieved the following scores; \u201cRTX 2050/MX570 GPU Score ~3,300 / MX 550 GPU Score ~2,500.\u201d For reference, the average Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile scores 3,571 points, and the average GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile scores 2,451 points, according to NotebookCheck.\n\n\nMark TysonFormer News Editor at Club386, he lent a helping hand at the start of Club386, shaping the website you see today. With a long history spanning back to Sinclair Spectrum 48K, there isn\u2019t much Mark hasn\u2019t reported on, leaving his keys battered and broken in a typing fury.\nTagsGeForceGPULaptopNvidia\n\nDeal of the Day\n\n\n\n \n\nSnatch AMD Ryzen 9 9900X for next to nothing with this CPU deal\n\n\n\n\nHot Reviews\n\n\n\nGraphics\nMSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X review: GPU deja vu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC systems\nCyberpowerPC Ultra 5080 Pro review: a fabulous fusion of RTX and X3D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC systems\nPCSpecialist Nebula Ultra R review: a great-value RTX 5080 system\n\n\n\nPreferred Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti vs. RTX 4070 Ti Super\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 clock speeds leak points to fast frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti vs. AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X review: GPU deja vu\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If you follow that link and scroll down to the specs section \u2013 or take the shortcut on the upper right of the page \u2013 you can see exactly how the new RTX 2060 12GB compares to its older 6GB brother. The comparison can be expanded with the \u201cView Full Specs\u201d link, but sadly we don\u2019t get to see the RTX 2060 Super compared against these two Founders Edition GPUs. No performance comparison charts are available as yet, either.\n\nWith its complement of 2,176 CUDA cores the new RTX 2060 12GB might be a closer relation to the RTX 2060 Super (8GB). On the other hand, while it doubles the memory quota of the 6GB device, the 12GB model retains the 192-bit bus and inferior bandwidth compared to the Super edition. Give and take, eh?\nScrolling down those spec lists, the only other differences we can see are the output configuration and TGP (the cards are even identically-sized). While the older card features DisplayPort, HDMI, USB Type-C and DVI-DL, the newer one drops USB Type-C support. The RTX 2060 6GB consumes up to 160W in normal operation, but the 12GB version draws up to 185W, most likely due to having to power an additional 6GB of memory.\n\nBetter in some specs, not as good in others\nIt will be interesting to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 12GB with the latest games people are playing in 2021, comparing against siblings and the newest entry-mid-level GPUs that should be available now.\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia released the GeForce Game Ready driver version 497.09 with support for the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB. The driver was headlined as being the Game Ready driver for Icarus, which utilises DLSS and RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) to maximise performance and image quality. Other upcoming games with official driver support include Chorus and Halo Infinite. The driver added support for six new G-Sync Compatible gaming monitors, and five new GeForce Experience Optimal Playable Setting profiles. Driver bugs affecting NIS, introduced in the last major driver release, have also thankfully been quashed.\n\nOn page eight of the driver release notes PDF file you can see clearly highlighted by Nvidia, the fact that the driver includes \u201cadded support for the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB.\u201d This info is repeated in a support table in the appendix (page 30), and some sites managed to see official confirmation of the RTX 2060 12GB via this file before Nvidia updated product pages.\nInterestingly, Nvidia re-released the RTX 2060 (6GB) and GTX 1050 Ti (4GB) to help address shortages earlier in 2021, but we aren\u2019t sure of the quantities/impact of that initiative.\nBefore signing off, and waiting patiently until next Tuesday for the release, The Verge got a quote from Nvidia with regard to pricing of the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 12GB. Keeping in mind the RTX 2060 6GB launched in 2019 for US$349, an Nvidia rep told The Verge that \u201cit is a premium version of the RTX 2060 6GB and we expect the price to reflect that.\u201d\n\n\nMark TysonFormer News Editor at Club386, he lent a helping hand at the start of Club386, shaping the website you see today. With a long history spanning back to Sinclair Spectrum 48K, there isn\u2019t much Mark hasn\u2019t reported on, leaving his keys battered and broken in a typing fury.\nTagsBusinessGeForceGPUNvidia\n\nDeal of the Day\n\n\n\n \n\nGrab an enormous 4TB WD Blue SN5000 SSD at its lowest ever price\n\n\n\n\nHot Reviews\n\n\n\nGraphics\nGigabyte GeForce RTX 5080 Aero OC SFF review: too rich for my blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics\nPalit GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GameRock OC review: star of the show\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics\nMSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X review: GPU deja vu\n\n\n\nPreferred Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCyberpower verifies its Nvidia RTX 50 Series PCs have all ROPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAMD reveals Radeon RX 9070 Series GPU specs and performance, launches March 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSapphire unleashes its RX 9070 Series featuring a 12V-2\u00d76 connector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHere are the games supporting AMD FSR 4 at launch\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Well, I suspect most of you didn't have high hopes on that one, and those that did have probably already lost hope.\nThat's because after the official announcement 3 weeks ago, there's basically no stock to be had, and the very few you can find at retail are grossly overpriced, even when compared to the 6GB models (!).\n\nAs of writing, it's possible to purchase a 6GB RTX 2060 from retailers like Newegg for $620, which is nearly a 80% premium over the $350 they sold for back in 2019. We could find a single 12GB model on offer for $830. That's a 34% premium over existing 6GB cards, and it's a similar story in other markets where we checked. In short, it's impossible to find one at a reasonable price. Then of course, Nvidia was clever in not including an MSRP for the new 12GB variant in the formal announcement and we suspect that was all part of their strategy.\nYou see, we've always thought it'd make sense for Nvidia and AMD to spin up past product lines on older nodes to help alleviate the supply issues, just as Nvidia appears to be finally doing with the 12GB RTX 2060. However, we were mistaken in thinking they'd do this because they cared about gamers, the customers that got them where they are today.\n\n\nAfter all, these are businesses and their main objective is to make money, maximize profits and please shareholders. Thus, flooding the market with affordable previous-gen products isn't in their best interest, especially when they can simply sell those products at unheard of margins to miners instead.\nPut simply, the 12GB RTX 2060 was never intended to be sold to gamers, instead Nvidia is looking to capitalize on the current situation and increase supply to miners. The longer this goes on, the less important gamers will become to GPU makers as their intended market. But what choice do gamers have?\n\nMoreover, the minute there's a crypto crash and things start to go back to normal, gamers will be stampeding over one another to get that shiny new GeForce graphics card. Nvidia knows this and their only concern is managing business after the inevitable end of the current cryptocurrency boom.\nArguably, the best way to do this is to sell as many non-competitive gaming graphics cards as they can to miners, so when they eventually flood the second hand market, they'll be almost worthless. So once again, that's why the 12GB RTX 2060 exists, and why it's unlikely you'll ever buy one for gaming. Be that as it may, if by some miracle it ends up making sense for you, how exactly does it perform? To find out, we purchased a (grossly overpaid) Zotac 12GB RTX 2060 we briefly discussed in this month's GPU pricing update.\n\n\nBefore we jump into the benchmarks, let's quickly go over the 12GB RTX 2060's specs, as well as the test system. Unlike the original 6GB card, the 12GB version features 2176 CUDA cores, which is the same amount as the 2060 Super, which would make it a 2060 Super but with more VRAM.\n\nBut there's more to it, unlike the 2060 Super which uses a 256-bit wide memory bus, the 12GB 2060 uses the same 192-bit bus of the original 2060, reducing the memory bandwidth from 448 GB/s to just 336 GB/s, a big 25% reduction. This means that the 12GB 2060 should perform between the 6GB 2060 and the 2060 Super, and depending on the game and quality settings used it may be closer to either model. As for testing, we're using our Ryzen 9 5950X GPU test system featuring 32GB of dual rank, dual channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory. Let's get into the data...\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla at 1080p and please note these results have been updated with the latest version of the game which greatly enhanced the performance of high-end GeForce GPUs, with more mild gains for the mid-range or lower-end models, like the RTX 2060.\n\n\nHere the 12GB model is no faster than the 6GB version, which is obviously disappointing and it meant both were slightly slower than the 5600 XT.\nThe situation at 1440p is no different with both 2060 models averaging just 49 fps, making them slower than the 5600 XT.\n\n\nNext we have Cyberpunk 2077 and we're looking at very similar performance to the 6GB model. Actually at this point you can call what we're seeing at 1080p 'identical performance', with 64 fps on average using slightly dialed down quality settings.\nThe numbers at 1440p won't exactly impress, and despite the larger buffer, performance goes largely unchanged when compared to the old 6GB model.\n\n\nWe're looking at 2060 Super-like performance in Death Stranding at 1080p with 119 fps on average, making the 12GB 2060 just 5% faster than the 6GB version.\nOddly, as we increase the resolution the 12GB 2060 drops closer to the 6GB version as it would appear memory bandwidth is more of an issue here, opposed to memory capacity.\n\n\nTesting with Horizon Zero Dawn we see the new 12GB 2060 is positioned between the 6GB version and the 2060 Super with 83 fps on average.\nThen at 1440p the margin is decreased as the larger memory capacity isn't required and instead memory bandwidth becomes more relevant.\n\n\nWe're looking at up to a 5% boost in Rainbow Six Siege at 1080p, which is about as good as it gets for the 12GB 2060 over the 6GB board.\nIncreasing the resolution to 1440p reduces the margin between the 6GB and 12GB models due to both having the same 336 GB/s bandwidth.\n\n\nFinally, we'll take a brief look at the Watch Dogs Legion results and here the RTX 2060 is rather unimpressive, regardless of which version we look at as performance is the same, falling well short of 60 fps as they trail the RX 5600 XT.\nThe 5600 XT was also faster at 1440p and although the 12GB 2060 was up to 9% faster than the 6GB variant, both fell short of a 40 fps average.\nPower Consumption\n\nIn terms of power consumption, the 12GB model is no different to the 6GB version. Both pushed total system usage to 358 watts when gaming, about the same power usage as the faster RTX 3060.\nPerformance Summary\nIt's fair to say the 12GB version of the GeForce RTX 2060 performed as expected, or maybe a little worse than expected. It's clear that the limited memory bus is choking the GPU a little, especially at 1440p. But before we wrap this up let's take a look at the average performance seen at 1080p and 1440p, as well as a look at the thermal performance of the Zotac Gaming Twin Fan model...\n\nStarting with the 1080p results we see that on average across the 12 games tested, the 2060 12GB was ~4% faster than the original 6GB model, which is nothing to write home about. This also made it the second slowest GPU in our test, or technically it was tied with the 5600 XT, another slow GPU by today's standards, but certainly good enough for 1080p gaming.\n\n1440p was a bit more of a struggle but even here we saw over 60 fps on average across the games tested, which is decent. Again, the 12GB 2060 was 4% faster than the 6GB model and roughly on par with the 5600 XT.\nAfter 30 minutes of gaming in a 21 C room inside an enclosed case, the Corsair Obsidian 500D, the Zotac Gaming RTX 2060 Twin Fan 12GB peaked at 68 C, which is a great result, though the fan speed was a little high at 2200 RPM.\nThe card remained relatively quiet at 43 dBA and not much louder than our test system's case fans. This is a stock model, so it operates at the reference specification and that saw a core clock of 1875 MHz on average with the memory at 14 Gbps.\n\nWhat We Learned\nThere you have it... the super unexciting 12GB version of the GeForce RTX 2060. Of course, had this graphics card managed to come in at a lower price point with strong supply we'd be super excited about its release, but that was never going to be the case. This product was always intended for miners.\nFrankly, gamers don't need a 12GB version of the RTX 2060. Just give us the old model at a half decent price and it's happy days, as sad as that may be. And while it's not a good situation for PC gamers or builders, it's great news for Nvidia and AMD.\n\nGenerally speaking, the 12GB 2060 is irrelevant for gamers. For us though it was at least interesting to compare a similar spec 2060 with 6GB and 12GB of VRAM, and it's an interesting discussion that heated up back in early 2019. At the time, many criticized the RTX 2060 for its lack of VRAM, but we felt overall it was a solid product and certainly one of the better offerings in the Turing series.\nStill, the pushback was strong, so we investigated memory usage in 37 games and found that the 2060 worked fine relative to the RTX 2070 at not just 1440p, but also 4K and this lead us to conclude that memory usage for the 2060 wouldn't be an issue for years to come. Crystal ball stuff, but it's been 3 years since we published that review, and it's fair to say the 6GB 2060 is still fine for 1440p gaming.\n\nIf you appreciated this depressing review, spread the word and share this feature, so more gamers can learn why they should avoid the 12GB 2060. And of course, stay tuned for more new GeForce and Radeon product reviews that you probably won't be able to buy early next year.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nIntel Core i5-12600K on Amazon\nIntel Core i7-12700K on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X on Amazon\nCorsair Obsidian 500D Case on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 20\n\n\n Got something to say?

I became so frustrated trying to find an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti graphics card that I bought a pre-built gaming rig with said GPU. With the chip shortage projected to last well into 2023 by some analysts, finding an RTX 30 series card will continue to be a difficult task.Despite the hardships customers are having getting Nvidia\u2019s current-gen graphics cards, we\u2019re already hearing rumblings about the company\u2019s next-gen GPUs. As we previously reported, a pay-walled story from DigiTimes claimed that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series cards are set to arrive in 2022. That's backed up by Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, who recently said the company aims to have improved GPU supplies in the second half of 2022, when the cards are projected to release (via PCMag).These reports aren\u2019t exactly world-shattering. Companies have to stay ahead of the competition, especially in the ultra-competitive tech sectors. There was no doubt Nvidia would be preparing to unleash the successor line to the RTX 30 series. The cards sound impressive, especially if the reports are accurate about them using TSMC\u2019s 5nm manufacturing process and Lovelace architecture; which would make for some truly powerful and efficient graphics cards.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI review gaming PCs for a living, and I'd never buy the RTX 5090 \u2014 here's why\n\n\n\n\nI'm so excited by the AI advances of the RTX 5090 I'm ditching my 4090 \u2014 here's why\n\n\n\nHowever, considering the significant challenge of obtaining Nvidia's current GPUs, I find the idea of the RTX 40 series cards launching anytime in the near future somewhat frustrating. Why should people get excited about new cards when they can\u2019t find current-gen GPUs in stock?(Image credit: Shutterstock)If Nvidia and big-box retailers don't find a way to stop scalpers...we're all going to be outside the club hatin' while the scalpers, the retailers and Nvidia are inside swimming in cash and buttery graphics.\"Sherri L. Smith, Laptop Mag EICThis is a sentiment shared by Laptop Mag Editor in Chief Sherri L. Smith, who I reached out to in order to get her thoughts on the situation.\u00a0\u201cI'm always a fan of the newest, most powerful tech,\u201d says Smith. \u201cAnd I'm fine with it costing exorbitant prices when it first launches. What I can never co-sign is the shiny, new, expensive tech being straight up unavailable. Such is the case with Nvidia's 30 Series GPUs. Since their launch, my fellow gamers have more often than not been unable to get their hands on even the weakest cards in the line, let alone a 3080 or a 3090. And if they do manage what is considered by many to be an impossible task, more often than not, it's because they paid a ridiculous markup.\u201dShe had this to say about the rumored RTX 40 series cards:\u201cCan I fault the wheels of process and capitalism? No and maybe. I do want to salivate over the new hotness, but I also want consumers to get a fair shot to get their hands said fire. That's not going to happen and it's infuriating. And yes, Nvidia is probably going to come out with cards designed specifically to ward off crypto miners. But none of that matters if Nvidia and big-box retailers don't find a way to stop scalpers from using bots to buy out the entire inventory. Until then, we're all going to be outside the club hatin' while the scalpers, the retailers and Nvidia are inside swimming in cash and buttery graphics.\u201dAs Sherri said, it\u2019s easy to drool over the prospect of new and more powerful graphics cards. Despite having an RTX 3080 Ti for a little under three months, I\u2019m curious to see what the RTX 40 series can bring to the table. Games look absolutely phenomenal on even the cheaper 30 series cards. How much better will titles specifically optimized to run on 40 series GPUs look? The imagination can run wild pondering the question. But this excitement is curtailed knowing that, if things continue as they have for nearly two years, few of us will actually get to experience what the new Nvidia graphics cards can offer.(Image credit: Asus)IGN Associate Tech Editor Taylor Lyles shares a similar view: \u201cI am perplexed at the idea that an RTX 40 series could arrive as early as next year. Nvidia is dominating the GPU market right now, there is no need for them to put out more powerful cards when the RTX 30 series is just as capable of whatever graphic-intensive games are coming out right now.\u201dSherri, Taylor and I are coming at this from the perspective of customers. We understand the reality of what\u2019s happening with regards to supply, but it\u2019s difficult for us to not get worked up over other gamers\u2019 inability to easily purchase Nvidia\u2019s current GPUs. I personally don't see things greatly improving next year. However, the industry analysts I reached out to see things more objectively.(Image credit: Nvidia)The current supply crunch is incredibly frustrating for anyone looking to buy a graphics card for gaming, VR, or work. However, Nvidia can\u2019t just stand still or it will be uncompetitive when supply finally catches up with demand.\"Avi Greengart, Techsponential\u201cThe current supply crunch is incredibly frustrating for anyone looking to buy a graphics card for gaming, VR, or work,\u201d says Techsponential president Avi Greengart. \u201cHowever, Nvidia can\u2019t just stand still or it will be uncompetitive when supply finally catches up with demand. Besides, it\u2019s not like launching new products constrains supplies of existing products \u2013 at worst, newer, better, and often cheaper GPUs replace the prior generation. In many cases, it\u2019s additive, as the newest products are produced on new, smaller process node fabrication lines.\u201dGartner VP analyst Alan Priestly has similar thoughts. He also believes the smaller process node fabrication lines will help improve the chip shortage problem.\u201cRTX4xxx GPUs are expected to be on TSMC 5nm process,\u201d says Priestly. \u201cThis means smaller die size which in turn equals more die per wafer and thus increased GPU availability.\" With regard to Nvidia staying ahead of the competition, Priestly said: \u201cIntel is entering the [GPU] market so Nvidia has to introduce new GPUs to keep ahead of its competition. Just sticking with current 30x0 GPUs will result in loss of market share as gamers move to newer high perf GPUs from other vendors.\u201dThe price of the rumored RTX 40 GPUs is something else to take into consideration. We recently reported on a tweet posted by Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan, where he said next-gen gaming laptops from the likes of the Razer Blade series will see an increase in price starting next year. The inflated costs, according to Tan, are tied with the \"significant increases in component costs.\u201d There is no reason to believe this won\u2019t also affect the price of Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards.\u201cWe should definitely expect an increase in pricing, not so that Nvidia can make up the difference between MSRP and what resellers are charging, but to cover the increase in Nvidia\u2019s actual costs,\u201d says Greengart. \u201cTransportation and labor costs have shot up, input costs have risen, and the fabs are charging more to manufacture the chips because, well, because they can.\u201d(Image credit: Nvidia/Shutterstock)While I admittedly have a bleak and perhaps too pessimistic view on where things stand with Nvidia's RTX 40 series cards, I recognize that the chip and supply shortage gripping the tech industry will eventually subside. The global pandemic has overturned all aspects of life, but the world will eventually settle on a new normal. Perhaps things will be better by the time the new Nvidia GPUs arrive in 2022. That\u2019s little solace, but it\u2019s better than nothing.For now, I\u2019ll continue enjoying the benefits provided by my RTX 3080 Ti-powered gaming rig. Even with new GPUs on the horizon, I know that games will look amazing on my machine for many years to come. PC game developers won\u2019t suddenly stop optimizing titles for 30 series cards when next-generation GPUs arrive. This is something all PC gamers should keep in mind as well.So I\u2019ll continue enjoying what I have and try to be optimistic for what the future holds. Even if I have to wait an extra year or two for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 40 series graphics cards to actually become available.Today's best Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 deals $749.99View Deal $799.99View DealLow Stock $2,480.99View DealShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nTony PolancoSocial Links NavigationSenior Computing WriterTony is a computing writer at Tom\u2019s Guide covering laptops, tablets, Windows, and iOS.

It's when costs are high than technology needs to progress the most. The high costs right. now might be due to supply chain problems, but diminishing costs can be achieved through technology advancement. Together with better technology comes better manufacturing techniques.\nIf Nvidia stopped at the 30 series and focused on releasing old models based on old tech again and again, customers would lose out in the end, in both availability and performance. High tech fabs won't be producing at their tech level as much anymore, and low tech products would start needing components the previously high tech production lines, and availability would worsen.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriur\n\n\nIt's kind of ironic that an article endlessly ranting about how it's \"nigh impossible to find current-gen GPUs\" ends with a whole list of Amazon affiliate links offering to buy those very \"impossible to find\" RTX 30XX GPUs in one click.

NVIDIA released a new benchmark with its BlueField-2 DPUs. The results may be shocking to some folks, and we will try to get into why. Note: We held this story pending comment from NVIDIA and will update when we hear back.\nNew NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU NVMe-oF Performance Faster than Optane SSDs\nWe are going to use the official release here as a reference. In that release, NVIDIA sad that it had achieved:\nThe 41.5 million IOPS reached by BlueField is more than 4x the previous world record of 10 million IOPS, set using proprietary storage offerings. (Source: NVIDIA)\nLikely this was referencing Fungible\u2019s 10M IOPS claim although NVIDIA did not call this out specifically. If you want to learn more about the Fungible DPU solution\u00a0Fungible DPU-based Storage Cluster Hands-on Look, and you can see it there hitting 10M IOPS even in our cover image:\n\nGetting back to the NVIDIA configuration:\nThis performance was achieved by connecting two fast Hewlett Packard Enterprise Proliant DL380 Gen 10 Plus servers, one as the application server (storage initiator) and one as the storage system (storage target).\nEach server had two Intel \u201cIce Lake\u201d Xeon Platinum 8380 CPUs clocked at 2.3GHz, giving 160 hyperthreaded cores per server, along with 512GB of DRAM, 120MB of L3 cache (60MB per socket) and a PCIe Gen4 bus.\nTo accelerate networking and NVMe-oF, each server was configured with two NVIDIA BlueField-2 P-series DPU cards, each with two 100Gb Ethernet network ports, resulting in four network ports and 400Gb/s wire bandwidth between initiator and target, connected back-to-back using NVIDIA LinkX 100GbE Direct-Attach Copper (DAC) passive cables. Both servers had Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 8.3. (Source: NVIDIA)\nA few quick notes here:\n\nThe P-series DPU is the company\u2019s performance DPU. The DPUs you have seen on STH are slower-clocked but lower-power E-series DPUs that do not require external power connectors.\nNVIDIA did not call out the storage it was using so we do not know what the storage configuration was. More on that in a bit.\nThe HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 Plus servers have 24-bay SFF front panels for storage. This is the 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Ice Lake update to the DL380 that we looked at the Made in the US version of in our HPE ProLiant DL380T Gen10 Trusted Supply Chain Server Teardown.\n\n\nHPE is currently selling a mix of Ice Lake and Cascade Lake platforms. The higher-end platforms have the Ice Lake refresh while the lower-end platforms do not. We asked HPE about this a few months ago and we got a response along the lines of the market feels the 2nd Gen Xeon Scalable parts are OK for the lower cost segments.\nWith that, let us get to what NVIDIA did:\nThe NVMe-oF storage protocol was tested with both TCP and RoCE at the network transport layer. Each configuration was tested with 100 percent read, 100 percent write and 50/50 read/write workloads with full bidirectional network utilization.\nOur testing also revealed the following performance characteristics of the BlueField DPU:\n\nTesting with smaller 512B I/O sizes resulted in higher IOPS but lower-than-line-rate throughput, while 4KB I/O sizes resulted in higher throughput but lower IOPS numbers.\n100 percent read and 100 percent write workloads provided similar IOPS and throughput, while 50/50 mixed read/write workloads produced higher performance by using both directions of the network connection simultaneously.\nUsing SPDK resulted in higher performance than kernel-space software, but at the cost of higher server CPU utilization, which is expected behavior, since SPDK runs in user space with constant polling.\nThe newer Linux 5.15 kernel performed better than the 4.18 kernel due to storage improvements added regularly by the Linux community. (Source: NVIDIA)\n\nMany drives are optimized for 4K reads/ writes these days. There are drives that also have good sub-4K performance like 512B performance. A good example of this is the Intel Optane P5800X that is basically the highest performing drive one can get today. Intel quotes ~1.5M 4K random read IOPS and in our testing, they are usually slightly conservative. Intel also suggests it can hit 2M IOPS in a 70/30 mixed workload scenario. The P5800X also has the ability to do 512B at up to 5M IOPS. (Source: Intel updated from the original 4.6M 512B RR IOPS in its original release below.)\nIntel Optane SSD P5800X Key Specs\nWe will note that NVIDIA did not specify in its release the storage medium nor the block size at 41.5M IOPS. Given the language below, it seems like NVIDIA must be using 512B and mixed workloads.\nIntel P5800X 800GB Front\nWhile the 41.5M IOPS may seem like a good number, but it lacks context as to how staggering that figure is. Let us put it into the context of the HPE DL380 Gen10+. Assuming 24 NVMe SSDs:\n\nNVIDIA is using 128 PCIe Gen4 lanes in the system (24*4 for the SSDs, 16\u00d72 for the DPUs)\nEach SSD would need to put out around 1.73M 4K IOPS (41.5/24) to get to 41.5M, but it seems that NVIDIA is likely using 512B and mixed workloads instead.\nThat 1.73M 4K IOPS is above the 1.5M rated read or write 4K IOPS for a P5800X 1.6TB, the fastest P5800X. There are some drives that claim slightly higher, but this is a PCIe Gen4 x4 limitation issue and that is why the P5800X is such a high-end drive. To get around the PCIe limitation, the P5800X can hit 2M IOPS in a mixed 4K use case or 5M IOPS in a mixed 512B use case.\nIn the HPE server, the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs are limited to PCIe Gen4 x16 connections each, and 2x100GbE is technically slower than the maximum PCIe bandwidth. We would expect the performance to be, therefore, lower than what eight PCIe Gen4 x4 NVMe SSDs can put out.\nNVIDIA, however, is achieving 41.5M IOPS, over this 100GbE fabric, which is faster than the rated P5800X speed at 5M 512B mixed IOPS times eight drives (8x PCIe Gen4 drives =32 PCIe lanes.)\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s announcement is very exciting. The team there seems to be delivering more performance per 32 lanes of PCIe Gen4, going through 100GbE interfaces than Intel is able to achieve with 8x P5800X NVMe SSDs.\nIn other words, NVIDIA\u2019s solution is hitting NVMe-oF speeds with BlueField-2 faster than 3D XPoint on NVMe natively in a local machine using the same number of PCIe Gen4 lanes.\nFinal Words\nOf course, we do not know the storage configuration that NVIDIA was using. It could have been using Optane DIMMs as we covered in\u00a0Glorious Complexity of Intel Optane DIMMs.\n\nNVIDIA can also be using a RAM disk or something like that (either on the host and/or on the DPUs themselves.) What is absolutely awesome though is that the NVIDIA BlueField-2 is able to push over 32x PCIe Gen4 lanes and then four (slower) 100GbE paths more data than Intel is able to push natively from eight Optane P5800X SSDs on 32x PCIe lanes, excluding the network links.\nThis is absolutely shocking performance from the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU team.\nUpdate 2021-12-21 #1: NVIDIA told us they were not actually storing data, as Fungible showed in our 2020 demo. This was simply using null devices. We are seeking clarification if it is all going back to the host systems or stopping partially/ fully on the DPU itself. If not all of the I/O is going back to the host system, then the PCIe lanes are irrelevant here.\nUpdate 2021-12-21 #2: NVIDIA confirmed via a phone call with Patrick that this is not going to storage, but is going to the host Xeons.\nUpdate 2021-12-21 #3: Based on our feedback, NVIDIA added these tables for performance to the blog post. They confirmed that they were using /dev/null, not actual storage. Also, when asked about how much of the BlueField-2 was being used versus using the ConnectX IP NVIDIA said they would get back to us on that. The BlueField-2 DPUs can act either with the Arm core complex as a bump in the wire or the host system can run through the ConnectX IP without going through the Arm complex. If the latter is the case, then the DPU is functioning basically as a ConnectX part for this test. NVIDIA is confirming what they did here.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 Storage Networking Performance Test Results Added\n2021-12-21 Update #4: NVIDIA confirmed the Arm core complex on the DPUs was not used so this just followed the host networking path.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSBlueField-2DPUFungibleIntelNVIDIAP5800X \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleStop Leaving Performance on the Table with AWS EC2 M6i InstancesNext articleCrucial P5 Plus 1TB NVMe PCIe Gen4 SSD Review Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nKioxia LC9 is the 122.88TB PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nMicron 4600 PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD Launched \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nSamsung Evo Select 1TB microSDXC Card Mini-Review \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin in NYC\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 21, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:19 am                                            \n\n\n\nUh, STH it doesn\u2019t work like that. \nYou don\u2019t get more performance by running NVMe over TCP or NVMe-oF than local.\nYou get lower performance going PCIe G4 x16 to 2x 200G\nThey\u2019ve got to be using RAM disks and almost certainly on not just the HPE servers but on the DPUs too to get around PCIe limits. Even then they\u2019re still stuck with the 100G links\nI\u2019m just saying, its BS and you need to call NVIDIA out on it.

NVMe over Fabrics using RDMA built in to, say, Infiniband native wire protocol kicks the crap out of NVMe over Fabrics over TCP. I\u2019ve tested this on my modest QDR Infiniband network, but honestly it should be obvious: there is a cost to de/encapsulating into TCP,  and then traversing the TCPIP stack.\n\u2014\nUnless this is what DPUs are for? Are they used to accelerate the crap out a rather dumb NVMe to TCP encapsulation? Is that what the DPU makers are actually selling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDip\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 21, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            7:09 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThis is complete BS. It is basically a ConnectX networking test.  DPU arm-cores can\u2019t be used as it is not acting as a root complex so all PCIe access to NVME would need to be via target\u2019s host OS/processor. Either way it doesn\u2019t matter for null devices as STH figured out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNils\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            December 21, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:30 pm                                            \n\n\n\nSo an accelerated networked null device?

Also, now I\u2019m left simply curious what its performance would *actually* be reading and writing to storage.

So much so, in fact, that you don't really see them on sale. So, if you've been pining for a Shield TV Pro for a while and have been waiting for a sale to pounce on... this is it. \nIt's been on the market for more than 6 years in one form or another and has stood the test of time. In its latest iteration, the Shield TV Pro has 4K HDR streaming on Android TV, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos enhancements, and a humming motor in the Tegra X1+ chipset with 3GB of RAM to run games on Stadia or GeForce Now. Did we mention all the ports it comes with? Two USB 3.0 slots, an HDMI 2.0 slot, and Gigabit Ethernet. It's a hunk of a box, alright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time it went on any sale of note was pretty much a year ago.

Obviously, you\u2019ll need a powerful processor capable of handling whatever games you play. You\u2019ll also need plenty of memory to store your gaming library, and a decent amount of RAM.\u00a0However, arguably the most important part of your build will be the graphics card which will power all your gaming endeavors. Unfortunately, at the moment, even half-decent GPUs are near-impossible to find. Below, I\u2019ll share how I nabbed an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card and managed to build my dream gaming PC despite the global chip shortage.\u00a0From a console to a laptop to a desktop PC\u00a0I\u2019ve always been a console gamer prior to the pandemic, having relied heavily on my PS4 Pro for all my gaming needs. However, in 2020 I finally made the transition to PC gaming after purchasing the Razer Blade 15 Quartz as my very first gaming laptop.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI just built an RTX 5090 gaming PC \u2014 here\u2019s what I used and how to build your own\n\n\n\n\nI review gaming PCs for a living, and I'd never buy the RTX 5090 \u2014 here's why\n\n\n\nI love my Razer Blade to bits, and I still use it whenever I feel like playing something more casual (like Stardew Valley) from the comfort of my sofa. But as I started to get into streaming on Twitch and playing more graphically-intensive games, the more I realized that my laptop\u2019s NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 just wasn\u2019t powerful enough to cope with the demand.I had been saving up for a desktop gaming PC for a while now, but was stymied by the ongoing chip shortage. Good CPUs were tricky but not impossible to find, and other components such as SSDs, PSUs and RAM were almost as plentiful as ever. However, trying to figure out where to buy either the RTX 3070 or RTX 3080 seemed fruitless. On multiple occasions I took a gamble and tried to play the restock game with no success \u2014 scalpers always managed to buy up every single unit the second it dropped.\u00a0In June 2021, I decided to try and go for the then-soon-to-be-released NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Unlike in the US, where plenty of retailers like Walmart to Best Buy were planning on selling the new GPU, Scan.co.uk was the only UK retailer officially stocking the 3080 Ti at launch. Predictably, their website crashed minutes into the launch, after scalpers bought out what little stock the UK had in mere seconds.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Fortunately, frantically refreshing the Scan website did eventually prove to be useful. After failing to nab the RTX 3080 Ti, I came across a pre-built hardware bundle that packed all the components I had been hunting for: an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X processor, ASUS ROG STRIX B550-A motherboard and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card.\u00a0Let\u2019s address the elephant in the room first: retailing at \u00a32,200, the price of this hardware bundle certainly scared me at first. However, after I took into account that it contains most of the priciest components within a PC, including a high-range CPU, GPU, motherboard, 32GB of RAM and all-in-one CPU liquid-cooler, I realized that it came out to a good deal. Don\u2019t believe me? If we assume retail value for the entire bundle, it comes to a total of about \u00a31,515, which means you\u2019d be overpaying by \u00a3645. In reality, however, buying these components separately would be substantially more expensive given that right now, most RTX 3080s are being resold on Ebay for \u00a31,500 \u2014 \u00a0more than twice their MSRP of \u00a3649.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Once I placed my order, I was notified by Scan that my order would be fulfilled as soon as they verified that they had all the components in stock. At this point, my heart sank \u2014 I had just paid a large sum of money for a GPU that wasn\u2019t even guaranteed to be available. Luckily, I worried for nothing, as the entire bundle was dispatched to my address within three days.While I patiently waited for my new hardware bundle to arrive, I went on Amazon to order whatever outstanding components weren\u2019t part of the bundle, including a PC case, a power supply unit and an SSD/HDD. I also had to order a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card, since it turned out that the ASUS ROG STRIX B550-A motherboard didn\u2019t have built-in wireless capabilities. Still, all these parts were relatively inexpensive compared to the sum I spent on the bundle.Another minor addition to the \u2018pro\u2019 column for me was the hardware bundle\u2019s color scheme. I\u2019ve always been a sucker for a white RGB gaming setup, so when I discovered the RTX 3080 included as part of the order was an ASUS ROG limited edition GPU, I knew that this piece of kit fit the bill perfectly in terms of my ideal aesthetics and performance.Hardware bundles - are they worth it?\u00a0Once all the components arrived, it was time to assemble my dream gaming PC. This was my first time putting one together, so it was incredibly convenient that the motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM and the liquid cooling unit all came pre-assembled \u2014 essentially all that was left to do was to hook the bundle up to a power supply and a hard drive.\u00a0After I made sure that the PC booted up without a hitch, I unhooked the power supply and carefully reattached it to the motherboard once all the components were installed safely inside my new case. Cable management, however, was an entirely different story. I had a clear mental image of what I wanted my PC to look like, so the majority of the time I spent working on my PC mainly consisted of tidying up cables and hiding them wherever possible to achieve a neat and minimalistic look.\u00a0Once I was finally finished, I couldn\u2019t help but admire my efforts - this absolute gaming beast may not look like it, but I can now finally stream graphics-heavy games like Cyberpunk 2077 on Twitch without so much as a stutter in frame-rate. No disrespect to my beloved 2019 Razer Blade 15, but it could never pull off such a feat.(Image credit: Future)Overall, my experience purchasing a hardware bundle was overwhelmingly positive. Despite paying a hefty price tag of \u00a32,200, I was able to purchase a brand-new GPU amidst a global shortage - and on top of that, I was able to do so without giving any money to scalpers. Not having to muck around with thermal paste was a plus in my book too.Is purchasing a pre-assembled hardware bundle with a CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM and liquid cooler a viable solution for everyone? Not really. Personally, it worked for me because I initially set out to build a brand new gaming PC entirely from scratch. This bundle would hardly be suitable for someone who already has a perfectly good PC and is just looking for an upgrade on their graphics card.Bottom line, I\u2019m happy with my new gaming PC, and I don\u2019t regret sinking my savings into a high-performance gaming PC that will last me for years to come. Even now, it feels like a bigger bargain with each passing day, especially with some analysts predicting that chip shortages may last through to 2023.Today's best RTX 3080 deals $699.99View Deal $1,249View Deal No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nDenise PrimbetSocial Links NavigationNews WriterDenise is a Life Reporter at Newsweek, covering everything lifestyle-related, including health, relationships, personal finance, beauty and more.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2060, which used to be one of the best graphics cards, rides again. Two years after the graphics card's, Nvidia decided to fire up the Turing stove once more to release the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB, which brings some significant upgrades to the table.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2060 12GB still leverages the same TU106 silicon that's fabricated on TSMC's 12nm FinFET manufacturing process. While the original had 30 enabled SMs out of the 36, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB comes with four additional SMs, same as the GeForce RTX 2060 Super and just two shy of the GeForce RTX 2070. This means that the revamped graphics card has 2,176 CUDA cores, 272 Tensor cores, and 34 RT cores at its disposal. In other words, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB comes with 13.3% more CUDA cores than the regular 6GB model.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2060 12GB comes with a 1,470 MHz base clock and 1,650 MHz boost clock, identical to the GeForce RTX 2060 Super. This new version has a 7.7% higher base clock than the GeForce RTX 2060, but the latter's boost clock is slightly faster (1.8%). Nonetheless, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB does offer higher FP32 performance. The regular version is rated for 6.5 TFLOPs, and this 12GB variant offers 7.2 TFLOPs, a 10.8% uplift.GeForce RTX 2060 12GB SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 GeForce RTX 2060 SuperGeForce RTX 2060 12GBGeForce RTX 2060ArchitectureTU106TU106TU106Process TechnologyTSMC 12FFNTSMC 12FFNTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)10.810.810.8Die size (mm^2)445445445SMs / CUs343430GPU Cores2,1762,1761,920Tensor Cores272272240RT Cores343430Base Clock (MHz)1,4701,4701,365Boost Clock (MHz)1,6501,6501,680VRAM Speed (Gbps)141414VRAM (GB)8126VRAM Bus Width256192192ROPs646448TMUs136136120TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)7.27.26.5TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)575752RT TFLOPS??25.2Bandwidth (GBps)448336336TDP (Watts)175185160Launch DateJul 19?Jan 19Launch Price$399?$349As the model name implies, the biggest upgrade on the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB resides in its memory system. Nvidia has doubled the GDDR6 memory from 6GB to 12GB. The generous amount of memory won't magically enable the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB to deliver an exceptional 60 FPS gaming experience, but it will help in modern titles that are pushing the memory envelope beyond 8GB even at 1080p.\n\nNvidia just upgraded the capacity of the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB, though. The memory still runs at 14 Gbps across a 192-bit memory interface. Therefore, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB provides the same level of memory bandwidth as the 6GB version, which is 336 GBps. This is where the GeForce RTX 2060 Super wins, as its wider 256-bit memory bus allows it to offer 448 GBps.\n\nThe CUDA core and memory bump didn't come free, though. Obviously, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB comes with a higher TDP rating. The Turing-powered graphics card is rated for 185W, 15.6% higher than the GeForce RTX 2060 and interestingly 5.7% higher than the GeForce RTX 2060 Super. Nevertheless, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB still only uses a single 8-pin PCIe connector.Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 12GB (Image credit: Nvidia)One of the smaller but visible changes is the design of the display layouts. Apparently, Nvidia has dumped the USB Type-C port on the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB. It's not a port that most users will miss, and Nvidia's partners have often disposed of the USB Type-C port in their custom offerings. Sadly, Nvidia didn't make any changes to the other ports. The DisplayPort outputs and HDMI port are still 1.4a and 2.0b, respectively. It's a shame but not surprising since it's using old silicon, which is another reason the GeForce RTX 3060 would still be a better pick (if you could find one).\n\nNow that Nvidia has finally released the specifications for the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB, we no longer have to rely on hearsay or speculation. Nvidia didn't disclose the pricing for this new Turing graphics card. Not like it's important since MSRP means little these days, but it would have been nice to see the premium that Nvidia has slapped on the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB.\n\nFor what it's worth, the GeForce RTX 2060 debuted at $349 whereas the GeForce RTX 2060 Super and GeForce 2070 came in at $399 and $499, respectively. Certain models of the RTX 2060 later dropped to $299, before Covid hit and the GPU shortages messed up all the pricing. In theory, the GeForce RTX 2060 12GB should slot in between the 2060 and 2060 Super, and certainly its MSRP ought to be less than the RTX 3060's $329 price point. In the real world, however, GPU prices on the RTX 2060 6GB are around $570, so the 12GB model will likely land north of that mark.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nCUDA\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (55)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

I'm not the hardcore gamer some of you are: are there indeed games consuming more memory than this at 1080p resolutions? Obviously memory requirements for textures and models don't scale linearly with resolution, but it would imply the game at 4K would require 16GB, or even more.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwirefire\n\n\nUnless this can be built using a different fab / schedule or they have a crapload of old 20XX GPUs sitting around to make these cards I don't get the point.

With no GPU hogs open, I believe I've seen Firefox gobble up to 1.7GB of my GTX1050's 2GB. Now I'm forcing Chrome and Firefox to use GT730 IGP instead to conserve VRAM so I don't get massive artifacting in game due to low VRAM.\n\nwirefire said:Unless this can be built using a different fab / schedule or they have a crapload of old 20XX GPUs sitting around to make these cards I don't get the point. They really don't need a \"new\" product, they need production. They are getting ready to announce the 40XX GPU when you still can't reasonably buy a 30XX GPU.And production is exactly why the RTX2060 is getting resurrected: the RTX2060 is made on TSMC's 12nm, so it doesn't compete with the RTX30xx on Samsung 8nm and everything else on TSMC 7nm. It also has the \"benefit\" of being less power-efficient, which should help make it somewhat less desirable for mining.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzoridon\n\n\nThey will be using a 12nm Fab process which will not take away from their RTX 3000 or future RTX 4000 series production. This will allow them to sell even more product since the demand will not go away any time soon even if they sell mountains of these cards. I expect most future triple A games to target the RTX 2060 performance at 1080p High detail at 60 frames per second without ray tracing. Hardcore gamers with money and miners will still buy all the high end RTX 3000 and 4000 series cards almost as fast as they can make them unless cryptocurrency crashes. However; as long as the world governments keep printing money without any restraint then crypto currency will continue to gain momentum since it, unlike our current system, can't be printed out of thin air and must be authenticated in the blockchain.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkorekan\n\n\nwill the msrp be $300? and everywhere on earth?\nand sold at the market @$250?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrenz496\n\n\nkorekan said:will the msrp be $300? and everywhere on earth?\nand sold at the market @$250?\nnvidia own MSRP most likely around $350 to $400. i think nvidia rep said this is more like a premium version of the original GTX2060 so base price will reflect that. some people might say such pricing might not make sense since 3060 MSRP starts at $330 but when nvidia reintroduce 2060 6GB and 2060 super 8GB earlier this year both card retain their turing era pricing ($300 and $400 respectively) instead of being adjusted by nvidia to fit with 30 series pricing.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidError\n\n\nkorekan said:will the msrp be $300? and everywhere on earth?\nand sold at the market @$250?The 12GB of VRAM alone costs ~$150 and TSMC jacked up its 12nm wafer prices by 20%. I expect the MSRPs to be $70-100 higher than the original RTX2060's mainly to cover increased costs and street prices will be whatever miners are willing to pay for 'em as usual.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to lower MSRPs when everything that is currently coming out of fabs ends up on the scalper market at 1.5-2X the price.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhotaru251\n\n\n12gb on 2060 is stupid.\n\nshould of just put the 12gb on the 2070. way more sense.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_dawn_chorus_\n\n\nEndymio said:I'm not the hardcore gamer some of you are: are there indeed games consuming more memory than this at 1080p resolutions? Obviously memory requirements for textures and models don't scale linearly with resolution, but it would imply the game at 4K would require 16GB, or even more.Lol no.. I don't know what the author is on about. Would love to see some examples of that claim. A lot of games will allocate quite a lot but actually require? At 1080p?

It feels like an odd choice for the company to still be releasing Turing architecture cards, but with everyone scrambling to get whatever they can in the shortage, these were looking like a ray of light.\u00a0The Nvidia RTX 2060 12GB upgrade was set to be a great budget gaming card that you might actually be able to find on shelves. The boost in VRAM from 6GB to 12GB would make the RTX 2060 in a position to actually compete against the AMD Radeon RX 6600 and 6700 cards, and hopefully avoid too much interest from miners, jacking up the price. It was going to be a great choice on a budget, but that\u2019s looking less likely.\u00a0Despite getting a good look at the specs for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 2060 12GB Founders Edition card just a few days ago, it turns out it probably doesn\u2019t exist. According to TechPowerUp (via Videocardz) Nvidia has since removed the listing from the specs page. A statement said it was placed there in error, and only custom designs by partners are going to be available.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nMSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia\n\n\n\nTips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021This means we aren\u2019t going to see a nice budget Founders Edition of this card to help set the pace for pricing. Board partners will set their own prices, and given they already have higher margins, they're going to be more expensive. This will only be more so depending on the configurations and other choices included in the boards.We haven\u2019t seen any partner designs of the 2060 12GB boards yet, so hopefully one kind partner will still give us a sweet budget deal. Though without it coming straight from Nvidia, we aren\u2019t expecting quite the tasty low price offerings we were hoping for.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\nHope CorriganSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterHope\u2019s been writing about games for about a decade, starting out way back when on the Australian Nintendo fan site Vooks.net.

Expertise Photography | PCs and laptops | Gaming and gaming accessories   See full bio    Lori Grunin    \n  Dec. 17, 2021  8:56 a.m. PT             Nvidia   For a company that likes to trumpet everything it does, \n  Nvidia's\n pre-CESannouncement of its entry-level laptop graphics chips seems oddly low-key. Not that the GeForce RTX 2050, MX570 and MX550 need or merit trumpeting. They're just the 2022 versions of the silicon that allows notebook manufacturers to use the attention-grabbing \"starts at $999\" in searches for \"laptops under $1,000\" -- even though, in reality, you'd need to pay closer to $1,100 for the performance you want. \u00a0They may not run games or creative applications much better than an integrated GPU would, but if your software won't work without detecting a discrete GPU, these will raise the flag that lets it run.\u00a0Nvidia provided close to zero detail about the chips, stating only that laptops incorporating them will ship in spring 2022. The RTX 2050 replaces the GTX 1650, so it does bring last-gen Turing-architecture technologies to that segment of laptops. They include DLSS (resolution upscaling for faster \n  gaming\n graphics) and ray tracing, which didn't work very well in Turing. They also offer support for Nvidia Broadcast and Optimus power saving, which are a nice step up from the previous generation. On the other hand, the MX chips aren't always worth the extra cost.Nvidia will likely announce its more powerful 2022 mobile GPUs at CES in January, as it does every year. Those are likely to include refreshes of the more powerful RTX 30 series.    \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                         Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

Hard enough that Nvidia is sending its product line almost literally backward. After weeks of rumors, a new version of the GeForce RTX 2060 \u2014 which was first released in January of 2019 \u2014 appeared on the official Nvidia spec page. It has double the GDDR6 RAM, a whopping 12GB, and slightly more CUDA cores. A release date and price aren\u2019t mentioned, but \u201csoon\u201d and \u201cmore than you want\u201d seem to be the likely answers. \nIn addition to the boosted RAM, the new variant of the RTX 2060 bumps up its CUDA cores (small, highly-efficient parallel processors) from 1920 to 2160. It also boosts the base GPU clock from 1365MHz to 1470MHz. Aside from a tiny downtick in the stock boost clock from 1680MHz to 1650MHz, the card is identical to the RTX 2060 released nearly three years ago. The RTX 2060 launched at a $300-350 retail price and Nvidia may do something similar here, though there\u2019s no telling what the highly-competitive market will price these cards at once they reach store shelves (and secondary listings). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nReading between the lines, the appearance of this new SKU indicates that Nvidia is finding it a lot easier to obtain the high-speed memory it uses in its card designs than the components needed to make its Ampere processors in the RTX 30xx series. The de facto announcement of a new 2060 card means we\u2019re probably not going to see budget-friendly (in relative terms) RTX 3050 or 3050 Ti desktop cards any time soon. \nEven secondhand RTX 2060 cards are still fetching $500-600 on the secondary market \u2014 double their retail value years later! \u2014 so there\u2019s no telling how expensive these new cards will be once they inevitably fly out of retailer inventory. Scalpers and cryptocurrency miners aren\u2019t scaling back their operations in any noticeable capacity. We can only hope that a fresh injection of supply will lower the competition and thus the price for affordable PC gaming hardware. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

One in the form of the PC (personal computer) gaming business where the booming demand for graphics cards is driving its growth. And another with its terrific market share in the data center market where the demand for its accelerators is on the rise. However, there is another area that could contribute significantly to Nvidia's growth in 2022 and beyond -- cloud gaming. Let's see why that may be the case.\nThe cloud gaming business has gained terrific traction\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the company's fiscal 2022 third-quarter earnings conference call that its cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW, has more than doubled its membership in the past year to over 14 million subscribers. It is worth noting that GeForce NOW had nearly\u00a010 million subscribers in March this year, and that number had increased to 12 million by\u00a0the end of September.\nAs Nvidia's Q3 earnings call was held on Nov. 18, it means that GeForce NOW's membership base increased by 2 million users in less than two months. This was much faster than the previous 2 million subscriber additions that took nearly six months from March to September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's GeForce NOW subscriber base jumped sharply in October thanks to the launch of a high-performance membership tier, which allows gamers to play high-end games without the hassle of owning expensive hardware. By paying\u00a0$99.99 for six months, subscribers to the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership can stream games to their PCs, MacBooks, SHIELD TVs, and certain Android devices.\nAccording to an Nvidia blog post, subscribers can stream games at \"up to 1440p at 120 FPS on PC, 1600p at 120 FPS on most MacBooks, 1440p at 120 FPS on most iMacs, 4K HDR at 60 FPS on NVIDIA SHIELD TV, and up to 120 FPS on select Android devices.\" Essentially, on all visual platforms, the quality and speed of gaming are top-notch with GeForce NOW. Given the massive shortage of graphics cards that is expected\u00a0to last until the end of 2022, it is not surprising to see gamers going for Nvidia's new membership tier and boosting the company's subscriber base.\nThat's because the price of an RTX 3080 on the street can range from around $1,070 to nearly $1,800 as compared to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $699. Buying a GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership means gamers can stream games directly from what Nvidia calls the world's most powerful supercomputer -- the GeForce NOW SuperPOD -- at a fraction of the price and without having to invest in other hardware such as faster memory or a more powerful processor.\nNvidia says gamers can get \"their own high-performance cloud gaming rig\" that could rival the gaming experience on local hardware. The graphics specialist claims that the \"GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership delivers an instant upgrade in performance for common hardware -- a 70x increase for the average laptop on Steam (a platform for downloading video games that is unrelated to Nvidia), 13x for an M1-based Macbook Air and 7x for the most popular desktop configuration on Steam.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this indicates that Nvidia has made the right moves to supercharge its cloud gaming business, which could be a big deal for the company in the long run.\nNvidia is dominating a potentially lucrative market\nVideo games market data provider Newzoo estimates that the cloud gaming market could hit\u00a023.7 million subscribers in 2021 and generate $1.6 billion in revenue. Nvidia's current GeForce NOW subscriber base indicates that it is already commanding close to 60% of the cloud gaming market, though it won't be surprising to see it increase its market share by the time 2021 ends.\nNewzoo estimates\u00a0that the cloud gaming market could hit $6.5 billion in revenue by 2024 and account for 3% of the global gaming market's revenue. So, cloud gaming still has a lot of room for growth and Nvidia has already put itself in a solid position to take advantage of this end market.\nMore importantly, Nvidia is going aggressively after this nascent opportunity by deploying more data centers dedicated to cloud gaming and increasing the number of games on offer. The company had\u00a020 data centers dedicated to GeForce NOW in March this year, and it is now serving 80 countries with 30 data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch of more data centers will help Nvidia increase the reach of GeForce NOW, while the addition\u00a0of popular game publishers such as Electronic Arts will give gamers more reasons to purchase a membership. All of this could help Nvidia remain a top video game stock in the long run as the company has found another way to complement the terrific growth of its gaming business.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Though Nvidia stock is still up 108% year to date, investors seem to be having second thoughts about the company's prospects.\nOne of the reasons for the stock's recent dip is probably the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) move to block Nvidia's proposed acquisition of British semiconductor company Arm Holdings. Another reason may be the global chip shortage that is likely to continue well into 2022 and potentially hurt Nvidia's sales, as it may not get enough components to manufacture its graphics cards that are used in several applications ranging from personal computers (PCs) to data centers to cars.\nConsidering these headwinds, will Nvidia be able to replicate its hot stock market performance in 2022? Or will the chipmaker fall prey to external factors that could throw its outstanding growth out of gear?\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nWhat could go wrong for Nvidia in 2022?\nThe biggest challenge that Nvidia faces going into the new year is justifying its rich valuation, for which it will have to sustain its impressive pace of growth. The chipmaker is trading at nearly 84 times trailing earnings, which is way above its five-year average earnings multiple of 56 and the S&P 500's earnings multiple of 28. What's more, Nvidia is trading at 28 times sales as compared to the S&P 500's multiple\u00a0of 3.19.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Nvidia must keep growing at high rates or investors will be quick to press the panic button at the first sign of trouble. Nvidia recorded 50% year-over-year revenue growth\u00a0in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 thanks to the gaming and data center businesses along with a 60% spike in earnings per share.\nThere are a few threats to that red-hot growth that may have led investors to book profits. For instance, PC sales are expected to take a hit next year. The downtrend is expected to begin in the current quarter itself, according to IDC.\u00a0The research firm expects a 3.4% drop in PC shipments this quarter thanks to supply chain constraints and high logistics costs.\nIDC sees the PC market declining close to 5% in 2022, which is likely playing on Nvidia investors' minds, as 45% of Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 came from selling the graphics cards used in gaming PCs. Additionally, the global chip shortage could pose another challenge for Nvidia and restrict it from fulfilling the massive demand\u00a0for graphics cards.\nEven the likes of Apple have fallen prey to the global chip shortage, losing billions of dollars in revenue as the tech giant has failed to make enough devices to meet demand. Something similar at Nvidia could prove catastrophic for the stock in 2022. However, savvy investors should consider using the dips in Nvidia to buy more shares, as there are stronger reasons to buy the stock if we look at the bigger picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nWhy the stock could jump once again in the New Year\nIDC points out in its PC market forecast for 2022 that the demand for gaming computers will remain\u00a0strong. The overall computer graphics market is expected to grow\u00a0by $7 billion next year and hit $138 billion in value, according to a third-party estimate. Gaming PCs are expected to hit $37 billion in revenue in 2022, and Nvidia is in a solid position to corner most of this market given its 80%-plus share.\nThe good part is that Nvidia is working to increase its\u00a0GPU (graphics processing unit) supply to gamers, which will help it ease the shortage to a large extent by the middle of 2022. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had remarked on the November earnings conference call that the company has \"secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry in substrate and packaging and testing certain companies, the integral part of our supply chain.\"\nNvidia seems well placed to ship more graphics cards going into 2022, and that should help ease any concerns about the health of its gaming business. The data center business, which produced 41% of Nvidia's Q3 revenue and clocked 55% year-over-year growth, can get even better in the new year thanks to the deployment of new hyperscale data centers.\nAccording to a third-party report, the hyperscale data center market could achieve\u00a0an annual growth rate of 20% through 2027, creating the need for more data center accelerators that Nvidia sells. As it turns out, the demand for GPUs used as data center accelerators is increasing\u00a0at an annual pace of 42% and could hit an estimated size of $20.6 billion by 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrow in new catalysts such as the omniverse\u00a0and investors have more reasons to be bullish about Nvidia's data center business. All this indicates why investors shouldn't be concerned about the short-term price fluctuations in Nvidia. It can continue to remain a top growth stock in 2022 and beyond, especially considering that its earnings are expected to reach an annual growth rate of over 39% for the next five years. That's plenty of time to buy, hold, and reap the benefits of owning this stock.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Survive long enough to mine exotic matter before returning to orbit, then explore and conquer new biomes of greater risk and greater reward. You must meet your deadline for extraction though, or face being left behind forever.\nICARUS will be the first game to utilise RTXGI Infinite Scrolling Volumes to apply Global Illumination in an open-world game environment.\nPlayers can now explore ICARUS\u2019 terraformed alien wilderness on a GeForce RTX GPU, desktop PC, or laptop for an even more immersive experience with incredibly realistic RTX Global Illumination lighting, and optimize performance by activating NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICARUS Available Now With RTX Global Illumination\nNVIDIA and RocketWerkz have collaborated to bring the truly incredible RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) to ICARUS. This game-changing technology realistically simulates the natural illumination of indoor and outdoor scenes from the sun and moon, and can also simulate the bouncing of light from surface to surface until the light rays dissipate, which was previously impossible at high frame rates in a real-time video game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the power of RTXGI, you can chop down a tree and see light naturally illuminate the previously darkened forest floor. If you build a house, light will flood through windows and bounce from surface to surface. And as in reality, light will inherit color from surfaces, so for instance, light bouncing from a red wall to a white wall will now cast a red tinge on the white surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious-generation rasterized solutions were extremely limited, and prior ray tracing solutions had a high performance cost while at most managing one limited lighting bounce. RTXGI, in contrast, is fully dynamic with infinite light bounces, which is made possible in part by the complex ray tracing workloads being calculated across multiple frames each second to create a high quality multi-bounce lighting cache with visibility information. If nothing changes in the scene, the information\u2019s already available in the cache. If something changes, update the necessary details. And by calculating across multiple frames, the cost is spread, making RTXGI highly performant in comparison to all other ray-traced global illumination solutions.\nBest of all, developers can add RTXGI with ease thanks to the release of an Unreal Engine 4 plugin, which can be freely downloaded from the RTXGI website.\nTo support ICARUS\u2019 massive biomes, and the massive locales of other open world games, a new RTXGI feature called Infinite Scrolling Volumes has been developed, and is being launched alongside ICARUS. As players move through ICARUS\u2019 environment, lighting is updated in a large volume around the player\u2019s viewpoint, to a range where detail can\u2019t be perceived, reducing memory requirements and increasing performance. Without Infinite Scrolling Volumes, you\u2019d be required to calculate and store the entire world\u2019s lighting in the cache, which simply isn\u2019t feasible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you enable RTXGI planet-side in ICARUS, or on the game\u2019s space station, you\u2019ll see incredibly lifelike lighting, far beyond the quality of any other global illumination solution you\u2019ve experienced in a game before now.\nWith a GeForce RTX GPU, desktop PC, or laptop, you can\u00a0experience RTXGI thanks to our dedicated RT Cores. And of course, you can enable NVIDIA DLSS for even faster performance when scavenging and building in ICARUS\u2019 incredible world.\nNote:\u00a0Ray tracing in ICARUS is only available through the DX12 runtime. At the time of this writing you can choose this option when launching the game, but should this change, adding -dx12 to the game\u2019s Launch Options field will also accomplish this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICARUS With NVIDIA DLSS: Boost Performance By Up To 80% \nICARUS takes full advantage of NVIDIA DLSS to boost performance. Powered by AI rendering technology and dedicated Tensor Core AI processors found exclusively on GeForce RTX GPUs, DLSS speeds up frame rates by up to 80% while still providing image quality similar to native resolution. Optimize gameplay without losing detail for the definitive ICARUS PC experience. \u00a0\nWith a GeForce RTX graphics card, desktop, or laptop, you can activate NVIDIA DLSS in just a few clicks: \n\nPress Escape and click SETTINGS in the lower right corner\nClick the DISPLAY tab\nScroll down to select your desired DLSS Mode and DLSS Sharpness value\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICARUS On GeForce NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget, you can also play ICARUS on GeForce NOW, NVIDIA\u2019s cloud gaming service. With GeForce NOW, gamers can play their favorite already-owned PC titles from popular digital stores like Steam, Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Store and GOG. Founders, Priority, and RTX 3080 members also get priority access to our cloud gaming servers and extended session lengths for longer playtimes. Head to GeForceNOW.com to learn more about the service, including the new, highest-performance GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ICARUS Out Now\nFrom the creator of the legendary survival game DayZ, Dean Hall and his team at RocketWerkz have furthered the co-op survival genre with their latest title ICARUS. Think you got what it takes to survive the alien wilderness? Play ICARUS and see if you can make it back to orbit\u2014available now.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United Kingdom\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Nvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 2050 laptop GPUs don\u2019t sound \u201cnew\u201d at all, considering that the company already released the RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs for laptops earlier this year (via VideoCardz). But it\u2019s clear that Nvidia isn\u2019t ready to retire its 20 series GPUs just yet \u2014 Nvidia says that the RTX 2050 will be available in laptops starting in the spring of 2022.The RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture, not TuringThe RTX 2050 isn\u2019t just a piece of old hardware brought back from the dead. Unlike other 20 series chips, the RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture, not Turing. Ampere is the same architecture that the RTX 3050 (and all other 30 series cards) is powered by, and packaging it within a 20-series card could potentially offer some of the same ray-tracing improvements at a cheaper price. The RTX 2050 comes with the same 2,048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory that the RTX 3050 has. However, it offers a 64-bit memory bus when compared to the RTX 3050\u2019s 128-bit, potentially leading to a bit of a downgrade in performance.While it\u2019s possible that Nvidia is releasing a GPU that doesn\u2019t belong to the latest and greatest 30 series due to the ongoing chip shortage, the move may also come as a way to provide a middle ground between the RTX 3050 and the RTX 1650. Nvidia might want a mid-range GPU that offers a boost in performance over the RTX 1650, but is still more affordable when compared to devices that carry the RTX 3050.In addition to the RTX 2050, Nvidia also announced the entry-level MX550 and MX570 laptop chips, but the company hasn\u2019t provided many details about their specs. Nvidia vaguely mentions \u201cmore CUDA Cores\u201d and \u201cfaster memory speeds\u201d with no solid numbers to back it up just yet. All this comes about two weeks after Nvidia released a new version of the RTX 2060 \u2014which was originally launched in 2019 \u2014 that offers an upgrade of 12GB of video RAM when compared to the 6GB of VRAM that the standard model comes with.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

He boasts that all cards in the building are almost all NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070s, and that his new facility will house all 170HX cards.\nWhat is interesting about the video is the particular RTX 3070 cards shown and how he acquired them for his crypto mining factory.\nRelated Story Worldwide GPU Shipments Saw A 4.4% Quarter-Over-Quarter Increase; Data Center GPUs Saw A Bigger GrowthJaxson Davidson on Twitter shows a fourth of his mining factory, hundreds of RTX 3070 FE graphics cards shown and sold \"under the table\"\nUpdate: The user has clarified that it wasn't the GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Editions that were sold directly by NVIDIA but the CMP 170HX mining cards. More in the tweet below:\nhttps://twitter.com/jaxson_davidson/status/1471553964667641858\nHere is the tweet in question \u2014\nhttps://twitter.com/jaxson_davidson/status/1470933731548356614?s=20\nIt appears that the building is located at the Tonaquint Data Center, Inc., located in the state of Utah. But what is really interesting is that one of our reporters recognized that the cards being used are NVIDIA RTX 3070 Founder's Edition GPUs.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3070 graphics cards are powered by Ampere\u2014NVIDIA\u2019s 2nd gen RTX architecture. Built with enhanced Ray Tracing Cores and Tensor Cores, new streaming multiprocessors, and high-speed memory, they give you the power you need to rip through the most demanding games.\n\u2014 from the NVIDIA RTX 3070 family product page\nOur readers will remember that currently, the world is experiencing a gigantic and global shortage of computer components, from CPUs to GPUs, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founder's Edition, which Davidson seems to have in large supply.\nSo, how did Davidson get his hands on the highly sought-after graphics cards during such a large shortage that gamers and enthusiasts are experiencing? He answers this question in a response below:\nhttps://twitter.com/jaxson_davidson/status/1471182751021731841?s=20\nIt's extremely fortunate that he is planning on selling them in the future because they will practically be useless to not only gamers but anyone trying to enjoy the graphic quality that NVIDIA stands for with their products.\nDavidson also gives advice on how he is keeping all of the graphics processors cooled while he is mining Ethereum and Ravencoin,\nRavencoin happens to be \"a Proof-of-Work blockchain specifically designed to facilitate the issuance of tokens, acting as an alternative to other token-capable chains such as Ethereum. Tokens issued on Ravencoin can be used for a variety of purposes, including representing real-world assets and NFTs. The project\u2019s design is broadly similar to Bitcoin, though its total supply, block rewards, and proprietary Ravencoin mining algorithm are optimized for decentralization and efficient token transfer,\" states website Cryptopedia.\nWe apologize for the language used in the below tweet.\nhttps://twitter.com/jaxson_davidson/status/1471181003355918339?s=20\nThe Utah facility apparently is one of many that the crypto miner and enthusiast is using in mining for cryptocurrency.\nOn why he prefers the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Founder's Edition GPU, as well as other high-quality and difficult to find graphics cards, above an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs), a device using microprocessors for the only purpose of mining digital currency, he responds with this word of advice:\nhttps://twitter.com/jaxson_davidson/status/1471180062468698115?s=20\nIn the thread of tweets, mostly from hateful Twitter users that feel the brunt of incapability of purchasing a GPU at an affordable price during the global shortage crisis, Davidson blatantly admits he purchased the graphics processors in a less than legal fashion, which is unfortunate, because the remainder of consumers who are still waiting for the RTX 3070 Founders Edition, as well as other GPUs until Davidson is done using them for his crypto mining purposes.\nSource: Jaxson Davidson (@jaxson_davidson)\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Custom Model Reportedly Suffers From High VRAM Temperatures; Memory Can Hit Over 90\u00b0C\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group Blamed: ByBit Crypto Exchange Suffers A \u201cSophisticated Attack\u201d On One Of Its Ethereum Cold Wallets, The Wallet\u2019s Holdings Were Transferred To An \u201cUnidentified Address\u201d [Updated]\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Might Face More China GPU Export Controls From Trump Admin \u2013 Report\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s AIB Market Share Grows To 90% As Total GPU Shipments Declined By 14.5% In Q3 2024\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n115\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n115\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The graphics card was confirmed through NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2060 product page where the GPU maker lists both 6 GB & 12 GB variants of the card.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB Graphics Card Gets Official, Specs Confirmed By GPU Maker\nThe RTX 2060 was released back in 2019 and the 12 GB variant will be launching two years later. The card did receive a SUPER variant and a few other variants specific to certain markets but it looks like the 12 GB variant is going to be available globally. NVIDIA is re-releasing this card in a bid to combat the current component shortages and offers an intermediate solution to gamers in the mainstream segment as their entire Ampere lineup currently starts at $329 US (plus the inflation).\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDPNVIDIA has officially confirmed the upcoming GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB graphics card. (Image Credits: NVIDIA)\nSpecifications wise, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB will carry the TU106 GPU fabricated on the 12nm process node with 2176 CUDA cores, 136 Tensor Cores, and 64 RT cores. The GPU is clocked at 1470 MHz base and 1650 MHz boost. Due to being based on the Turing GPU, the new card won't be as feature-rich as the Ampere cards that have more RT/Tensor cores, PCIe Gen 4.0 support, a brand new NVENC encoder, or even a Resizable Bar.\nThe same GPU was featured on the RTX 2060 SUPER however the main difference is the memory. The card will retain a 192-bit bus versus the full 256-bit bus featured on the SUPER variant. This will allow the card to hit 12 GB GDDR6 memory capacity running at 14 Gbps pin speeds for a total bandwidth of 336 GB/s. It will also come with a similar TDP of 185W, the same as the RTX 2060 SUPER variant. Interestingly, the card will be available in Founders Edition flavors too alongside custom models from NVIDIA AIB partners.\n\nBut in terms of pricing, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB graphics cards are said to end up at around $300 US. This isn't MSRP but the actual retail price. The\u00a0AMD Radeon RX 6600 Non-XT is currently at an MSRP of $329 US but real prices end up close to $400-$500 US. The RTX 3060 12 GB has an MSRP of $ 329 US but also ends up over $500 US. So for $150-$200 US lower, the GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB might make sense, especially if it ends up offering performance in between the RX 5600 XT and RX 5700.\nTalking to the Verge, an NVIDIA representative told to expect a slightly more premium pricing for the premium variant of the RTX 2060 graphics card:\n\u201cIt is a premium version of the RTX 2060 6GB and we expect the price to reflect that.\u201d\nNVIDIA via The Verge\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB graphics card is also currently supported by the latest 497.09 WHQL drivers which include a range of features and bug fixes. More details here.\nA possibility is that the new GeForce RTX 2060 will be positioned against what is likely to be an even more entry-level RDNA 2 lineup from AMD, mainly their Navi 24 GPUs but that's all speculation for now. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB is expected to hit the street on 7th December, the same day as its launch. The card will serve as an intermediate solution for the entry-level segment until NVIDIA launches its GeForce RTX 3050 series.\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GBNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\n\n\n\n\nGPU ArchitectureTuring GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU106)Turing GPU (TU106)\n\n\nProcess12nm FNN12nm FNN12nm FNN\n\n\nDie Size445mm2445mm2445mm2\n\n\nTransistors10.6 Billion10.6 Billion10.6 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores1920 Cores2176 Cores2176 Cores\n\n\nTMUs/ROPs120/48136/64136/64\n\n\nGigaRays5 Giga Rays/s6 Giga Rays/s6 Giga Rays/s\n\n\nCache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache4 MB L2 Cache\n\n\nBase Clock1365 MHz1470 MHz1470 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1680 MHz1650 MHz1650 MHz\n\n\nCompute6.5 TFLOPs7.5 TFLOPs7.5 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory6 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Speed14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps14.00 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Interface192-bit256-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth336 GB/s448 GB/s336 GB/s\n\n\nPower Connectors8 Pin8 Pin8 Pin\n\n\nTDP160W185W185W\n\n\nStarting Price$349 US$299 US?$499 US\n\n\nPrice (Founders Edition)$349 US$299 US?$599 US\n\n\nLaunchJanuary 2019December 2021July 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n151\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1160\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

A filing to the Eurasian Economic Commission shows what could be new versions of the RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 on the way. A bizarre non-launch of the RTX 2060 12GB involved a retail listing for a graphics card that didn't include a buy button. Now, a report by VideoCardz claims that the RTX 3090 Ti will be on shelves by January 27, 2022.An alleged embargoed document listing for the RTX 3090 Ti lists an on-shelf date of January 27, 2022. Specifically, the GPU will reportedly be on shelves at 6 AM Pacific Time on that day. The document does not list an announcement date for the graphics card.Assuming that the RTX 3090 Ti launches with the specs that we expect, it will be one of the best GPUs. It's said to have 10,752 CUDA cores, 24GB of GDDR6X RAM, and memory speeds of 21 Gbps. Those figures are slightly higher than those of the RTX 3090.A refreshed RTX 3050 with more VRAM is said to arrive on the same day as the RTX 3090 Ti. The new RTX 3050 will reportedly have 8GB of VRAM. This increase would be similar to what we've seen NVIDIA do with the RTX 2060, namely increasing the VRAM on a preexisting card.VideoCardz has not confirmed the launch date of the upcoming RTX 3080 at this time.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nComputers Desktops\nHardware\n\n\nSean EndicottSocial Links NavigationNews Writer and apps editorSean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Nvidia just revealed an all-new GeForce RTX 2050 \n\t\t\t\tThe perfect ending to a very weird year for GPUs.\t\t\t\n\n \n\n By Brad Chacos  \n\n Executive Editor, PCWorld   Dec 17, 2021 7:28 am PST \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia kicked off the real-time ray tracing revolution when it launched GeForce RTX 20-series \u201cTuring\u201d graphics cards in 2018. These cards have since been replaced by better, faster RTX 30-series \u201cAmpere\u201d GPUs, but in a world ravaged by chip shortages, scalpers gone wild, and insane demand from PC gamers about to enter the third year of a pandemic, Turing is being brought back from the dead. Nvidia recently released a new 12GB version of the RTX 2060 desktop graphics card, and on Friday, the company announced new RTX 2050 laptop GPUs.\nWe\u2019ve never seen the RTX 2050 before, either in laptops or desktops. If this is indeed an all-new Turing GPU rather than one based on Ampere (Nvidia didn\u2019t specify), it\u2019s being built and released years after you\u2019d usually expect to see it, and even after the RTX 3050 has already made its laptop debut. Weird. Don\u2019t expect it to be a proper gaming option despite the GeForce branding, however.\n\n\nHead over to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 20-series laptop page and you can see the RTX 2050\u2019s detailed specifications. With 2,048 CUDA cores, the RTX 2050 actually wields slightly more GPU cores than the step-up RTX 2060 found in many mainstream gaming laptops. Don\u2019t expect this to be a barnburner though, as the clock speed range is lower than the RTX 2060\u2019s, and since this is a 30 to 45 watt part (compared to 65W to 115W for the RTX 2060), you can expect those speeds to settle into the lower range of its 1155 \u2013 1477MHz rating more often than not.\nThe RTX 2050\u2019s memory configuration drives home that this is no gaming chip. It wields 4GB of GDDR6 memory across a paltry 64-bit bus, good for just 112GB per second of overall memory bandwidth. By contrast, the RTX 2060\u2019s 6GB and 192-bit bus provides it with three times as much bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\nAll told, while it\u2019s a shock to see the RTX 2050 launched in 2021, everything points to this being a card for content creators on a budget\u2014folks who need some basic GPU firepower (and maybe the AI acceleration provided by Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology) to get work done. Sure, you could get some low-end gaming done on the side, but RTX 2050 laptops probably shouldn\u2019t be purchased if you\u2019re primarily looking to play Rocket League or Witcher 3. That said, Nvidia made a point of mentioning that the RTX 2050 supports Nvidia Reflex and Broadcast, two gamer-centric GeForce features, so who knows.\nAlongside the RTX 2050, Nvidia also announced new GeForce MX550 and MX570 chips, the latest entries in the budget-level series intended for people who want basic GPU capabilities or more flexible display output options. In general, MX graphics are also not intended for use by gamers.\n\nNvidia says laptops powered by the GeForce RTX 2050 and the new MX GPUs should start shipping next spring.\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive Editor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

However, its impact on the world of technology has been vast. According to the Steam Hardware Survey, over 70 percent of users have an Nvidia graphics card in their gaming system, while Passmark says over 60 percent of users have an Nvidia product.\nThere was a lot of work involved in getting to that level, and while the company's first chip in 1995, the NV1 seemed like a brilliant product offering video and 3D acceleration, a built-in sound card, and a gamepad port, its reliance on quadratic texture mapping instead of triangle polygon rendering meant that Nvidia dropped the ball on its big debut. Lesson learned as the chips that followed included some surefire hits. Let's take a look...\n\nNvidia RIVA 128\n\nImage: Andr\u00e9 Karwath\nAn acronym for Real-time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator, the RIVA 128 was the successor to the NV1 and a product that put everyone in the space on notice. Featuring support for DirectX 5 and OpenGL, the RIVA 128 didn't repeat the same mistakes. It seemed future proof from the get-go, with 4 MB of SGRAM and AGP 2X support.\nAt the time, it could keep up with 3Dfx Voodoo cards, which were the fastest cards on the market. Over a million units shipped within the first 4 months of the RIVA 128 release, cementing its importance as a product and a company.\nNvidia RIVA TNT2\n\nThe successor to the RIVA 128, the TNT was good but was still outperformed by 3Dfx. But the following year, Nvidia delivered the TNT2 with several significant improvements. A process shrink to 250 nm (and later 220 nm with the TNT2 Pro) allowed for higher clock speeds (125 MHz core and 150 MHz on the memory, compared to 90/110 on the original TNT), while the chip supported larger textures, a 32-bit Z-buffer, AGP 4X and a maximum of 32 MB of memory.\nCompared to rival products from 3Dfx, the TNT2 featured better support for DirectX and OpenGL and packed excellent image quality with 32-bit color. Gamers took notice.\nNvidia GeForce 256 DDR\n\nIn 1999, Nvidia introduced the first GeForce chip, known as the GeForce 256. There were two variants, with the high-end DDR model gaining most of the attention for its speedy memory.\nThe GeForce 256 also featured a transformation and lighting engine (T&L) that allowed the chip to handle calculations previously covered by the CPU. This feature allowed the card to be paired with a slower processor yet still deliver excellent performance. While critics and rivals said the technology wasn't necessary, it eventually became commonplace and found in nearly every graphics card on the market.\nThe GeForce 256 was also the basis for the first Quadro product for computer-aided design. This line of products opened up a whole new and lucrative market for Nvidia.\nNvidia GeForce 6800 series\n\nThe early 2000s turned into a royal rumble between ATI and Nvidia, as they one-upped each other through the GeForce 2, 3, and 4 eras. After ATI dropped their Radeon 9700 and impressed everyone, Nvidia had to throw a haymaker of its own, and thus the GeForce 6800 was introduced.\nAs one of the early products to sport GDDR3 memory, the GeForce 6800 was a speed demon, even dismissing ATI's X800 XT with better shader model support and 32-bit float point precision, compared to the Radeon. Furthermore, since Nvidia had acquired 3Dfx, they began implementing features and technology from the former graphics company.\nOne major part of 3Dfx's portfolio was Scan-Line Interleave, which linked two video cards and boosted 3D processing power available. In 2004, Nvidia modernized this feature and reintroduced it as Scalable Link Interface (SLI) with many enthusiasts pairing 6800s to create the ultimate gaming PC.\nNvidia GeForce 8800 series\n\nTwo years after the GeForce 6800, Nvidia introduced the new GeForce 8800 series. The new graphics card was an absolute beast of a gaming GPU. With up to 128 streaming processors, a 575 MHz core, a 1.35 GHz shader clock, and 768 MB of GDDR3, it could actually outpace a dual GPU flagship from the previous generation.\nIt was one of the first products to use a unified shader architecture. The GeForce 8 series was considered fast even years after its initial debut. Not everything was gravy, as a significant number of this series' chips suffered from an overheating issue that led to many failures.\nNvidia GeForce GTX 295\n\nJust before the 2010s came around, dual-GPU boards became a hot commodity, and AMD was pretty aggressive with its ATI Radeon 4870 x2. To rival that, Nvidia brought out the GeForce GTX 295, which put two of its GeForce 200 chips on a single board.\nWith the right drivers, this was the fastest graphics card money could buy, and at $500 it could outperform a pair of GTX 260s when a single one had an MSRP of $450, making it a bargain to enthusiasts.\nNvidia GeForce GTX 580\n\nWhile the GeForce GTX 480 launch didn't go as planned, all was well with its successor known as the GTX 580. A fully unleashed Fermi architecture meant 16 stream multiprocessor clusters, six active 64-bit memory controllers, and full-speed FP16 filtering.\nThis graphics card was the real deal. With AMD hot on its heels, the GTX 580 needed to be everything the GTX 480 wasn't, and fortunately it was enough to hold off AMD for a while. The top-tier dual-GPU GTX 590 was met with scathing reviews due to poor stability and the inability to upstage the Radeon HD 6990.\nNvidia Tegra X1 SoC\n\nNvidia had been making products for PC enthusiasts, design professionals, and even supercomputers and AI researchers, but with Tegra SoCs, it made the jump into the world of mobile computing. The Arm-based Tegra lineup was designed for smartphones and tablets, but things went beyond that, and the extra processing power of the SoC went to good use in the Nintendo Switch.\nThe success of the Switch has been off-the-charts, with nearly 70 million units sold since 2017. Each one packs the Tegra X1, which pairs an ARMv8 ARM Cortex-A57 quad-core with a Maxwell-based 256 core GPU.\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1080\n\nThe 16nm fabricated GeForce GTX 1080 series was extremely influential and a big milestone for the GPU maker, showcasing Nvidia's might and design expertise. The Pascal architecture was well ahead of the competition, so much so that GeForce GTX 10 cards remained in contention for several years which is almost an anomaly in the graphics market.\nThe GTX 1080 became the benchmark to beat, and even the next generation of Nvidia GPUs struggled to show any significant improvement in raster performance. Speedy GDDR5X memory was matched with 2560 cores in the GTX 1080 and 3584 cores in the GTX 1080 Ti, leading to eye-popping frame rates even as you increased resolutions.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080\n\nThe GTX 1080 was followed by the Turing-powered RTX 20 series, which implemented real-time hardware ray tracing for the first time in a consumer-oriented video card. However, there were very few games with ray tracing features at the time of its release, and in general, the RTX 20 series didn't feel like a significant enough jump from the GTX 10 series.\nNvidia upped the ante with the RTX 30 series and the Ampere architecture, leading the RTX 3080 to become the ultimate gaming card regardless of resolution or enabling demanding ray tracing features when using DLSS. The 3080 has 28.3 billion transistors and 8704 cores clocked up to 1.7 GHz, delivering a big 70% performance jump over the RTX 2080 at 4K is impressive.\nOn the less positive side, the card features just 10GB of memory, although it's of the faster GDDR6X kind. It's also power hungry, but it's very fast and that makes up for all of it. At the original $700 MSRP (which due to the chip shortages that ensued would be a dream to have at that price), it could be considered a bargain to enthusiasts, thanks to a low cost per frame.\n\nWrap Up\nNvidia has grown into a graphics giant and beyond, by steadily churning out impressive and innovative products for computer gamers and enthusiasts, but most recently also providing solutions for automakers, creative studios, and researchers. Not to mention the impending (and somewhat doubtful?) acquisition of Arm.\nThese days, Nvidia is pushing the efforts of its real-time hardware ray tracing products, which allow for photorealistic lighting. However, even without these features, its GPUs are among the fastest performing in the industry. As we sit upon a new generation of gaming, with new consoles featuring ray tracing support, it'll be interesting to see if Nvidia can increase its lead over the competition.\n25 years later: How many of these have you owned?\nAlso, don't miss our parallel feature showing off the Top 10 Most Significant AMD/ATI GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 123\n\n\n Got something to say?

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven all the recent leaks about Nvidia's upcoming GeForce RTX 3090 Ti (see also 3070 Ti 16GB Delayed and the 21Gbps rumor), it looks pretty clear that Nvidia will soon launch a new king of the GPU benchmarks, supplanting the 3090 as the fastest option in the best graphics cards. Two things remain unclear: exact specifications and the launch date. Regarding the latter, leaked documents point to January 27, 2022, as the availability date.\n\nNvidia is rumored to formally introduce its GeForce RTX 3090 Ti on January 4, 2022, at CES 2022. But the company will only lift embargo from product reviews and let its partners start selling the new boards on January 27, 2022, according to excerpts from documents from two companies: MSI (which covers availability of the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Suprim X 24G) and presumably Nvidia itself. While the information comes from one source (VideoCardz), one excerpt corroborates another, so it's a reasonably safe bet at this point that Nvidia indeed wants its GeForce RTX 3090 on shelves for a January 27 launch.(Image credit: VideoCardz)Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will be the company's new flagship offering, delivering even more performance than the GeForce RTX 3090. The new card will supposedly use a fully enabled GA102 GPU\u00a0with\u00a010,752 CUDA cores\u00a0(up from 10,496 on the RTX 3090) mated with 24GB of Micron's GDDR6X memory connected using a 384-bit interface. The memory will get a boost to a 21 GT/s data transfer rate (up from 19.5 GT/s in case of the RTX 3090). Also noteworthy is that the board will\u00a0reportedly\u00a0use Micron's 16Gb memory chips (instead of 8Gb ICs), which will optimize its cost and put all of the VRAM on one side of the PCB.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3090 Ti won't get a significant performance uplift from its additional 256 CUDA cores unless it also gets higher clocks \u2014 it only has 2.4% more cores. However, the faster memory will boost bandwidth from 936.2 GBps up to 1,018 GBps, a 9% increase, which will positively affect performance in bandwidth-hungry games and in high resolutions.\n\nIt's also unclear what will happen to the original GeForce RTX 3090 once the RTX 3090 Ti is launched. With the release of other Ti variants in the Ampere lineup (RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 3080 Ti), vanilla versions remained afloat. But since we are dealing with a flagship here, Nvidia may choose to retire the RTX 3090 in a bid not to offer a competitor for the RTX 3090 Ti.\u00a0We're also curious to see if Nvidia will implement its LHR anti-mining lock on the 3090 Ti, something it has so far avoided for the 3090 models. Maybe it will even get some tweaks to further combat the LHR workarounds from mining software.\n\nNvidia does not comment on unreleased products and rumors, so it's impossible to confirm or deny any information about the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. Still, we suspect we'll find out more come CES 2022 \u2014 which Nvidia won't be attending in person, so plan on another video from Jensen's kitchen.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce RTX 3090\nCUDA\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (3)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Preds YouTube \nFollowing the Sony\u2019s firing PlayStation Network Senior Vice President of Engineering George Cacioppo after he was allegedly caught soliciting sex from an underage male undertaking an amateur pedophile sting, news of the similar bust of a senior Nvidia employee \u2013 undertaken by the same group who busted Cacioppo no less \u2013 has once again begun to circulate.\n\n\nRelated: PlayStation Exec George Cacioppo Fired After Appearing To Be Caught In Amateur Pedophile Sting\nThe now-former Nvidia employee, Senior Account Manager Todd Wiseman, was caught on video on October 7th as part of an amateur sting operation undertaken by People v. Preds, an online group whose self-described goal is to \u201ccatch online preds that prey on children for sexual activities.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to supposed chat logs obtained by People v. Preds and released to Twitter news commentator @BanishedJourno, the accused Wiseman met his assumed victim on the gay dating app Grindr, where the non-existent teenager near-immediately informed him, \u201cI\u2019m only 15 plz don\u2019t be mad.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, despite displaying an initial hesitation that he was \u201cnot certain I can be with a minor\u201d on the grounds that it was \u201crisky\u201d, Wiseman eventually began to suggest the two meet-up after being told that the teenager was staying in his own hotel room and could \u201chost\u201d an encounter.\n\nMoving to text messaging in an attempt to verify that his would-be victim was \u201cnot a cop or law enforcement\u201d and leaping to accept mere written assurances as sufficient proof, Wiseman \u2013 who gives his name as \u2018Todd\u2019 \u2013 then appears to definitively make plans to stop by the hotel room and victimize the teenager on his way to work that day.\n\nRelated: Archives Prove IGN Executive Review Editor Lied When Claiming Outlet Would Not Report On Sony Exec Pedophile Allegations Because They Don\u2019t Cover \u201cGeneral Crime\u201d\n\nHowever, as seen in People v.

I know everything about you Todd,\u201d the People v. Preds operative can be heard yelling as Wiseman exits the hotel\u2019s parking lot. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police, you f\u2014ing scumbag.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn a statement issued to CNET following the recirculation of his supposed bust video, an Nvidia spokesperson stated that though Wiseman was previously employed by the company, he had since been let go, though the company declined to comment on whether or not his alleged appearance in People v Pred\u2019s video had played a role in his exit.\n\n\nWhat do you make of Wiseman\u2019s alleged attempt to sexually assault an underage boy?

Joining the GeForce family next year will be a new RTX 2000 series configuration, the GeForce RTX 2050, as well as an update to the MX lineup with the addition of the GeForce MX550 and GeForce MX570. The combination of parts effectively provide a refresh to the low-end/entry-level segment of NVIDIA\u2019s laptop product stack, overhauling these products in time for new laptops to be released next year.\nWhile the announcement of these parts makes sense in context, the timing of this announcement is a bit odd, to say the least. NVIDIA is dropping this news not only on a Friday (a day normally reserved for bad news), but the last working Friday of the year at that \u2013 most of the tech industry has the remaining two Fridays off. So make of that what you will.\nStill, with CES 2022 starting bright and early on January 3rd, 2022, there\u2019s little time left to announce anything that won\u2019t be announced at the show itself or needs to be announced ahead of it. So it looks like NVIDIA is laying the groundwork for some partner laptop announcements next month, as OEMs will want new(er) laptop video card SKUs to pair with the new laptop CPUs that we\u2019re expecting to come out in the first part of 2022.\nMore curious, perhaps, is that NVIDIA\u2019s announcement today is for laptop parts that the company doesn\u2019t expect to hit retail shelves until the Spring of 2022. It\u2019s not unusual for OEM parts such as laptop GPUs to be announced a fair bit in advance, since laptops themselves tend to get announced ahead of time. However as it\u2019s still (barely) Fall \u2013 we haven\u2019t even reached Winter yet \u2013 Spring of 2022 is still over 3 months off, so NVIDIA is announcing these low-end parts well in advance of when they\u2019re expected to reach consumer hands. We\u2019ll see how things play out at CES, but this may be a sign that the industry is going to jump the gun a bit and use the show to announce laptops that won\u2019t be available until a few months later (CES is a fixed point in time; hardware dev cycles aren\u2019t).\nGeForce RTX 2050: Named By Turing, Powered by Ampere\nDiving into the hardware itself, let\u2019s start with the GeForce RTX 2050. The fastest of the new laptop accelerators announced today, it\u2019s also the most curious, for two reasons. First and foremost, this is the second time this month that NVIDIA has issued a new GeForce RTX 2000 series SKU, following the 12GB desktop RTX 2060 last week. Secondly, this is a very odd configuration, as it\u2019s fully RTX-enabled, RT cores and all; but NVIDIA never produced a low-end Turing TU10x chip with those features.\nAt this point we believe RTX 2050 to be based on TU106, given the feature set and RTX 2000 series branding.\nUpdate: NVIDIA has since responded to us and informed us that, despite the RTX 2000 series naming, RTX 2050 is based on Ampere, not Turing. Specifically, GA107, the same GPU used in the RTX 3050 series.\nFrom a high-level perspective, NVIDIA is clearly doing the tech industry equivalent of rummaging through the pantry and cooking up whatever is left over. The chip crunch means that NVIDIA is already producing every Ampere (GA10x) chip they can on Samsung\u2019s 8nm process, so they are completely capacity constrained there. This means that NVIDIA is looking to salvage virtually every last die that they can, and even though RTX 3050 is already itself based on a less-than-fully-functional GA107 die, NVIDIA is now going one step further by creating a further cut-down GA107 SKU. Meanwhile this also helps to keep the low-end of NVIDIA's product stack competitive, both against AMD's dGPUs and the ever-increasing performance of integrated GPUs.\nMuch odder, however, is NVIDIA's decision to classify the new SKU as an RTX 2000 series part. Which, for the previous 3 years, has been exclusively comprised of Turing TU10x parts. NVIDIA has not provided an explanation for this decision (and I doubt they ever will), but for now it means that the RTX 20 series will live on for another generation in some fashion thanks to the inclusion of an Ampere-based product. And while this just made talking about NVIDIA's laptop GPU lineup a whole lot harder, it's hard to particularly chide NVIDIA here since this is an Ampere part playing down a level (as it were), as opposed to the more common (and much loathed) tradition of rebadging older parts in order to satisfy OEM demands.\n(But if we're taking bets on NVIDIA's rationale, my money is on the company not wanting a 40-class RTX part, i.e. RTX 3040)\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 20/30 Series Laptop Specifications\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3060\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3050 Ti\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3050\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 2050\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3840\n2560\n2048\n2048\n\n\nROPs\n48\n32\n32\n32?\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1283 - 1703MHz\n1035 - 1695MHz\n1057 - 1740MHz\n1155 - 1477MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n192-bit\n128-bit\n128-bit\n64-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n6GB\n4GB\n4GB\n4GB\n\n\nTDP Range\n60 - 115W\n35 - 80W\n35 - 80W\n30 - 45W\n\n\nGPU\nGA106\nGA107\nGA107\nGA107\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\n\n\nLaunch Date\n01/26/2021\n05/11/2021\n05/11/2021\nSpring 2022\n\n\n\nSo what is the RTX 2050? We're essentially looking at an additional salvage bin of the GA107 GPU that is designed to occupy a slot below the Ampere-based RTX 3050 for Laptops. The RTX 2050 comes with 2048 CUDA cores \u2013 the same as the RTX 3050 \u2013 but is aimed at low-power configurations, so it has relatively low clockspeeds as a result. NVIDIA\u2019s official figures for the boost clock are just 1155MHz to 1477MHz. On paper, this gives it a total throughput of between 4.7 TFLOPS and 6.0 TFLOPS.\nAnd being that this is an RTX-branded part, it is fully RTX enabled, as NVIDIA likes to put it. That means it ships with both tensor cores and ray tracing (RT) cores enabled, and making the RTX 2050 the lowest-power/lowest-performing SKU to come with these features. In practice I have significant doubts that such a slow Ampere part can do ray tracing fast enough to be useful. However the inclusion of the tensor cores should be good news for anyone who\u2019s good with using DLSS to enhance sub-native resolution rendering.\nAnd you\u2019ll be doing a lot of lower-resolution gaming with the RTX 2050, as the biggest cutback to the underlying GA107 GPU is to its memory controllers. NVIDIA has disabled half of GA107's memory controllers, leaving it with a very narrow 64-bit memory bus. So while RTX 2050 has what we believe to be 32 ROPs to push pixels (the same as RTX 3050), it\u2019s quite light on the memory bandwidth that would be needed to keep those ROPs fully fed. Bus width aside, NVIDIA is using 14Gbps GDDR6 here, so the SKU gets (up to) 112GB/second of memory bandwidth, which is a straight one-half the bandwidth of the RTX 3050. Meanwhile the narrow memory bus means that laptop vendors can get away with a rather small physical implementation \u2013 they\u2019d need just 2 GDDR6 chips to pair with the already fairly small GA107 GPU.\nThe cut-down memory bus also is a big component in keeping power utilization of the RTX 2050 down. NVIDIA is aiming it for 30W to 45W configurations, which is close to their traditional power window for the MX series of laptop GPUs, and at the upper bound is about half of what RTX 3050 scales up to. Typically, these lower-power SKUs get paired with low-power CPUs (e.g. Intel H35 series), but given the chip shortage, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see laptop vendors pair them with just about anything that needs a dGPU.\nAnd for those pairings, laptop vendors will need to make sure they\u2019re using a chip with an integrated GPU. According to NVIDIA\u2019s specifications, they have disabled all of the chip\u2019s display outputs, so there are no HDMI or DisplayPort headers available to drive laptop or external displays. Put another way, Optimus is the only configuration supported, as the iGPU will be needed to drive the screen. In practice this isn\u2019t a very big shift since most laptops use Optimus configurations to begin with, but let it be noted that NVIDIA has explicitly removed any option to use the RTX 2050 alone. Unfortunately, this also means that G-Sync is not supported in any fashion.\nUltimately, if nothing else, RTX 2050 is going to go down in history as one of the weirder laptop SKUs that NVIDIA has ever released. But with the chip crunch seemingly remaining with us for some time yet, NVIDIA and other chip vendors are going to get increasingly creative to get any chips they can on the market. The resulting performance of this SKU won\u2019t be anything worth writing home about, I suspect \u2013 it\u2019s very much a low-end SKU \u2013 but if it\u2019s meaningfully faster than integrated graphics, then it\u2019s filling a much-needed role right now.\nGeForce MX550 & GeForce MX570: Mixing Turing and Ampere\nCompared to the RTX 2050, NVIDIA\u2019s new entry-level laptop GPUs are decidedly more traditional. NVIDIA\u2019s MX series of laptop GPUs take up the very bottom of NVIDIA\u2019s product stack, and are the first step above integrated graphics in most laptop designs. These parts are also commonly used for adding dGPUs to thin and light laptops, given the relatively small sizes of the chips used, as well as their low TDPs.\nLast updated back in August of 2020 with the GeForce MX450, for this generation of the MX series NVIDIA has brought back a two-chip stack. This gives us the MX550, and the faster MX570.\nUnfortunately, NVIDIA is notoriously mum when it comes to officially disclosing the specifications of the MX series, and this year is no different. So we don\u2019t have any specifications to share with you with respect to CUDA cores, ROPs, clockspeeds, or memory configurations. NVIDIA isn\u2019t even offering a \u201cGeForce Performance Score\u201d estimate for these parts, which in previous generations was a basic estimate of performance versus Intel\u2019s most recent integrated GPU. So there\u2019s very little we can definitively tell you besides the fact that these parts exist \u2013 or at least, will exist in the Spring of 2022.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce MX Series Laptop Specifications\n\n\n\u00a0\nMX570\nMX550\nMX450\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n>1024?\n1024?\n896\n\n\nROPs\n32?\n32?\n32\n\n\nMemory Clock\n12Gbps GDDR6?\n12Gbps GDDR6?\n10Gbps GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n64-bit\n64-bit\n64-bit\n\n\nTDP Range\n<30W?\n<30W?\n<30W\n\n\nGPU\nGA107\nTU117\nTU117\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nTuring\nTuring\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 8nm\nTSMC 12nm\nTSMC 12nm\n\n\nLaunch Date\nSpring 2022\nSpring 2022\nAugust 2020\n\n\n\nInevitably, once these parts start shipping someone will be about to query them and document their configuration details. But for the moment we can at least take a couple of educated guesses based on a few choice disclosures from NVIDIA, as well as their published photos.\n\nFirst and foremost, NVIDIA\u2019s literature confirms that MX550 is based on the Turing architecture. The last-generation MX450 was based on the TU117 GPU, and this is the logical choice for this generation as well. NVIDIA is not disclosing the number of CUDA cores enabled on MX550, but they are disclosing that it\u2019s more CUDA cores than the MX450, which came in at 896 CUDA cores. So it would seem that MX550 is 1024 CUDA cores \u2013 a full TU117 configuration. In the strictest sense this avoids the MX550 being a pure rebadge, but given the relatively small changes, I wouldn't expect it to perform significantly higher than the MX450 before it.\nMeanwhile MX570 makes no mention of Turing. Instead, NVIDIA mentions \u201cmore power-efficient CUDA Cores.\u201d And, after checking with the company, NVIDIA has since confirmed that, unlike MX550, MX570 is an Ampere-based part using GA107. This effectively makes it the smaller sibling to the new RTX 2050. This comes as a bit of a surprise, since NVIDIA tends to stick to a single GPU for the MX series \u2013 but it's clearly has been (and is going to be) that kind of year.\nBoth SKUs are also slated to come with faster memory. MX450 was typically seen with 10Gbps GDDR6, so it\u2019s a relatively safe assumption that NVIDIA is pairing the new MX500 parts with 12Gbps GDDR6. The MX series has always been equipped with a 64-bit memory bus, so that is almost certainly the same situation here. In which case we\u2019re looking at 96GB/sec of memory bandwidth.\nPast that, NVIDIA is offering no further details. The MX series is not sold on the basis of features, and NVIDIA is offering no indication that the Ampere-based MX570 has any of its advanced features enabled, such as the RT or tensor cores. For all practical purposes, it's functionally closer a feature level 12_1 SKU, rather than 12_2/DirectXU as the hardware is capable of.\nNVIDIA also isn\u2019t disclosing official TDPs here. But keeping in line with the target market for the MX500 series and previous parts\u2019 TDPs, we\u2019re almost certainly looking at sub-30W configurations here.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n18 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nAlistair - Friday, December 17, 2021 - link\nIt's fun going backwards. 12nm in 2019, moving to 8nm in 2021, and 7nm for AMD, 5nm for Apple... then back to 12nm in 2022... NO thanks\n\n\n\nRU482 - Friday, December 17, 2021 - link\nIntel be like \"Hey Guys, wait up\"\n\n\n\nAlistair - Friday, December 17, 2021 - link\nImagine what a 5nm RTX 3060 would be like? Call it the GTX 4050 and charge $200.\n\n\n\nmeacupla - Saturday, December 18, 2021 - link\nlow end nvidia products never used the best process node available.In fact, I'm surprised they used 12nm at all.I wouldn't have expected 16nm on Fermi architecture.\n\n\n\nKangal - Tuesday, December 21, 2021 - link\nI would hardly call the RTX-3050-Ti low-end.This position has always been Nvidia's high-end offering for cards that are 70W / don't need external power supply. It's been the goto option for HTPCs and Office PCs, and they generally have a price-premium. Since the original GTX-650 in 2012, then GTX 750-Ti in 2014, then the GTX-1050Ti in 2016, and lastly the GTX-1650 back in 2019. \n\n\n\nKangal - Tuesday, December 21, 2021 - link\nThis market has been underserved for a long while now by the OEMs. It's nice seeing the RTX-3050Ti looking competitive on-paper. Hopefully they will be available to buy, come in a Low-Profile (or Half-Height) variant, and cost a fair price. Though I doubt it. Otherwise, this market will continue to stagnate, or possibly be served by Intel's Xe, and dominated by Apple's own SoC/APU in the market.Would've been great to grab an ex-Office PC like a Dell OptiPlex 7070 SFF, with an i7-8700, for something like USD $270, throw in a $80 nVme, and extra RAM for $20. Then complete the system with an RTX-3050Ti for USD $130, for a total of USD $500 give or take. Not too bad for roughly the performance of the Xbox Series S. That is, if the Pcie x4 slot doesn't cause problems since the x16 slot is placed wrongly/too low....but I'm dreaming here, those types of deals are gone. \n\n\n\nSamus - Saturday, December 18, 2021 - link\nIt seems like putting 4GB VRAM on a 64-bit bus is a total waste on Ampere. My GTX970 has DOUBLE that memory bandwidth using ancient memory technology on a 7 year old card.\n\n\n\nSlyr762 - Saturday, December 18, 2021 - link\nAgreed. Actually, 970 was what I had before a 1080, lol.\n\n\n\nOxford Guy - Saturday, December 18, 2021 - link\nOver 3.5 GB.\n\n\n\nSamus - Sunday, December 19, 2021 - link\nWe used to think the 3.5GB thing mattered, especially when BF2042 was in beta and there was clear stutter when more than 3.5GB was being utilized. But like ALL games released over the years that the GTX970 has had the known segmented memory issue, ALL games have taken it into account, including 2042. Which says a lot considering 2042 doesn't even officially support cards prior to the GTX 1000-series.I've been running 2042 at 1080P (technically 1200P) in low detail just fine on my 970. And monitoring its memory usage in GPUZ, there is no stutter when more than 3.5GB is used.Posts on forums and reddit from beta testers quantify something happened during the beta that rectified this: even when the 512MB segment is used (which is only allocated a 32-bit memory interface to the crossbar) it is still exponentially faster than going to system RAM. What needed to be done to prevent the stutter was for DICE to make sure textures didn't get cached into this segment. You can monitor the memory allocation in detail using GPUZ to see the layout or whatever, and the game does what some other recent games do: two memory partitions. This is actually done for ALL GPU's in BF2042 and presumably other games, but there appears to be a specific memory allocation for GTX970 that, you guessed it, makes a 3.5GB and 512MB partition, and the 512MB partition is utilized by non-texture data that still benefits from having high speed memory. Keep in mind here that many videocards (like those in THIS AT POST) only have 64-bit memory buses so 32-bit is totally fine for logging, z-buffering, pre-rendering, meshes, shades\\colors, even HUD\\static data. The goal is to keep the data quickly accessible by the crossbar. DICE obviously didn't prioritized supporting unofficially supported hardware until the game released as that wasn't really the focus of the beta.Basically the only time the 0.5GB segment is ever an issue is when devs don't use it right, and textures are stored indiscriminately across the entire memory bus. Basically all games do, as they should, because the GTX970 was one of the best selling GPU's in history and there are a great deal of them still in use. Pretty crazy when you consider they are 7 years old, but it's also worth mentioning why some people like myself hold onto them: one of the last GPU's with a compact blower, the last gen of GPU's with analog output and native HD15, low power consumption, still relevant for 1080P gaming, actively supported drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

In a market filled with streaming devices at all sorts of different budgets \u2013 many of them cheaper than this high-spec model \u2013 the answer simply comes down to whether you want the best.From Fire TV Cubes to Roku streaming sticks, if all you're after is the latest movies and shows streamed without hassle, you can do so without breaking the bank \u2013 while even premium features like Dolby Vision are, these days, trickling down to cheaper models. But if you're after a bit more 'oomph' from the gadgets serving your TV, only the Shield TV Pro will do.An Android-powered set top box / games console, the Shield TV Pro is an impressively powerful streaming device, and is jam-packed with features that will tempt both movie buffs and gamers alike.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe excellent Nvidia Shield TV Pro just got a rare discount at Amazon\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia Shield lives!

That gets you the console itself, a new-and-improved remote control (which we'll discuss in detail shortly) and access to 20 great (if ageing) PC games that can be streamed over the internet as part of the GeForce Now service, which you can expand upon with your own purchases.With improved internal hardware and some new features which we'll get to in a second, it'd be a fantastic deal\u2026 were it not previously outdone by Nvidia's own Nvidia Shield TV Gaming Edition pack.\u00a0That offered the last-gen box, last-gen remote and the mic-packing Nvidia Shield Controller, which is now sold separately, for roughly the same price. It's a better device than ever before, with more features and a more powerful processor, but it\u2019s tough to say if the latest Shield represents better value than previously, even with the knowledge that any PS4 or Xbox One gamepad will pair with it, as well as newer PS5 DualSense or Xbox Series X controllers.Aside from its older siblings, there\u2019s not much that can compete with the Nvidia Shield TV Pro. The Amazon Fire TV Cube is just as capable as a film and TV streaming device, and is cheaper, but lacks the gaming chops the Shield TV Pro offers. If you've got the money, the Shield TV is hard to beat.(Image credit: Future)DesignThe Nvidia Shield TV Pro is a tiny little thing, given the power it packs. Shaped like a slim wedge with some angular indentations carved into it for posterity, it\u2019s about the size of two Kindle e-readers stacked on top of each other. It\u2019d just about fit into the back pocket of your jeans, in a pinch.\u00a0Laying flat or standing tall (when placed in a sold-separately stand accessory), it\u2019ll sit innocuously alongside your other AV gear, with its 'on' status depicted by a neon green light strip, the intensity of which can be tweaked if you find it a little garish.Around the back you'll find two USB 3.0 ports, a 4K HDR-compatible HDMI port, an Ethernet port and a proprietary power port. Wi-Fi is built-in (802.11ac dual-band) as is Bluetooth 5.0 for connecting wireless accessories. The only cable included in the box, however, is for the power. You'll have to supply your own HDMI (and USB if required) lead.(Image credit: Future)Under the hood is 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The RAM remains unchanged then, but we've seen other Shield models with as much as 500GB of on-board storage, so a little more here would have been appreciated. Still, the two USB ports make adding external storage a cinch, not to mention plugging in a wired controller or keyboard and mouse.What's really changed then is the processor \u2013 the first major upgrade to the Shield TV range since it was introduced in 2015. On-board here is the Tegra X1+ processor \u2013 representing a 25% performance boost over the retiring Tegra X1, it\u2019s of the same family of chips currently powering the latest Nintendo Switch models, including the Nintendo Switch Lite.The Shield TV family has never been a slouch in terms of performance, but the addition of the X1+ makes everything feel a tad snappier, and also facilitates some of the new feature additions on-board here.(Image credit: Future)Features and interfaceIf you\u2019ve used an Android TV device before, you\u2019ll know what to expect from the Nvidia Shield TV. It\u2019s pretty much been the vanilla Android TV experience as Google designed it, with some small tweaks (mostly in terms of settings options) specific to the Shield TV Pro\u2019s features.It offers rows of content, based on your installed apps. The top row is an overview of your most regularly-used apps, with the rows that follow offering rich artwork and content recommendation snippets based on what the associated app offers. All of this can be re-organised or hidden as you see fit.\u00a0The Shield TV Pro therefore gives you access to all the major streaming services in their 4K / HDR configurations, from Netflix to Amazon Prime Video to the BBC iPlayer and everything in between. There\u2019s also media server apps like Plex, a ton of Android TV games to try out (including some exclusive to the Shield and its powerful innards) and, for those happy to navigate the potential pitfalls, a host of retro gaming emulators to tinker with.Keep in mind that not every Android app you have on your phone has an Android TV variant, and that browsing the app store for Android TV can be a pain \u2013 you always get the feeling you\u2019re not being shown every possible app from a search.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)A 2021 update did bring some new changes, removing app shortcuts from the home screen, and expanding the apps view to get more services onscreen at one time. There's also now a Discover tab with content recommendations, and new banner promotions for\u00a0Disney Plus shows. It's a better interface, but altogether too different.Plus, Google Chromecast is built-in here, so any Chromecast-supporting mobile app that you want to throw up onto the big screen via the Shield will be supported here.It\u2019s worth noting that all this can be browsed using voice commands from within any section of the interface or from inside an app, with the included remote featuring a mic. Google Assistant is the native voice butler built in, but the Nvidia Shield TV Pro can be controlled with Amazon\u2019s Alexa devices, too. As such, the Shield TV Pro is an effective smart home hub, as well as being a media player and gaming box.So what\u2019s new in terms of features for the Nvidia Shield TV Pro? It\u2019s mostly down to video playback performance.Shield TV already supports plenty of HDR formats, but it now also can play back Dolby Vision content, a premium format that tweaks brightness and contrast levels using frame-by-frame metadata. If your TV supports it, it\u2019s an incredibly rewarding feature, bringing great depth to a scene.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)It also means the Shield now supports both of Dolby\u2019s premium cinema formats, including Dolby Atmos audio, which can make sounds appear to come from behind and above a movie viewer, as well as in front, for a truly immersive experience \u2013 provided you\u2019ve got compatible speaker gear hooked up to your TV.The second of the big additions is a new AI image upscaler that can be toggled on or off at the push of a button. It\u2019s fantastic, and transformative for content that\u2019s running below 4K resolution.\u00a0Powered by an algorithm determined by a neural network that has been fed thousands of hours of footage, it\u2019s processed locally and can hugely sharpen softer sources, making them worthy of your 4K TV, not to mention standard-definition sources (like some YouTube content) running on a 1080p set.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t work across every app (anything running above 1080p or 30fps won\u2019t accept it), and there are some occasions where it can be overly aggressive where an artistic intention may actually call for a softer focus. But for the most part it\u2019s an excellent addition \u2013 so much so that a side-by-side slider, intended as a demo tool, has been left accessible in the menus to play with.GeForce Now and GameStreamIf one thing sets the Nvidia Shield TV Pro apart from other streaming boxes, it\u2019s the built-in GeForce Now service. It essentially gives you access to top-tier PC games on your TV, whether you have a gaming PC or not \u2013 provided your internet connection is capable of reaching consistent, moderately-fast speeds. GeForce Now is currently free to use, as it's still considered to be in a 'beta' phase \u2013 what it may eventually cost once it's beyond beta remains to be seen.The feature works by creating a virtual PC on Nvidia\u2019s remote servers, making use of super-charged components to deliver max-settings gameplay visuals from demanding games.\u00a0These are then streamed in as video feeds to your Shield TV Pro, which you can control \u2013 all the heavy lifting is done remotely, so all you need is a fast enough internet connection to keep the video from stuttering as you play.\u00a0It's a similar concept to Google Stadia.Nvidia has done much to improve GeForce Now over the years. Running at maximum resolutions of 4K and at 60fps, a solid internet connection will see you manage to play games very smoothly. A recommended speed of 25Mbps is required for stable 1080p / 30fps streaming.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)The list of games GeForce Now supports is continually expanding, and adding to your library is easy \u2013 link up your Steam account, and any supported games you\u2019ve purchased there are then playable through GeForce Now. You can buy games from Steam via GeForce Now too, meaning you don\u2019t even need access to a PC to play.GeForce Now began life as a Netflix-like subscription service, giving you access to a catalog of games for a monthly fee. The remnants of that service remain, with all Shield TV Pro owners getting access to twenty included games straight out of the box, including Batman Arkham City, a handful of LEGO games and Tomb Raider. Not new titles, but welcome for free all the same.It\u2019s not always seamless, however. Some games are better supported than others (those developed with gamepads in mind from the beginning, for instance), and you\u2019ll sometimes be thrust into the Steam 'Big Picture' interface left wondering what\u2019s going on, to be presented with a pop-up starter menu launcher window for your game in question.\u00a0The Nvidia Shield TV Pro no longer comes with a controller, making the excellent (pictured) Nvidia Shield Controller now a sold-separately accessory. (Image credit: Future)But there are benefits to playing streamed games beyond the low hardware entry requirements \u2013 games load in an instant without the need to download tens of gigabytes of data in advance, as well as all the latest updates and patches being applied automatically.The Shield TV Pro also has a feature called GameStream, which has a similar concept to the GeForce Now service. Providing you have a computer packing a compatible Nvidia GPU, you can stream almost anything from that machine to the Shield TV Pro.\u00a0It takes some tinkering, and is no good to those without a reasonably powerful gaming PC in another room of the house, but again stresses the flexibility of Nvidia\u2019s powerhouse box.(Image credit: Future)RemoteA new remote control comes in the box with the Nvidia Shield TV Pro, and it\u2019s thoughtfully reconsidered. Rather than being flat, it\u2019s now shaped like a prism, and includes dedicated playback controls, as well as a selection wheel. A dedicated Netflix button is also included, as well as a mic-on button and a \u2018Quick Menu\u2019 button that can be customised in the interface to jump straight to any function you choose.\u00a0The remote also doubles up as an IR blaster now for controlling your TV, while it\u2019ll also beep if lost if you make use of the mostly-inessential Nvidia Shield TV mobile app.Another improvement is that the remote now makes use of AAA batteries, rather than the last generation\u2019s button-shaped watch batteries. However, it\u2019s still not as convenient as the first generation Shield remote\u2019s USB rechargeable power supply.Want something cheaper? Try the new-and-improved standard Nvidia Shield(Image credit: Nvidia)The Nvidia Shield TV Pro launches alongside a new standard Nvidia Shield model, priced more affordably at $149.99 / \u00a3129.99. In terms of what it can do, it\u2019s a very similar product, with the same processor bump and upscaling features as the Pro.\u00a0But in terms of industrial design, they couldn\u2019t be more different \u2013 the standard Shield is shaped like a relay baton, and is designed to sit behind your TV, out of sight, the cylindrical shape used for its Wi-Fi signal boosting properties, apparently. It comes with the new remote, too.With just 8GB of built-in storage, only 2GB of RAM, and no full-size USB ports (microSD cards will instead be needed for storage expansion, while USB controllers will be a pain to get working), Nvidia is aiming this one squarely at media consumers, while the Pro is for the gamer that likes to tinker under the hood.VerdictThere\u2019s not much new within this Nvidia Shield TV Pro edition, but that doesn\u2019t stop it being an essential buy for newcomers to the product. It\u2019s unrivalled when it comes to its 4K HDR streaming capabilities, has wide app support thanks to its Android TV foundations, and is littered with potential for gamers, whether playing games stored locally on the device or over the net through the GeForce Now service.However, there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve to the many tricks the Shield Pro is capable of, and you\u2019re going to need a strong web connection to take advantage of all its gaming powers. Android TV as an interface needs some finessing too (as does GeForce Now\u2019s game browsing library) \u2013 but any faults with Android TV lie with Google, not Nvidia.What is disappointing is the price \u2013 for the same cost as the older Shield TV Gaming edition, the Shield Pro really only adds a processor bump and a nifty upscaling feature. And that\u2019s at the expense of a bundled Nvidia Shield controller, which we were fans of. As a result, what was already an expensive streaming proposition offers less value than with previous generations.As a device then, it\u2019s almost unreservedly recommended. But it may sting to know that the Shield TV Pro isn\u2019t quite the deal it once was.Check out the best streaming devices at any budgetNvidia Shield TV Pro: Price Comparison1 Amazon customer review\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $199View $418ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nGerald LynchSocial Links NavigationGerald is Editor-in-Chief of iMore.com.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nGiven that Nvidia has been forced to revive a handful of older graphics cards to try and ease the demand for the perpetually out of stock RTX 3080 series, you might assume the announcement of the RTX 2050 laptop GPU is the same old refrain.That\u2019s actually not the case. Despite its name, the GeForce RTX 2050 is actually based on the same GA107 Ampere design seen in the RTX 3050 laptop GPU, rather than the Turing architecture of other RTX 20-series cards.\u00a0The RTX 2050 could power some of the best gaming laptops for those on a budget when it arrives next year. Here's what we know so far.\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050 specsOf course, there are some clear drawbacks to explain the smaller number. While the RTX 3050 features a 128-bit memory bus, the RTX 2050 halves this to 64-bits, and the boosted clock speed is capped at 1,477MHz instead of 1,740MHz. But otherwise, it\u2019s the same, right down to the 2,048 CUDA cores, 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM and ability to pump out ray traced graphics (albeit not as effectively as pricier hardware).\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5050 laptop GPU just showed up in LG Gram 2025 \u2014 but there's bad news\n\n\n\n\nI was hyped for Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5050 \u2014 until I saw these leaked specs\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an advantage to these paired back specifications besides price, too: energy efficiency. While RTX 3050 laptops power consumption ranges between 35 and 80W, the RTX 2050 laptop GPU is listed as ranging between 30 and 45W.Alongside the RTX 2050, Nvidia also announced another couple of lower cost laptop GPU options: the MX550 and MX570. The former is based on Turing architecture, while the latter uses Ampere, but the market for both is the same: thin and light laptops that need slightly more grunt than integrated graphics for photo and video editing, as well as some light gaming.Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050 release date and availabilityWhat\u2019s slightly odd about this announcement \u2014 other than the confusing 20-series name for what appears to be a 30-series GPU \u2014 is the timeline involved. Nvidia says that all three laptop GPUs are being readied for Spring 2022, which is obviously some way off yet.\u00a0Why the long lead time? Well, it may be down to the global chip shortage, but it could also have something to do with the busy January Nvidia is reportedly set to have.\u00a0Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.According to the rumor mill, Nvidia is due to release three different desktop GPUs next month including two RTX 3050 variants alongside an RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3090 Ti. Whether availability will be any better than what\u2019s nominally possible to buy now remains extremely doubtful, however.\u00a0Today's best Gaming Laptops deals85 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $699 $469.93View $879.99 $599.99ViewLow Stock $605ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAlan Martin Social Links NavigationFreelance contributor Alan has been writing about tech for over a decade, covering phones, drones and everything in between.

This causes reduced performance in GPU-dependent workloads such as machine learning frameworks. Here's how to expose your host's NVIDIA GPU to your containers. \n                        Making GPUs Work In Docker\n               \nDocker containers share your host's kernel but bring along their own operating system and software packages. This means they lack the NVIDIA drivers used to interface with your GPU. Docker doesn't even add GPUs to containers by default so a plain docker run won't see your hardware at all.\nAt a high level, getting your GPU to work is a two-step procedure: install the drivers within your image, then instruct Docker to add GPU devices to your containers at runtime.\nThis guide focuses on modern versions of CUDA and Docker. The latest release of NVIDIA Container Toolkit is designed for combinations of CUDA 10 and Docker Engine 19.03 and later. Older builds of CUDA, Docker, and the NVIDIA drivers may require additional steps. \n                        Adding the NVIDIA Drivers\n               \nMake sure you've got the NVIDIA drivers working properly on your host before you continue with your Docker configuration. You should be able to successfully run nvidia-smi and see your GPU's name, driver version, and CUDA version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use your GPU with Docker, begin by adding the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to your host. This integrates into Docker Engine to automatically configure your containers for GPU support.\nAdd the toolkit's package repository to your system using the example command:\ndistribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \n && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \n && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list\nNext install the nvidia-docker2 package on your host:\napt-get update\napt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\nRestart the Docker daemon to complete the installation:\nsudo systemctl restart docker\nThe Container Toolkit should now be operational. You're ready to start a test container. \n                        Starting a Container With GPU Access\n               \nAs Docker doesn't provide your system's GPUs by default, you need to create containers with the --gpus flag for your hardware to show up. You can either specify specific devices to enable or use the all keyword.\nThe nvidia/cuda images are preconfigured with the CUDA binaries and GPU tools. Start a container and run the nvidia-smi command to check your GPU's accessible. The output should match what you saw when using nvidia-smi on your host. The CUDA version could be different depending on the toolkit versions on your host and in your selected container image.\ndocker run -it --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.4.0-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Selecting a Base Image\n               \nUsing one of the nvidia/cuda tags is the quickest and easiest way to get your GPU workload running in Docker. Many different variants are available; they provide a matrix of operating system, CUDA version, and NVIDIA software options. The images are built for multiple architectures.\nEach tag has this format:\n11.4.0-base-ubuntu20.04 \n\n11.4.0 - CUDA version.\n                        \n\nbase - Image flavor.\n                        \n\nubuntu20.04 - Operating system version.\n                        \n\nThree different image flavors are available. The base image is a minimal option with the essential CUDA runtime binaries. runtime is a more fully-featured option that includes the CUDA math libraries and NCCL for cross-GPU communication. The third variant is devel which gives you everything from runtime as well as headers and development tools for creating custom CUDA images.\nIf one of the images will work for you, aim to use it as your base in your Dockerfile. You can then use regular Dockerfile instructions to install your programming languages, copy in your source code, and configure your application. It removes the complexity of manual GPU set up steps.\nFROM nvidia/cuda:11.4.0-base-ubuntu20.04\nRUN apt update\nRUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\nRUN pip install tensorflow-gpu\nCOPY tensor-code.py .\nENTRYPONT [\"python3\", \"tensor-code.py\"]\nBuilding and running this image with the --gpus flag would start your Tensor workload with GPU acceleration. \n                        Manually Configuring an Image\n               \nYou can manually add CUDA support to your image if you need to choose a different base. The best way to achieve this is to reference the official NVIDIA Dockerfiles.\nCopy the instructions used to add the CUDA package repository, install the library, and link it into your path. We're not reproducing all the steps in this guide as they vary by CUDA version and operating system.\nPay attention to the environment variables at the end of the Dockerfile - these define how containers using your image integrate with the NVIDIA Container Runtime:\nENV NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES all\nENV NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES compute,utility\nYour image should detect your GPU once CUDA's installed and the environment variables have been set. This gives you more control over the contents of your image but leaves you liable to adjust the instructions as new CUDA versions release. \n                        How Does It Work?\n               \nThe NVIDIA Container Toolkit is a collection of packages which wrap container runtimes like Docker with an interface to the NVIDIA driver on the host. The libnvidia-container library is responsible for providing an API and CLI that automatically provides your system's GPUs to containers via the runtime wrapper.\nThe nvidia-container-toolkit component implements a container runtime prestart hook. This means it's notified when a new container is about to start. It looks at the GPUs you want to attach and invokes libnvidia-container to handle container creation.\nThe hook is enabled by nvidia-container-runtime. This wraps your \"real\" container runtime such as containerd or runc to ensure the NVIDIA prestart hook is run. Your existing runtime continues the container start process after the hook has executed. When the container toolkit is installed, you'll see the NVIDIA runtime selected in your Docker daemon config file. \n                        Summary\n               \nUsing an NVIDIA GPU inside a Docker container requires you to add the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to the host. This integrates the NVIDIA drivers with your container runtime.\nCalling docker run with the --gpu flag makes your hardware visible to the container. This must be set on each container you launch, after the Container Toolkit has been installed.\nNVIDIA provides preconfigured CUDA Docker images that you can use as a quick starter for your application. If you need something more specific, refer to the official Dockerfiles to assemble your own that's still compatible with the Container Toolkit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Neo's Nokia 8110 lived in my head rent free for 20 years, and now Nvidia's offering a chance to win three custom gaming PCs straight from the Nebuchadnezzar's concept book.These are three seriously awesome-looking PCs, and the specs are made to match.\u00a0Image 1 of 3Backup Operator(Image credit: Nvidia)Nebuchadnezzar(Image credit: Nvidia)The Breacher(Image credit: Nvidia)First, the Backup Operator, made by Digital Storm and Stefan Ulrich, a case mod extraordinaire going by the name RandomDesign. This design aims to look like something you would find Morpheus' using himself, scavenged out of old bits of once deadly machines. It definitely looks the part.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nGot the Nvidia 50-series and AMD X3D stock-out blues?

This custom H710I takes inspiration from its namesake and is wrapped in the robotic tendrils of the sentinels. Inside this is an RTX 3080 Ti (no surprise there) and an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, alongside 32GB of RAM and NZXT's Z73 Kraken all-in-one.Then you have The Breacher, and this one is going to make me seriously jealous of whoever wins it. This machine comes from Staszek 'Tips' Wiertelak, a professional modder with GeForce Garage, and is intended to look like a pirate signal impersonating a hacked sentinel.Your next machine(Image credit: Future)Best gaming PC: the top pre-built machines from the pros\nBest gaming laptop: perfect notebooks for mobile gamingThe Breacher also comes with some serious kit inside. The RTX 3090 should see any game dealt with at high resolution, and that's paired with AMD's Ryzen 9 3950X for serious core firepower. That's next to 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD, and Nvidia says the whole PC part of the system can be easily removed from the mod for regular use.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Furthermore, there are five custom The Matrix Resurrections RTX 3080 Ti GPU backplates to be won.

The 'GPU-N' and its respective COPA designs have been discussed along with their possible specifications and simulated performance results.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe 'GPU-N' is said to feature 134 SM units (vs 104 SM units of A100). This makes up a total of 8576 cores or a 24% increase over the current Ampere A100 solution. The chip has been measured at 1.4 GHz, the same theoretical clock speed of the Ampere A100 and Volta V100 (not to be confused as the final clocks). Other specifications include a 60 MB L2 cache, a 50% increase over Ampere A100, and a DRAM bandwidth of 2.68 TB/s that can scale up to 6.3 TB/s. The HBM2e DRAM capacity is 100 GB and can be expanded up to 233 GB with the COPA implementations. It is configured around a 6144-bit bus interface at clock speeds of 3.5 Gbps.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nNVIDIA V100\nNVIDIA A100\nGPU-N\n\n\n\n\nSMs\n80\n108\n134\n\n\nGPU frequency (GHz)\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n\n\nFP32 (TFLOPS)\n15.7\n19.5\n24.2\n\n\nFP16 (TFLOPS)\n125\n312\n779\n\n\nL2 cache (MB)\n6\n40\n60\n\n\nDRAM BW (GB/s)\n900\n1,555\n2,687\n\n\nDRAM Capacity (GB)\n16\n40\n100\n\n\n\nComing to the performance numbers, the 'GPU-N' (presumably Hopper GH100) produces 24.2 TFLOPs of FP32 (24% increase over A100) and 779 TFLOPs FP16 (2.5x increase over A100) which sounds really close to the 3x gains that were rumored for GH100 over A100. Compared to AMD's CDNA 2 'Aldebaran' GPU on the Instinct MI250X accelerator, the FP32 performance is less than half (95.7 TFLOPs vs 24.2 TFLOPs) but the FP16 performance is 2.15x higher.\nFrom previous information, we know that NVIDIA's H100 accelerator would be based on an MCM solution and utilize TSMC's 5nm process node. Hopper is supposed to have two next-gen GPU modules so we are looking at 288 SM units in total. We can't give a rundown on the core count yet since we don't know the number of cores featured in each SMs but if it's going to stick to 64 cores per SM, then we get 18,432 cores which are 2.25x more than the full GA100 GPU configuration. NVIDIA could also leverage more FP64, FP16 & Tensor cores within its Hopper GPU which would drive up performance immensely. And that's going to be a necessity to rival Intel's Ponte Vecchio which is expected to feature 1:1 FP64.\n\nIt is likely that the final configuration will come with 134 of the 144 SM units enabled on each GPU module and as such, we are likely looking at a single GH100 die in action. But it is unlikely that NVIDIA would reach the same FP32 or FP64 Flops as MI200's without using GPU Sparsity.\nBut NVIDIA may likely have a secret weapon in their sleeves and that would be the COPA-based GPU implementation of Hopper. NVIDIA talks about two Domain-Specialized COPA-GPUs based on next-generation architecture, one for HPC and one for DL segment. The HPC variant features a very standard approach which consists of an MCM GPU design and the respective HBM/MC+HBM (IO) chiplets but the DL variant is where things start to get interesting.\u00a0 The DL variant houses a huge cache on an entirely separate die that is interconnected with the GPU modules.\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nLLC Capacity\nDRAM BW\nDRAM Capacity\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n(MB)\n(TB/s)\n(GB)\n\n\nGPU-N\n60\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-1\n960\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-2\n960\n4.5\n167\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-3\n1,920\n2.7\n100\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-4\n1,920\n4.5\n167\n\n\nCOPA-GPU-5\n1,920\n6.3\n233\n\n\nPerfect L2\ninfinite\ninfinite\ninfinite\n\n\n\n\nVarious variants have been outlined with up to 960 / 1920 MB of LLC (Last-Level-Cache), HBM2e DRAM capacities of up to 233 GB, and bandwidth of up to 6.3 TB/s. These are all theoretical but given that NVIDIA has discussed them now, we may likely see a Hopper variant with such a design during the full unveil at GTC 2022.\nNVIDIA Hopper GH100 'Official Specs':\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Graphics CardTesla K40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla M40\n(PCI-Express)Tesla P100\n(PCI-Express)Tesla P100 (SXM2)Tesla V100 (SXM2)NVIDIA A100 (SXM4)NVIDIA H100 (PCIe)NVIDIA H100 (SMX5)\n\n\n\n\nGPUGK110 (Kepler)GM200 (Maxwell)GP100 (Pascal)GP100 (Pascal)GV100 (Volta)GA100 (Ampere)GH100 (Hopper)GH100 (Hopper)\n\n\nProcess Node28nm28nm16nm16nm12nm7nm4nm4nm\n\n\nTransistors7.1 Billion8 Billion15.3 Billion15.3 Billion21.1 Billion54.2 Billion80 Billion80 Billion\n\n\nGPU Die Size551 mm2601 mm2610 mm2610 mm2815mm2826mm2814mm2814mm2\n\n\nSMs1524565680108114132\n\n\nTPCs1524282840545766\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores Per SM19212864646464128128\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores / SM64432323232128128\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores2880307235843584512069121459216896\n\n\nFP64 CUDA Cores9609617921792256034561459216896\n\n\nTensor CoresN/AN/AN/AN/A640432456528\n\n\nTexture Units240192224224320432456528\n\n\nBoost Clock875 MHz1114 MHz1329MHz1480 MHz1530 MHz1410 MHzTBDTBD\n\n\nTOPs (DNN/AI)N/AN/AN/AN/A125 TOPs1248 TOPs\n2496 TOPs with Sparsity1600 TOPs\n3200 TOPs2000 TOPs\n4000 TOPs\n\n\nFP16 ComputeN/AN/A18.7 TFLOPs21.2 TFLOPs30.4 TFLOPs312 TFLOPs\n624 TFLOPs with Sparsity1600 TFLOPs2000 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP32 Compute5.04 TFLOPs6.8 TFLOPs10.0 TFLOPs10.6 TFLOPs15.7 TFLOPs19.4 TFLOPs\n156 TFLOPs With Sparsity800 TFLOPs1000 TFLOPs\n\n\nFP64 Compute1.68 TFLOPs0.2 TFLOPs4.7 TFLOPs5.30 TFLOPs7.80 TFLOPs19.5 TFLOPs\n(9.7 TFLOPs standard)48 TFLOPs60 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Interface384-bit GDDR5384-bit GDDR54096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM24096-bit HBM26144-bit HBM2e5120-bit HBM2e5120-bit HBM3\n\n\nMemory Size12 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s24 GB GDDR5 @ 288 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s\n12 GB HBM2 @ 549 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 732 GB/s16 GB HBM2 @ 900 GB/sUp To 40 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/s\nUp To 80 GB HBM2 @ 1.6 TB/sUp To 80 GB HBM2e @  2.0 GbpsUp To 80 GB HBM3 @  3.0 Gbps\n\n\nL2 Cache Size1536 KB3072 KB4096 KB4096 KB6144 KB40960 KB51200 KB51200 KB\n\n\nTDP235W250W250W300W300W400W350W700W\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs;

Upgrade Now          Nvidia\u2019s $40 billion Arm deal is all but dead \u2014 but it\u2019s not a huge loss      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor  December 4, 2021 3 min read        46   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -3.79%       Graphics card giant Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) plans to buy Arm, which licenses chip designs, looks all but dead after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal on Thursday. The move is just the latest blow to the $40 billion deal and would seem to strike the final blow to a deal that would have been one of the largest chip industry mergers in history.  Nvidia\u2019s stock, however, was up slightly on the news late Thursday, though it was down Friday along with the broader market. That could point to a recognition among investors that the deal with U.K.-based Arm was on life support as is and unlikely to go through. Susquehanna senior equity analyst Chris Rolland told Yahoo Finance after Nvidia\u2019s Q3 earnings in November that the deal\u2019s demise was already built into Nvidia\u2019s stock price. Rolland further explained that Nvidia leadership\u2019s own language during its Q3 earnings call seemed to point to an expectation that the acquisition would fail. \u201cI think some of the commentary [on Wednesday] kind of puts the final nail in the Arm coffin here,\u201d Rolland said.   In its suit, the FTC says that the Nvidia deal would give one of the largest chip companies power over technology that rivals depend on to build their own chips. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s complaint alleges that the combined firm would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation technologies, including those used to run data centers and driver-assistance systems in cars,\u201d the commission said in a statement. Nvidia responded to the suit via a spokesperson\u2019s statement saying: \u201cAs we move into this next step in the FTC process, \u200b\u200bwe will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition.\u201d  The FTC\u2019s suit comes after the U.K.\u2019s competition commission launched an in-depth probe into the proposed deal. China and the E.U. would also need to sign off on the acquisition. Industry leaders like Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) \u2014 which rely on Arm\u2019s designs to build their own chips \u2014 have all come out against the deal. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pressed the case for the Arm acquisition saying, \u201cThe benefit of Arm being part of Nvidia is that we could accelerate their R&D scale.\u201d The loss of the Arm deal wouldn\u2019t necessarily hurt Nvidia, though. The company already builds processors based on Arm\u2019s designs and can continue to do so into the future. No, it won\u2019t reap the rewards of charging competitors to use Arm\u2019s designs, but it also won\u2019t face any setbacks in its production pipeline.   Story Continues What\u2019s more, Nvidia is a graphics and AI company. It will be more interesting to see how the company can innovate in those areas, such as how it\u2019s using its Omniverse to teach self-driving cars how to maneuver on streets.So while the Arm deal looks finished, it\u2019s not exactly a total loss for Nvidia.Sign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter More from DanTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey steps down, CTO Parag Agrawal tapped to replace him Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings report is the \u2018nail in the coffin\u2019 for $40 billion ARM deal: Analyst Nvidia CEO Huang: AI is the 'most powerful technology force the world has known' Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and redditGot a tip?

Though the global chip shortage has ravaged the best graphics cards' availability for some time now, Kress stated that NVIDIA is confident the situation will be better by the second half of 2022 (via PCMag).That estimate aligns with multiple expert opinions predicting consumer electronics are likely to be in far better shape by 2022's second half, as well as a report from DigiTimes stating that NVIDIA is set to unleash its RTX 40-series unto the world in that same frame. The cards are said to be based on Ada Lovelace architecture and are being manufactured with TSMC now that NVIDIA's swapped over from Samsung because the latter wasn't cutting the mustard.For those unwilling to wait until late 2022 to get their hands on a graphics card, there is another option: Instead of waiting to go forward in time with the RTX 40-series, go back in time with the RTX 20-series, which is seeing a revitalization thanks to the RTX 2060 12GB edition. It's a real product that's going to hit markets shortly, though how long it will stay on them is anyone's guess. Though the product's existence is good news for gamers, it may very well be even better news for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, as the cards are reportedly great for anyone interested in learning how to mine crypto.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nRobert CarnevaleSocial Links NavigationRobert Carnevale is the News Editor for Windows Central.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia believes that supply of its hard to find graphics cards will improve by the second half of 2022, yet another glimmer of hope in a year full of false starts on the graphics card front.The prediction comes courtesy of Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, who spoke at the UBS Global TMT Virtual Conference on December 6.\u00a0During the 45 minute event, Kress addressed Nvidia's attempts to get ahead of the semiconductor shortages and boost supply of its most in-demand graphics cards like the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 that no one seems to be able to find more than a year after their release.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 GPU stock rumored to be \u2018basically non-existent\u2019 for launch day, and RTX 5080 doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019ll be much better\n\n\n\n\nBad news, PC gamers: this retailer\u2019s worst-case prediction for the Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU is a long wait until almost June for the GPU to be back in stock\n\n\n\n\"It's early to speculate in terms of demand trends as we go forward into the next year,\" Kress said, \"but we do believe demand is strong, we believe right now that channel inventories are very lean. We believe we still have a great opportunity in front of us to upgrade gamers to that Ampere architecture.\"\"The company as a whole will take the appropriate work to continue to procure more supply,\u201d Kress went on to say, \"because right now we have situations where that demand exceeds our overall supply.\"Kress was optimistic about Nvidia's prospects for 2022, however.\u201cWe believe we will be in a better situation in terms of supply when we look at the second half of next year.\"Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It's been a very long year for gamers, to say the leastNvidia has been trying for more than a year to get more of its graphics cards into the hands of gamers, and there is some evidence that its efforts are real.\u00a0Immediately after the first Ampere cards launched in September and October 2020, they sold out at every retailer within minutes. Initially, the shortage was blamed on higher than expected demand, but as time went on, other problems quickly revealed themselves.Soon after the new RTX 3080 graphics cards sold out before legitimate customers could buy them, Nvidia announced that it would review purchases on its site to root out bots buying up all the available stock. Even we thought that this would be a temporary problem, but it hasn't been.\u00a0Graphics cards, as well as video game consoles like the PS5, are essentially unattainable through normal means because automated bot networks have been clearing out stock all year with no signs of stopping.(Image credit: Manuel Medir/Getty Images)On top of that, a boom in Ethereum prices in 2021 caused even more demand for the cards from cryptominers.Nvidia made two major efforts to stop graphics card diversion from gamers to cryptominers: Light Hash Rate (LHR) GPUs, which halved the hash rate used for mining Ethereum to hopefully cut off demand; and cryptomining processors (CMPs), which Nvidia hoped would be more attractive to cryptominers than the consumer RTX cards.Neither of these efforts have made an appreciable difference in gamers ability to buy a new graphics card. Even a crash in cryptocurrency prices hasn't seemed to slow things down, and with cryptocurrency prices on the rise again, we could be in for more of the same.All through 2021, gamers in particular have been looking for signs that an end to the shortage was at least on the horizon, and whenever the price of cryptocurrencies crashed or a new contract was announced, many hoped that it would make a dent in the problem.It hasn't though, and Nvidia's latest graphics cards are effectively as hard to find as they were the day they went on sale, so repeatedly disappointed gamers can be forgiven for looking at Nvidia's optimism for the second half of next year with a bit of skepticism and even a touch of bitterness.Kress, though, believes that Nvidia LHR cards, the introduction of CMPs, and renewed government interest in regulating cryptocurrencies will reduce demand for Nvidia cards.(Image credit: FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)Nvidia hopes that new supply contracts will make a difference\"A large part of the strategy for improving supply is locking in more supply capacity by entering into longer term contracts,\" Kress said.\"We also have to think about our add-in card partners, our OEMs, which are also integral in terms of getting our cards in the hands of gamers.\"\"That takes us working not only procuring inventory now in the next couple quarters, but as you've seen us also procuring longer-term \u2013 longer term can be more than a year \u2013 and you've also seen us now enter into agreements that will take us out many years in terms of long-term capacity needs.\"While Kress certainly sounds optimistic, as PCMag notes, none of this necessarily translates into more cards getting into the hands of gamers.Specifically, securing longer term capacity doesn't automatically mean that all demand can be met by this time next year. This means scalpers are still likely to buy up those cards too and resell them at grossly inflated prices, though the prices gamers might have to pay could be less than they are now.And there isn't an upper limit on how many graphics cards crypto miners will want to buy. If a graphics card is profitable, they will buy it. If anything, the best hope any of us has for getting a new graphics card before the latest cards become last-gen tech is for Ethereum 2.0 to finally be implemented.That will move the cryptocurrency over to a proof-of-stake model from its current proof-of-work model that requires GPUs to perform intense mathematical operations in order to mine the currency. Without proof-of-work, you don't need graphics cards.Ethereum 2.0 is expected to roll out some time next year, so Kress might not be wrong to say that the supply situation should improve by the second half of 2022. Between more capacity on Nvidia's part and the drop in demand from Ethereum 2.0, it may be easier for gamers to get the graphics cards next year.We wouldn't blame you if you were skeptical, though. We've heard this before, and you can only have your hopes dashed so many times. \u00a0AMD vs Nvidia: who makes the best graphics cards\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

The new graphics card will be aimed in the sub $300 US segment which will see some heated competition between the three GPU makers in the first half of 2022.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Allegedly Launches on 27th January, Will Feature 8 GB GDDR6 Memory\nWhile the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 (Ti) for laptops rocks the Ampere GA107 GPU core, the RTX 3050 for desktops is said to feature the Ampere GA106 GPU core. Previously, there have been a series of reports that the RTX 3050 series would include two variants, a Ti and a non-Ti part. The non-TI part was expected to feature the GA107 GPU while the Ti SKU was expected to feature a GA106 GPU configuration. However, the latest report suggested that even the Non-Ti variant will feature a GA106 GPU which means it should end up with much higher performance than the Ti variant for laptops.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n12.3update\uff1aGeForce RTX 3050 (8GB) 2022.1.27 on-shelf\n\u2014 hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) December 3, 2021\n\nComing to the specifications, there are reports of an NVIDIA GA106-150 GPU for the 'PG190 SKU 70' board being cooked up. The GA106-150 GPU allegedly features 3072 CUDA cores in 24 SM units. It is also reported that the card might end up with 8 GB GDDR6 memory which gives it a big memory advantage over AMD and Intel entry-level parts. The card is expected to offer performance faster than the GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER but will be slower than the RTX 2060 12 GB variant which also launches in the coming week. The GeForce RTX 3050 will be introduced in early Q1 2022.\n\nBased on these performance figures, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 is going to be competitive against AMD's Navi 24 (Radeon RX 6500 / Radeon RX 6400) and Intel's Alchemist DG2-128 (ARC A380) graphics cards which launch next year too. What will be interesting is to see whether prices can be maintained for these budget tier cards though we shouldn't keep our hopes high as supply issues aren't expected to be resolved till 2023.\nOne reason why NVIDIA could have delayed the RTX 3050 so much could be that they don't want to mess things up in the entry-level market with jacked up prices and to offer an intermediate solution, they have refreshed the RTX 2060 with 12 GB till GPU prices and supply get slightly better than what they are now.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 SUPER Graphics Card Specifications (Alleged):\n\n\n\nGraphics CardGPU NameSM / CoresMemory CapacityMemory BusTGPPrice (MSRP)\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti?GA102-350?84 / 1075224 GB GDDR6X384-bit~400W$1499 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090GA102-30082 / 1049624 GB GDDR6X384-bit350W$1499 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TIGA102-22580 / 1024012 GB GDDR6X384-bit350W$1199 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER?GA102-22070 / 896012 GB GDDR6X384-bit~320W$699 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080GA102-20068 / 870410 GB GDDR6X320-bit320W$699 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiGA104-40048 / 614416 GB GDDR6X256-bit~290W$599 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiGA104-40048 / 61448 GB GDDR6X256-bit290W$599 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070GA104-30046 / 58888 GB GDDR6256-bit220W$499 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 SUPERGA104?44 / 563212 GB GDDR6X192-bit~200W$399 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiGA104-20038 / 48648 GB GDDR6256-bit200W$399 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060GA106-30028 / 358412 GB GDDR6X192-bit170W$329 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiGA106-250/200?24 / 3072?8 GB GDDR6128-bit~120W$259 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050GA106-15020 / 2560?8 GB GDDR6128-bit~100W$209 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050GA106-14018 / 2304?4 GB GDDR6128-bit~90W$179 US?\n\n\n\n\nNews Source: Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n85\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Is Falling Behind In The AI Race After Delaying Personalized Siri, Despite Features Being Functional, As Competitors Push Ahead With More Advanced AI Assistants\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n15\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n14\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1528\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

For the last GFN Thursday of the year, we\u2019re taking a look at some of the GeForce NOW community\u2019s top picks of games that joined the GeForce NOW library in 2021.\nPlus, check out the last batch of games coming to the cloud this year, with seven new additions streaming this week.\nBringing Gaming to Gamers\nThis year, the GeForce NOW library has reached over 1,100 PC games streaming on the service, including nearly 100 free-to-play options. Plus, new titles come to the cloud every GFN Thursday, meaning more players can play more games that they own.\nWhether they\u2019re playing on underpowered PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, SHIELD TVs, Android devices, iPhones or iPads, there\u2019s a PC game for every player to stream instantly from this ever-expanding library \u2014 at legendary GeForce levels of performance.\nPumped Up Picks\u00a0\nTo round out a year full of great gaming and new title additions, the GeForce NOW community shared some of their picks to play on the cloud.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheNorseman5/status/1472976191472680966?s=20\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy, 4K 60fps on my Shield Pro!\n\u2014 Tartan Troot \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f (@TartanTroot) December 20, 2021\n\nMembers are having a blast strapping on Star-Lord\u2019s boots for an original adventure in Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy, and have shared their love for the game.\n\u201cMarvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy looks absolutely stunning on GeForce NOW,\u201d said DrSpaceman. \u201cThe colorful, alien worlds are so vibrant with RTX ON and the game plays like a dream.\u201d\n\u201cPlaying this game on the 3080 tier is just beautiful,\u201d said Bill from NerdNest.tv. \u201cThe art direction is top notch.\u201d\nGamers are also delighted to befriend charming spirit companions and enjoy a rich tale in Kena: Bridge of Spirits, and thrilled to overthrow a corrupt government in Far Cry 6.\n\u201cKena: Bridge of Spirits was by far one of my favorite games, due to the graphics, visuals and the storyline,\u201d said VetCloudGaming. \u201cThe visuals were amazing and reminded me of a film.\u201d\n\n@playnewworld ! New world for the win !!\n\u2014 Wuyts jeroen (@Wuytsjeroen1990) December 20, 2021\n\nFor fun with friends, players are squading up to explore, build, craft and battle in the MMO New World or become the Vikings they were born to be in Valheim.\n\u201cNew World has to be the biggest surprise game of the year,\u201d said Marchief from Cloud Gaming Xtreme. \u201cSo many people wanted it, and now it\u2019s on GeForce NOW.\u201d\nIf stretching 2021 to include an extra month from the end of last year \u2014 members are taking Cyberpunk 2077 to the next level with cinematic quality by turning RTX ON for a glamorous game and gritty story.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 in 4K on the Shield with my 3080 membership \ud83d\ude0d\n\u2014 H e l l M o n k e y (@HellMonkey88) December 20, 2021\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OlivierChlc/status/1473007849919942661?s=20\nOther games we\u2019ve seen mentioned frequently include PowerWash Simulator and Gas Station Simulator for entertaining scenarios with wacky outcomes. Games like No Man\u2019s Sky and Icarus are popular options for those looking for a challenge to explore and survive. And members wanting to become an unstoppable warrior should try Warframe for a sci-fi, story-driven, free-to-play game.\nThe Power to Play With GeForce RTX 3080\nAnother big win for GeForce NOW members this year is the ability to play all of these titles using the newest generation of cloud gaming with a GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership.\nRTX 3080 memberships turn nearly any device into a gaming rig capable of streaming at up to 1440p resolution and 120 frames per second on PCs, native 1440p or 1600p at 120 FPS on Macs, and 4K HDR at 60 FPS on SHIELD TV, with ultra-low latency that goes head-to-head with many local gaming experiences.\nIt also comes with the longest gaming session length available of eight hours, full control to customize in-game graphics settings, as well as RTX ON rendering environments in cinematic quality for supported games.\nBesides powering up your ultimate cloud gaming experience on GeForce NOW, for a limited time, get the gift of a copy of Crysis Remastered free with the purchase of an RTX 3080 membership or six-month Priority membership. Terms and conditions apply.\nEnd Games for 2021\nBattle it out with the best using martial-arts-inspired melee combat and get hooked onto NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, now supported on Epic Games Store.\nThe following seven titles come to the cloud this week to close out a year packed full of gaming:\n\nBattleBeasts (Steam)\nMoving Out (Epic Games Store)\nNARAKA: BLADEPOINT (Epic Games Store)\nOperencia: The Stolen Sun (Steam)\nPC Building Simulator (Epic Games Store)\nSalt and Sanctuary (Epic Games Store)\nWargroove (Steam)\n\nWe make every effort to launch games on GeForce NOW as close to their release as possible, but, in some instances, games may not be available immediately.\nStay tuned and look out for new announcements at CES to see how we\u2019re kicking off 2022.

It looks likely there might be a few on the way, as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are all reportedly prepping what should be some of their cheapest GPUs for launch. The latest on that front is word of Nvidia's long-lost RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti GPUs on desktop, which are reportedly arriving in the first half of 2022.Nvidia first released the mobile RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti way back in May, 2021, and these GPUs have made it into many a laptop since, including the MSI Pulse GL66 that our Alan reviewed and thought okay at best. You might think that tells us all we need to know about the discrete desktop cards. But apparently, you'd be wrong.The RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti are now rumoured to arrive with the GA106 GPU on desktop, says reliable leaker kopite7kimi. That's the same GPU as found powering the RTX 3060, and a step-up from the GA107 GPU commonly found powering the mobile RTX 3050 GPUs.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nSpecs for Nvidia's new RTX 5050, 5060, and 5060 Ti GPUs leak out and that 5060 might actually be half decent. If it's priced right\n\n\n\nUpdate that: GA106-150-Kx-A1RTX 30508G GD6December 2, 2021Importantly this shake-up would see the CUDA Core count of the RTX 3050 Ti increase from 2,560 on mobile to 3,072 on desktop\u2014a 20% increase for the discrete card.Similarly, these two desktop cards are said to come with 8GB of VRAM, as opposed to the rather paltry 4GB available on mobile. That's going to be big for performance, as in our recent review of the mobile RTX 3050 Ti we found its 4GB of GDDR6 memory to be one of the main factors holding it back from achieving decent frame rates.The RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 could be more the graphics cards we want them to be on desktop, then. Especially with DLSS thrown in, which was something I talked about wanting to see back in November 2020, when these cards were first rumoured. Ultimately, though, their success all boils down to price and availability.The silicon shortage has ravaged graphics card supply, which has in turn caused ballooning price tags for top-tier PC gaming gear, such as the RTX 3080 or RX 6800 XT. That's a real shame because the underlying architectures powering both Nvidia and AMD's latest lineups are really powerful and excellently designed.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 3060 12GB is a $329 graphics card. It's supposed to be, anyway. If you can find it in stock anywhere, you might find it selling for $100 more than that, at least. That's also the cheapest RTX 30-series card to-date. Without plenty of availability, the RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 may face a similar fate, and that's going to be a really tough pill to swallow for PC gamers in need of an upgrade.Though there's potentially a silver lining in all of this. Prebuilt gaming PCs will likely be prime candidates for these two cheaper Nvidia GeForce cards, and prices haven't nearly been quite so bad for these machines. So if these two cards can provide a cheaper way into PC gaming, without having to resort to an older generation GPU, I'm all for it.Nvidia's GTX 1650 Super launched for $159 in 2019, but Nvidia's cheapest today is the RTX 3060 12GB at $359. (Image credit: Asus)It's not like Nvidia is the only option, either. Two weeks ago it was news of AMD's Radeon RX 6500 XT and RX 6400 that had us excited for some affordable options in PC gaming. No doubt these will also find their way into prebuilt PCs when they do arrive, and hopefully will be offered as discrete components, too.Cut the cord...(Image credit: Steelseries)Best wireless gaming mouse: ideal cable-free rodents\nBest wireless gaming keyboard: no wires, no worries\nBest wireless gaming headset: top untethered audioNext year will also see the arrival of Intel in the discrete graphics card space, in earnest for gaming. The company will be releasing its Arc lineup of GPUs at some point in the new year, and the latest rumours from another reliable leaker, TUM_APISAK, tell tale of a budget GPU by the name of Intel Arc A380, which should feature 6GB of VRAM and offer around Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super performance.With all three manufacturers efforts combined, there's perhaps a chance that PC gaming can shake off the high price tags that have made it such a difficulty to get into this past year. PC gaming has become way harder to get into, and the loss of budget graphics cards is one cause for that, itself a symptom of larger global supply issues and demand. There used to be heaps of excellent budget cards, such as AMD's Polaris lineup, but sadly the global semiconductor shortage and surging demand, from gamers and non-gamers alike, has killed them off entirely.Will the arrival of budget cards from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel make all of PC gaming's supply problems go away? No, but perhaps it can make PC gaming a little easier to get into for under $1,000.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Learn More.\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 NVIDIA is introducing a data generation engine to produce physically simulated synthetic data for training artificial learning (AI) deep neural networks.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Replicator augments costly and laborious human-labeled real-world data, which can be error prone and incomplete, with the ability to create large and diverse physically accurate data, according to the company last month.\nIt also enables the generation of ground-truth data that is difficult or impossible for humans to label, such as velocity, depth, occluded objects, adverse weather conditions or tracking the movement of objects across sensors.\nNVIDIA introduced two applications for generating synthetic data: one for NVIDIA DRIVE Sim, a virtual world for hosting the digital twin of autonomous vehicles; and one for NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a virtual world for the digital twin of manipulation robots.\nOmniverse Replicator will be made available next year to developers to build domain-specific data generation engines.\nThe replicator allows developers to bootstrap AI models, fill real-world data gaps, and label the ground truth. Data generated in the virtual worlds can cover a range of scenarios, including rare or dangerous conditions that can\u2019t regularly or safely be experienced in the real world.\nAutonomous vehicles and robots built using the data can \u201cmaster skills\u201d across virtual environments \u201cbefore applying them in the physical world.\u201d\nOmniverse Replicator allows users to \u201ccreate diverse, massive, accurate data sets to build high-quality, high-performing and safe data sets, which is essential for AI,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, VP of simulation technology and Omniverse engineering, NVIDIA.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile we have built two domain-specific data generation engines ourselves, we can imagine many companies building their own with Omniverse Replicator,\u201d Lebaredian said.\nOmniverse Replicator is part of NVIDIA Omniverse, a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPrevious articleAIB Signs \u20ac65m Deal With IBM for Digital TransformationNext articleThreat Detection Improves 41% With Integrated Cybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Subscribe to Data Insider                \n\n                    Learn the latest news and best practices about data science, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, data security, and more.                \n\n\n\n\n                        Email Address\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.                        \n\n\n\n                    Subscribe                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar articles\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApplications\n8 Best Data Analytics Tools: Gain Data-Driven Advantage In 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApplications\nCommon Data Visualization Examples: Transform Numbers into Narratives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBig Data\nWhat is Data Management?

After all, data science is one of the most quickly growing fields in the world. Why? Because many companies are sitting on a literal treasure trove of data \u2013 just waiting to be utilized. Modern technology has enabled the storage of vast amounts of information and as a result, data volumes have exploded \u2013 it's estimated that 90 percent of the data in the world was created in the last two years.By analyzing this data, data science and AI can reveal insights that businesses can use to make better decisions and create more innovative products and services. This wealth of data can have truly transformative benefits to businesses and societies around the world \u2013 but only if it can be properly interpreted. That's why many companies use data centers in order to use machine learning (ML) models to learn from the vast amounts of data being fed to them, rather than relying upon human business analysts to see what conclusions they can draw from unfathomable amounts of data and information.With many companies making data science a priority and investing in these programs heavily, it's important to consider all of your options when it comes to data processing \u2013 enter the DGX Station A100.Install it anywhereData science teams are often left searching for available AI compute cycles in order to complete projects, often leveraging the use of large, expensive data centers in order to perform complex computations. These teams need a dedicated resource that can plug in anywhere and provide maximum performance for multiple, simultaneous users anywhere in the world. Nvidia DGX Station A100 brings AI supercomputing to data science teams, offering data center technology without a data center or additional IT infrastructure.Organizations around the world can provide multiple users with a centralized AI resource for all workloads that delivers an immediate on-ramp to Nvidia DGX\u2122-based infrastructure and works alongside other Nvidia-Certified Systems with a DGX Station A100 rental now available from Rentacomputer.com and iRent.

Simply plug your Station into any standard wall outlet to get it up and running in minutes \u2013 and work from anywhere. This supercomputer was truly designed for today's agile data science teams that work in corporate offices, labs, research facilities, or even from home \u2013 as the DGX Station A100 can run simultaneous processes from multiple users without affecting performance.With an Nvidia DGX Station A100 rental, you'll have an opportunity to use the world's only office-friendly system with four fully interconnected and MIG-capable Nvidia A100 GPUs, leveraging Nvidia\u00ae NVLink\u00ae for running parallel jobs and multiple users without impacting system performance. You can also train large models using a fully GPU-optimized software stack and up to 320 gigabytes (GB) of GPU memory.Expanding AI adoption\"You can think of us progressing in two directions, one with constant innovation to raise the bar. But the other is to really democratize AI to put it in the hands of as many companies and scientists as we possibly can,\" said Manuvir Das, head of enterprise computing at Nvidia. \"We are also announcing for the first time a rental model. Instead of procuring a DGX Station, customers will be able to rent a station directly from Nvidia at a low monthly price point, and they can use it for as long as they choose and then return it to Nvidia. So that's an important direction that we are taking with the Station.\"By making the DGX Station A100 available to rental customers, Nvidia opens up the world of AI to a wider variety of enterprise customers as they investigate areas such as AI, data science, drug discovery, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, manufacturing, and more. These data processing units (DPUs) can offload, accelerate, and isolate users' data \u2013 providing customers with a secure connection to their AI infrastructure.Nvidia's idea was to broaden AI adoption for enterprise IT departments that need to support the work of teams in multiple locations, help academic and research institutions, and get powerful supercomputing into the hands of a wider variety of customers. \"We have to make AI easier to use,\" said Jensen Huang, President, CEO, and co-founder of Nvidia Corporation in a press release.About Nvidia CorporationNvidia Corporation is an American multinational company incorporated in Delaware and based in Santa Clara, California.

The GPU has an MSRP of USD 450.\nThe big news about this tiny GPU is it supports NVIDIA\u2019s hardware-accelerated real-time RTX raytracing technology. And it does so in a low-profile GPU form-factor that works ideally in SFF (small-form-factor) workstations. SFF workstations are often found in architecture and engineering practices because they take up less space.\nGiven our more dominant AEC focus at Architosh, the folks at NVIDIA provided us with this new RTX A2000 GPU so we could give it a good spin in both benchmarks and real-app testing. And that is precisely what we have done.\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 Details\nBefore we jump into the results, let\u2019s cover the basics of this Ampere generation tiny GPU. First off, the card is so tiny it almost feels cute. But don\u2019t let this fool you. The RTX A2000 packs a very decent punch.\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX A-series lineup for the workstation market. Lower left, the double-slot RTX A2000. Upper left: RTX A6000. Upper Right: RTX A5000, and lower right, single-slot RTX A4000. Only the A2000 can fit in tiny SFF (small form factor) workstations. (Image: NVIDIA / All rights reserved.)\nThe unit comes with 6GB of GDDR6 ECC memory, and there is an optional version with 12 GB. One will find 4x Mini DisplayPort connectors on the backside (see images below). Despite being small and low-profile, the RTX A2000 is a doublewide card. It can work with a low-profile bracket or a full-height bracket like ours was sent to us. It supports PCI Express-4.\nRayTracing\nThe RTX A2000 brings NVIDIA\u2019s workstation-class hardware-accelerated raytracing technology down to the entry-level workstation-class GPU range. In the previous workstation generation GPUs, RTX technology stopped at the Quadro RTX 4000, and everything under that was RT-free, meaning no raytracing cores.\nThe tiny fan on the rather tiny A2000. One issue we talk about at the end of this article is the fan noise.\nThe RTX A2000 delivers 8 peak TeraFlops single-precision (FP32) performance, compared to its previous generation at half that value. From our recent review on AMD\u2019s new GPU, our readers learned that our own reference NVIDIA GPUs, the Quadro P4000, has 5.2 peak TeraFlops (FP32). We will be referencing that unit in some of our benchmarks below.\nThe RTX A2000 possesses \u2018second-generation\u2019 RT cores with hardware-accelerated motion blur and 2x faster raytracing. We tested the raytracing and CUDA cores using Chaos\u2019 V-Ray-based rendering benchmark. (see charts below). In terms of cores in general here is the breakdown:\n\n3328 CUDA cores\n26 second-gen RT (raytracing) cores\n104 third-gen Tensor Cores\n\nInstalling the RTX A2000 was straightforward. We dropped it into our 2021 year model BOXX Technologies testing workstation. The card is powered entirely through the PCI bus; the A2000 has a TDP of just 70 watts.\nPerformance Tests\nAt Architosh, we have been trying to establish a suite of \u201ccross-platform benchmarks\u201d and real-world app tests as much as possible.

Both AMD and NVIDIA are expected to utilize the node for its next-gen lineup but it looks like NVIDIA is very serious in making sure they get enough wafer supply for its lineup and as such, they have paid the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer several Billions of dollars as an advanced payment for 5nm wafers.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDPAccording to industry sources,\u00a0TSMC\u2019s requirements for Apple, MediaTek,\u00a0AMD\u00a0and other three major customers are relatively low. They do not need to pay too much deposit in advance to stabilize production capacity.\u00a0Customers like\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0need to pay huge advance payments in advance\u00a0if they want to obtain\u00a05nm\u00a0production orders.\nvia MyDrivers (Machine Translated)\nMyDrivers reports that NVIDIA has prepaid TSMC around $1.64 Billion US in Q3 2021and will pay $1.79 Billion US in Q1 2022. The total long-term 'Multi-Billion' dollar deal is set to cost NVIDIA an insane $6.9 Billion US which is much higher than what they paid last year. NVIDIA will not just use this money to procure wafer supply from TSMC but also from Samsung but it looks like that the majority of the amount will be spent on TSMC's 5nm technology.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card - Ada Lovelace Powered AD102 Flagship GPU\nBased upon previous rumors, there have been whispers that NVIDIA would utilize TSMC's N5 (5nm) process node for its Ada Lovelace GPUs. This includes the AD102 SKU too which will be an entirely monolithic design. Talking about specific GPU configurations, the flagship AD102 GPU is said to feature a clock speed as high as 2.5 GHz (2.3 GHz average boost). The specific tweet states that the GPU clock for Ada Lovelace 'AD102' could be 2.3 GHz or greater so let's take that as a baseline and previously leaked specifications to figure out where the performance should land.\nThe NVIDIA AD102 \"ADA GPU\" appears to have 18432 CUDA Cores based on the preliminary specs (which can change), housed within 144 SM units. This is almost twice the cores present in Ampere which was already a massive step up from Turing. A 2.3-2.5 GHz clock speed would give us up to 85 to 92 TFLOPs of compute performance (FP32). This is more than twice the FP32 performance of the existing RTX 3090 which packs 36 TFLOPs of FP32 compute power.\n\nThe 150% performance jump looks huge but one should remember that NVIDIA already gave a big jump in FP32 numbers this generation with Ampere. The Ampere GA102 GPU (RTX 3090) offers 36 TFLOPs while the Turing TU102 GPU (RTX 2080 Ti) offered 13 TFLOPs. That's over a 150% increase in FP32 Flops but the real-world gaming performance increase for the RTX 3090 averaged at around 50-60% faster over the RTX 2080 Ti. So one thing we shouldn't forget is that Flops don't equal GPU gaming performance these days. Furthermore, we don't know if 2.3-2.5 GHz is the average boost or the peak boost with the former meaning that there could be even higher compute potential for AD102.\nAside from that, leaks have also stated that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 flagship would retain a 384-bit bus interface, similar to the RTX 3090. What's interesting is though that the leaker mentions G6X which means that NVIDIA won't be moving to a new memory standard until after Ada Lovelace and utilize the higher pin-speeds of G6X of 21 Gbps for its next-generation cards before we see a newer standard (e.g. GDDR7). The card will feature 24 GB of memory so we can either expect single-sided 16Gb DRAM or dual-sided 8Gb DRAM modules.\n\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:\n\n\n\nGPUTU102GA102AD102\n\n\n\n\nFlagship SKURTX 2080 TiRTX 3090 TiRTX 4090?\n\n\nArchitectureTuringAmpereAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcessTSMC 12nm NFFSamsung 8nmTSMC 4N?\n\n\nDie Size754mm2628mm2~600mm2\n\n\nGraphics Processing Clusters (GPC)6712\n\n\nTexture Processing Clusters (TPC)364272\n\n\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SM)7284144\n\n\nCUDA Cores46081075218432\n\n\nL2 Cache6 MB6 MB96 MB\n\n\nTheoretical TFLOPs 16 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs?\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6XGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Capacity11 GB (2080 Ti)24 GB (3090 Ti)24 GB (4090?)\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps21 Gbps24 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth616 GB/s1.008 GB/s1152 GB/s?\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nPCIe InterfacePCIe Gen 3.0PCIe Gen 4.0PCIe Gen 4.0\n\n\nTGP250W350W600W?\n\n\nReleaseSep. 2018Sept. 202H 2022 (TBC)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will power the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards that will go head-on with AMD's RDNA 3 based Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards.

The Hopper GPU, which is primarily aimed at the Datacenter & AI segment, is\u00a0allegedly taping out soon\u00a0and will feature an MCM architecture.

Unlike DLSS, it also doesn\u2019t require one of the best graphics cards from Nvidia\u2019s RTX range, only an Nvidia GPU from the Maxwell generation or later \u2013 so the performance benefit is available to far more potential users. However, the issue of exactly how to use Nvidia Image Scaling isn\u2019t very well-explained by Nvidia\u2019s own software, so I suppose the task falls to this guide you\u2019re already reading. \r\n\n\n\r\nThe way Image Scaling works is actually much more akin to AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) than the AI-fuelled DLSS, because it doesn\u2019t add any clever anti-aliasing of its own, simply applying an upscaling algorithm with a sharpening effect to reduce visible blurriness. Unlike both DLSS and FSR, however, it\u2019s also distinct in that you\u2019ll need to set it up outside of your games, as opposed to just flicking a switch within them. The upside of this approach is that Image Scaling can potentially work with any game, not just those with developer-crafted support for it.\r\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Latest? DLSS 2.3 & How It Keeps Learning\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nThere are in fact two methods of enabling Image Scaling, both of which are detailed below. I\u2019d definitely start with the Nvidia Control Panel method, which is slightly more involved than using Nvidia GeForce Experience, but also gives you more control. Using GeForce Experience is easier, especially if you already rely on it to set your games\u2019 other graphical settings, though it can also introduce compatibility issues: a game that can\u2019t be \u201cOptimised\u201d through GeForce Experience won\u2019t have Image Scaling applied unless you set it through Nvidia Control Panel instead.\r\n\n\r\nWhichever one you use, first make sure your Nvidia graphics card drivers are up to date, as is GeForce Experience if you\u2019re going that route.\r\n\n\n\r\nHow to use Nvidia Image Scaling with Nvidia Control Panel\r\n\n\nStep 1: Open up Nvidia Control Panel and click \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d. Under Global Settings, you should see the Image Scaling setting at the top of the list; if it\u2019s not there, update your graphics card drivers to the latest version.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 2: Click on Image Scaling and set it to \u201cOn (GPU Scaling & Sharpening)\u201d while leaving the Overlay Indicator box checked for now. You can also adjust the slider to choose the global sharpening filter intensity, though you may eventually wish to set different sharpening values for different games (see below). To start with, I\u2019d recommend leaving the slider in the 60-70% range, as this will generally make upscaled games look more crisp without appearing overly processed.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 3: Click \u201cOK\u201d, then \u201cApply\u201d to save your changes. Exit Nvidia Control and launch a game.\r\n\n\nStep 4: Step 3: Assuming you left the Overlay Indicator box checked, you should see a blue \u201cNIS\u201d indicator in the corner of your screen. This means the sharpening component of Image Scaling is in effect, but not the upscaling. The enable the latter and get your performance boost, navigate to the game\u2019s display settings and set the display resolution to something that\u2019s lower than your native resolution, but also uses the same aspect ratio. For example, if you\u2019re using a 3840x2160 monitor, set it to 2450x1440 or 1920x1080. The lower you go, the bigger performance gain you\u2019ll get, though the image quality will be lower even with upscaling.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 5: Once you\u2019ve applied the resolution change, the NIS indicator should change from blue to green; this shows that both the upscaling and sharpening components are in effect. If it doesn\u2019t change colour, quitting and restarting should fix it.\r\n\n\nStep 6: As you try Image Scaling with different games, you might notice the global sharpening value might be too high or too low for specific games. In which case, you can go back into Nvidia Control Panel, click \u201cManage 3D settings\u201d and open the Program Settings tab. From there, select a game from the drop-down list of applications, click on Image Scaling and set a different sharpening value using the slider. Click \u201cOK then \u201cApply\u201d to finish, and note that you can only do this if Image Scaling is already enabled in the Global Settings tab; while you can customise sharpening on a per-game basis, Nvidia Control Panel won't let you have Image Scaling enabled for certain games and disabled for others at the same time.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\r\nHow to use Nvidia Image Scaling with GeForce Experience\r\n\n\nStep 1: Open GeForce Experience and open the General Settings menu by clicking the cog icon. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 2: Scroll down to the Image Scaling section and click the toggle to turn it on. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 3: This method differs from the Control Panel method in that you select a render resolution outside the game. Click on a resolution option from the ones presented to you, then either a) click on the green \u201cOptimise\u201d text that appears in the popup, applying the settings to all your games at once or b) navigate to a specific game on the Home tab, then click \u201cOptimise\u201d. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 4: Don\u2019t forget to set the sharpening filter! This can be done with the slider just below the render resolution options. Somewhere in the 60-70% range seems to work well for most games, though you can always adjust it later. \r\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 5: Launch the optimised game and check that Image Scaling is working. There should be a green \u201cNIS\u201d indicator in the corner of your screen, and the display resolution should be set to whichever render resolution setting you chose. If it hasn\u2019t worked, exit the game and select a different resolution using the same steps. If the NIS text is blue, it means sharpening is being applied, but not upscaling.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

With 704 A100 GPUs, the new public high performance computing system will be Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning at 30x faster than the current TARA system, the new supercomputer will be hosted in the NSTDA Supercomputer Center (ThaiSC) to drive research by engineers as well as computational and data scientists from academia, government and industry sectors across Thailand. It will support research projects in areas such as pharmaceuticals, renewable energy and weather forecasting.\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs will form the engine of the new supercomputer to accelerate AI, data analytics and HPC. Representing the most powerful end-to-end AI and HPC platform for data centres, they will boost data-intensive simulations and accelerate AI in HPC applications.\n\u201cThe new supercomputer at NSTDA will expand and enhance research in Thailand, speeding up the development of breakthroughs that benefit individuals and industries in the country,\u201d said Dennis Ang, director of enterprise business for the SEA and ANZ regions at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA A100 incorporates building blocks across hardware, networking, software, libraries, optimised AI models and applications to enable extreme performance for AI and HPC.\u201d\n\u201cThe supercomputer, which is expected to start operations by the end of 2022, is important for Thailand in terms of national disaster predictions and forecasts,\u201d said Anek Laothamatas, the minister of MHESI.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf.Dr. Anek Laothamatas, the Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI) during his opening remark for the press conference on Thailand's new supercomputer to be launched in late 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe supercomputer will strengthen Thailand's position in HPC and research capabilities in ASEAN,\u201d said Narong Sirilertworakul, president of the NSTDA.\nThe new supercomputer will enable researchers to benefit from real-world results and the ability to deploy solutions into production at scale.\n\u201cWe chose NVIDIA A100 because it is currently the leading solution for HPC-AI in the market. Even more important is that many HPC-AI software applications are well supported by NVIDIA technology, and the list will keep growing,\u201d said Manaschai Kunaseth, Chief of Operations at ThaiSC.\nThaiSC\u2019s users are looking forward to the additional power of the new supercomputer, which will let them scale up their research projects once it becomes operational in the second half of 2022. This new supercomputer will accelerate innovation for Thailand\u2019s efforts in medicine, energy sources, weather forecasting and more with advanced modeling, simulation, AI and analytics capabilities.\nKwanchiva Thangthai, of the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center\u2019s Speech and Text Understanding Team, expects to see massive efficiency gains in speech recognition research pipelines. \u201cWe can gain competitive performance and provide a free-of-charge Thai speech-to-text service for everyone via AIForThai,\u201d she said.\nIn May, NSTDA became the first organization in Thailand to install an NVIDIA DGX\u2122 A100 system with NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking and the first in Southeast Asia to use the NVIDIA Clara\u2122 Parabricks\u00ae sequencing analysis software, which enabled the National Biobank of Thailand to accelerate genomic sequencing efforts, including a genome study to combat COVID-19.\n\u201cNVIDIA GPUs are the core of our molecular dynamics simulation platform. We are inspired by the ability to apply this technology to elucidate the behaviour of protein-ligand binding,\u201d said Thanyada Rungrotmongkol of Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Structural and Computational Biology Research Unit. \u201cIn addition, the power of NVIDIA GPUs hastens the research to find inhibitors against the coronavirus.\u201d\u00a0\nPlease find Thai media alert\u00a0here.\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

Bringing limited resources with them, prospectors must explore the damaged planet, craft tools and machinery, build shelter, survive storms, hunt wildlife, extract exotic matter and return to their dropship in time - or be left behind forever.\nBy installing our new Game Ready Driver, you\u2019ll optimize your system and enable support for NVIDIA DLSS\u2019 trademark performance boosts, and NVIDIA RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI). This enhances ICARUS\u2019 environments with realistic lighting from the sun and moon, which naturally bounces from surface to surface. Compared to traditional rasterized techniques, the difference is literally night and day, making RTXGI one of the most important advancements in real-time video game rendering. And as players level trees, erect buildings, and change the environment, lighting is instantly updated to reflect these changes, enabling a once-dark forest floor shielded by the trees\u2019 canopies to now be brightly lit when they\u2019re chopped down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo support ICARUS\u2019 massive biomes, a new feature called Infinite Scrolling Volumes has been developed. As players move through the environment, lighting is updated in a large volume around the player\u2019s viewpoint, reducing memory requirements and increasing performance. ICARUS is the first published game utilizing this feature, and demonstrates the possibilities of RTXGI for other games.\nTo learn more about ICARUS, head on over to its Steam page, and stay tuned for our ICARUS launch article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For All The Latest Games\nOur latest Game Ready Driver also includes optimizations and enhancements for the many games launching in the next few weeks.\nChorus: Deep Silver\u2019s new sci-fi action-adventure game launches December 3rd on Steam. On PC, it\u2019s enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS, so be sure to play on a GeForce RTX GPU for the definitive Chorus experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalo Infinite: On December 8th, the Halo Infinite campaign launches, following last month\u2019s launch of the multiplayer mode.

Even with the best graphics cards nowhere to be found in 2021, it seems the company is confident its shift from Samsung to TSMC will solve a chunk of the problems when it comes to keeping up with demand.A previous report indicated that a trifecta of circumstances would lead to consumer semiconductor concerns being eliminated in the latter half of 2022 (or, if not entirely eliminated, then greatly reduced). One of said circumstances was NVIDIA contracting TSMC for its 5nm capabilities, moving away from Samsung's less capable setup.Now, DigiTimes' latest scoop claims that this change will indeed facilitate the anticipated 2022 launch of NVIDIA's next wave of GPUs (via WCCF Tech). They will be RTX 40-series cards based on Ada Lovelace architecture.There's a lot of time between now and whatever period in mid-to-late 2022 NVIDIA aims to release the cards, so anything can happen.

The GeForce RTX 3050 has 4 GB while the MX570 has 2 GB GDDR6 memory. As for the MX550, it is based on the much older Turing TU117 architecture and features just 1024 cores and a 2 GB & 64-bit bus interface.\nOne interesting thing that Zhihu (via HXL) mentions is that the TGP for the new laptop GPUs determines not only how far the boost clock will be pushed but also the memory clock. At 20W, you get 11 Gbps, at 25-35W, you get 12 Gbps and at 40-45W, you get 14 Gbps memory speeds. The RTX 2050 runs at 30 - 45W which gives us 14 Gbps so it's already faster than the MX570 which features a 15-25W design for 12 Gbps. The same is the case with the MX550.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 3DMark Time Spy Benchmark (Image Credits: Zhihu):\n\nNVIDIA GeForce MX550 3DMark Time Spy Benchmark (Image Credits: Zhihu):\n\nNow coming to the benchmarks, the RTX 2050 and GeForce MX570 are said to offer almost similar graphics performance and score around 3369 points. The GeForce MX550 scores 2510 points. Now compared to the GeForce RTX 3050, we are looking at 40-45% lower performance and that's on the same architecture but with the RTX 3050 sporting higher clocks and a wider bus (128-bit). This can be considered GTX 1660 series performance in 2021 which could make for some decent gains over an iGPU. Now while there are ray-tracing cores on both these parts, don't expect to get any decent performance out of them unless you are playing at 720p with DLSS set to max performance mode.\nAMD Ryzen 6000 Rembrandt APU performance compared to several entry-level mobility GPUs. (Image Credits: @uzzi38)\nThe NVIDIA GeForce MX550 on the other hand looks very underwhelming especially when we take into account the leaked AMD Ryzen 6000 'Rembrandt' APU score of 2700 points in 3DMark Time Spy. It looks like the MX550 will either be on par or even loose against AMD's RDNA 2 iGPU which makes this part pretty much DOA though we will still give it time till release to see if the final chip has some improvements over pre-release silicon and if the final drivers add some improvements but the same could be true for AMD's Rembrandt APU in its final form.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce MX550 dGPU Barely Outperforms The AMD RDNA 2 \u2018Radeon 680M\u2019 Integrated GPU In Gaming\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Intros Ampere GeForce RTX 2050, GeForce MX570 & Turing MX550 GPUs For Entry-Level Gaming Laptops\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce MX550 Laptop GPU Might Be Green Team\u2019s Answer To AMD\u2019s Rembrandt RDNA 2 APUs, 2 GB GDDR6 Memory & 15% Faster Than MX450\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n177\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n115\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n77\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
