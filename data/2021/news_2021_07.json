Its chips are behind cutting-edge technologies that will have huge ramifications on how consumers and businesses get things done in the future. It's estimated that the implementation of artificial intelligence and 5G will add over $10 trillion in economic value by 2035,\u00a0and Nvidia is the leader in providing the high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to make it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nNow what\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to post $24.9 billion in revenue this year, with earnings per share coming in at $15.82.\u00a0That makes the current stock price look expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 47 times earnings estimates,\u00a0but I wouldn't underestimate this dominant GPU provider.\nNvidia is expanding into software services, which could lead to a windfall in profits over the next decade. The company talked about its NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform at its investor day in April\u00a0and has a new central processing unit (CPU) launching in 2023 for data center.\u00a0\nInvestors should only buy shares with a long-term mindset, because as we saw in 2020, anything can happen in the near term. But if you have at least 10 years to invest, this growth tech stock\u00a0still offers attractive return potential.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

After class, she had a lot of questions and later built an AI-powered security system that let her friends \u2014 but not her parents \u2014 into her room.\n\u201cBefore the class, she said she was not very interested in college, but now she\u2019s majoring in computer science and she\u2019s in my class as a freshman,\u201d said Tseng, an assistant professor at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology and founder of CAVEDU, a company that runs youth programs using robotics.\nEchoes Out of Africa\nA teacher in Tunisia who\u2019s run many robotics events for young people tells a similar story.\n\u201cA couple of my students started their own robotics startup, AviaGeek Consulting, and a couple others got internships at an aircraft manufacturer in Tunisia thanks to what they learned and practiced,\u201d said Khlaifia Bilel, an assistant professor of data science at an aviation school near Tunis, who started a student program to build tiny satellites using Jetson products.\n\u201cThanks, NVIDIA, for changing the life of my kids,\u201d he said in a talk at GTC in April.\nPlanting Seeds on the Farm\nTony Foster, a 4H program volunteer in Kansas, put one of the first Jetson Nano 2GB developer kits into the hands of an 11-year-old.\n\u201cShe was in a rural area with no programming classes in her junior high school, so we sent her everything she needed and now she\u2019s building a robot that can run a maze and she wants to take it to science fairs and robotics competitions,\u201d he said in a GTC talk (watch a replay free with registration).\nFoster, a 4H member since he was seven years old, believes the middle-school years are the best time to plant seeds. \u201cThese hands-on opportunities help children grow and learn \u2014 and they have results that last a lifetime,\u201d he said.\nA Celebration of Learning\nOn this World Youth Skills Day, we celebrate kids finding their way in the world.\nA JetBot powered by Jetson Nano 2GB.\nSo far this year, 250 organizations around the globe have expressed interest in using NVIDIA\u2019s educational tools in their curriculum. As part of a grant program, the company has given hundreds of Jetson Nano developer kits to educators in colleges, schools and nonprofit groups.\nOur work with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania\u2019s AI Pathways Institute also helps expand access to AI and robotics education to more students, particularly in traditionally underrepresented communities.\nReleased in October, the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit packs quite a punch for its size \u2014 a whopping 472 gigaflops of AI performance. That\u2019s enough to run Linux and CUDA software as well as AI training and inference jobs.\nStudents Get Certified in AI\nThe hardware is just the half of it. NVIDIA also certifies students and educators in AI skills through its Deep Learning Institute (DLI). Eight-hour classes require attendees to demonstrate their skills by building a working project, and they help them do it through online courses, videos and a repository of code to get started.\nThe curriculum is being embraced around the world from high schools in Korea to universities in Japan and Europe. For example, at Spain\u2019s University of M\u00e1laga, more than a dozen students attended a three-day workshop, seven are now certified AI specialists and the university is looking to integrate Jetson into its curriculum.\nIn Taiwan last year when the pandemic was not a factor, Tseng ran nearly 20 events with 300 participants and a competition that drew seven teams of high schoolers \u2014 work that led to 200 people earning DLI certificates.\nTeacher Gives Program an A+\nA recent weekend event for educators drew more than 100 attendees including 30 college professors, some from fashion, hospitality and economics departments.\nDavid Tseng of CAVEDU in Taiwan\n\u201cSchools are encouraging teachers to merge AI into their courses, so they are eager to find suitable content and DLI is very suitable because the documentation is good and it helps them get going right away,\u201d said Tseng, whose company published a book in traditional Chinese to add to the curriculum.\nThe weekend event drew kudos from one of the professors who attended.\n\u201cThanks to leaders like NVIDIA providing so many wonderful platforms and tools, I am more confident to teach AI in my next semester courses,\u201d said Cheng-Ling Ying, a professor at Jinwen University of Science and Technology.\nMaking a Difference in Young Lives\nEach teacher, each event sends out ripples that affect many young lives.\nBack in Kansas, Foster said 4H STEM programs like the ones he runs now \u201creally helped me on my path to become a computer system engineer working at Dell.\u201d\nToday, he\u2019s one of 6,000 volunteers in a university extension program that serves 75,000 youth across five counties. \u201cWe want to empower youth \u2026 to make decisions about their future and go where they want in jobs and careers,\u201d he said.\nTo learn more about how NVIDIA promotes youth and vocational education go to Jetson for AI Education.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Deep Learning Institute | Education | Jetson | Machine Learning | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Traditional valuation metrics are just about as high as they\u2019ve ever been for the chip giant. Its price-earnings ratio sits above 90 currently, worse than roughly 83% of industry peers.   Nvidia (NVDA) stock logo on a smartphone.   Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com But guess what? It doesn\u2019t matter long term because there\u2019s many more reasons to believe it\u2019ll rise. There may be a temporary cooling period, but company prospects are as bright as ever. I\u2019d say that NVDA stock has every right to have moved as high as it has over the past five weeks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q1 Results Speak Volumes There was very little bad that could possibly be said about Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results. Revenue was up massively from a year earlier, and 13% on the quarter. Net income more than doubled over the past year, and 31% on the quarter. The overall business and financial picture were stellar. And on a business-by-business basis things were equally positive. Gaming revenues were more than double where they were a year earlier. And each of Nvidia\u2019s data center, professional visualization and automotive businesses also realized revenue growth as well.  7 Stocks That Could Be Big Winners From Increasing Interest Rates  Just about the only arguable dull spot was that cash flows from operations declined 9% from the previous quarter. Even that could be explained away in that the company made a $317 million investment in capital expenditures. On those results NVDA stock has been tearing upwards from $546 in mid-May to hitting $800 this week. The price chart indicates that shares might run sideways for a bit, but most believe it\u2019ll continue upward. If most believe it\u2019ll continue to rise, what then might cause it trouble? Valuation and Gaming Concerns One of the major concerns about Nvidia moving out of the pandemic is that its gaming revenues may falter. The bearish thesis is that as the pandemic wanes so too will gaming pulling Nvidia down in the process. Gaming did contribute $2.76 billion to Nvidia\u2019s $5.66 billion of revenues in Q1. But that argument relies on the idea that gaming only became popular because we were cooped up due to the pandemic. It\u2019s just as easy to believe the trend is here to stay and that the pandemic simply added fuel to the trend. Then there\u2019s the idea that Nvidia should drop because it\u2019s overpriced. Nothing New That Nvidia is technically overvalued is likely news to no one. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, it carries a very high P/E ratio. The company\u2019s other valuation metrics are equally skewed. Nvidia\u2019s price-book and price-sales ratios are both among the lowest 5% in the semiconductor industry.   Story Continues But these concerns are nothing new and the fact remains that Nvidia has been on a long upward trend since the end of 2018. Those who have bet against it over the last two-and-a-half years have lost.Investors will continue to be willing to pay richly for a dollar of its earnings and many multiples of its book value as long as it remains hot. Many believe Nvidia is going to stay up.There\u2019s one simple way to gauge whether investors believe Nvidia\u2019s prices will go down. It\u2019s one we often associate with low-priced, volatile meme stocks rather than NVDA. That\u2019s short interest.Short interest volume for Nvidia is down over the last month by 6.29%. So those investors clearly abandoned the idea that shares would go down.TakeawayClearly Wall Street believes that will be exactly what happens.

Up 1.5% as of 12:45 p.m. EDT today, the Nasdaq is actually up slightly on the week after a big roller coaster ride.\nMany investors follow the Dow Jones Industrial Average more closely than the Nasdaq. Just six stocks out of 30 Dow components are listed on the Nasdaq, but they include some of the biggest tech companies on the planet. Nevertheless, one recent move could make it more likely that the Dow will replace one of its older Nasdaq stocks in favor of a newer and much larger rival. Below, we'll look at Nvidia (NVDA -3.22%) to see if it's ready to join the Dow and replace its competitor Intel (INTC 0.86%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMaking the case for Nvidia\nBack when Intel joined the Dow in the late 1990s, it was the undisputed powerhouse of the chip industry. Its groundbreaking x86 microprocessor designs had become the standard for personal computers, and the tech boom had put PCs on the cutting edge of innovation.\nToday, though, Intel has fallen behind, while Nvidia has moved forward with innovations of its own. The latter's graphics processing units have become favorites not only among video gamers but also for those requiring their superior processing power for other applications, such as cryptocurrency mining. As a result, Nvidia's market capitalization is now roughly twice that of Intel.\nNvidia never would have been able to be considered for the Dow when its stock price was above $800 per share. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted index. Nvidia would instantly have had more than twice the influence of any other single stock in the average, making it a nonstarter as a potential addition to the Dow.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, though, Nvidia's 4-for-1 stock split has finally taken effect. As a result, the stock's price has moved to around $185. That's a perfect amount for a new Dow component to take its place within the average.\nIntel has no Dow influence anyway\nSome will inevitably argue that Intel is still an extremely strong player in technology and doesn't deserve to lose its place in the Dow. Intel has been able to sustain its track record in areas like data servers, and it still plays a big role in the PC industry.\nYet where it has fallen behind is in chips for mobile devices. Nvidia and others took the lead in that market, and Nvidia's proposed acquisition of ARM Holdings would give it a big leg up not only on Intel but also the rest of the semiconductor industry.\nAlso, from a Dow standpoint, Intel has almost no influence over the average anyway. Its share price of $55 makes it the third-least-influential stock of the Dow 30, with a weighting of barely 1%. Nvidia would fall in the middle of the Dow pack, with roughly 3% to 3.5% weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing soon?\nThe managers of the Dow have been busy, making changes to seven Dow components on five separate occasions in the past four years. It's definitely possible that they'll move again if they see Intel as having lost the semiconductor wars.\nJoining the Dow would be a mark of distinction for Nvidia. But even if it doesn't happen, investors can take heart in the fact that the GPU giant has already proved its superiority over Intel.\n\n\n\nDan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends Intel and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel and short January 2023 $57.50 puts on Intel.

As per the Bill, depositors of troubled banks would get back amounts below Rs 5 lakh within 90 days, even if a bank is put under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India. \"As per the bill approved by the Cabinet, each depositor's bank deposit is insured up to Rs 5 lakh in each bank for both principal and interest. Increase of insured amount from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh will cover 98.3 percent of all deposit accounts and 50.9 percent of deposit value,\" Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.  This is a historic decision taken by the Modi government for the protection of interests of small depositors across the country. The insurance cover offered by DICGC is applicable on deposits such as savings accounts, fixed deposits (FD), current accounts, recurring deposits (RD), etc. However, there are few deposits that are excluded, such as the deposits of foreign governments, central/state governments, the state land development banks with a state co-operative bank, inter-bank deposits, etc. All commercial banks, including branches of foreign banks functioning in India, local area banks and regional rural banks are insured by the DICGC. At present, all co-operative banks are covered by the DICGC. However, deposits in primary cooperative societies are not insured by the DICGC, deposits in any NBFCs or Housing Finance Companies or corporate entity do not enjoy this insurance cover. Many depositors have more than Rs 5 lakh in their fixed deposit accounts with a single bank. Retirees who get lump sum gratuity and provident funds usually put their money in term deposits because of the safety and security.  What should a depositor do if you have, say, Rs 50 lakh in fixed deposit accounts in a single bank? Since only Rs 5 lakh is covered under the insurance policy, people can\u2019t leave it to chance and should proactively manage their savings. There are two ways to manage it. 1. Open FD accounts with multiple banks There are 12 public sector and 19 private sector banks in India. If you have Rs 50 lakh worth of FDs in a single bank, you can distribute them among 10 banks, with Rs 5 lakh each. Since the covered amount includes interest as well, you can shift accumulated interest on all FDs after their maturity of say 1, 3 or 5 years amongst more banks in multiples of Rs 5 lakh each. Let\u2019s say you opted for 3-year FDs in all the 10 banks. At the end of 3 years you would have earned interest of around Rs 8 lakh at current interest rates. You can park this Rs 8 lakh in 2 more FDs with two more banks.   Story continues Technically, you can have Rs 1.5 crore worth of FDs in your name insured by DICGC (31 banks multiplied by Rs 5 lakh each).I have not included here foriegn banks and regional rural banks.It may sound cumbersome to operate so many accounts, but as the adage goes there is no gain without pain.With video KYC and online banking, opening FDs in 10 banks would not be as tedious as it would have been before the pandemic.2. Open different types of FD accounts in the same bankAs per the DICGC guidelines, each depositor in a bank is insured up to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh for both principal and interest amounts held by her/him in the same right and same capacity as on the date of liquidation / cancellation of the bank's license or the date on which the scheme of amalgamation / merger/ reconstruction comes into force.What this means is that If you hold deposits in different rights and capacities, each of your deposits will enjoy a cover of Rs 5 lakh separately in the same bank, as per DICGC guidelines.Let me explain, let\u2019s say the above person in our example who has Rs 50 lakh worth of FDs is married, has two children and lives with his parents.If he structures his FD in the following manner:Rs 5 lakh in his name Rs 5 lakh in his first child name Rs 5 lakh in his second child name Rs 5 lakh in joint account with his wife with him as first holder Rs 5 lakh in joint account with his wife as first holder Rs 5 lakh in joint account with his father with him as first holder Rs 5 lakh in joint account with his father as first holder Rs 5 lakh in joint account with his mother with him as first holder Rs 5 lakh in joint account with his mother as first holder Further permutations and combinations are also possible. That would become more complex though. This way an individual can have Rs 45 lakh worth of FDs insured by the government for free in the same bank.The above structure can be repeated for his wife, father and mother. That would take the total to Rs 1.8 crore.So, don\u2019t wait for lightning to strike, make adjustments in your FDs with banks based on the two options as per your convenience.This way you can have a sound sleep and not fret about your money with this free government insurance announcement.DON\u2019T MISS:The 40 world heritage sites in India.

This also allows King\u2019s to open the research to the broader U.K. healthcare community.\nThe AI model was developed by King\u2019s and NVIDIA data scientists and engineers. It is one of several projects taking place on Cambridge-1. Other leading U.K. healthcare institutions planned digital biology projects include drug design and genome sequencing.\nCambridge-1 is the U.K.\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, with 80 NVIDIA DGX\u2122 A100 systems integrating NVIDIA A100 GPUs, BlueField\u00ae-2 DPUs and NVIDIA HDR InfiniBand networking.\nKing\u2019s College London intends to share its synthetic data model with the greater research and startup community.\n\n\n\n\nAbout King\u2019s College London\r\nKing\u2019s College London is an internationally renowned university delivering exceptional education and world-leading research.

Yet despite frustrations with acquiring the 30 Series cards, they remain incredibly popular. The demand for high-performance hardware among PC gamers remains incredible. It's no surprise then that leaks from Nvidia claim that the company is already wrapping up design plans for its next line of graphics cards, even as 30 Series cards remain inaccessible. Clearly, progress waits for no one. \nThe leak comes from Twitter user Greymon55. They say that the codename for the upcoming generation of graphics cards is Ada Lovelace, that it's \"definitely\" the next generation of Nvidia GPUs, and that plans have been finalized and will not change. While Greymon55 doesn't explicitly state that this is Nvidia's GeForce 40 Series of graphics cards that they're talking about, that's absolutely the implication. If the leak is to be believed, Nvidia is ready to start transitioning out of the 30 Series generation of GPUs.\nRELATED:\u00a0Nvidia and AMD GPUs May be Coming Down in Price This Quarter\nIn a second post, Greymon55 shares a little bit of information regarding the technology that will be used in Nvidia's Ada Lovelace cards. Greymon55 says \"TSMC 5nm 100%.\" TSMC refers to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is the world's largest semiconductor company and has Nvidia as a customer. 5nm refers to a process for making chips. It doesn't literally mean a 5-nanometer node, but is rather more of a brand used to explain a certain caliber of quality for a semiconductor chip. The 100% implies that they're confident the technology will be TSMC 5nm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor comparison's sake, Nvidia's 30 Series of graphics cards are based on Samsung's 8nm process. AMD's 6000 Series graphics cards utilize a TSMC 7nm fabrication process. Meanwhile, some semiconductor manufacturers, including Samsung and TSMC, are already preparing to start production on 3nm, though it may be years before that goal is reached. Nvidia's choice of 5nm will move it forward, but AMD\u00a0is reportedly also moving to 5nm. There's still some question as to whether Nvidia will use TSMC's newest and improved N5P process rather than its N5, however.\nEarlier in July, Greymon55 also offered up some early details regarding this next-gen Nvidia series of graphics cards' release date and performance levels. However, they clarified the leak by saying they're \"not sure if it's true.\" Still, they claim that Nvidia's 40 Series will release Q4 2022 into Q1 2023. As for performance, they say, \"3090 double performance.\"\nObviously, a new generation of Nvidia graphics cards is very exciting, particularly if double the performance of 30 Series cards is realistic. The huge, looming question regarding supply remains, however. At this point, some PC gamers are wondering if they'll have access to 30 Series cards by late 2022, let alone any newly released Nvidia 40 Series card.\nMORE:\u00a0Comparing the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080Ti Graphics Card to the 3080 and 3090\nSource: VideoCardz \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Launch Sales Numbers Compared to PS4 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nA new report indicates how the sales of Sony's recently released PlayStation 5 Pro compared to the PlayStation 4 Pro, which was launched in 2016.\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGabriel Machado Pureza\n\n\nNov 16, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Packaging Has Interesting Spin on Console's Lack of a Disc Drive\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nNov 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Confirms Release Date and Massive Price Tag\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro is Even More Expensive Outside the US\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAtari Reveals New Console\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nOph\u00e9lie Castelot\n\n\nAug 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tParty Club: How to Change Characters\n\t\t\n\n\nParty Club\n\nThe different characters in Party Club each have a unique visual flair.

But it\u2019s not just hardware that\u2019s helping professionals transform photorealistic rendering. AI technologies are also advancing design workflows in the industry.\nNVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a groundbreaking, AI-powered rendering technology that delivers ultra-high-resolution ray-traced images. Enscape, a leading supplier of rendering software for architectural visualization,\u00a0is\u00a0integrating\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0DLSS\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a03.1\u00a0release\u00a0of\u00a0its\u00a0real-time\u00a0rendering\u00a0and\u00a0VR\u00a0plugin.\u00a0\nWith Enscape supporting DLSS, it\u2019s now easier for architects and designers to harness the power of AI and boost the realism and performance of architectural visualization workflows.\nThe Growth of AI in AEC Industry\nAs high-fidelity GPU-accelerated visualization of 3D building models become more commonly used by architecture firms, innovative rendering software vendors like Enscape are taking large strides in speeding up photorealistic rendering and making it more easily accessible with easy-to-use functionality.\nEnscape was one of the first rendering engines to support\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0in\u00a02019. This delivered the benefits of real-time ray tracing to architects and designers by leveraging the first-generation RT Cores in RTX-powered workstations to enhance the speed, accuracy and realism of their 3D models and animations.\n\nWith accurate ray tracing and massively accelerated speed from RTX, project teams and clients improved decision-making, and archviz specialists gained time to iterate more during creation of compelling renders for competitions and bid submissions.\nWith the introduction of DLSS support in Enscape 3.1, architects and designers with NVIDIA RTX-powered workstations gain even more benefits, including:\n\nImproved real-time performance of walkthroughs and higher frame rates with much lower GPU requirements.\nDecreased video rendering time and increased image quality.\nHigher quality virtual reality experiences with the latest generation of high-resolution VR headsets.\n\n\nFollowing up NVIDIA\u2019s invention of AI-accelerated rendering denoising, NVIDIA DLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to increase graphics performance using Tensor Cores \u2014 dedicated hardware for AI processing on NVIDIA RTX professional GPUs. This upscaling technique allows Enscape to render internally at a lower resolution but output a crisp, clean high-resolution image for high-quality videos and high-performance VR walkthroughs.\nAI is powering enhancements for design visualization with tools like Enscape. And there are plenty of advancements in other areas such as autonomous construction vehicles and robotics.\nLearn more about the\u00a0role\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0plays\u00a0in\u00a0driving\u00a0these\u00a0innovations\u00a0forward for\u00a0the\u00a0AEC\u00a0industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFeatured image courtesy of Enscape.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Orcs Must Die! 3, the newest title from the action-packed, orc-slaying series from Robot Entertainment, is joining the GeForce NOW library when it releases tomorrow, Friday, July 23. \u00a0\nIn addition, 10 more games are coming to the service this week.\nPlay Your Games, Your Way\nGaming on GeForce NOW means having instant access to over 1,000 PC games streaming from the cloud. Whether it\u2019s a low-powered PC, Macs, Chromebooks, SHIELD TVs or Android and iOS mobile devices, GeForce NOW supported devices play real PC games with GeForce levels of performance.\nAnd you don\u2019t just get to play real PC versions of games optimized on GeForce NOW compatible devices. The games you play are the ones you own, streaming from popular stores like Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect and GOG.COM. With GeForce NOW, you never have to rebuy a different version of that game to play it on multiple compatible devices.\nMembers can play awesome PC games, like Orcs Must Die! 3 in high-powered detail and battle across all of their GeForce NOW compatible devices.\nBring the Mayhem\nOrcs Must Die! 3 (Steam) challenges players to slice, burn, toss, zap, grind and give it all they\u2019ve got to keep massive hordes of orcs at bay across the battlefield in an effort to secure the castle walls and victory. Battle with a buddy or slay your enemies solo against enormous orc armies with weapons and traps of your choice.\nPrepare the catapults \u2014 and everything else you\u2019ve got. You\u2019re going to need it to face off against these hordes of orcs.\nPlayers can experience all-new war scenarios that pit players against overwhelming legions of orcs. But don\u2019t worry, players have an arsenal of magic, weapons and new War Machines: traps on an oversized scale that range from mega flip traps that launch orcs ragdolling off the castle walls to mega boom barrel launchers that unleash pyrotechnic glory.\nEnjoy a new and exciting story set 20 years after the previous game with fresh characters.

Called RecSys, it\u2019s a relatively new branch of computer science that\u2019s spawned one of the most widely used applications in machine learning, one that helps millions find what they want to watch, buy and play.\nThe team\u2019s combination of six AI models packed into the contest\u2019s limit of 20 gigabytes all of the smarts it culled from studying 750 million data points. An unusual rule in the competition said the models had to run in less than 24 hours on a single core in a cloud CPU.\nThey hit the submission button and waited.\nTwenty-three hours and 40 minutes later an email arrived: They hit No. 1 on the leaderboard.\nRight Under the Buzzer\nOn June 28 it was official, a seven-member NVIDIA team won for the second time the ACM RecSys Challenge.\n\u201cThe email came in right under the buzzer \u2014 20 minutes later and we would have timed out,\u201d said Chris Deotte, one of several team members who\u2019s also a grandmaster in Kaggle competitions, the online Olympics of data science.\n\u201cWe were really on the edge,\u201d said Benedikt Schifferer, a teammate who helps design NVIDIA Merlin, a framework to help users quickly build their own recommendation systems.\nGPUs could have busted through the inference job in a fraction of the time. Adapting the work to one CPU core \u201cwas like going back to the distant past,\u201d said Gilberto \u201cGiba\u201d Titericz, a Brazil-based Kaggle grandmaster on the team.\nIn fact, once the competition was over, the team demonstrated the inference job that took nearly 24 hours on a CPU core could run on a single NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU in just five and a half minutes.\nSorting 40M Items a Day\nFor that competition, Twitter gave participants millions of data points a day for 28 days and asked them to predict which tweets users would like or retweet. It was an industrial-strength challenge from the leading technical conference on RecSys, an event that draws a who\u2019s who of top engineers from Facebook, Google, Spotify and other players.\nPart of the RecSys Challenge team (clockwise from upper left): Bo Liu, Benedikt Schifferer, Gilberto Titericz and Chris Deotte.\nThe discipline is as hard as it is helpful. Recommendation systems fuel our digital economy, serving up suggestions faster and smarter than a traditional search.\nIndustry challenges help advance the field for everyone, whether they\u2019re seeking the perfect gift for a spouse or trying to find an old friend online.\nThree Wins in Five Months\nEarlier this year, the full NVIDIA team led a field of 40 in the Booking.com Challenge. They used millions of anonymized data points to correctly predict the final city a vacationer in Europe would choose to visit.\nIn June, another top recsys contest, the SIGIR eCommerce Data Challenge, set an even higher hurdle.\nSIGIR challenge winners include (clockwise from upper left) Ronay Ak, Sara Rabhi, Md Yasin Kabir and team leader Gabriel Moreira.\nThe annual meeting of the Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval, SIGIR, draws experts from companies that span Alibaba to Walmart Labs. Its 2021 challenge provided 37 million data points from online shopping sessions and asked participants to predict which products users would buy.\nOverlap with the ACM contest forced the NVIDIA team to split into two groups that coordinated their efforts between the contests. Ratcheting up the pressure, some team members were heads down writing a paper for the ACM RecSys conference.\nThe Art of the Fast Break\nTwo factors propelled a five-person NVIDIA team with members spread across Brazil, Canada, France and the U.S. to the best overall performance, taking first or second place in every leaderboard. They made a big bet on Transformer models developed for natural-language processing and increasingly adopted for recsys, and they understood the art of the handoff.\n\u201cAs one member is going to bed another picks up the work in a different time zone,\u201d said Even Oldridge, who leads the Merlin group.\n\u201cWhen it all clicks, it\u2019s very effective, and I\u2019m amazed at what we\u2019ve accomplished in the last year building our internal knowledge and our standing in the recsys community to the point where we could win three major competitions in five months,\u201d he said.\nRespecting User Privacy\nThe contest required models to make predictions with no background on users beyond their current browsing session.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important task because sometimes users want to browse anonymously, and some privacy laws limit access to historical information,\u201d said Gabriel Moreira, a senior Merlin researcher in S\u00e3o Paulo who led NVIDIA\u2019s SIGIR team.\nThe competition marked the first time the team used only Transformer models in their solution to a challenge. Moreira\u2019s team aims to make the massive neural networks more easily available to every Merlin customer.\nFrom a Hat Trick to a Haul\nOn June 30, we notched a fourth consecutive win in RecSys, what hockey players call a haul. MLPerf, an industry benchmarking group, announced that NVIDIA and its partners set records in all its latest training benchmarks, including one in recommendation systems.\nThe team behind that effort described its work training a recommendation system in less than a minute on 14 NVIDIA DGX systems, a 3.3x speedup compared to their submission a year ago.\nSharing Lessons Learned\nThe competitions fuel ideas for new techniques that find their way into recsys frameworks like Merlin and related tools, papers and online classes held by the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute. The ultimate goal: Help everyone succeed.\nIn interviews NVIDIA\u2019s recsys experts freely shared their know-how \u2014 part art, part science.\nA Pro Tip on RecSys\nOne best practice is using a diversity of models that work together as an ensemble.\nIn the ACM RecSys Challenge, the team used both tree and neural-network models. The outputs from one stage became inputs for the next in a process called stacking.\n\u201cA single model can make a mistake due to a data error or convergence issue, but if you take an ensemble of several models, it\u2019s very powerful,\u201d said Bo Liu, the newest member of NVIDIA\u2019s Kaggle grandmaster team.\nMeet RecSys Experts Online\nOn July 29, you can meet RecSys experts from Facebook, NVIDIA and TensorFlow to learn more about how to create great recommender systems.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | GPU | Inference | Machine Learning | Merlin | Recommender Systems \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Grab your stuff. And walk right out again, without stopping to check out.\nIn just the past three months, California-based AiFi has helped Choice Market increase sales at one of its Denver stores by 20 percent among customers who opted to skip the checkout line.\nIt allowed Zabka, a Polish convenience store chain, to provide faster checkout for morning train commuters.\nIt helped pro-racing team Penske and Verizon run a dinky 200-square-foot store at the Indy500, so race fans could quickly get back to the action.\nAnd on Wednesday AiFi announced an expanded partnership with Loop Neighborhood to introduce its computer vision, camera-only platform into stores in California, starting with two Bay Area locations.\nAiFi, a member of the NVIDIA Inception accelerator for AI and deep learning startups, has moved out of the proof-of-concept stage and into stores across the world.\nIts technology makes shopping more convenient and helps retailers better understand their customers.\nAiFi has helped Choice Market increase sales at one of its Denver stores by 20 percent among customers who opted to skip the checkout line.\n\u201cRetailers can now get as much information about physical shopping habits as online stores are getting from ecommerce,\u201d  said AiFi CEO and co-founder Steve Gu, a veteran of Apple and Google.\nAiFi\u2019s ability to analyze shopper habits is even more impressive because its stores don\u2019t need to buy costly sensors and RFID tags.\nInstead, the company uses real-time image recognition and edge AI powered by NVIDIA GPUs to recognize the items shoppers select and charge them, usually through an app linked to the customer\u2019s credit card.\nIt\u2019s not an easy task in busy stores stocked with many hundreds of items, but the five-year-old company\u2019s technology now achieves an accuracy rate of 99 percent.\nTo date, more than 15 stores worldwide are putting the company\u2019s technology to work. Those stores are already serving satisfied customers who return again and again.\nAt Choice Market, 60 percent of shoppers who tried the checkout-free option used it again within a month. Twenty percent came back three times.\nThe computer-vision-powered system uses NVIDIA Metropolis for smart video analytics. It works smoothly alongside the store\u2019s traditional checkout system, and is integrated with the Choice Now app, where customers can shop checkout-free, and place online orders and arrange pickups.\nAiFi is revolutionizing retail operations with AI. At the Indy500 auto race earlier this year, Penske Entertainment\u2019s nano-store allowed fans to buy snacks, beverages and merchandise with an app. No need to stop and swipe a credit card.\nThis speed translates well to any kind of store where people need to slip in and out in a hurry. Zabka partnered with AiFi to open its first public autonomous store in Poznan, Poland, quickly drawing huge amounts of foot traffic from commuters going to and from a nearby train station.\nWith AiFi integrated with the Zappka App, which has over 5 million users, harried commuters could hustle out the door with a newspaper and a morning coffee.\nZappka partnered with AiFi to open its first public autonomous store in Poznan, Poland.\nMore stores equipped with AiFi\u2019s technology are coming. In France, the company is working with Carrefour on what the retailer calls its \u201cFlash LabStore,\u201d a frictionless store at its headquarters in Massy.\nAnd in the U.K., Britain\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket, Morrisons, is working with AiFi to test out a store with no checkout.\nThese stores represent a growing number of collaborations with major retailers that see AiFi\u2019s combination of AI and computer vision as the key to a brick and mortar retail renaissance that will ultimately put more goods in front of more customers, in more places.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform powering intelligent retail stores.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Computer Vision | Metropolis | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As they exchange ideas, educate and inspire each other, the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem of RTX-accelerated apps, hardware and drivers is helping advance their craft.\nGDC 2021 marks a major leap in game development with NVIDIA RTX technology integrated in the latest releases of Unity, Unreal Engine 4, Toolbag and more. They\u2019re supported by the July NVIDIA Studio Driver, available today, providing peak performance and reliability.\nDevelopers can create better looking games, in less time, without worrying about their systems crashing, with NVIDIA Studio.\nGame Development Runs Faster with NVIDIA Studio\nThe two most popular PC game engines, Unity and Unreal Engine, recently received additional RTX benefits.\nThe new 2021.2 beta release of Unity delivered native support for NVIDIA DLSS, allowing game developers to easily incorporate advanced AI rendering into their games. DLSS produces image quality that\u2019s comparable to native resolution \u2014 and sometimes even better \u2014 while only conventionally rendering a fraction of the pixels, boosting real-time performance for more engaging experiences and saving artists valuable exporting time.\n\nDLSS SDK 2.2.1, the latest offered by NVIDIA and built into Unity 2021.2, brings a new blueprint function to enable the optimal image quality for a particular resolution, called \u201cAuto\u201d mode. There\u2019s also an optional sharpening slider so developers can further tune their visuals.\nUnreal Engine 4.27, currently in preview, included an experimental feature called Eye-Tracked Foveated Rendering. The technique renders a single image at varying resolutions, sharpening the point of focus, while blurring other parts, to mimic human eyesight.\nIt\u2019s perfect for extended reality with improved performance on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, using NVIDIA Variable Rate Shading, and no discernable loss of picture quality. In addition, GPU Lightmass baking built on RTX ray tracing introduced parameters to better control lighting and levels of detail in production assets.\nImage courtesy of Unreal Engine.\nMarmoset Toolbag 4.03 sports a new ray-tracing engine, optimized to run on all modern GPUs. Even faster ray-traced results are achieved with native hardware support of NVIDIA RTX devices.\n\nThe most recent update added RTX-accelerated AI denoising, allowing game artists to quickly visualize materials with photorealistic lighting and shadows.\nImage courtesy of Marmoset Toolbag.\nRTX-accelerated ray racing with improved shading, global illumination and reflections raise the visual quality bar, while RTX-accelerated baking speeds up asset creation.\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse is a platform for 3D content creation and collaboration. It was built from the ground up to be easily extensible and customizable with a modular development framework. The platform includes ready-made Omniverse Apps like Machinima and Audio2Face, plus a collection of over 200 Omniverse Kit Extensions, small pieces of code purpose-built to achieve a specific task.\nGame developers can use the prebuilt apps or extensions, or easily build their own tools on Omniverse Kit, a robust system allowing coders with basic programming knowledge to build extensions, apps and microservices to assist in content creation pipelines.\nImage courtesy of NVIDIA Omniverse.\nDevelopers can learn more about Omniverse in the GDC session Collaborative Game Development with NVIDIA Omniverse, taking place from 8:30-9:30 a.m. PT on July 22. The session will feature tips on collaborative workflows between leading industry applications such as Unreal Engine 4, 3ds Max, and Maya, plus an introduction on how to build on Omniverse Kit. Interested developers can register here.\nThe Studio Advantage, Built for the Bold\nNVIDIA Studio ushered in a new era of creative performance with laptops and desktops purpose-built to power the world\u2019s most innovative minds. Packed with industry-leading RTX GPUs, these machines deliver unprecedented levels of computing power.\nFuture game developers and content creators can unleash their creativity and build magnificent worlds with the latest RTX 30-Series GPU-powered NVIDIA Studio laptops.\nPerfect for students heading back to school, Studio laptops accelerate more than just the latest game engines, they power dozens of applications in STEM \u2014 including engineering, computer science, data science and economics applications \u2014 plus the apps creators rely on. The latest selection of Studio laptops can be found in the Studio Shop.\nTogether with game engine and creative app developers, teams of testers and engineers are continually optimizing the way NVIDIA hardware works with top software \u2014 enhancing features, reducing the repetitive and speeding up workflows. Studio Drivers undergo extensive testing to deliver the performance and reliability developers need, helping them create the blockbuster games at the speed of imagination.\nFurther Boost Creativity With the July Studio Driver\nThe July NVIDIA Studio Driver available today features support for updates to Unity, Unreal Engine, Toolbag, Omniverse and more.\nEnscape 3.1, dropping July 21, adds a new NVIDIA real-time denoiser and support for NVIDIA DLSS, designed for real-time engines utilizing NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nImage courtesy of Enscape.\nThis enables smoother viewport visibility, as well as the ability to render at lower resolutions, enabling higher framerates, using AI super resolution to upscale the image to equal if not higher visual fidelity.\n\nPixar Animation Studios RenderMan 24 added RenderMan XPU, a look-development focused GPU-accelerated ray tracer.\nImage courtesy of RenderMan 24.\nTogether with AI denoising in the viewport, RenderMan XPU enables artists to interactively create their art and view an image that is predictive of the final frame render.\n\nClick here to download the Maya teapot asset used in performance testing.\nTopaz Video Enhance AI now offers Slow Motion, a new RTX GPU Tensor Core powered AI feature that generates a high-quality, smooth, slow-motion capture with minimal artifacts.\n\nCrucially, eliminating the need for an expensive high-frame-rate camera.\n\nFinally, gamers and content creators who use Discord to collaborate and share content with friends can use the new NVDEC integration, exclusive to NVIDIA GPUs, for accelerated video decoding. This lets them share screens and stream over Discord with reduced resources for video and results in better gaming performance.\nStay up to date on new Studio products by subscribing to the NVIDIA Studio newsletter and following us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\n\nCategories: Gaming | Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Using its own low-latency computing platform, the GODBOX powered by NVIDIA RTX, OSF enhanced virtual production workflows and delivered real-time compositing and previsualization for the interactive experience.\nBringing Virtual Sets to Life with NVIDIA RTX\nWhen it comes to bringing VFX on set, OSF faced a common challenge \u2014 finding computers that could be configured for their creative teams and production needs. So they created their own on-set computer platform, GODBOX Workstations and Servers. It\u2019s a synchronized real-time virtual production platform for low-latency, frame-accurate, virtual production applications and workflows.\nFrom LED and in-camera VFX to mixed reality and motion capture, the GODBOX provides all the tools, features and solutions needed to set up and run a virtual production from any set.\nAll images courtesy of On-Set Facilities.\nFor Deathtrap Dungeon, OSF laid the foundations during preproduction and previsualization. The team used virtual sets and real locations, and combined that with real-time visual effects to bring sets to life. Digitally creating the previsual assets allowed the team to specify the size of stages, amounts of props and how many physical sets were needed.\n\u201cThe objective was to previsualize the final VFX on the set, so that the directors, actors and crew could all see the virtual world,\u201d said Asa Bailey, director of virtual production at OSF. \u201cThe GODBOX delivers in-camera VFX and real-time compositing pipelines powered by NVIDIA RTX. The platform was specifically designed to work with all kinds of virtual productions.\u201d\nThroughout the preproduction and the film shoot, OSF used Unreal Engine to conduct virtual scouting sessions using the GODBOX cloud production VPN. Using the secure cloud platform, OSF tested the virtual sets and worked with the production to set lighting and camera movements, all before going on set.\nWith the RTX-powered GODBOX, OSF also delivered real-time compositing so the cast and crew can see their performance with the virtual set and characters.\u00a0 The team combined green screen live action with virtual sets and VFX elements in Unreal Engine. Then they\u2019d take the real-time composition and feed it through to large screens and projectors on set.\nOSF\u2019s GODBOX stays updated with the latest NVIDIA drivers, as well as recently released optimizations. This helps increase the stability of the machine, which becomes crucial when the cameras are rolling.\nLearn more about On-Set Facilities, GODBOX low-latency computing and virtual production.

Your sole aim is to survive Facepunch Studios\u2019 brutal world, where hunger, thirst, cold and wildlife are as dangerous as other players. Build bases, scavenge the world, and team up with others to increase your odds of survival.\nToday, Rust receives its latest round of content and feature enhancements, which continue to make the game better and better. And included with the update is the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS, which\u2019ll boost\u00a0system performance by up to 50%, while maintaining comparable image quality to native resolution rendering. In fact, in many instances, DLSS improves upon Rust\u2019s previous anti-aliasing options, with reduced temporal aliasing, superior detail in the distance, and improved anti-aliasing on the game\u2019s massive amount of foliage. Take a look in our new Rust NVIDIA DLSS video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), it\u2019s a groundbreaking AI rendering technology that increases graphics performance using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. To enable DLSS in Rust, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver, download the Rust update when released at 11 AM PT, then adjust settings in the Options > Graphics menu.\nIn our testing, frame rates increased by up to 50% at 4K with DLSS. Faster performance gives you smoother gameplay, or if you love eye candy, the headroom to crank up detail levels and rendering resolutions.\nAlso, be sure to enable NVIDIA Reflex in the options menu, if it isn\u2019t already activated. NVIDIA Reflex reduces latency by up to 38% in Rust, whilst maintaining your frame rate, so whenever it\u2019s available it\u2019s always beneficial to enable. Lower latency reduces the delay between a mouse click and a weapon firing in-game, reduces peeker\u2019s advantage, and increases your chance at victory, giving you a more responsive experience that\u2019ll make you more competitive online.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the availability of both NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex in Rust, players with GeForce RTX GPUs can get the definitive experience, with faster performance and optimized system latency.\nTo learn about all the other games that have recently added NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and ray tracing, head to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, players can experience \u2018Braking Point\u2019, a new story-based campaign, play two-player careers, and can jump into the campaign with \u2018Real Season Start\u2019, trying to achieve greater success with their points and standing.\nFor PC players, F1\u24c7 2021 further leverages the power of the latest hardware to deliver even greater realism, higher levels of visual fidelity, and more accurate simulations in expert driving modes for those with wheels, pedals, and the whole kit and kaboodle. Plus, if you have a GeForce RTX graphics card you can enable NVIDIA DLSS for maximum performance, and ray tracing to enhance reflections and shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nFollowing the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS to F1\u24c7 2020, we\u2019ve worked with Codemasters to bring the latest version of our AI and Tensor Core-powered tech to F1\u24c7 2021, where it can boost performance by up to 65%, enabling every GeForce RTX GPU owner to play at 60 FPS+ at 2560x1440, and owners of the GeForce RTX 3070 and up to play at over 60 FPS at 4K with max settings and ray tracing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Bahrain to Belgium, F1\u00ae 2021 players can maximize performance without compromising image quality, for the fastest and most fluid experience possible, as it should be when you\u2019re racing at up to 340 km/h. See for yourself in our new NVIDIA DLSS ON-OFF video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing Reflections & Shadows\nF1\u00ae teams devote as much attention to the aero-affecting chassis of their cars as they do their innards, and launch each new car with spectacular fanfare and glossy photos that make F1\u00ae fans weak at the knees. When replicating them for their games, Codemasters devotes more and more polygons each year, and applies ever-better rendering effects in an effort to perfectly replicate their polished appearance.\nFor Codemasters, the application of reflections and shadows have been particularly important, with significant resources invested in higher-quality effect presets, and custom-made techniques. Now, they\u2019ve taken the next logical step and upgraded to ray tracing, adding real-time reflections and shadows.\nWith ray tracing, all surrounding detail is accurately reflected on each car, and on windows, water surfaces and other metallic game elements, which previously lacked reflections, or featured simple cube maps. Now, all reflect the world around them, improving fidelity and realism. And with ray-traced shadows, existing shadows are enhanced with more accurate detail that naturally softens and sharpens, and many more smaller game elements now cast shadows, further enhancing the realism and quality of circuits, cars, and other game elements.\nTo use both ray-traced settings, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver, and then activate the options in the in-game graphics menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Always, There\u2019s More to Come \nF1\u24c7 2021 is the latest game to be enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS!

The autonomous driving platform, which is specifically designed for robotaxis, uses NVIDIA DRIVE automotive-grade GPUs to reach up to 2,200 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of AI compute performance.\nIn January, AutoX launched a commercial robotaxi system in Shenzhen, China, becoming one of the first autonomous driving companies in the world to provide full self-driving mobility services with no safety driver behind the wheel. The Gen5 system is the next step in its global rollout of safer, more efficient autonomous transportation.\n\u201cSafety is key. We need higher processing performance for safe and scalable robotaxi operations,\u201d said Jianxiong Xiao, founder and CEO at AutoX. \u201cWith NVIDIA DRIVE, we now have power for more redundancy in a form factor that is automotive grade and more compact.\u201d\nZero Blind Spots\nIn developing safe self-driving technology, AutoX is aimed at solving the toughest environments first \u2014 specifically high-traffic, urban areas.\nAt the Gen5 Release Event, the company livestreamed its fully driverless robotaxi transporting a passenger through challenging narrow streets in China, called the \u201cUrban Village.\u201d\nSafely navigating such chaotic streets requires sensors that can detect obstacles and other road users with the highest levels of accuracy. The Gen5 system relies on 28 automotive-grade camera sensors generating more than 200 million pixels per frame 360-degrees around the car. (For comparison, a single high-definition video frame contains about 2 million pixels.)\nIn addition to cameras, the robotaxi system includes six high-resolution lidar sensors that produce 15 million points per second and surround 4D radar.\nAt the center of the Gen5 system are two NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs that deliver 900 TOPS each for a truly level 4 autonomous, production platform. With this unprecedented level of AI compute at the core, Gen5 has enough performance to power ultra complex self-driving DNNs while maintaining the compute headroom for more advanced upgrades.\nThis capability makes it possible for the vehicles to react to high-traffic situations \u2014 like dozens of motorcycles and scooters cutting in or riding the opposite way at the same time \u2014 in real time, and continually improving, learning how to manage new scenarios as they arise.\nMore Stops Added\nThe Shenzhen fully driverless robotaxi service is just the first stop in AutoX\u2019s roadmap to deploy a global driverless vehicle platform.\nWith a population of more than 12 million people and ranking in the top 50 of global cities with the heaviest traffic, Shenzhen provides an ideal setting for developing a scalable robotaxi model.\nThe startup plans to roll out thousands of autonomous vehicles powered by the Gen5 system over the next couple of years and expand to multiple cities around the world. AutoX is working with partners such as Stellantis and Honda to integrate their technology in a variety of vehicle platforms.\n\nBy leveraging the open, scalable NVIDIA DRIVE platform for each of these use cases, the opportunities for the road ahead are limitless.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The solution delivers the intrusion prevention and advanced security capabilities of Palo Alto Networks\u2019 virtual NGFWs to every server without sacrificing network performance. It also allows network flows that were previously impossible or impractical to inspect by intelligently screening the relevant parts of the flow and offloading the rest to the DPU.\nThis hardware-accelerated software NGFW is a milestone in boosting software firewall performance and maximizing data center security coverage and efficiency by being first to market to be accelerated by a DPU.\nThe recently announced DPU-enabled Palo Alto Networks VM-Series NGFW uses zero trust network security principles. The DPU operates as an intelligent network filter to parse, classify and steer traffic flows with zero ReCPU overhead, which enables the NGFW to support close to 100Gb/s throughput for typical use cases. This is a 5x performance boost versus running the VM-Series firewall on a CPU alone \u2014 and up to 150 percent capex savings compared to legacy hardware.\n\u201cAs enterprises and telcos build cloud-like data centers, they need the agility and automation of the cloud without compromising performance. Together with NVIDIA, we are turbocharging our VM-Series virtual ML-powered NGFWs,\u201d said Muninder Singh Sambi, senior vice president of Products at Palo Alto Networks. \u201cThe industry-leading NVIDIA BlueField DPU is ideal for cybersecurity solutions operating in cloud-like environments.\u201d\nThe first BlueField-enabled NGFW to market, the VM-Series enables application-aware segmentation, prevents malware, detects new threats and stops data exfiltration with the BlueField DPU offloading the host processor to accelerate packet filtering and forwarding functionality.\n\nIntelligent Traffic Offload Service\nIn certain customer environments, the majority of traffic either does not need inspection (for example, streaming traffic such as video, gaming and video conferencing) or can\u2019t be inspected, such as encrypted traffic for which the customer is unable to assign corresponding decryption policy on firewall. In such environments, Intelligent Traffic Offload will ensure that firewall resources are optimally utilized to inspect only those flows that benefit from continuous security inspection.\nUp to 80 percent of network traffic, including media and encrypted data in a data center, doesn\u2019t need to be \u2014 or can\u2019t be \u2014 inspected by a firewall. To address this, the NVIDIA and Palo Alto Networks joint solution includes the Intelligent Traffic Offload (ITO) service, which examines network traffic to determine whether or not each session will benefit from security inspection.\nThe ITO service examines every session of the traffic to determine whether or not that session will benefit from security inspection. If the firewall determines that the session will not benefit from security inspection, ITO instructs the BlueField-2 DPU to forward all subsequent packets in that session directly to their destination without sending them to the firewall. (See the chart below.)\nBy only examining flows that can benefit from security inspection and offloading the rest to the DPU, the overall load on the firewall and the host CPU is reduced and performance increases without sacrificing security.\nThe ITO empowers enterprise, telco and cloud operators to protect end-users with an NGFW that can run on every host in a zero trust environment, helping expedite their digital transformation while keeping them safe from a myriad of cyberthreats.\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 integration with the NVIDIA BlueFIeld DPU allows the ITO service to intelligently offload traffic that does not benefit from further security inspection.\nExpanding Developer Ecosystem Around NVIDIA DOCA SDK\nPalo Alto Networks began development of the NGFW on the BlueField DPU by using the gRPC open source remote procedure call framework (a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and NVIDIA ASAP2, an open-source driven hardware acceleration framework.\nThe gRPC interface to BlueField and ASAP2 are now merged into the NVIDIA DOCA SDK, the data center infrastructure-on-a-chip architecture that gives developers an open platform for building software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking, storage, security and management applications running on BlueField DPUs.\nDOCA is part of NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to building a broad developer community that revolutionizes data center infrastructure applications and services powered by NVIDIA GPUs and BlueField DPUs.\nLearn more about the DOCA ecosystem and join our developer community.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | NetworkingTags: Cybersecurity \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cambridge is also the site of Arm\u2019s headquarters, which NVIDIA agreed to acquire last year, and that Huang hopes to make NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cfuture home in the U.K.\u201d\n\n\u2018Super-Exponential\u2019 Growth\nNVIDIA\u2019s Turing GPU architecture \u2014 named for Cambridge computing pioneer Alan Turing \u2014 introduced a computer architecture that makes artificial intelligence a central method of computation, Huang said. Now life sciences are poised to benefit from the \u201csuper-exponential\u201d growth in computing capabilities unleashed by new AI computing techniques.\nThe results are already \u201cstaggering,\u201d Huang explained, enabling researchers using the latest NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs to simulate 300 million atoms for 100,000 nanoseconds, a scale 10 millionfold larger than what was possible just 15 years ago.\nAmidst a global pandemic, bringing genomics and computing breakthroughs together is more important than ever, Huang explained. \u201cThe pandemic has made the need to accelerate healthcare a paramount social and economic imperative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need these two superpowers together now.\u201d\nBuilt Fast, Runs Fast\nNVIDIA\u2019s U.K. partners will be able to put the technologies powering Cambridge-1 to work with extraordinary speed. Cambridge-1 took just 20 weeks to build, rather than the two years it takes to build most supercomputers of its scale.\n\u201cFrom inception it was clear that Cambridge-1 was a pioneering deployment that would reimagine how quickly supercomputers can be designed and brought online,\u201d said Lee Myall, CEO of Kao Data, NVIDIA\u2019s co-location partner for Cambridge-1.\nCambridge-1 is ranked the 12th fastest in Europe and among the 50 fastest in the world, according to the latest TOP500 list of world\u2019s fastest computers. It delivers more than 400 petaflops of AI performance and eight petaflops of Linpack performance.\nBased on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD reference architecture, the system packs 80 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, integrating NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, BlueField-2 DPUs and NVIDIA HDR InfiniBand networking.\nUK Expertise, Global Impact\nCambridge-1 gives NVIDIA a platform to work with world-class U.K. universities, life sciences companies, healthcare providers and over a thousand startups, Huang explained.\nAs part of Wednesday\u2019s event, key Cambridge-1 partners gathered to talk about the breakthroughs they\u2019re pursuing with the new machine.\nAstraZeneca uses Cambridge-1 to train a model named MegaMolBART. With it, the pharmaceutical giant can borrow techniques from natural language processing to help discover new drugs, explained Lindsay Edwards, vice president of Data Science and AI, Respiratory and Immunology, BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca.\nIn addition, NVIDIA works with many public and private sector healthcare organizations in the U.K., including the NHS, UK Biobank, Genomics England, and more than 80 U.K. healthcare startups involved in NVIDIA Inception.\nKing\u2019s College London and Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust are using Cambridge-1 to teach AI models to generate images of synthetic brains, trained using tens of thousands of MRI brain scans across various ages and diseases.\nWith enough medical imagery of a specific disease, we can \u201cstart to understand the evolution or the progression of a disease,\u201d said Sebastian Ourselin, head of the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King\u2019s College London.\nOxford Nanopore, a member of the NVIDIA Inception startup accelerator program, uses innovative sensors and AI algorithms running on NVIDIA GPU supercomputers to digitize DNA into sequences of billions of characters.\nOxford Nanopore\u2019s technology helped to characterize the coronavirus genome. Now it\u2019s being used to do rapid testing and identify variants of the virus, making the U.K. a leader in this area.\n\u2018Full Circle\u2019\nHuang explained that NVIDIA\u2019s work with these world-class organizations at Cambridge brings NVIDIA \u201cfull circle.\u201d Cambridge-1 brings NVIDIA back to where much of modern computing and life sciences began. And to where so much talent now resides.\n\u201cBut the impact will be global, benefiting millions of people around the world,\u201d Huang said. \u201cCambridge-1, we have a world to save \u2014 make it so.\u201d\nTo watch a video of the full event, visit our Cambridge-1 website.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 NVIDIA\u2019s Marc Hamilton on Building the Cambridge-1 Supercomputer During a Pandemic \u2013 Ep. 137\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA in Europe \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company will make its next-generation virtual firewalls run on Nvidia\u2019s BlueField-2 DPU, promising a five-fold performance increase to enterprises and service providers.That would be a huge leap in performance for enterprises with hundreds to thousands of virtual software firewalls in their private cloud environments and for service providers that rely on firewalls to secure their large networks, Muninder Singh Sambi, Palo Alto\u2019s senior VP of products, told DCK. Switching from a dedicated hardware firewall to a virtual one would no longer mean having to accept slower network speed.\u201cIt\u2019s better security without compromising performance,\u201d Sambi said.Nvidia\u2019s recently introduced BlueField-2 family of DPUs are dedicated infrastructure processors designed to offload processing tasks like security and network and storage management to lighten the load on CPUs, leaving more resources for main application processing.With BlueField DPU, Nvidia Is Ahead of Rivals in a New MarketChipmakers have been racing to develop their entries for the emerging DPU accelerator market. These processors improve data center performance, efficiency, and cost effectiveness, Jim McGregor, a principal analyst at TIRIAS Research, told DCK.Related:Xilinx Wants to Flip the CPU-Accelerator Relationship Upside DownPalo Alto Networks and Nvidia have collaborated on the DPU-enabled VM-Series next-generation firewall for about a year, said Sambi, adding that the product is meant for service providers and enterprises with hyperscale security needs.Palo Alto turned to DPUs because its customers were asking for the technology, and it partnered with Nvidia because the chipmaker developed a DPU that fit its needs, according to him.\u201cThe timing was right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see a growing need for this.\u201dNvidia began shipping the BlueField-2 DPU in April; Intel unveiled its own DPU, called the Infrastructure Processing Unit, in June; Marvell (also in June) announced ts OCTEON 10 DPU; and Xilinx, which has made a deal to be acquired by AMD, announced its Versal HBM accelerator last week.\u201cAll these guys are coming at it from different angles and slightly different ways,\u201d McGregor said, but Nvidia is a pioneer in the space and has an early market lead. \u201cThe one out front is Nvidia, but it\u2019s still a nascent market.\u201dNvidia also has an advantage in its software tools that enable developers to optimize their applications to run on its DPUs, he said. They can use Nvidia\u2019s DOCA software development kit to write applications that take advantage of the processor\u2019s capabilities.Related:Intel Shatters Precedent, Embraces Dedicated FPGA Infrastructure ProcessorsIts partnership with Palo Alto Networks is the latest sign that Nvidia DPUs are gaining traction. Server manufacturers such as Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, Inspur, Lenovo, and Supermicro integrating Nvidia DPUs into their servers.Enterprise data center software companies including VMware, Red Hat, Canonical, and Check Point Software Technologies all support Nvidia DPUs as well. As part of its Project Monterey initiative, VMware is working with Nvidia to offload not just networking, security, and storage management tasks to the DPU, but also the hypervisor itself.Nvidia DPUs are based on SmartNIC cards by Mellanox, which Nvidia acquired for $7 billion in 2019; silicon by Arm, the British processor giant that agreed to be acquired by Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020; and Nvidia\u2019s own GPU accelerators.\u201cThe combination of the (Mellanox) ConnectX adapter, Arm cores, and accelerators is super powerful,\u201d Kevin Deierling, Nvidia\u2019s senior VP of networking, told DCK.How Nvidia BlueField DPU Speeds Up Palo Alto\u2019s Virtual FirewallNvidia and Palo Alto Networks together build the Intelligent Traffic Offload (ITO) service, which identifies network traffic that needs security inspection, according to a blog post by Nvidia.About 80 percent of network traffic either doesn\u2019t have to or cannot be inspected by a firewall. That includes streaming traffic, such as video, games, and video conferencing, and encrypted traffic, the blog post said.If the firewall decides a session doesn\u2019t benefit from inspection, the ITO tells the BlueField-2 DPU to forward all the subsequent packets in that session directly to their destination, without sending them to the firewall.For example, if an enterprise user is on a video conference and the x86 CPU determines that the traffic isn\u2019t malicious, it offloads the rest of the video conference to DPU, Nvidia\u2019s Deierling explained. With 80 percent of the network traffic offloaded to the DPU, the remaining 20 percent goes to the x86 CPU for deeper packet inspection.\u201cBy only examining flows that can benefit from security inspection and offloading the rest to the DPU, the overall load on the firewall and the host CPU is reduced and performance increases without sacrificing security,\u201d the blog post said.Faster speed also means enterprises and service providers can meet their firewall needs with fewer servers, resulting in up to 150 percent capex savings, the two companies estimated.Palo Alto Networks\u2019 partnership with Nvidia is not exclusive. The cybersecurity company is also prototyping DPUs from other vendors. \u201cWe think this is just the start of the journey. More things are coming our way,\u201d Palo Alto\u2019s Sambi said.About the AuthorWylie WongChips and Hardware WriterWylie Wong is a journalist and freelance writer specializing in technology, business and sports.

We\u2019re now investing in new platforms where we can deploy advanced graphics so gamers have more choice. The performance and energy efficiency of ARM CPUs with NVIDIA technologies can open an entirely new class of PCs.\n\u201cRTX is the most groundbreaking technology to come to PC gaming in the last two decades,\u201d said PC Tseng, general manager of MediaTek\u2019s Intelligent Multimedia Business Unit.\u201cMediaTek and NVIDIA are laying the foundation for a new category of Arm-based high-performance PCs.\u201d\nRTX on Arm in Action\nShowing the potential for NVIDIA RTX on Arm, developer Machine Games packed the Wolfenstein: Youngblood demo with beautiful, ray-traced reflections, all accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS, which uses GPU-accelerated deep-learning algorithms to boost frame rates.\nNVIDIA also showed how RTX can enhance the The Bistro demo, which portrays a detailed, ray-traced urban scene in France, while running on an Arm-based system.\nBoth were demonstrated on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU paired with a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 Arm processor. Wolfenstein: Youngblood uses the idTech game engine made by id Software, while The Bistro uses NVIDIA\u2019s sample framework.\nView the demos here.\n\nThe demos are made possible by NVIDIA extending support for its software development kits for implementing five key NVIDIA RTX technologies to Arm and Linux.\nThey include:\n\nDeep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), which uses AI to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images for games\nRTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), which lets developers add dynamic lighting to their gaming environments\nRTX Global Illumination (RTXGI), which helps recreate the way light bounces around in real-world environments\nNVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers (NRD) a\u00a0denoising library that\u2019s designed to work with low ray per pixel signals\nRTX Memory Utility (RTXMU), which optimizes the way applications use graphics memory\n\nThe Potential for RTX on ARM\n\nGeForce RTX technologies \u2014 including GPU-accelerated ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS and other AI-powered innovations \u2014 have made a significant impact on real-time graphics since their introduction in 2018.\nThe world\u2019s leading publishers have used NVIDIA RTX technologies to set apart their top franchises. RTX technologies are now available in an all-star list of gaming franchises, including Battlefield, Call of Duty, Cyberpunk, DEATH STRANDING, Doom, Final Fantasy, Fortnite, LEGO, Minecraft, Quake, Rainbow Six, Red Dead Redemption, Rust, Tomb Raider, Watch Dogs and Wolfenstein.\nThe news garnered widespread industry support.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA extending RTX support to Arm and Linux has the potential to benefit games and industries such as automotive, where leading manufacturers use Unreal Engine not only for design visualization but also for digital cockpits and infotainment\u201d said Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games. \u201cWe always welcome powerful features and SDKs that can be leveraged across many platforms.\u201d\n\u201cWolfenstein: Youngblood is the first RTX PC game to be shown on an Arm-based system, a testament to the flexibility, power and optimized nature of the iD Tech engine,\u201d said Machinegames CTO Jim Kjellin. \u201cAn iD Tech-based game running on an Arm CPU with ray tracing enabled is a significant step in a journey that will result in many more gaming platforms being available to all game developers.\u201d\n\u201cRTX support for Arm and Linux opens up new opportunities for game developers to provide more immersive experiences on a wider variety of platforms,\u201d said Mathieu Muller, senior technical product manager of high-end graphics at Unity. \u201cWith GeForce RTX\u2019s cutting-edge graphics features, Unity developers targeting Arm platforms will have more tools in their toolbox to create with.\u201d\n\nThe RTXDI, NRD and RTXMU SDKs for Arm with Linux and Chromium are available now. RTXGI and DLSS will be coming soon.

Its first projects with AstraZeneca, GSK, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies include developing a deeper understanding of brain diseases like dementia, using AI to design new drugs and improving the accuracy of finding disease-causing variations in human genomes.\nCambridge-1 brings together decades of NVIDIA\u2019s work in accelerated computing, AI and life sciences, where NVIDIA Clara\u2122 and AI frameworks are optimized to take advantage of the entire system for large-scale research. An NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122 supercomputing cluster, it ranks among the world\u2019s top 50 fastest computers and is powered by 100 percent renewable energy.\n\u201cCambridge-1 will empower world-leading researchers in business and academia with the ability to perform their life\u2019s work on the U.K.\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, unlocking clues to disease and treatments at a scale and speed previously impossible in the U.K.,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cThe discoveries developed on Cambridge-1 will take shape in the U.K., but the impact will be global, driving groundbreaking research that has the potential to benefit millions around the world.\u201d\nCambridge-1 builds on the U.K.\u2019s status as a global leader in life sciences, technology and AI by providing advanced infrastructure for current and future generations to carry out groundbreaking research within the country.\nAccording to a report by Frontier Economics, an economics consulting firm, Cambridge-1 has the potential to create an estimated value of \u00a3600 million (about $825 million) over the next 10 years.\nAstraZeneca: Transforming Drug Discovery with AI \r\nNVIDIA is collaborating with AstraZeneca to fuel faster drug discoveries, creating a transformer-based generative AI model for chemical structures. Transformer-based neural network architectures, which have become available only in the last several years, allow researchers to leverage massive datasets using self-supervised training methods, avoiding the need for manually labeled examples during pre-training.\nThe MegaMolBART drug discovery model is being used in reaction prediction, molecular optimization and de novo molecular generation and will optimize the drug discovery process. It is based on AstraZeneca\u2019s MolBART transformer model and is being trained on the ZINC chemical compound database \u2014 using NVIDIA\u2019s Megatron framework to enable massively scaled-out training on supercomputing infrastructure. This model will be open sourced, available to researchers and developers in the NVIDIA NGC\u2122 software catalog.\nNVIDIA and AstraZeneca are also planning a separate project on Cambridge-1 focused on the use of AI in digital pathology. In digital pathology, significant time and money are spent annotating whole slide images of tissue samples, to aid the search for new insights. By using unsupervised AI algorithms trained on thousands of images, it is possible to accelerate the process of annotating while simultaneously finding potential imaging features that help in drug development\n\u201cTraining AI algorithms on whole slide images is challenging in part due to the size of the images,\u201d said Lindsay Edwards, vice president and head of AI, Respiratory and Immunology, BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. \u201cWorking with NVIDIA on Cambridge-1 enables us to scale our current work and develop new methodologies advancing the use of AI in digital pathology.\u201d\nGSK: Steering Great Science with Partners for Patients\r\nGSK\u2019s research and development approach includes a focus on genetically validated targets, which are twice as likely to become medicines and now make up more than 70 percent of its research pipeline. To maximize the potential of these insights, GSK has built state-of-the-art capabilities at the intersection of human genetics, functional genomics, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\u201cAdvanced technologies are core to GSK\u2019s R&D approach and help to unlock the potential of large, complex data through predictive modeling at new levels of speed, precision and scale,\u201d said Dr. Kim Branson, senior vice president and global head of AI-ML at GSK. \u201cWe are pleased to have the opportunity to partner with NVIDIA to deliver on GSK\u2019s drug discovery ambition and contribute to the U.K.\u2019s rich life sciences ecosystem \u2014 both aims that have patient benefit at the centre.\u201d\nWorking with partners at the cutting edge of genetics, genomics and AI/ML can ultimately help GSK predict more about human health, and develop better medicines that are twice as likely to succeed in the clinic and go on to become approved therapies that benefit patients. Access to Cambridge-1 will contribute additional computational power and state-of-the-art AI technology to GSK\u2019s drug discovery process.\nKing\u2019s College London & Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust: AI-Generated Synthetic Brain Data \r\nKing\u2019s College London and Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust are using Cambridge-1 to teach AI models to generate synthetic brain images by learning from tens of thousands of MRI brain scans, from various ages and diseases. The ultimate goal is to use this synthetic data model to gain a better understanding of diseases like dementia, stroke, brain cancer and multiple sclerosis and enable earlier diagnosis and treatment.\nAs this AI synthetic brain model can generate an infinite amount of never-seen brain images with chosen characteristics (age, disease, etc.), it will allow a better and more nuanced understanding of what diseases look like, possibly enabling an earlier and more accurate diagnosis.\n\u201cThrough this partnership, we will be able to use a scale of computational power that is unprecedented in healthcare research,\u201d said Professor Sebastien Ourselin, head of the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt will be truly transformational for the health and treatment of patients.\u201d\nThis research leverages several of the U.K.\u2019s world-leading healthcare resources through close collaboration with the National Health Service and the UK Biobank, one of the richest biomedical databases in the world. King\u2019s College London intends to share this synthetic data model with the greater research and startup community.\n\u201cThe power of artificial intelligence in healthcare will help to speed up diagnosis for patients, improve services such as breast cancer screening, and support the way that we risk assess and prioritize patients according to clinical need,\u201d said Professor Ian Abbs, chief executive officer of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust. \u201cWe are excited about our involvement in the Cambridge-1 data center as it will enable us to be amongst the first to benefit from these new AI capabilities \u2014 using the very latest technology to benefit our patients, as well as manage precious resources more efficiently.\u201d\nOxford Nanopore: Scalable, Real-Time Genomics\nOxford Nanopore Technologies\u2019 long-read sequencing technology is being used in more than 100 countries to gain genomic insights across a breadth of research areas \u2014 from human and plant health to environmental monitoring and antimicrobial resistance.\nOxford Nanopore deploys NVIDIA technology in a variety of genomic sequencing platforms to develop AI tools that improve the speed and accuracy of genomic analysis. With access to Cambridge-1, Oxford Nanopore will be able to carry out tasks relating to algorithm improvement in hours rather than days. These improved algorithms will ensure improved genomic accuracy for greater insights and quicker turnaround times in scientists\u2019 hands.\n\u201cHarnessing the power of Cambridge-1 will help us further speed up our algorithm development to support powerful, accurate genomic analysis,\u201d said Rosemary Sinclair Dokos, vice president of Product and Programme Management at Oxford Nanopore. \u201cThis will in turn enable the scientists using our technology on the ground to gain more insights than ever before, across a breadth of research areas.\u201d\nAbout Cambridge-1\r\nCambridge-1 is the first NVIDIA supercomputer designed and built for external research access. The company will collaborate with researchers to make much of this work available to the greater scientific community.\nFeaturing 80 DGX\u2122 A100 systems integrating NVIDIA A100 GPUs, BlueField\u00ae-2 DPUs and NVIDIA HDR InfiniBand networking, Cambridge-1 is an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD that delivers more than 400 petaflops of AI performance and 8 petaflops of Linpack performance. The system is located at a facility operated by NVIDIA partner Kao Data.\nCambridge-1 is the first supercomputer NVIDIA has dedicated to advancing industry-specific research in the U.K. The company also intends to build an AI Center for Excellence in Cambridge featuring a new Arm-based supercomputer, which will support more industries across the country.\nWatch the inauguration event and learn more about the Cambridge-1 supercomputer.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

In the eyes of an increasing number of property buyers, two-bedroom (2BR) apartments are ideal. Singapore household sizes have fallen over the years, with many couples having only one or two children or deciding to skip childbearing altogether. As family sizes shrink, so too does the need for a large number of bedrooms.  2BR condo units are ideal for singles or couples without children as the spare bedroom can double up as a home office or guest bedroom. The 2BR layout is also a good choice for couples with one child. In addition, HDB upgraders can take advantage of the relative affordability of 2BR apartments to purchase their first private property. To give you an idea of what\u2019s on the market, here are 10 of the cheapest 2BR condo listings on PropertyGuru. 1.

Property agents that EdgeProp spoke to reckon it is just a coincidence. (See also: Leedon Park Good Class Bungalow sold for $73 mil) The owners are as varied as the GCBs and the locations. Two of the GCBs were transacted for the same absolute price of $36 million, with caveats lodged on the same day - June 25. One was a GCB at Binjai Park and the other is at Swettenham Road. The third is a GCB at 24 Coronation Road West which had been put on the market for sale at $37 million in May. It is said to have found a buyer for $36 million around the same time towards the end of June, although a caveat has yet to be lodged. The fourth is the GCB at 27 Olive Road, which was sold to Ian Ang, the co-founder of Secretlab gaming chair, with a caveat lodged for $36 million on June 24. Binjai Park    The GCB at Binjai Park owned by CEO of Yongnam Holdings changed hands recently at $36 million (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)    Source: EdgeProp Singapore Inspector tool  The GCB at Binjai Park sits on a freehold corner plot of 27,320 sq ft and has a prominent frontage. It has changed hands four times in the past 26 years. The property is one of the biggest plots on Binjai Park, hence the $36 million transaction price is also the highest achieved in the GCB estate to date. The price translates to a land rate of $1,318 psf.  The property was owned by Seow Soon Yong, CEO of Singapore-listed structural steel contractor and civil engineer, Yongnam Holdings for over a decade. Seow had purchased it in 2010 for $27 million ($988 psf) and had built a new house on the site, which was completed in 2012. The property was put up for sale two years ago with a $40 million ($1,464 psf) price tag. According to a property title search, the buyers of the GCB at Binjai Park is Ng Siew Moi, a director of Inter-Continental Oils & Fats (ICOF), a merchandiser and distributor of sustainable palm oil and palm oil derivative products, and Lim Jing Yi Clara, Karim.

The GCB was previously held by Ng Bok Eng Holdings, a company founded in 1969 focusing on property and securities investment. The firm was founded by the late business tycoon and philanthropist Ng Bok Eng, who was known in the past as the \u201cking of cloves\u201d. Ng had migrated to Singapore in 1947 and founded Bian Bee Company, an import-export business dealing in cloves, coffee and pepper.   Story continues Ng Bok Eng Holdings purchased the GCB at Swettenham Road for $6.5 million ($353 psf) in Nov 2003. On the site is an existing house built in 2000. The recent sale price of $36 million is more than 5.5 times the original purchase price 18 years ago.The buyer of the GCB at Swettenham Road, based on a property title search, is Gregory Alva Ng Yong He. According to his bio from an article in New Naratif published in Aug 2019, Ng is a writer and researcher based in Singapore. He is a graduate with a B.A. in Ethnicity, Race & Migration from Yale University, and at that time, was enrolled in the Performance Studies M.A. programme at New York University. Ng is said to be one of the sons of Philip Ng, CEO of one of Singapore's largest property groups, Far East Organization. The deal was brokered by Michael Lam of Asset Property.Coronation Road West  The GCB at 24 Coronation Road West that fetched $36 million ($1,500 psf) recently, although a caveat has yet to be lodged (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)  Source: EdgeProp Singapore Inspector toolThe GCB at 24 Coronation Road West is said to have changed hands a fortnight ago for $36 million. The GCB, which sits on a freehold site of 24,000 sq ft, was put on the market for $37 million just two months ago. However, a caveat has yet to be lodged. The property is owned by a family under the entity of Namazie Realty Pte Ltd, according to a title search. Steve Tay, senior associate vice president of List Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who brokered the sale, declined to comment on the deal.In a story that ran in EdgeProp on May 14, the orientation of the property at 24 Coronation Road West can be changed. It will front Jalan Sampurna, and will become part of the Oei Tiong Ham GCB estate. The buyer has the option to purchase the strip of state land of about 8,000 sq ft adjacent to the property at Coronation Road West. However, approval from Singapore Land Authority is needed for the amalgamation with the existing GCB site to create a larger land plot.Olive Road  The GCB at Olive Road that changed hands for $36 million ($1,537 psf) at the end of June (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)  Source: EdgeProp Singapore Inspector toolThe GCB at 27 Olive Road was purchased by Ian Ang, co-founder of Secretlab gaming chairs for $36 million, according to a caveat lodged on Jun 24. The story was first published on EdgeProp Singapore on June 29.The property was previously owned by Danny Yong Ming Chong, founding partner and CIO of hedge fund Dymon Asia Capital, who had purchased it for $26.1 million ($1,114 psf) in Oct 2012. \u201cWhen the owner purchased the site back then, the plan was to build a new home and move in eventually,\u201d says Tay of List Sotheby\u2019s, who represented the seller in the deal.  The Silkie chickens, pets of the expatriate family, roam free on the grounds of the GCB at Olive Road (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)The old bungalow at Olive Road was built in 1940. Yong renovated the property and rented to an expatriate family who wanted a vast garden so that their four pet Silkie chickens can roam freely. The family likes the proximity to MacRitchie Nature Trail and Reservoir Park as well as the convenience of amenities in the nearby Thomson Road and Toa Payoh precincts, notes Tay. They have been living there for the past five years.The GCB at 27 Olive Road, which sits on an elevated plot of 23,424 sq ft, had been put on the market for $38.9 million several months ago. At the sale price of $36 million ($1,537 psf), it\u2019s a record high both in terms of absolute and psf price for the Caldecott Hill Estate. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a GCB in the Caldecott Hill Estate sold for above $30 million in the last 15 years,\u201d notes Tay.Check out the latest listings near Binjai Park, Swettenham Road, 24 Coronation Road West, Olive RoadSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) [UPDATE] TT International bosses\u2019 home at Coronation Road West for sale at $48 mil [UPDATE] Secretlab co-founder Ian Ang snaps up penthouse, Good Class Bungalow for $51 mil  GCB at Coronation Road West going for $37 mil amid surging prices En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

One way that investors can do this is by beefing up their portfolios with overweight stocks\u2014these heavyweight assets will help you swing above the average. \ud83e\udd4a\nWhile making better returns will help with any investing plans, it\u2019s even more important when some analysts see us on the verge of a bear market. Learning how overweight stocks work gives you valuable insight into what picks are better for your portfolio.\u00a0\nKnowing what these assets are will expand your investing lexicon and keep you informed. So, what are overweight stocks, how do you identify them, and how do you use them to make money? Let\u2019s find out. \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat you\u2019ll learn\n\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat Does Overweight Stock Mean?\nImportance of Portfolio Diversity\nWhy Stocks are Weighed\nExamples of Overweight Stocks\nOverweight Stock Rating Systems\nPros and Cons of Going Overweight\nHow Analysts Determine 'Overweight'\nUsing Indices as Benchmarks\nHow to Invest in Overweight Stocks\nFinal Note\nFAQs\nGet Started Trading Stocks\n\n\nWhat Does Overweight Stock Mean?\u00a0\ud83d\udd0e\nIf you watch financial news or listen to what analysts have to say, you may have heard the term overweight being thrown around. It may seem counterintuitive at first that being overweight is a good thing. After all, it sounds like the company may need to trim back.\u00a0\nWhat people actually mean when they say a company is overweight is that investors are bullish on the asset. They see the company growing and outcompeting similar businesses in the next 8 to 12 months.\nThe term overweight is used as an expression of your overall portfolio or an index in general. When a company is overweight it should outweigh other assets. Overweight stocks have good prospects for continued profitability.\u00a0\nOverweight status comes from the normal indicators that we see with good companies. Good decisions being made by management, important proprietary patents being secured, and indicators of market growth.\nFor some investors, It\u2019s good to keep a balanced and diverse portfolio with stocks and bonds. This keeps you safe from excessive risk and keeps you seeing modest, but consistent returns. However, having a less diverse portfolio may mean that you are exposed to greater potential gains.\nLosing portfolio diversity can be a good thing, and when the analysts say a stock is overweight, it may be time to load up on that asset. Trimming some of the less desirable underweight stocks, and instead betting on businesses that are seeing strong growth. All of this converts to greater profitability for you. \ud83e\udd11\nImportance of Portfolio Diversity \ud83d\uddc2\nWhile overweight stocks can make excellent investment vehicles, keeping some diversity in your portfolio can be a good way of dealing with underperformance. Insulating from risks isn\u2019t always the best way of making extreme gains, but it can keep you from hitting the sale button when things look bleak. It\u2019s easier seeing your account down by 5% instead of 50%.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, having some overweight stocks in your portfolio can help the other assets look better. A few securities that are beating the average while the rest of your investments are staying the course will make your entire account look better.\nThere are several options available from top stock brokers for investors that want to maintain diversity while staying overweight in a sector they are confident in. These can come in mutual funds or even Exchanged Traded Funds. There are all kinds of ETFs for investors who believe in the possibility of greater returns in tech, energy, or even cannabis.\u00a0\nFor investors who don\u2019t have the time to manually track each company in their account, ETFs and mutual funds present an opportunity to get higher returns without spending too much time reading trades and doing fundamental analysis.\nWhy Stocks are Weighed\u00a0\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nStocks are weighed because it helps investors and analysts classify and understand a more realistic impact of certain assets against benchmarks. This means that bigger companies have a larger representation in indexes and portfolios.\u00a0\nFor example, the S&P 500 is the most commonly used index in America and it is composed of the 500 largest companies. Weighing is imported so that the largest companies don\u2019t take up the same percentage of the index as the smallest companies. Instead, every company represents a proportional amount of their market capitalization relative to other businesses.\nThis is important because it gives a more accurate representation of the market. It also means that when you are composing your own portfolio you can avoid investing too heavily in one asset.\nAdvisors often recommend that you don\u2019t put too much of your portfolio into one stock because it may expose you to an excessive amount of risk relative to the potential reward. Risk indicators such as the beta are important to understand why a stock might be excessively risky.\nThe majority of people aren\u2019t constantly evaluating and redistributing the weight of assets in a major index though. For most people, it\u2019s simply good enough to know that an overweight stock is likely a good buy, while underweight stocks are trending downwards.\nExamples of Overweight Stocks \ud83d\udc47\nThe market is constantly changing and so finding the right time to purchase stocks is key to staying profitable. Even now, analysts are seeing more movement in recovering markets, opening the door for investors to make a profit. Keeping your eye on what is overweight and what is underweight can be incredibly helpful when trying to beat trends.\nRecently the tech industry overall has been performing very well when compared to the rest of the stock market. Over the past year, the ETF QQQ, which is weighted more heavily in favor of the largest tech companies on the S&P 500, has returned an additional 4% profit to investors when compared with a standard S&P 500 ETF. Any extra percent is important, especially for investors who are worried about peaking inflation.\n\nSPY compared to QQQ in 2020 and 2021. Image by TradingView.\nInvestors who invested more heavily in the tech sector for this period of time would have more to show for their money than individuals who decided to stick with an even distribution. While investors who bought QQQ were exposed to greater risk and more volatility, the gains have been greater.\nAnother tech company that is often considered overweight is Nvidia. Analysts have been expecting strong returns from this company given their dominant market share and their products that are difficult to produce.\u00a0\n\nComparing NVDA to QQQ in 2020 and 2021. Image by TradingView\nHere, we can see that while QQQ performed comparable levels to the S&P 500 for the past three months. During that same time period, it was massively outperformed by the overweight stock NVDA.\u00a0\nWhile QQQ presented more diversity and insulation than just buying a single security, we can see that the lack of diversity could have produced greater gains for investors. It isn\u2019t always just industries that are propped up.\u00a0\nWhile QQQ gives a good representation of tech companies it is also important to remember that investors can drill down further and find the specific companies that are making an entire sector seem more attractive. This especially becomes more evident when dealing with massive market cap companies like Amazon or Apple. This same technique can be used when looking at the stock market from day to day as a few companies and some good news can drive up the entire market.\nIn the stock market, there are no sure things. Even when a stock is overweight, that doesn\u2019t mean the company can\u2019t have a bad report or miss earning goals and thus drive the price down. Something that happened to Peloton after disappointing news emerged about new product lines.\n\nPeloton (PTON) price changes in early 2021. Image by TradingView.\nAlthough it was considered overweight earlier in May and April, PTON dropped sharply based on poor news and underwhelming earnings. It\u2019s difficult for investors to anticipate news like this and is one of the reasons that some might want to avoid investing too heavily in any one company.\nSometimes it\u2019s not a single disappointing factor that leads to a company\u2019s downtrend. For instance, Oracle beat expected earnings and still saw their stock decline. Therefore, relying on stock weighing is not an exact science.\nOverweight Stock Rating Systems \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\nThere are several different weighting systems employed by different investment firms. Knowing what an overweight and underweight stock is means you have the basics down in deciphering other jargon. Terms will change depending on where you get your news from and what tools you use to analyze markets.\nA popular metric has been the 3-tier rating system where a firm will issue recommendations of sell, hold, or buy. Sell correlates to underweight and buy correlates to overweight stocks. Hold stocks would be those companies that aren\u2019t showing strong trends for over or underperformance.\nStocks that indicate no strong trend can be a good way to protect yourself from the volatility of the market. But investors should be sure they understand why a company or an asset class is stagnating to avoid value traps.\nOutside of the 3-tier system, there is also the 5-tier ranking system where stocks will be recommended on a sliding scale of 1 to 5. A rating of one represents the most underweight stocks and a 5 indicates the most overweight companies.\n\nA 5-point stock recommendation scale, showing where \u201coverweight\u201d appears in the spectrum.\nWhichever system you are using, the basics are the same. You are looking for companies with strong future performance to load up your portfolio. While at the same time not over-investing in any one area to avoid large losses.\nAdvantages and Limitations of Going Overweight on a Stock \u2696\ufe0f\nInvesting based on overweight and underweight ratings can be a good way to take more control of your investments. You should know the risks involved before you start moving your money around. You should also be working with information that you trust and understand why a company is rated the way it is.\nAdvantages of Overweight Stocks \u2705\nThe biggest advantage of using overweight stock predictions is that it can help you find better ways to balance your portfolio. This is essential for beating average gains and making more meaningful movements in your accounts.\nGoing overweight on particular assets can be a great way to hedge against other securities that you hold that are potentially very poor or stagnate. Weighting your portfolio with good stocks helps offset other investments that you may have overbought at one point. It helps you bolster poor performance with greater gains.\nOverweighting the portfolio lets you put money in the things you believe in without being excessively reckless. If you have a portfolio that is balanced with stocks, bonds, and other resilient assets like real estate, you are better insulated from potential inefficiencies and inflation. It also means that you are paying closer attention to your portfolio and managing your assets better\u2014this gives you the potential to readjust when you find inefficiencies.\nLimitations of Overweight Stocks \u26a0\ufe0f\nThe major limitation of going overweight on a stock is that you are taking more risk. When you lose on a bet, you lose harder. Investors looking to make bigger moves might make some more money but should have some tissues nearby to deal with the tears of the bad days. \ud83d\ude2d\nOverweight ratings are not infallible. It\u2019s not uncommon for once overweight stocks to slip into the underweight territory\u2014if there is a catastrophic event in the company, returns can stagnate or worse. Otherwise, the positions might slowly lose ground as a company misses earnings estimates, or if a company is in a cyclical sector.\nEither way, you have less of a chance to keep your funds safe than if you are balancing between broader indexes and bonds.\u00a0 If you are close to retirement, active management likely isn\u2019t for you. It may be best to keep your funds in your retirement account and not touch them. If you are younger, you likely have more time to make up for any excessive risk.\nHow Analysts Decide if a Stock is Overweight\u00a0\ud83d\udca1\nAnalysts rely on a plurality of factors to decide what stocks are overweight. First, you should know that there are generally two terms that people mean when they are referring to overweight stocks. The first is in reference to an individual\u2019s portfolio allocations.\nIf someone has a brokerage account and is invested in the S&P 500, but they have decided to put more money into certain sectors, they are overweight in those sectors.\u00a0\nFor example, if the S&P 500 has a total allocation of 10% of its capitalization in agricultural funds, but someone is confident in agriculture because of the increases in food prices and they decide to make their portfolio 20% agriculture, then that portfolio is overweight. It\u2019s a great idea to bet on the farmers when the inflation-proof avocados go flying off the shelf.\nThat all makes enough sense, what most people really care about is what analysts mean when they talk about overweight stocks. And the worst part about that is it\u2019s going to depend on the analysts looking at the stocks.\nNormally, when analysts are talking about stocks they are going to give a buy rating as we have discussed previously. These ratings are relative to the strength that the company is showing in relation to its sector and the overall market, and the ratings can be pretty subjective because they are speculative.\nGenerally, following one investment firm or analyst will give you a more consistent and logical rating of stocks. This is because the person rating that stocks will have a consistent rationale.\u00a0\nWeighing stocks can depend on many factors such as the potential for expansion, important technologies, market disruption, management, and even increasing wages. Looking at what many analysts have to say about a certain asset can give you a better idea about the consensus on a company.\u00a0\nUsing Indices as Benchmarks \u2714\ufe0f\nTo understand what analysts are talking about in a larger context, we have to know a little bit about indices. Indices are basically a group of stocks that investors use to categorize the market. The S&P 500 is one such index and it contains the 500 largest companies that are publicly traded in the US.\nOf course, different companies will compose a different percentage of this index because there are massive global corporations on their lists like Apple and Amazon. There are also companies worth only a fraction of these businesses such as Nordstrom or Gap.\nWhen an analyst is saying that a stock is overweight, they mean that they think the company should compose a higher percentage of the index or benchmark they are using. This is based on speculative observation.\nHow to Invest in Overweight Stocks \ud83d\udcc8\u00a0\nInvesting in overweight stocks can be as easy as reading the news, setting up an account with a top stockbroker, and throwing your life savings into one asset. That\u2019s probably also a really easy way to lose all your money.\nInvestors should know that stock ratings are just recommendations and they can come from people who don\u2019t need to disclose their open positions in these companies. Analysts and investment firms are fallible and they won\u2019t be on the hook for your potential losses. So before you make a purchase, do some stock research.\nAnother important factor to keep in mind is the reason that you are investing. Are you trying to save for a large purchase? Put money away for retirement? Fund your illicit weasel racing circuit?\u00a0\nWhatever the reason you\u2019re investing, you should know how long you can afford to keep your money in the market. Overweight stocks may only have a bright future for the next 8 months, while your horizon is 10 years. You would need to adjust as you go, and they may introduce tax liabilities and a greater potential for loss.\nThe best way to invest in overweight stocks is to consider all of the reasons you are investing, figuring out your investment plan and timeline, and balance your portfolio based on an index or a mutual fund with adequate allocations based on your risk.\u00a0\nAfter you have created a diverse portfolio, some traders recommend using a portion of your account for speculation. Maybe just 5-10% of the total funds in the account. You can adjust your speculation based on your risk tolerance\u2014it\u2019s better to start with smaller risks and adjust once you better understand how much it pains you to lose money on the market.\nFinal Note \ud83c\udfc1\nYou\u2019ve figured out how weighing stocks works. Good for you! Give yourself a pat on the back, or if that\u2019s not your thing, maybe just get to researching some stocks. It\u2019s good to know what the analysts are talking about as they blather on about the flavor of the day stock. Now that you know what they\u2019re saying you\u2019re better equipped to make good trades.\nIn the end, their recommendations are just speculation. If you decide to put your money on the line, you\u2019ll be on the hook for losses. But for the money you make, that might just be worth it.\n\nOverweight Stock: FAQs\n\n\nShould You Buy Overweight Stock?\nYou should do your own analysis before purchasing any asset. While it may be tempting to follow the herd and simply buy whatever asset everyone else is buying, you\u2019re going to be on the hook if trades go south. Buying an overweight stock is normally a good idea because they have good prospects in the short term. For long-term investors, it may be best just to keep your money in your mutual fund or ETF.\n\n\nHow Can I Tell if a Stock is Outperforming the Market?\nYou can tell if a stock is outperforming the market by measuring its recent performance against an average indicator like the S&P 500. If the growth of a stock is greater than the S&P 500, then it is outperforming that market.\n\n\nWhat is an \u201cOutperform\u201d Stock Rating?\nIn stocks, an outperform rating means that one asset will see more growth than similar assets. Sometimes this means that a stock is likely to outperform the entire market, and sometimes it\u2019s just outcompeting other similar companies\n\n\nWhat Does an Overweight Rating from JP Morgan Mean?\nWhen JP Morgan issues an overweight rating for a particular asset, that means that the analyst at that firm thinks the asset they\u2019ve chosen is likely to rise over a set period of time. Overweight ratings mean that investors should consider increasing the amount of an asset in their portfolio.\n\n\n\nGet Started Trading Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFees\n\n\n\nMinimum initial deposit\n\n\n\nTS Select: $2,000\nTS GO: $0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\nCommissions\n\n\n\n$0\n\n\nVary\n\n\n\nAccount minimum\n\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nBest for\n\n\n\nActive options and penny stock trading\n\n\nActive traders\n\n\n\nHighlight\n\n\n\nPowerful tools for professionals\n\n\nHuge discounts for high-volume trading\n\n\n\nPromotion\n\n\n\n50% Off Future\n\n\n \n\n\nRating\n\n\n\n8.0/10\nVisit TradeStation\non TradeStation's website\n\n\n8.0/10\nVisit Interactive Brokers\non Interactive Brokers' website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFees\n\n\n\nMinimum initial deposit\n\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\nCommissions\n\n\n\nVary\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\nAccount minimum\n\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nBest for\n\n\n\nActive traders\n\n\nBeginners and mutual fund investors\n\n\n\nHighlight\n\n\n\nHuge discounts for high-volume trading\n\n\nLow fees\n\n\n\nPromotion\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nRating\n\n\n\n8.0/10\nVisit Interactive Brokers\non Interactive Brokers' website\n\n\n9.5/10\nVisit Firstrade\non Firstrade's website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFees\n\n\n\n\nMinimum initial deposit\n\n\nTS Select: $2,000\nTS GO: $0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\n\nCommissions\n\n\n$0\n\n\nVary\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\n\nAccount minimum\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\nBest for\n\n\nActive options and penny stock trading\n\n\nActive traders\n\n\nBeginners and mutual fund investors\n\n\n\n\nHighlight\n\n\nPowerful tools for professionals\n\n\nHuge discounts for high-volume trading\n\n\nLow fees\n\n\n\n\nPromotion\n\n\n50% Off Future\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nRating\n\n8.0/10\nVisit TradeStation\non TradeStation's website\n\n\n8.0/10\nVisit Interactive Brokers\non Interactive Brokers' website\n\n\n9.5/10\nVisit Firstrade\non Firstrade's website\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll reviews, research, news and assessments of any kind on The Tokenist are compiled using a strict editorial review process by our editorial team.

(Photo by Deepak Gupta/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)  \u00b7 Hindustan Times via Getty Images The Kerala High Court recently pulled up the state government for its \u2018failure\u2019 to ensure COVID protocols were being followed at the Beverages Corporations\u2019 liquor shops. The High Court ordered the Government to ensure that Covid protocols are followed in the liquor outlets and that said that health was more important than revenue. It also asked the state to consider opening outlets at less crowded places and avoid main roads.  Ever since liquor outlets were reopened in the state, in June, the state has seen record sales and huge lines outside the outlets. A major reason for the overcrowding is that, till recently, liquor was sold only at state-run outlets. This was because post the second lockdown, Bevco had raised the profit share of liquor supplied to bars to 25 per cent from the previous 8 per cent. This had caused the closure of bars and wine parlours across the state. Kerala is not the only state in India that has seen serpentine lines after liquor outlets were reopened amidst the pandemic. Cities across the country have witnessed unruly crowds, with all social distancing rules being thrown to the wind, with the police having to step in to manage crowds. How India likes its tipple  India is among the top ten consumers of alcohol in the world, ranked at 7th place, consuming 663 million litres of alcohol. Out of this, the five southern states \u2013 Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Karnataka account for 45 per cent of all liquor sales in India. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 11 per cent of Indians are binge drinkers \u2013 the global average is 16 per cent. The average alcohol consumption in India is 5.7 litres per person above the age of 15. The country is also home to six crore alcohol addicts.  Around 21 states derive more than 15 per cent of their tax revenue from the sale of liquor. Further, despite bans in some states over the purchase of liquor under the age of 25, a study has revealed that more than 88 per cent of Indians under the age of 25 purchase or consume liquor. We take a look at the states with the most alcohol consumption in India: Assam: As per data from the Health and Family Welfare Statistics (HFWS), 59.4 per cent of men consume alcohol in Assam, in the age group of 15-54. This is much higher than the national average of 29.5 per cent. Assam has 713 country liquor shops and 2,512 IMFL (Indian Made Foreign Liquor) shops. Women in Assam consume the most amount of alcohol in India, with 44.8 per cent of women in the age group of 15-44 consuming alcohol at least once a week.   Story continues Chhattisgarh: Amidst the lockdown, Chhattisgarh became the second state after Kerala to open state-run liquor stores. The state did so keeping in mind the alcohol withdrawal symptoms citizens of the state were experiencing. The Chhatisgarh government also allowed home delivery of liquor during the lockdown to avoid overcrowding at liquor outlets and to curb illegal manufacturing, sale and transportation of liquor. The state received Rs 5,000 crore as total revenue collection from alcohol sales excise. More than 35 per cent of men in the state consume alcohol, while 13.7 per cent of women in the state consume alcohol.Telangana: As per the National Family Health Survey-5, 43.3 per cent of men above 15 years of age drink alcohol in Telangana. Rural men consume more alcohol (49 per cent) than urban men (33.9 per cent). Women (6.7 per cent), however, drink much less when compared to men. Tax from liquor in the state is 10 per cent of the revenue share.Sikkim: The state has a high percentage of women drinkers (19.1 per cent) in the 15-49 year group who consume alcohol in Sikkim about once a week. Further, in Sikkim, the percentage of women above the age of 15 consuming alcohol was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Sikkim also has a high percentage of male drinkers, with 39.8 per cent men consuming alcohol.Punjab: A study conducted in 2019 by AIIMS ranked Punjab first in alcohol consumption among children. As per the study, 1.2 lakh children in the age group of 10 and 17 consume alcohol. This is despite the fact that 25 is the legal drinking age in the country. The state\u2019s per capita annual consumption of liquor is 7.9 litres, the second-highest among the states.Karnataka: Karnataka is among the largest consumers of alcohol in the country \u2013 guzzling a whopping 12 per cent of national sales. The state also sources 11 per cent of its revenue from liquor tax. Karnataka, however, is among the states recording the lowest alcohol consumption in the 15-54 age group for women, at just 0.1 per cent.Tamil Nadu: At 15 per cent, Tamil Nadu, along with Kerala, tops the list when it comes to revenue percentage. In Tamil Nadu, the state controls liquor sales, with TASMAC (Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation), holding a monopoly over wholesale and retail vending of alcoholic beverages. The state is also among the largest guzzlers of alcohol in the country, consuming 13 per cent of national sales. The Madras High Court has appealed to the State Government to bring prohibition to the state in a phased manner, keeping in mind the offences committed against women and children under the influence of alcohol.Goa: The state, with its party image, has always been a haven for tipplers. Around 36.9 per cent of the state's men consume alcohol, surprisingly lower than Telangana. The Goa Government has, however, been cracking down on alcohol consumption in public places and has announced a ban on drinking alcohol on the state\u2019s beaches with a penalty of Rs 10,000 to those found violating it.Himachal Pradesh: As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2019-20, 30.4 per cent of men consume alcohol in urban areas, while in rural areas 32.1 per cent of men do so. The percentage among women is low - only 0.3 per cent women consume alcohol in urban areas while in rural areas, it is 0.7 per cent.Arunachal Pradesh: A large percentage of men in Arunachal Pradesh (59 per cent) consume alcohol, making it among the top alcohol consuming states in India. Among women, the figures are also high (33.6 per cent). The Government started levying a 25 per cent cess on liquor in May, last year, with the additional levy expected to garner Rs 70 crore to the exchequer per month.Bihar: Despite the fact that alcohol is officially banned in Bihar, the dry state sees high consumption among men (15.5 per cent of all men above the age of 15), as per NFHS 2019-20. This is higher than in Maharashtra, which does not have prohibition and where 13.9 per cent men consume alcohol. 15.8 per cent of men in rural areas consume alcohol in the state, while in rural areas, 14 per cent men consume alcohol. This percentage is much lower among women - only 0.4 per cent women consume alcohol in the state.Meanwhile, a recent study published in the journal The Lancet Oncology has linked more than 6.3 million cases of cancer in 2020 to alcohol consumption. Cancer of the mouth, larynx, breast, colon, rectum, liver, oesophagus, all have links to alcohol consumption.Don't miss: Explained: What is an IPO?

Technologies EmbeddedMarvell Fights Nvidia and Intel With Latest Octeon Family of DPUsJuly 2, 2021Marvell is pushing the envelope with its Octeon 10 DPU product line. The Octeon 10 is the first server processor in the category to take advantage of TSMC's 5-nm node and Arm's N2 CPU core, giving it a competitive edge in performance-per-watt.James MorraRelated To: Electronic Design      Marvell Technology is striking back against Nvidia, Intel, and other semiconductor giants in the data center market with the latest generation of its Octeon family of data processing units (DPUs) due out in late 2021.\u00a0On Monday the Santa Clara, California-based company said the Octeon 10 family of DPUs are systems on a chip based on the latest 5-nanometer node from TSMC and integrating Arm's Neoverse N2 core for the first time in a server-grade processor. The combination brings three times more performance than the previous generation of Octeon TX2 while burning up 50% less power and boosting the data throughput to 400 Gbps.The Arm CPUs are complemented by a cluster of accelerators and other building blocks in hardware that move, process, secure, store, and manage the deluge of data traveling through the sprawling networks of servers or cellular base stations. Marvell upgraded many of these to state-of-the-art accelerators, ranging from the machine learning engine to \"vector packet processing\" pipeline. It also improved the cryptograhy accelerator in the chip to run encrypt and decrypt data in real time (400+ Gbps) without CPU intervention.\u00a0\u201cTo meet and exceed the growing data processing requirements for network, storage, and security workloads, Marvell focused on significant DPU innovations across compute, hardware accelerators, and high-speed I/O,\u201d John Sakamoto, vice president of Marvell\u2019s infrastructure processors business unit, said in a statement. Marvell said the first Octeon DPU in the family will start shipping in the second half of 2021.The DPU has become a battleground in the data center segment in recent years. Nvidia has expanded its data center ambitions with its Bluefield family of DPUs that, like Marvell's Octeon DPUs, are used to offload networking, storage, security, and other infrastructure workloads from the CPU in the server and accelerate them, saving CPU capacity for other tasks. Nvidia plans to start supplying its future Bluefield-3 DPU in 2022.Intel is also wrestling to win market share in the category with what it calls infrastructure processing units (IPUs) which are based on FPGAs instead of the more general-purpose chips at the heart of the Octeon 10. Intel said IPUs have been developed with and deployed by Microsoft, Baidu, and other major cloud vendors. Marvell is also up against industry rivals Xilinx and Broadcom as well as startups Fungible and Pendsando.Marvell said Octeon has become\u00a0the most popular infrastructure processor in the world since it came to market a decade-and-a-half ago, with millions of chips deployed in data centers and 3G, 4G, and 5G RAN.But it is aggressively pushing the envelope with its Octeon 10 family of DPUs. The Octeon 10 is the first server processor in its class based on on TSMC's 5-nm node and also the first to feature Arm's N2 cores, giving it a competitive edge in performance-per-watt, thus reducing the cost of cooling and powering the chips. Marvell said Octeon 10 has a wide range of industry-first features for a DPU, such as its integrated machine learning engine. The chips also contain advanced IO interfaces, including PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5.Intel, Nvidia, and other vendors are trying to convince Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and other cloud services players to attach DPUs to the millions of servers in the colossal data centers they use themselves and rent out to millions of clients over the cloud. But unlike its rivals, Marvell said that it is looking to stand out with more scalable platforms. The Octeon DPUs are not only targeted at cloud data centers but also wireless and wired networking gear such as switches, routers, secure gateways, firewalls and 5G base stations.The Octeon 10 DPUs can also be attached to plug-and-play server networking cards also called SmartNICs. \"This is a platform that is scalable from the edge out to hyperscale cloud,\" Sakamoto told Electronic Design.Under the hood, the Octeon 10 DPUs have up to 36 N2 cores clocked at up to 2.5 GHz and arranged on the same slab of silicon. The N2 is the first in a family of central processing cores for the data center based on the Armv9 architecture. Designed on the Perseus microarchitecture, the Arm cores support up to 40% more instructions per clock compared to the N1 core crammed in Amazon's Graviton2 and Ampere's Altra CPUs.For years, Marvell used its architecture license with Arm to create the CPU cores at the heart of its Octeon family of server-grade processors from the ground up. But with the Octeon 10 generation, Marvell swapped its in-house TX2 core in favor of Arm's standard infrastructure cores, giving it the freedom to spend more of its engineering resources on the accelerators and other features instead of tangling itself up in CPU design.Octeon 10 delivers up to three times more single-threaded performance than its prior generation based on the TX2. \"If you compare Octeon 10 to other DPU families, this is clear compute leadership,\" Sakamoto said.The 64-bit cores are provisioned with 64 kB of L1 instruction cache plus 64 kB of L1 data cache. Marvell also enlarged the L2 cache to 1 MB per core to reduce latency for a wide range of workloads. The cores (which have 32-bit hardware as well) can also access 2 MB of L3 cache each, totaling up to 36 MB of L2 and 72 MB of L3 cache in the flagship Octeon 10 DPU. According to Marvell, it also attached advanced hardware scheduling to the cores, reducing latency from the CPU to the accelerators by a factor of three.Because it is based on the Armv9-A architecture, the CPU also integrates 128-bit wide processing pipelines that take advantage of Arm's SVE2 instruction set. The SVE2 technology is a new series of instructions that improve the data processing and machine learning capabilities of Arm CPUs. That potentially gives Marvell an extra edge over Nvidia's newest Bluefield-3 DPU, which builds on\u00a0Armv8.2-based Cortex-A78 CPU cores.The chips also incorporate up to eight PCIe Gen 5 lanes, up to 16 50G Ethernet ports, and up to 56G SerDes lanes, upgrading from PCIe Gen 4 and DDR4 DRAM lanes in its previous generation Octeon TX2 processors.Surrounding the Arm CPU cores are a group of state-of-the-art accelerators and other hardware modules, including its in-house machine learning engine. According to Marvell, the module is based on a mosaic of inferencing tiles that incorporate SRAM and MACs that can run Int8 and FP16 operations. The inferencing tiles are linked to each other with a crossbar interconnect, which also attaches to shared system memory.The machine learning engine in the Octeon 10 DPUs can be used by software to identify potential intruders traveling along the sprawling networks of servers in the cloud or corporate data centers. The AI capabilities can also be used in\u00a04G and 5G base stations to improve beamforming technology that shoot out signals at\u00a0smartphones and other devices directly instead of broadcasting over a wide area sort of like a floodlight.Marvell said that it integrated the machine learning engine \"directly in the data pipeline\" to reduce latency in the system to the levels required by 5G networks and high-throughput workloads in cloud data centers. The company said the tile-based architecture means that it can scale up or down depending on the end market. More tiles equal faster performance for AI chores. The machine learning engine can scale up to more than 100 trillion operations per second (TOPS) at a cost of it occupying more die area and draining more power.\u00a0Marvell said that it upgraded the packet\u00a0processing pipeline in the Octeon 10 DPUs to process more than one packet at a time, reducing system latency and improving data throughput. Marvell said that the \"vector packet processing\" engine can intercept data traveling through the network, group the packets together in a set, and process the complete set as a vector in hardware instead of processing all the packets one by one.According to Marvell, the improved pipeline is able to boost packet processing throughput at the system level by a factor of five compared to the scalar processing engines in its previous Octeon TX2 generation.\u00a0Another area of improvement is the integrated 1 terabit-per-second switch. The chips incorporate a set of 16 50 gigabit-per-second Ethernet ports that are configurable from 1G up to 100G Ethernet. By integrating the switch on the same silicon chip as the hardware accelerators and other computing modules, Marvell said its Octeon 10 DPUs cut\u00a0system costs by reducing the amount of hardware used in 5G base stations and edge networking switches. Other advanced features in the switch include\u00a0256-bit MACsec and TSN.For storage workloads, the chips natively support up to 20 million IO operations per second (IOPS) over NVM Express (NVMe).\u201cA significant amount of compute is required to process the deluge of data generated from cloud to edge devices today,\u201d said Chris Bergey, senior vice president and general manager of the infrastructure business at Arm, in a statement. \u201cThe combination of leading-edge 5-nm technology, Neoverse N2 cores, and Octeon 10 will enable Marvell to take on complex workloads, and showcase its strengths in DPU computing.\u201dMarvell said that it would also roll out development tools to make it easier for customers to deploy software on the Octeon DPUs, which can take advantage of the Arm ecosystem because they are based on the same instruction set. The tools include\u00a0software stacks for\u00a0networking, storage, and security\u00a0as well as support for virtual machines and containers. The chips can also support a wide range of open and standard APIs.\"Our objective on the software side is to make it very easy for users to run and accelerate applications on the Octeon 10,\" Sakamoto added.\u00a0\u201cOur strategy is to have an open platform. Other companies have taken this approach where they want to create a closed ecosystem by offering their own proprietary toolkits and then trying to secure some vendor lock-in. We're trying to keep things open and support open frameworks.\"Marvell plans to roll out a software development platform for the Octeon 10 DPU family by the end of 2021.Marvell plans to roll out a wide range of different SKUs, ranging from the\u00a0CN103xx\u2014ideal for wireless and wired networking gear in a wide range of energy-efficient, or even fanless, form factors\u2014to\u00a0the DPU400\u2014targeted at network infrastructure in cloud data centers. The flagship processor in the family fits in a 60W envelope,\u00a0which is up to 50% more power efficient than its 80W to 120W predecesor, the CN98xx.Marvell has also shipped millions of Octeon DPUs in 3G and 4G base stations globally\u00a0and Tier-1 telecom infrastructure OEMs such as Nokia and Samsung Electronics have already selected Octeon DPUs for new 5G base stations.\u00a0Marvell also rolled out CN106XX with\u00a0up to 24 N2 CPU cores\u00a0to run 4G and 5G base stations as well as corporate and wireless carrier data centers, while consuming around 40W to 50W.Marvell said the first processor in the family\u2014the CN106xx\u2014is now in production at TSMC and should be available to early customers by the fourth quarter. Marvell plans to start shipping the other SKUs in 2022.\u00a0 About the Author James Morra | Senior EditorJames Morra is a senior editor for Electronic Design, covering the semiconductor industry and new technology trends, with a focus on power electronics and power management.

What currently sets NVIDIA apart in the market is the breadth of its hardware and software ecosystem.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys In Ecosystem\nAs with major CUDA releases, TensorRT is one of the foundational technologies that is driving the adoption of AI in new market segments.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 and RecSys Announcements\nTensorRT is a SDK for high-performance inference using NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. While NVIDIA has a major lead in the data center training market for large models, TensorRT is designed to allow models to be implemented at the edge and in devices where the trained model can be put to practical use. Some examples for TensorRT are conversational AI, natural language processing, and computer vision.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys Inference Is Complex\nWhen NVIDIA discusses its edge inference platforms for automotive, robotics, data center, manufacturing, and elsewhere, a key part of this is TensorRT being used across everything from Jetson SOMs to NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys NVIDIA TensorRT Overview\nTensorRT 8 brings the next level of optimizations including features such as sparsity support and INT8 accuracy on Ampere generation GPUs. NVIDIA makes new versions of its software available that include new optimizations and thus higher performance and potentially higher accuracy. Optimizations for inference can also mean fitting models into smaller memory footprints which is extremely important for edge inference.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys TensorRT 8\nThere is an item on this slide that we are a bit sad to see. Quantization Aware Training or (QAT) is not the same QAT as Intel uses it. QuickAssist Technology has been around for ages and is largely a set of accelerators that NVIDIA\u2019s new Mellanox-powered gear can accelerate. See Intel QuickAssist Technology and OpenSSL Benchmarks and Setup Tips and\u00a0Intel QuickAssist at 40GbE Speeds: IPsec VPN Testing. We first saw Intel market QAT in the data center space with the Atom C2000 series\u00a0in 2013\u2019s Rangely line and it now runs at 100Gbps. It is unfortunate we have two silicon providers in the data center using the same acronym for two functions that can be running at the same time in a server.\nGetting back to TensorRT 8, we get better performance as we would expect. NVIDIA can move both hardware and software advancements over time which makes for very large gains chronologically in the CUDA ecosystem.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys BERT Inference\nThe other side of the announcement is around recommender systems. Recommender systems we see all around us which makes them a huge driver for investment.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys Recommender Systems\nNVIDIA announced a number of wins in the recommender systems space over the past few months and is showing it is focused on driving performance in this space with Merlin.\nNVIDIA TensorRT 8 And RecSys Democratizing Recommender Systems\nFinal Words\nFor most of our readers, TensorRT 8 is going to be the more impactful of the two announcements. While we often cover the hardware, we should note that one of the big reasons NVIDIA has maintained its edge in the AI space is because it has shown years of generational improvements both in the hardware and in the software space. That hardware also expands to new power and performance envelops to expand the reach of the ecosystem making it important as well.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSNVIDIATensorRT \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleTP-Link 5-Port Gigabit PoE Switch Review TL-SG1005PNext articleMicrochip Adaptec 24G SAS Tri-Mode RAID and HBA Launch Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

These days, however, HDB flats have taken on a much broader definition. The phenomenon of \u201cmillion dollar HDB flats\u201d has garnered attention in recent years. Usually located in prime areas, these HDB flats enjoy such a dramatic appreciation in value after their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) is over that their owners are often able to sell them at a huge profit.  For instance, a five-room unit at The Pinnacle @ Duxton, located a short walking distance from the Central Business District (CBD), was sold for a record-breaking $1.258 million in September 2020. Unsurprisingly, there are concerns that public housing in prime areas is becoming accessible only to affluent households, and that lower income groups will get pushed to farther-flung suburbs. Some lament that the wealth gap is widening due to disproportionate capital appreciation of HDB flats in prime areas. Here is a short video of Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development of Singapore, speaking on the issue:  A public survey was conducted from 28 May to 30 June 2021 to gain some insight into public views on a possible new housing model for BTO flats in prime areas. 11 possible policies were outlined based on these suggestions, aiming to improve affordability, minimise cases of large resale profits and ensure a balanced mix of Singaporeans from different socio-economic backgrounds in prime locations. In case you missed it, here are the 11 policies the Government sought feedback on.  To Improve AffordabilityPossible policies: Longer Minimum Occupation Period, additional subsidies for lower-income buyers, build more small (and thus more affordable) flats, offer flats with shorter leases To Minimize Large ProfitsPossible policies: Mandate that all resale profits to be paid into CPF SA, only allow these flats to be sold back to the Government at a fair price, a clawback on subsidies, capital gains tax To Ensure a Balanced Mix of Singaporeans in Prime AreasPossible policies: Disallow renting out of whole flat, impose BTO eligibility conditions on resale buyers, remove the Married Child Priority Scheme  To Improve Affordability of Prime-District HDB Flats As the prices of HDB flats in prime locations creep upwards, more and more households are getting priced out of the market and forced to settle for homes in less central locations. This can give rise to wealthy enclaves in more sought-after areas, which goes against the HDB\u2019s goals of inclusivity.   Story continues 1. Implement Longer MOPsThe MOP is currently five years. HDB flat purchasers must live in their flat for the full MOP before being able to sell or rent out the entire unit.One suggestion has been to impose a longer MOP on flats in prime areas. This would discourage buyers from treating the flats as an investment rather than a home.However, on the downside, a longer MOP might make it difficult for owners who genuinely need to move, for instance due to a growing family.Related article: Upgrading After Minimum Occupation Period (MOP): 8 Confusing Questions Answered2. Additional Subsidies to Help More Afford Prime HDBsSome respondents have suggested offering additional subsidies when purchasing HDB flats in prime areas, thereby making them more accessible to people of a wider range of income levels. The subsidies could then be recovered upon resale of the flat.Related article: HDB\u2019s New Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) and Higher Income Ceilings: What You Need to Know3. Build Smaller FlatsBuilding smaller flats in prime areas or dedicating a larger proportion of units to smaller flat types could lower the average per-unit price and make the flats more affordable for buyers.However, that would have the effect of attracting smaller households, singles and retirees to prime areas and discouraging larger families.Related article: Just How Much Smaller Are New Condos and HDB Flats Getting? 4. Offer Flats with Shorter LeasesNew HDB flats usually come with 99-year leases. Some respondents have suggested shortening the leases of new flats in prime areas, which would make them more affordable.However, this raises the question of whether the leases will be sufficient to meet the needs of subsequent buyers, who might outlive their flats.Just How Much Smaller Are New Condos and HDB Flats Getting?Related article: 5 Ways The Government Can \"Save\" Ageing HDB Flats in SingaporeTo Minimise Cases of Large Resale ProfitsPrime flats are often resold by owners at astronomical prices, netting them huge profits and giving rise to a phenomenon known as the \u201clottery effect\u201d.5. Resale Proceeds to be Paid into CPF Special Account (CPF SA)In order to combat the issue of buyers treating their flats as investments, it has been suggested that a portion of resale proceeds be compulsorily paid into the CPF Special Account, rather than pocketed in cash by the seller.This would combat the \u201clottery effect\u201d experienced by buyers of flats in prime locations and discourage people from flipping their property. However, it would be difficult to determine what would be a fair amount to be paid into the CPF Special Account.Related article: How to Balance the Use of CPF for Property and Save Up for Retirement6. Government BuybackInstead of letting owners sell their prime flats on the open market, it has been suggested that they only be allowed to sell them back to the HDB, which can then resell them to the public at an affordable price.However, it would be difficult to determine what a fair buyback price would be, as well as to justify why only prime HDB flats would have their selling prices capped. Imposing a set buyback price might also be seen as guaranteeing the value of the flats and perceived as unfair by the rest of the population in a market downturn.Related article: Is The Lease Buyback Scheme Worth It?7. Recovery of Additional Subsidies ProvidedOffering additional subsidies to buyers of prime flats can make them more affordable, but for the sake of fairness, it has been suggested that such subsidies be clawed back by the government when the flat is sold in order to ensure fairness, as the first owners of such flats would benefit disproportionately from subsidies compared to later buyers.For instance, the government might mandate that additional subsidies be repaid upon sale of the flat. This way, the subsidies will benefit the first owners who do not intend to sell the property, and 'penalize' those who want to sell or 'flip' the property.Related article: CPF Housing Grant Eligibility in Singapore: How Much BTO, Resale Flat and EC Buyers Can Get8. Implement Capital Gains TaxSingapore has no capital gains tax, which means that people can profit unbridledly from any gains in value when they sell their property.Imposing a capital gains tax would attenuate the \u201clottery effect\u201d of flats in prime areas by limiting the profits earned by sellers and discouraging them from flipping their property.Related article: Singapore Property Tax Guide: What Are The Rates And How to Calculate ThemTo Ensure A Balanced Mix of Singaporeans in Prime LocationsOne of the aims of the HDB is to enable a diverse mix of Singaporeans of different income levels to live together. As flats in prime locations get snapped up by affluent households, this diversity is being eroded.9. Disallow Renting Out of Whole FlatAffluent households are more likely to upgrade to private property and then rent out their HDB flat for passive income. Disallowing renting out of the entire flat, even after expiry of the MOP, would discourage people from purchasing a flat just for rental income. However, short of requiring the owner to live in the flat, it would be difficult to enforce this rule.Related article: Rental Income Tax Guide in Singapore (Including 5 Tax Deduction Examples)10. Limit Resale Buyers Only to Those Who Meet the BTO Eligibility ConditionsIn order to depress resale prices of flats in prime locations, one suggestion has been to limit the pool of resale buyers to those who meet Build-to-Order (BTO) flat eligibility conditions, which have a lower income ceiling. This would, however, be detrimental to buyers who have exceeded the BTO income ceiling but still qualify for a resale flat.Related article: BTO Eligibility, Resale Criteria and the Available Schemes11. Remove the Married Child Priority SchemeThe Married Child Priority Scheme offers subsidies to married people who wish to purchase a flat near their parents\u2019 homes. This means that those whose affluent parents can afford to live in prime areas often find it easier to continue living in the area. Getting rid of the scheme would put flat buyers on equal footing.Related article: Married Child Priority Scheme & Multi-Generation Priority Scheme: What You Should Know if You Want To Increase Your BTO Ballot ChancesStay Tune for UpdatesThe public survey has closed and the Government is reviewing the feedback. So far, no new policies or updates have been announced.That said, the Government did release some information on their findings. According to a TODAY report, the Government collected feedback from over 6,500 members of the public. Many respondents support the idea of additional subsides, as well as a 'clawback' clause mandating that some of the subsidies previously enjoyed must be paid back upon sales of the flat.The conversation on prime HDB flats dates back to 2015, with talks intensifying in 2019 when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that they will be building HDB flats where Keppel Club is.More FAQs on Prime HDB FlatsWhere Are Some Prime Areas For HDB Flats?Prime areas tend to be near the CBD and city centre.

Sure, it's fast and can sometimes even beat Nvidia's top-shelf RTX 3090. Overall, however, the RX 6900 XT fails to impress relative to the RX 6800 XT. It's such an incremental bump in performance that it hardly seems worth the trouble. That's assuming that there are enough cards to meet the demand, which of course there aren't.By the numbers, the RX 6900 XT is only 4 to 7 percent faster than the RX 6800 XT, but it officially costs over 50 percent more. Okay, sure, you can't find the 6800 XT in stock for $649 right now, but at some point (hopefully before RDNA3 arrives), that will no longer be the case. If you want the best high-end AMD graphics card, our pick still goes to the RX 6800 XT. But if you're open to other options, AMD has a tougher time of things.Toss out ray tracing performance, and the RX 6900 XT looks very competitive, chalking up several wins against the RTX 3090. But if you're willing to spend over a grand on a new graphics card for gaming purposes, we simply can't overlook the ray tracing performance, not to mention the large number of games with DLSS support. Yes, FidelityFX Super Resolution is now here, and it works with every GPU, but it doesn't look quite as good as DLSS 2.0 and it's not in nearly as many games, particularly games that really need it. However, even without DLSS, the RTX 3080 already leads the 6900 XT by an average of 25 percent at 1440p in ray tracing games.It's also interesting to note that, for all the complaints about the lack of RTX 30-series GPUs, all of the Nvidia cards (except the most recent RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti) actually show up in the Steam Hardware Survey. We still don't know what sort of fuzzy statistics Steam might be using, as Valve has never been particularly transparent about the data behind the HW survey. If it's not fully random and instead sent out queries to anyone with a new 'unknown' GPU during the past month or two, that could explain things. Still, not a single RX 6000-series GPU shows up, while the RTX 3070 has basically caught up to the RX 580 (AMD's highest ranked GPU on the list).As a professional card, the RX 6900 XT again has some potential. There are certain applications where AMD is more generous than Nvidia when it comes to optimized drivers. If you happen to use one of those apps, this could be the best overall value, but again the 6800 XT has the exact same features and specs, only with a few fewer shader cores.That's the real difficulty with the top of the pecking order. You often get radically diminishing returns going from the second- or third-tier GPU to the fastest card. The RTX 3090 has the same problem, and we don't recommend it as a general gaming solution for the same reasons. But really, anyone wanting a new GPU is likely going to be waiting for prices to come down, whatever their GPU of choice. When even the RTX 3060 and RX 6700 XT sell for over $700, it's best to hang on to whatever you already have.AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT (16GB) at Amazon for $988MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU BenchmarksMORE:\u00a0All Graphics ContentAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT: Price Comparison6 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $988View $999.99View $1,295.95ViewLow StockWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nNvidia Radeon RX 6900 XT: Fast but Expensive\n\n\n\nPrev Page Radeon RX 6900 XT: Power, Temperatures, and Fan Speeds\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nRadeon RX 6800\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\nIntel Core\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nGeForce RTX 3070\nrtx\nray tracing\nRadeon\nRadeon RX \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (7)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

Secondly, if you don't like their articles then go read another publisher's. Don't complain about it in the comments.\n\nPersonally I like the formatting where it's divided into different pages, makes finding benchmarks easier.\n\nNow here's my thoughts on the 6900XT: absolute joke, just like the 3080Ti and 3090.\nIf literally all you care about is gaming the 3080 and 6800XT are excellent cards (at normal pricing), and like the article pointed out, there's literally nothing different between the 6800XT and 6900XT except the cores. Memory and everything else is the same. Might save 50% price for 10% performance.\n\nAt least with 3090 you get 24GB of VRAM so content creators will love that. Plus it's faster than the 6900XT so people looking for the \"absolute best\" will go for the 3090 instead of AMD.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU\n\n\nJarredWaltonGPU said:Yeah.

The text and content hasn't been changed, but I guess it posts with the new date.I actually went through and reread the old review, then updated sections that were no longer correct and/or relevant. So, for example, FSR is now out, the RTX 3080 Ti is also here, prices are still fubar. But the review as it stands now should be generally correct in light of the current market situation.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamikazekerr\n\n\nPersonally Nividia is hitting it's marks there simple but effective I've had a 3090,80,70oc,3060ti and a 3060 junk and Personally I only play warzone prior to the dlss for cards like the 3070 even on custom cooling it struggled badly even turning it right up.with custom cooling, the 3080 vram took a big hit and aswell my personal favorite 3090 vram gauge looked like you threw 5 bucks in a Lincoln continental. LOL......Fast forward a few months I get an ASUS LC 6900XT it ran fine but warzone cranked up his hard on any card while the 6900 remained cool with all the buttons and dials and lack of software I found the card did not perform to my liking and sold it and jumped back into a rog 3070...but then I go and buy a refence amd 6900xt because of the look and ekwb water block. Getter plugged in and bam 100 degrees at the junction while I wait for my water block I've got 3 arctic fans force feedijg this thing air and still to high 80's and 90s which I do not like not to mention artifacting outta the box using only amd oc settings...so I pull it apart today no thermal anything under backplate..add my own from ekwb....then scrape the pad off the cooler side of the chip then watch the stock thermal pads almost Disintegrate under there own weight... replace them and repaste went from\n92 temp and 95 plus junction temp down to 75 to 82 ish temp and still a steady junction temp about 92 when working but still force feeding it air all around disappointment and the artifacting concerns me it's hit or miss now hopefully it comes around with the water. BUT all in all I would not recommend anything amd gpu related at this time...I hope to change that in the future but as of right now I'd take my Rog 3070 onwater over this 6900xt in performance for my needs and user friendly software and settings\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 7 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeydous NJ98-CP V2 HE Review: Dedicated calculators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicron 4600 2TB SSD Review: The New Baseline in SSDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex Review: A very close second\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock PG-1600G Phantom Gaming power supply review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID-Cooling FX 360 INF Pink Review: Stylishly pink, but loud in more ways than one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWD Black SN7100 SSD Review: The power efficiency king, with caveats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review: Stunning gaming performance meets top-tier productivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025) review: Blue skies ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Mac Studio (Early 2025) Review: Renewed vigor with M4 Max and M3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Roles & responsibilities of members of the empire      Chaitra Anand     15 July 2021 7 min read          Being born into the richest family in India is not just a matter of fate, but also a matter of responsibility. The Ambani family is generally known to be glamorous but shot into the spotlight even more after the grand weddings within the family, which was attended by the who's who of the world. While these were family occasions to celebrate with pomp and show, in reality, each member of the Ambani family is entrusted with huge responsibilities as they shoulder the growth of one of the biggest conglomerates in the country.   Ambanis   Dhirubhai Ambani died in 2002 without leaving a clear succession plan. After the bickering between brothers Anil and Mukesh, their mother Kokilaben mediated and split the family-owned businesses between the two brothers. Mukesh could take over the oil and chemical portion of the company and Anil could take over the electricity and telecom arm of the industries set up by their father.  This 'sibling rivalry', a lesson for all of posterity, is probably the main reason why roles and responsibilities of each member of the Ambani clan is clearly charted out in the current scheme of things. Surely the second generation of Ambani's have it all better planned for the future. Here's a look at what responsibilities the Ambani kids handle, we're talking about the offsprings of both Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, even though one brother may be more successful than the other in the current scenario; we never know when the tide turns. Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani are proud parents to three children\u2014 Isha Ambani, Akash Ambani, Anant Ambani.   India's richest man and oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani (R) and his wife Nita Ambani (2R) pose with their children (L-C) Akash Ambani, Anant Ambani and Isha Ambani as they arrive for the company's 40th AGM in Mumbai on July 21, 2017. Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries' first-quarter consolidated profit jumped 28 percent July 20, pumped up by higher margins from its core oil refining business, the group said, beating analyst estimates. / AFP PHOTO / INDRANIL MUKHERJEE (Photo credit should read INDRANIL MUKHERJEE/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 AFP Contributor via Getty Images Mukesh and Nita Ambani's children Isha Ambani Born on 23rd October, 1991, Isha Ambani is the elder twin, hence the first born of Mukesh and Nita Ambani. Isha completed her Masters in Business Administration from the Graduate School of Business in Stanford University and also holds a bachelor's degree in psychology and South Asian studies from Yale University. Isha joined the family's telecom and retail businesses \u2014 Jio and Reliance Retail \u2014 as director in 2014. She holds two board and advisory roles as Additional Director at Reliance Foundation and Director at Reliance Jio.  Her role in the conglomerate has expanded in the last two years as she was one of the lead negotiators with Facebook in its bid to acquire 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms. She and her twin Akash played a crucial role in the negotiation. It was Isha's statement that was released by RIL when Reliance Retail Ventures acquired the retail, logistics and warehousing businesses of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore.   Story continues She also spearheads the popular fashion portal Ajio and looks after the e-commerce venture JioMart as well. Most recently she set up the Reliance Arts Foundation.She is married to Anand Piramal, executive director of the Piramal group.Akash AmbaniThe elder son of Mukesh Ambani, Isha's twin, Akash Ambani is the Director and Head of Strategy and a member of the Executive Committee at Reliance Jio.After completing his IB Diploma Programme from Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS), Akash studied economics at the prestigious Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Apart from the Executive Committee, Akash is part of the governing and operating body of Reliance Jio as well.Akash and Isha were appointed to the board of directors soon after graduating college, and Akash already had some experience working for the telecom arm of Reliance in Mumbai. He was equally responsible for introducing the Jio 2 mobile phone along with Isha.Akash's main responsibilities include product development, messaging and chat development, and other digital services applications of Reliance Jio. Being a huge sports fan, he also handles the functioning of their cricket team in the Indian Premier League (IPL) team, the Mumbai Indians. He is also involved in the football counterpart of IPL, known as Indian Super League (ISL).He is married to Shloka Mehta, the daughter of diamantaires Russell and Mona Mehta. Her parents own one of the world's largest jewellery companies.Anant AmbaniBorn on April 10, 1995, the youngest son of Mukesh and Nita, Anant, is currently an Additional Director on the board of Jio Platforms. Being the youngest, his introduction into mainstream business has been more gradual as he takes on more key roles. He is being groomed to handle social roles of Reliance Industries. Like his brother Akash, Anant studied at Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai and then went on to do his graduation from Brown University in Rhode Island.Among the three children, he has spent the most time at the company\u2019s Jamnagar campus and has been involved in social activities with his mother.As a child, Anant Ambani struggled with chronic asthma and due to the medication gained huge amounts of weight. He was later lauded for losing weight through a healthy lifestyle and strict diet in just 18 months. Ananth is known to be an avid animal lover and has many pets in his Antilia residence in Mumbai. In his speech at the 40th anniversary of Reliance\u2019s listing, Anant stated that \"serving the Reliance family is the most important mission of his life\".Anil and Tina Ambani are proud parents to two sons being groomed to handle the future of the Reliance Group  Indian businessman Anil Ambani (2nd R) poses for photographs along with his wife and former Bollywood actress Tina Ambani (2nd L) and their sons, Anshul Ambani (R) and Anmol Ambani (L), as they arrive to attend the wedding ceremony of Akash Ambani, son of Indian Businessman Mukesh Ambani, in Mumbai on March 9, 2019.

The update was delivered as part of the Red Dead Redemption Online: Blood Money expansion, which was released on Tuesday. This update included code to apply DLSS to both the online and main games.\n\nThe headlining DLSS benefit delivered alongside Blood Money is the possibility of boosting your RDR2/Online 4K gaming frame rate by as much as 45 per cent. This uplift comes to those playing the game in DLSS 'Performance Mode', and you can see an example performance-uplift chart as published by Nvidia embedded below.\n\nPlaying the RDR2 games on Nvidia's test system, average frame rates of 60fps+ were enjoyed by all Ampere cards from RTX 3070 and better. The previous gen RTX 2080 Ti was also lifted past 60fps in these games using DLSS Performance mode.\n\nIf you play these games at 1440p, Nvidia says that DLSS can bring up your average frame rates to >60fps, as long as you own an RTX 3060 Ti or better. Meanwhile, at 1080p, \"all GeForce RTX gamers can experience Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s incredible world with max settings at over 60fps\".\n\nIn other related news, Nvidia told HEXUS that Unity 2021.2 is out in beta with Nvidia DLSS support. One of the key new features in Unity is native DLSS support in Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) \u2013 this will make it much easier for devs to make their wares DLSS ready.\nLastly, Nvidia would like to remind folk that DLSS is supported in nearly 60 games, including top titles like Call of Duty, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, DOOM Eternal, Rainbow Six Siege \u2013 as well as engines like Unreal Engine 4, 5 and Unity. Nvidia maintains an RTX enhanced applications list, so you can see the current state of support for features like Ray Tracing and DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nMicrosoft imagines Xbox 2042 with 1 exaFLOP processor\n\n                    Meanwhile, EA/DICE have revealed three big new maps for Battlefield 2042. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\n\n                    And Nvidia's GeForce Now service becomes Xbox friendly (via updated Microsoft Edge). \n                \n\n\n\nRockstar outlines Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy PC specs\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 6 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was higher than the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s target range of 2% to 6% for the first time since November last year. The increase in May was largely on account of higher fuel and food prices. Petrol, diesel prices in India have been rising over the past two months crossing Rs 100 per litre level in many cities.  The RBI has estimated an average inflation rate of 5.1% per cent for the current financial year. The RBI has been mandated by the government to maintain the crucial number at 4% in the medium term, with a 2% leeway on either side as part of its inflation target. As per Investopedia, \u2018Inflation is the rise in the price of goods and services in an economy over a certain period\u2019. The standard measurement of inflation is the (CPI). Components of the CPI include a \u2018basket\u2019 of certain elementary goods and services, such as food, energy, clothing, medical care, education, communication and recreation. The different components have been assigned weights (importance) in the index in line with the average consumption basket of an individual. The weights differ for rural and urban India because of differences in consumption pattern. Food and beverages have the highest weight of 46%, followed by housing (10%), transport and communication (9%), fuel and light (7%) and clothing and footwear (7%). This is represented in Table 1 below: Table 1: Inflation Basket of India (figures in %)    Let\u2019s say in a month, food and beverages prices increase by 5% in urban India. This will contribute 1.8% (36.3% weight multiplied by 5%) to increase in inflation for the month. Similarly, if prices of housing increase by 10%, recreation and amusement decline by 10% and so on, the CPI inflation for the month would be 6.6%. Table 2: Calculation of inflation    This also means that the purchasing power of individuals in urban India would have declined by 6.6% in the month. Unless income increases by a similar or higher amount, an individual would have to reduce his consumption of one of the items listed above. Different states have different rates of inflation in different years. It means that the inflation you experience also depends on which part of the country you are in and the inflationary pressures it is experiencing during a particular year. Of course, within a state, whether you are in an urban area, or a rural one, also makes a difference. In 2019-20, among large states, Kerala had the highest rate of inflation at 6.1%. Bihar had the lowest at 2.2%. Assam had the second highest rate of inflation, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu at number five in the list.   Story continues Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, along with Bihar feature in the top 5 states with lowest level of inflation.Chart 3: Inflation across states in India (Source & Credit www.vivekkaul.com)  Inflation or price rise as it is normally called has been one of the Top 5 issues across state and central elections over the years.  The Sushma Swaraj-led BJP government is believed to have lost in Delhi due to soaring onion prices. In the recent state elections, Trinamool Congress raised the issue of rise in fuel prices forcefully in West Bengal.Does inflation impact electoral results? The results of the 2021 state elections show a surprising trend. The incumbent governments of Kerala and Assam which have reported the highest inflation in India were re-elected.So was the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar which recorded the lowest price rise amongst states in India. So, states with good as well as bad inflation records were re-elected.This means there are other factors in play as well in determining electoral results in India. Inflation, which is listed among top 5 issues across polls, does not play a big role though it impacts adversely the purse of every citizen.DON\u2019T MISS:How Modi checkmated the Opposition with his vaccination masterstroke Vaccination: Why India has more faith in PM Modi Modi 2.0 report card: Great progress despite the pandemic Is the Congress party sparking vaccine hesitancy in India?

The 1.0 TSI AT Ambition is proving to be the most popular variant with garnering around 40 percent of total 1.0 TSI orders. Keen pricing and good value is drawing customers to the 1.0 TSI according to dealers who are quite happy with the response.  The \u2018Carbon-Steel\u2019 colour is the most preferred by buyers, followed by white and orange. According to some dealers, all versions have received adequate interest, including the 1.5 TSI, whose test drives are yet to begin. As reported by us earlier, deliveries for the Kushaq 1.5 TSI will start a little later. Most dealers say that around 25 percent of orders are for the larger engine and they expect this share to increase once test drives begin. Skoda dealers are also giving customers a system generated ETA as soon as the booking is confirmed, with deliveries set to begin by the middle of this month. How the Skoda ETA system works Once the customer selects his powertrain, variant and colour by either visiting the dealer or the Skoda website, an estimated delivery date for the next available unit in that configuration is reflected on the system and conveyed to the customer The estimate delivery date is derived from various stages, including stocks with dealers, vehicles in transit, the current order backlog and production plans that span the following 12 weeks. Skoda Kushaq: pricing and competition check Prices for the Kushaq start at Rs 10.49 lakh for the entry-level 1.0 TSI Active variant. The Kushaq 1.5 TSI is priced from Rs 16.19 lakh for the Style variant and the top-spec automatic costs Rs 17.59 lakh (ex-showroom). Key rivals for the Kushaq include the upcoming Volkswagen Taigun, the Kia Seltos and the Hyundai Creta.

As for the highlights, the car's design and features will be similar to its fuel-guzzling counterpart. However, it will be fueled by an electric powertrain and should offer a driving range of around 500km. Here are more details.  Exteriors: The car will have squared windows and round headlights  The Mercedes-Benz EQG will have a flat bonnet, a large grille with the brand's logo, a wide air dam, and round LED headlights. It will be flanked by squared windows, ORVMs, flared wheel arches, and designer wheels. Narrow taillights and a tailgate-mounted spare wheel will be offered on the rear end of the vehicle. Dimensions-wise, it should have a wheelbase of 2,850mm.  Fact: Two variants are likely to be available  Mercedes-Benz EQG might be offered in two trims: 560 and 580 4MATIC. The latter will reportedly pack a 108kWh battery linked to two electric motors and an all-wheel-drive system. The setup will generate around 486hp of power and provide a driving range of about 500km.  Interiors: The vehicle should offer five seats and a touchscreen console  Similar to the G-Class, the EQG is expected to have a 5-seater cabin with auto climate control, parking sensors, rear AC vents, and a multifunctional steering wheel with cruise control. It should house a touchscreen infotainment system with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. For safety, multiple airbags, a rear-view camera, crash sensors, and an engine immobilizer are likely to be available.  Fact: Mercedes-Benz EQG: Pricing and availability  The pricing and availability details of the Mercedes-Benz EQG should be announced in late 2022. For reference, the fuel-based Mercedes-Benz G-Class falls in the price-bracket of Rs. 1.64-2.44 crore in India (all prices, ex-showroom, New Delhi).

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The global economy was chugging along, the company announced its next-gen RTX 20 series video cards (the first ever to enable real-time ray tracing in video games), and NVIDIA's small data center business was expanding at a rapid pace. If you'd invested that summer three years ago, however, your timing would have seemed terrible based on what happened over the next couple of months.\u00a0\nStarting in late 2018, a confluence of events worked against the leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer. The U.S.-China trade war heated up and complicated supply chains for chip companies, a global oversupply of chips started to crop up, and the price of bitcoin (BTC -2.92%) tanked along with other cryptocurrencies. NVIDIA stock ended up tanking too, ultimately falling as much as 55% from its late-summer 2018 peak.\nHowever, if you bought $5,000-worth of NVIDIA stock three years ago -- just before its crash -- you'd still have turned a tidy profit.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nImperfect timing yields a nearly-38%-per-year return\nIf you had the worst timing ever and bought NVIDIA on October 1, 2018, and endured the over 50% drubbing that followed through the first half of 2019, you'd still be up just over 160% as of July 15, 2021. That's almost a 38% per-year average return over the last three-year stretch. If you had originally bought $5,000 of NVIDIA stock, it'd be worth about $13,000 today, excluding dividend payments.\u00a0\nFor the sake of comparison, the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC -1.04%) has returned just 49% over the same period, and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index 120%.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery stock has its dog days\nThere are powerful lessons contained here. As dominant a semiconductor industry player as NVIDIA has been, it's not perfect. Every growing company goes through tough stretches. So while paying a fair price for a stock is important, your timing doesn't need to be perfect if you're eyeing the long-term potential.\u00a0\nAs for NVIDIA in particular, the crypto crash was a learning experience. The company lacked visibility on how many cryptocurrency miners were purchasing its video game cards, and when the market dried up, its sales unexpectedly took a tumble. Since then, it's made some adjustments to its product portfolio to make sure gaming GPUs end up in the hands of gamers.\u00a0\nNVIDIA didn't let the stumble sidetrack it from its goals either. While cryptos were a nice add-on to business a few years ago -- and have been again over the last year even though cryptocurrency prices took a steep nosedive again this spring -- data centers have been a primary focus for NVIDIA for some time. NVIDIA has since acquired Mellanox to boost its presence here and has steadily released new chip types aimed at scooping up a share of these modern computing units that enable cloud computing. Three years ago, its data center business hauled in about $2.9 billion in sales. Today, NVIDIA most recently reported that the same segment is worth about $7.6 billion in trailing 12-month sales.\nThis is all timely information to think about because a similar situation could be shaping up for NVIDIA now. Chip sales are booming this year, and sooner or later supply will catch up to demand. The crypto market crashed again, yet NVIDIA stock is near all-time highs, running up most recently because of the upcoming stock split. If you buy right now, your timing may not be perfect. But it doesn't need to be. NVIDIA is gobbling up a share of the semiconductor market through innovation and is poised to continue growing for many years to come.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients own shares of NVIDIA.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)2. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)3. Shopify (NYSE: SHOP)4. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)5. Disney (NYSE: DIS)6. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)7. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI)8. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)9. The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD)10. Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)Final Word\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of Warren Buffett, the legendary value investor and co-founder of Berkshire Hathaway. Perhaps you\u2019ve also heard of Charlie Munger, Buffett\u2019s lower-profile but no less impressive business partner.\nBut unless you\u2019re a seasoned DIY investor, you probably haven\u2019t heard of two stock market veterans who \u2014 like the Oracle of Omaha himself \u2014 have proven their stock picking chops time and again.\nThey\u2019re Tom and David Gardner, co-founders of The Motley Fool \u2014 the premier online resource for U.S.-based retail investors.\nWant to invest like David and Tom Gardner? To truly replicate their success, you\u2019ll need to pay for The Motley Fool\u2019s premium investment newsletters, like the Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers services. But this list of 10 of their best recent stock picks offers a taste.\nWho Are Tom and David Gardner?\nThe Gardner brothers and their growing team at The Motley Fool have been picking stocks for more than 25 years, delivering their stock recommendations through subscription stock picking services like The Motley Fool Stock Advisor and The Motley Fool Rule Breakers.\nMany of these picks have handily beaten the broader stock market, as have Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers since their respective inception dates \u2014 although the Gardners would be the first to admit that not all of their choices have panned out.\nAccording to the most recent performance data available, the average return since inception of all Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendations \u2014 the Gardners\u2019 most popular stock picking newsletter \u2014 is 815%. That\u2019s far higher than the return for the S&P 500 during the same time period (166%) as of November 5, 2024.\n\nBest Stock Picks by the Gardner Brothers at The Motley Fool\nDavid and Tom Gardner\u2019s top stock picks were all among the best stocks to buy when the brothers recommended them. Most remain among the best stocks to buy right now.\nThat\u2019s no accident. The Gardners have a knack for sussing out long-term, game-changing value where others fail to see it. They believe that picking durable winners is the best way for long-term investors to build wealth for the long haul.\nAnd so they pick individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the next decade, not just the next quarter. Although no one can predict the future, each of these recommended stocks has outperformed the broader market on a consistent basis and is poised to capitalize on long-term economic trends.\n1. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nAmazon is the dominant online retailer in North America. It sells just about everything on its namesake website: digital and physical books (its first product line), consumer electronics, household goods, pet products, sporting equipment, food and beverages, and much, much more.\nThrough its Whole Foods Market supermarket subsidiary, Amazon enjoys a growing foothold in the world of physical retail too, and analysts widely expect the company to build on that advantage in the years ahead.\nAmazon isn\u2019t only in the retail business. During the 2010s, the company invested heavily in its Amazon Prime Video service, which blends a massive library of licensed movies and shows with a rapidly growing studio that pumps out high-profile original content. In 2021, Amazon doubled down on this investment when it acquired MGM, a major film studio, for $8.45 billion according to The Verge.\nAmazon benefited massively from the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders as trepidatious consumers shifted retail\u2019s center of gravity to the World Wide Web. The company\u2019s net revenue increased by 38% to $386 billion in 2020, according to Forbes. That\u2019s an eye-popping rate of growth for a firm of Amazon\u2019s size and a warning sign for bearish investors who believe Amazon\u2019s best days are behind it.\nAmazon is all but certain to continue to dominate online retail in the near future and could threaten current market leaders in the physical retail and entertainment spaces in the years ahead. It\u2019s no wonder that the Stock Advisor touts Amazon as one of its best stock tips of all time \u2014 nor that Amazon remains one of the top tech stocks to buy today.\nAmazon\u2019s five-year annualized return is 36.22% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s a bit better than the 28.45% five-year annualized return of the Internet retail sector.\nThis is especially impressive given that Amazon is the most dominant Internet retail company in North America, so it can only grow so fast these days. The stock\u2019s 15-year annualized return of 34.85% is comfortably ahead of the sector\u2019s 23.16% benchmark return.\n\n2. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)\nFrom its humble beginnings as a mail-order rental service for DVDs (remember those?) to its present-day position as the North American market leader in streaming content, Netflix has consistently outperformed the broader stock market.\nLike Amazon, Netflix is now a major producer of original video content. It\u2019s behind some of the most-watched TV shows in recent history: \u201cBridgerton,\u201d \u201cLupin,\u201d \u201cTiger King,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d to name just a few.\nAnd, like Amazon, Netflix was perfectly positioned to benefit from the widespread economic disruption wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the nominal leader of a diverse drop of \u201cstay-at-home stocks\u201d that saw outsize gains during the pandemic, like Zoom Video (NASDAQ: ZOOM) and Wayfair (NYSE: W).\nNetflix saw incredible subscriber growth in 2020, adding nearly 16 million subscribers, per Reuters, and defying prognosticators who mistakenly believed the streaming market was saturated.\nNetflix\u2019s subscriber growth tailed off as the pandemic faded, coming in below expectations through the first half of 2021. But the company remains uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of a longer-term shift in content consumption. And that\u2019s more than enough to include it on a list of the Gardners\u2019 best stock picks ever.\nNetflix\u2019s five-year annualized return is 41.16% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s more than twice the 16.64% five-year annualized average return of the broader entertainment sector.\n\n3. Shopify (NYSE: SHOP)\nShopify is a Canadian e-commerce retailer that makes it possible for small, lean businesses \u2014 often solopreneurs with big dreams and limited capital \u2014 to sell products online. Shopify also provides vital diversification for brick-and-mortar retailers looking to reach customers beyond their hometowns.\nNeedless to say, Shopify was a lifesaver for many small businesses amid pandemic lockdowns. The platform\u2019s revenue nearly doubled in 2020, according to a company release. To the extent that the sudden pandemic shift to digital retail proves permanent, Shopify is poised to benefit.\nThat\u2019s not to say that Shopify wasn\u2019t on the up and up before COVID hit. According to The Motley Fool, $10,000 investment in Shopify\u2019s IPO was worth about $286,000 in February 2020, the last truly \u201cnormal\u201d month in pre-COVID history. Before the world-changing event that kicked its growth into another gear, Shopify was already one of the most successful Motley Fool Stock Advisor picks.\nShopify does operate in a fragmented industry. The company entered an e-commerce market that was already pretty crowded, and its success \u2014 along with consistent growth in online retail as a whole \u2014 spurred a wave of Shopify alternatives. Some of those alternatives improve on the original and may threaten Shopify\u2019s dominance in the coming years. But in the short term, Shopify is riding high.\nShopify\u2019s five-year annualized return is 105.63% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s more than triple the 30.20% five-year annualized return of the software application sector.\n\n4. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nTesla is a U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer that\u2019s consistently ranked among the best electric vehicle stocks to buy. It\u2019s arguably the best-known EV company in the world, although bigger competitors like Ford and General Motors are quickly making up for lost time in the EV manufacturing race.\nTesla is difficult to separate from the persona of Elon Musk, its impulsive and controversial founder. Musk is a serial entrepreneur whose attention often appears divided between his bread-and-butter business (Tesla) and riskier, capital-intensive ventures like interplanetary spaceflight (SpaceX) and subterranean transportation (the Boring Company).\nAnd his public statements (often delivered on Twitter) have drawn SEC sanctions of material impact to his firm\u2019s finances. As a result, Musk deserves more scrutiny than the typical founder.\nShould that worry long-term investors in Tesla? Probably not.\nInvestors concerned about Tesla\u2019s long-term potential need to remember that the company is on the leading edge of a once-in-a-lifetime sea change in human mobility \u2014 the transition from the internal combustion engine to the battery-powered electric engine.\nWith the Biden administration aiming to build 500,000 electric charging stations around the U.S. by 2030, per Government Technology, it\u2019s not a question of whether electric cars will replace gas-powered vehicles, but how quickly.\nAnd Tesla also isn\u2019t just an electric car company, even if transportation still accounts for the bulk of its revenue. One of Tesla\u2019s key long-term objectives \u2014 one even more ambitious than replacing the gas engine \u2014 is to decentralize and democratize the planet\u2019s electricity infrastructure. Innovations like the Megapack, a utility-scale energy storage solution, offer an early taste of how that might look.\nTesla\u2019s five-year annualized return is 95.84% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s nearly three times the 32.90 five-year annualized return of the auto manufacturers sector, which includes a mix of EV and conventional automakers.\n\n5. Disney (NYSE: DIS)\nFor most people, the name \u201cDisney\u201d evokes Mickey Mouse and the Magic Kingdom. But Disney is in the business of much more than cartoons and theme parks, although both undoubtedly drive billions in revenue for this global entertainment behemoth.\nDisney\u2019s low-key holdings are surprising enough for Business Insider to run a list of brands the average person doesn\u2019t realize Disney owns. Among them are:\n\nABC, a major U.S. broadcast network\nESPN, the global sports media brand\nMarvel Studios and Lucasfilm, two of the most successful film studios of the 2010s\n21st Century Fox, another massively successful film studio with a huge content library\nHulu, a major Netflix and Amazon Prime Video competitor\nHollywood Records, a storied music publisher\n\nDisney\u2019s vast entertainment portfolio supported the company through the COVID-19 pandemic, which devastated its travel and leisure holdings. In a post-pandemic environment, something closer to the reverse could happen, with Disney\u2019s theme parks, resorts, and cruise lines seeing a surge in revenue as leisure travel returns.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Disney\u2019s medium-term stock returns are not as impressive as those of some other Gardner picks. But the company has easily outperformed the broader market since the beginning of the 21st century, and the company looks to remain relevant (and vibrant) for years to come. That makes it a sensible addition to any long-term stock portfolio.\nDisney\u2019s five-year annualized return is 13.69% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. Though that actually underperforms the broader entertainment sector during the same period, Disney\u2019s 15-year return of 12.42% is comfortably ahead of its benchmark index over the same timespan.\n\n6. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nApple needs no introduction. If you\u2019re reading this article on a mobile device, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s an iPhone, the handset that kickstarted the smartphone revolution. The iPhone has done more for Apple\u2019s bottom line (and stock price) than any other piece of consumer electronics technology since the advent of the personal computer.\nPerhaps not coincidentally, Apple also played a significant role in the PC revolution. Behind both transformative technologies stood Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose rare talent for branding and consumer product development quite literally changed the world.\nMany investors and market analysts were understandably concerned about the company\u2019s future following Jobs\u2019 untimely death in 2011, as Apple endured a prolonged slump after he left the company for the first time in 1985. But current Apple CEO Tim Cook proved more than capable of picking up where Jobs left off, and the company\u2019s stock performance to date reflects market confidence in his leadership.\nApple continues to launch and update successful consumer electronics products: the iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV. Lately, the company has diversified into electric and autonomous vehicle systems.\nThanks to its deep pockets and vast technical expertise, those moves could eventually pose a competitive threat to EV upstarts like Tesla as well as established automakers like Ford, but they\u2019re not a significant revenue driver at present.\nApple\u2019s five-year annualized return is 41.28% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s roughly in line with the five-year annualized return of the consumer electronics sector.\nOf course, like Amazon, Apple absolutely dominates its industry and simply can\u2019t grow like a startup anymore. Its 15-year annualized return of 30.11% is comfortably ahead of the sector\u2019s 26.64% annualized return during the same period.\n\n7. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI)\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of MercadoLibre, don\u2019t blame your limited stock market knowledge. Blame geography.\nMercadoLibre is a huge deal, just not in the United States. Based in Argentina, it\u2019s the largest e-commerce platform and payments processor operating in Latin America today. That means it\u2019s primed to tap into one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing multinational economic blocs, stretching from Mexico in the north to Chile and Argentina in the south.\nMercadoLibre\u2019s breakneck expansion made it one of the top growth stocks of the 2010s \u2014 and one of the Gardners\u2019 best stock picks to date. Indeed, overly simplistic comparisons to Shopify understate MELI\u2019s value.\nNot only is the company the top e-commerce player in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile, its MercadoPago payments arm makes it a leading online payment provider in the region, and its MercadoCredito department is a valuable short-term financing solution for emerging digital merchants.\nThere\u2019s more. In addition to its namesake online marketplace and the two solutions described above, MercadoLibre offers three distinct additional solutions for digital sellers and buyers in Latin America:\n\nMercadoShops. It\u2019s fair to compare MercadoShops to Shopify. This is a turnkey digital storefront solution, not at all unlike Shopify or Etsy, that allows ambitious sellers to create, manage, and grow their own digital stores with plenty of help from MercadoLibre. MercadoShops integrates seamlessly with MercadoLibre itself and the MercadoPago payment platform.\nMercadoEnvios. MercadoEnvios is a third-party logistics service that allows smaller sellers to fulfill orders without investing in storage space, logistics contracts, and any number of other headaches associated with dropshipping.\nMercadoPublicidad. MercadoPublicidad is a marketing and advertising solution that allows smaller sellers to take advantage of the vast amounts of buyer data MercadoLibre collects.\n\nIn sum, MercadoLibre is a truly comprehensive online retail solution for Latin American entrepreneurs. No wonder it\u2019s one of the best picks on the Gardners\u2019 stock lists.\nMercadoLibre\u2019s five-year annualized return is 57.80% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s double the 28.45% five-year annualized return of the Internet retail sector, itself one of the hottest stock market sectors right now.\n\n8. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nNVIDIA is another high-growth company that\u2019s probably not familiar to the average American consumer. But, like Apple\u2019s iPhone in its day, NVIDIA\u2019s technology is quietly revolutionizing computing.\nWhat is that technology, exactly? In a word (or three): high-end computer chips.\nNVIDIA manufactures the graphics processing units (GPUs) that serious computer gamers rely on to minimize lag times and maximize visual resolution. NVIDIA is widely recognized as a market leader in the GPU space, dominating closely watched industry lists like PCMag\u2019s annual best graphics cards roundup.\nThe Gardners and the Motley Fool Stock Advisor team are bullish on NVIDIA for other reasons as well. The company\u2019s GPUs are widely used in commercial applications like data centers and cryptocurrency mining, two rapidly growing sectors that could pay dividends for NVIDIA and its investors for years to come. Anticipating said growth, NVIDIA acquired data center company Mellanox in 2020.\nNVIDIA\u2019s super-fast chips are poised to capitalize on another transformative trend that\u2019s coming sooner rather than later: artificial intelligence. NVIDIA chips run AI systems better than any competitor\u2019s. As those systems take on ever greater responsibility in applications as diverse as data centers, driverless cars, and health care, those little wafers will become ever more important to the smooth functioning of human society.\nA bold claim, to be sure. But investors shouldn\u2019t bet against NVIDIA. The Gardners certainly haven\u2019t.\nNVIDIA\u2019s five-year annualized return is 77.12% as of June 30, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s more than double the 33.89% five-year annualized return of the broader semiconductors sector.\n\n9. The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD)\nIn terms of revenue and market capitalization, California-based adtech firm The Trade Desk is dwarfed by the likes of Apple and Amazon. But what The Trade Desk lacks (so far) in market heft, it more than compensates for in share price growth.\nSince going public in 2016 at a share price of $18, the company\u2019s stock went on a four-year tear before finally pausing for breath in late 2020.\nAccording to a Motley Fool analysis, before The Trade Desk\u2019s all-time high, $1,000 invested in the company\u2019s IPO would have been worth nearly $8,000 in April 2020. Of course, The Trade Desk\u2019s impressive past-year performance doesn\u2019t help investors who haven\u2019t gotten in on the action yet.\nA more recent Motley Fool analysis suggests there\u2019s still plenty of upside here. In the near term, a 10-for-1 stock split is widely seen as a vote of confidence by management in the stock\u2019s appreciation potential.\nLooking farther ahead, The Trade Desk is tackling head-on a potential threat to its business \u2014 a privacy-friendly shift in Google\u2019s tracking cookie policy \u2014 by designing a new platform that\u2019s less sensitive to the search giant\u2019s whims.\nIf The Trade Desk can stay one step ahead of the Google curve, it\u2019s in an enviable position to take advantage of rapidly growing and diversifying advertising markets on Web, mobile, and streaming platforms.\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s three-year annualized return (the longest span available since its IPO) is 106.82% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s more than three times the 30.20% three-year annualized return of the broader software applications sector.\n\n10. Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)\nLike The Trade Desk, Okta is a digital technology company whose cybersecurity products and services the average Web user interacts with only indirectly. But those products and services are absolutely vital to the smooth functioning of the digital economy.\nThey\u2019ll only become more important as high-profile hacking and ransomware attacks like those that temporarily felled Colonial Pipeline and JBS increase in frequency and severity.\nOkta\u2019s solutions are technical, even eye-watering, for nonexperts to wrap their heads around. What\u2019s important for would-be investors to understand is that Okta\u2019s solutions make the Internet safer for individual users and companies alike \u2014 and that those solutions are in high demand.\nThe Colonial Pipeline and JBS hacks focused national attention on what digital security experts have long known: Hackers are getting better at what they do, and their work grows more disruptive by the month.\nAccordingly, a Motley Fool analysis from June 2020 identifies Okta as one of the \u201cthree tech stocks that could make you rich.\u201d The reasoning is simple: Not only are Okta\u2019s solutions sophisticated and adaptable enough to stymie elite hackers, but they\u2019re also \u201csticky,\u201d meaning companies tend to keep using them once they\u2019ve tried them out.\nAnd it appears that Okta is diversifying \u2014 if not from its core cybersecurity business, then at least into what The Motley Fool describes as a $30 billion consumer cybersecurity market. To this end, Okta purchased Auth0, a consumer identity and access management firm, in early 2021.\nOkta\u2019s three-year annualized return (the longest span available) is 63.28% as of Nov. 10, 2021, according to Morningstar. That\u2019s roughly twice the three-year annualized return of the broader software infrastructure sector.\n\nFinal Word\nRule Breakers and Stock Advisor are only the two most popular Motley Fool subscription services. MF has far more premium services where those came from \u2014 around two dozen in all, with new ones coming online periodically to replace older packages that have run their course.\nWhether you\u2019re keen to build a portfolio that mirrors David Gardner\u2019s own with Everlasting Portfolio or unlock deep value with one of the industry- or trend-specific Rule Breakers packages, there\u2019s almost certainly a Motley Fool service tailored to your personal investing style and objectives.\nIn truth, there\u2019s almost certainly more than one MF service that fits your needs, in good times and bad.

Predicting when exactly crashes will hit remains incredibly difficult, but there are strategies and orienting principles that can put you in position to weather (and even benefit from) challenges as they emerge.\u00a0\nTo help readers prepare for the next crash, a panel of Motely Fool contributors has weighed in with three things you should keep in mind as you navigate the stock market. Read on to see why they think that understanding these points will help you survive, and thrive, through the next crash.\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nEach stock market crash is different\nKeith Noonan: When trouble hits, there's a natural instinct to look to history in hopes that it will show us the right way forward. Looking at what worked in the past can provide a valuable frame of reference for evaluating the present and navigating the future, but it's important to keep in mind that each stock market crash happens for different reasons and in the context of a different market environment.\u00a0\nFor example, let's compare the last two major stock market crashes: the pandemic-driven crash of 2020 and the crash stemming from the 2008 financial crisis. The factors shaping market behavior were widely different in these two instances.\u00a0\nThe stock market languished for years following the financial crisis, and it wasn't until 2013 that the S&P 500 index climbed above its early 2008 level. If you assumed that a similar progression would play out after last year's crash, you would have missed out on the market's rapid recovery.\u00a0The S&P 500 is now up roughly 35% since the start of 2020.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth-dependent tech stocks often get hit hard when the market turns bearish, and investors usually flock to safer-looking alternatives that pay dividends and trade at low earnings and sales multiples. However, pandemic conditions actually created powerful tailwinds for many tech-focused companies. These seemingly risky stocks not only went on to recover faster than even high-quality value names, but many enjoyed a period of record growth and went on to set new valuation highs.\u00a0\nThe past can teach us a lot about factors that influence the market and how things might play out, but don't expect that following yesterday's playbook will necessarily put you on track to strong performance tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0\nSector-wide crashes happen all the time\nDaniel Foelber:\u00a0The definition of a market correction is simple enough. Technically speaking, it's when the stock market falls by 10% or more from its peak, with a bear market being an extended period of a greater than 20% decline from the peak. Similarly, a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\u00a0\nStock market crashes and recessions affect different sectors in different ways. After the March 2020 stock market crash, the S&P 500 proceeded to rebound and finish the year up 16%, with tech, consumer discretionary, and renewables stocks doing even better. However, the energy sector suffered a brutal 37% decline in 2020, meaning it stayed in bear market territory while most of the market was roaring back to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nThis year, the script has flipped. Oil and gas stocks are crushing the broader markets but renewable energy stocks are selling off.\u00a0The average stock in the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN -1.67%) is down 20% year to date. And just last week, many small-cap tech stocks suffered 10% or even 20% or higher declines.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nThe same dichotomies persist during recessions. Over 22 million Americans lost their jobs in the first four months of 2020. In April 2020, which was the month many consider to be the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate reached 14.8%. And while the mass exodus out of the office affected much of the country, folks who were already working remotely saw little change.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors can glean lessons from the volatility of different market sectors, as well as the anatomy of the COVID-19 recession. For small-cap tech investors, last week's sell-off can feel like the market is crashing before their eyes. By contrast, many oil and gas investors are just recently feeling like they are out of a bear market. Crashes are relative and can happen without warning. Therefore, it's best to keep a diversified portfolio that can handle changes in sentiment as sectors ping pong between in favor and out of favor.\nCommit now to being a (smart) buyer then\nJames Brumley:\u00a0It's easy to forget it while stocks are plummeting, but any pullback is a buying opportunity. The bigger, the better. The market's never not recovered from a correction or bear market.\nOf course, you still have to stick with names that are actually poised to recover, and steer clear of the stocks that were lucky enough to temporarily catch a tailwind.\nA ticker like AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC 0.50%) comes to mind. Its short squeeze was ultimately born out of shutdowns prompted by advent of COVID-19, or more specifically, the recovery of the movie business following the easing of the pandemic -- it made for great bullish rhetoric. The thing is, the company's now overvalued by any measure you can think of using any of the company's pre-coronavirus results. A marketwide stumble could set it on a crash course.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for a quality name like NVIDIA (NVDA -3.22%) instead. I love the fact that its data center business is now eclipsing its gaming (and crypto mining) revenue, as the former is a much more sustainable sort of business. I'm too cheap to step in at 44 times next year's projected earnings. A move back to the $500 where it leveled off for several months late last year and early this year, however, is not only plausible, but would leave NVIDIA shares at a very attractive projected P/E around 30. (Just for the record though, I'd settle for a pullback of half that size.)\nYour job is simply building a cash stash, making a watch list, and establishing an entry plan now. Waiting for a pullback to start before doing these things means you're making decisions under pressure, which is anything but ideal.\n\n\n\nDaniel Foelber has the following options: long July 2021 $50 puts on AMC Entertainment Holdings and short July 2021 $49 puts on AMC Entertainment Holdings. James Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Keith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends NVIDIA.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now. Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund manager and present host of Mad Money on news platform CNBC, is one of the most well-known finance personalities on television. His stock picks have consistently outperformed the wider market over the past few years, mostly because he is a big believer in technology stocks that have witnessed explosive growth over this time period. Cramer has worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs, founded a hedge fund named Cramer Levy Partners, and is the founding member of one of the premier finance websites in the world.   Some of the stocks that Cramer has backed over the past few months include Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), among others. These are discussed in detail below. Cramer has a net worth of over $150 million and regularly contributes to TheStreet, the finance publication he co-founded in 1996. He is the author of three books on investment strategies, including Get Rich Carefully that was published in 2013.  The success of Cramer is an exception in the world of big finance that has not posted incredible numbers in recent years. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\u2019s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\u2019s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.    With this context in mind, here is our list of the 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. These were ranked keeping in mind the timing of the mention by Cramer, hedge fund sentiment, and basic business fundamentals of each. The list was also compiled using the videos that Mad Money posts to the CNBC website and streaming platform YouTube.    Story Continues Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now15. Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) is an Ohio-based business services company. It is ranked fifteenth on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. The company\u2019s shares have offered investors returns exceeding 31% over the course of the past twelve months. On June 22, investment advisory Goldman Sachs raised the price target on the stock to $411 from $387 and reiterated a Buy rating. During his show in early April, Cramer called the stock terrific in the medium and small businesses market. On July 15, Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) posted earnings results for the fourth quarter, reporting earnings per share of $2.47, beating market predictions by $0.17. The revenue over the period was more than $1.8 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Alkeon Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) with 384,602 shares worth more than $131 million. Just like Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. In its Q4 2020 investor letter, Artisan Partners Limited Partnership, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cWe concluded our campaigns in Cintas during Q4. We have held Cintas since the portfolio\u2019s inception on the thesis that the acquisition of G&K created significant opportunities for revenue and cost synergies. We had high confidence in Cintas\u2019 management team to achieve those synergies, and we have been rewarded accordingly for that conviction. We think the stock\u2019s valuation now more appropriately reflects the strength of the franchise and profit cycle, and therefore we ended our successful campaign.\u201d 14. Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY) is placed fourteenth on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY) markets cloud computing services and is headquartered in California. On April 6, during a lightning round question, Cramer said the stock had room to run to the upside. The company has a market capitalization of over $5 billion and posted more than $290 million in revenue last year as the pandemic boosted sales. In 2019, the annual revenue for the company had been close to $200 million. On June 10, investment advisory RBC Capital initiated coverage on Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY) stock with a Sector Perform rating and a price target of $50. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at the firm, highlighted the developer-focused model and positioning of the firm in the ratings reveal. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 26 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.3 billion in Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY), down from 32 in the preceding quarter worth $1.5 billion. 13. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13 GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) is a video game retailer. It is ranked thirteenth on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. The company\u2019s shares have returned 4,112% to investors in the past year. On May 27, during his show, Cramer blasted those trying to short-sell the stock, predicting that those trying to do so would end up like those that had tried to short-sell GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) in January, resulting in record losses as the share price registered a record rally, even going as far as to call those short-selling GameStop 'idiots.'On July 12, investment advisory Ascendiant raised the price target on GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) stock to $25 from $10, but kept a Sell rating on the stock. Edward Woo, an analyst at the firm, said the target reflected the digital and execution risks offset by the transformation plan. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) with 3.2 million shares worth more than $620 million. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now, alongside Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO).In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Rhizome Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cThe first quarter saw some bizarre market reactions. Game Stop is a heavily shorted legacy video game retailer that saw its stock price rise from $17 to a peak of $483 within a month. It appears that retail investors on a Reddit.com forum called WallStreetBets used memes to create a viral feedback loop of forced buying. Game Stop reached $20 billion in market cap and had more daily trading volume than Apple at one point. The Game Stop short squeeze became a black swan event for the short sellers. Large hedge funds such as Melvin Capital suffered 50% losses during a short period and required emergency capital injections that resulted in costly dilution. Shorting is difficult and introduces a risk of ruin. This is especially true in situations where a large percentage of the float is shorted. We want to remind you that we hedge our portfolio via index puts, sector puts, and sometimes buying puts directly in our own portfolio companies. However, we rarely short because 1) we are not good at it 2) the potential for brain damage is too high and 3) we want to avoid the risk of ruin.\u201d 12. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC)Number of hedge fund holders: 19 AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) stock has returned 743% to investors in the past twelve months. It is placed twelfth on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) runs a chain of movie theatres and operates from Kansas. In early July, the company cancelled a previously proposed approval for share increase. Commenting on the decision, Cramer lauded the leadership of Adam Aron, the CEO of the firm, and backed the stock to climb higher under his guidance. On July 15, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) stock rallied by close to 10% as it broke a five session losing streak. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) remains one of the most active on the market, with 90 million shares changing hands on July 15. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 19 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $34 million in AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), up from 16 in the preceding quarter worth $24 million. In its Q4 2020 investor letter, Mittleman Investment Management LLC, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cAMC Entertainment (AMC) was our only material loser in Q4, dropping from $4.71 to $2.12 (-55%). I planned on discussing here why it was worth at least the $10 per share that my recently reduced estimate of fair value claimed, but since then AMC raised more cash against their UK holdings and then the stock took off due to speculative players from reddit.com getting involved, so we sold it all around $14 during the last week of Jan. 2021. This was a modest profit for most clients, but a loss for some others, depending on when the account began, so check your statements to see where you came out. And yes, I recognize it as being a dose of good luck, which I heartily accept from the universe as it seemed somewhat lacking in the portfolio of late. After the sale of AMC in late January 2021, our exposure to the movie theater business is now exclusively in Canada via Cineplex, which has a 75% market share and much less leverage on its balance sheet.\u201d 11. Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91 Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) is an ecommerce firm based in Canada. It is ranked eleventh on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. The company\u2019s shares have returned 55% to investors in the past year. On July 1, Cramer called the firm the ultimate enabler of small businesses and highlighted the steps the firm was taking to expand business through increased spending on developers. Cramer also underlined how the stock had climbed more than 4,500% in the past five years. On June 30, investment advisory RBC Capital raised the price target on Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) stock to $1,700 from $1,500. Paul Treiber, an analyst at the firm, maintained an Outperform rating on Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP).Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm Lone Pine Capital is a leading shareholder in Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) with 1.7 million shares worth more than $1.8 billion. In addition to Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now.In its Q4 2020 investor letter, RGA Investment Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cWhile we are pleased with the results of these specific purchases, we made a huge mistake of omission at that time. This mistake will likely be one of the biggest we ever make in our careers. Specifically, we did deep work on Shopify and loved everything about the business qualitatively. Unfortunately, we ultimately found ourselves unable to get comfortable with the numbers. 10. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON) is placed tenth on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. The stock has offered investors returns exceeding 50% over the course of the past twelve months. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON) operates as a conglomerate with interests in aerospace, building technologies, performance materials, and productivity solutions. In November last year, Cramer backed the stock to climb higher on the back of automated warehousing solutions it offered, an area of the industry that has grown by leaps and bounds because of the virus crisis. On July 14, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Buy rating on Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON) but lowered the price target to $245 from $246. Nicole DeBlase, an analyst at the firm, expects the stock to beat earnings estimates this quarter. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 56 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.7 billion in Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON), up from 45 the preceding quarter worth $983 million.In its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cThe portfolio\u2019s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020. However, that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the Strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration, which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality. This has been the case during the vaccine- and stimulus-driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter. Sectors that lagged in the quarter included industrials, Honeywell also lagged in the quarter after previously generating strong returns over extended periods.\u201d 9. The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) is an aerospace firm that operates from Chicago. It is ranked ninth on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. The company\u2019s shares have offered investors returns exceeding 26% over the course of the past year. Cramer has slammed investors who have been selling The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) because of speculation around the 737 MAX, urging them to reconsider as Boeing gets new orders for the product, reinvents itself, and the economy reopens, all potential growth catalysts for the stock. On July 14, investment advisory Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) stock with a price target of $274, dismissing recent concerns around Boeing 737 MAX as a minor headache for the aircraft firm. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 59 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.4 billion in The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA), up from 55 the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG), and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) are some of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now, alongside The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA).In its Q1 2020 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\u201cWe\u2019ve known Boeing for a long time. It\u2019s always been a high quality company that\u2019s traded for a premium valuation owing to its position as a global duopoly. We\u2019d looked at it recently after weakness due to its highly publicized Max 737 issues, but it never got cheap enough for us to pull the trigger. After the pandemic, the stock went into freefall as its customer bases\u2019 business dried up and people worried about its liquidity. The stock fell from $338 on February 19th when the S&P hit its high to a low of $89. We bought the stock after the new CEO Dave Calhoun said publicly that it would not take government capital if it required equity dilution because it had many other options. Our average price is just above $120 where it was trading for less than 7x what it earned in 2018. It will likely take a while to normalize to those earnings levels, but this business will survive and ultimately we will own a leader in a global duopoly. Even on depressed forecasts, the company currently has about a 10-15% free cash flow yield. If and when the economy normalizes, we think Boeing could be worth more than double its current price.\u201d 8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 251Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock has returned 38% to investors in the past year.

Here is what the fund said:\u201cWe have written extensively about Microsoft in recent commentaries. It was our leading contributor last year and one of our largest weightings within the Portfolio. It continues to experience business momentum through several dominant, essential, and competitively advantaged businesses, like Office 365 and Azure. The markets it competes for are enormous, which gives the company the ability to compound at scale. In the past quarter alone, the company generated over $40 billion in revenue, representing a 17% growth rate. The inherent operating leverage in Microsoft\u2019s business model continues and led to 34% earnings growth this past quarter. Despite the broad rotation we saw in the first quarter and Microsoft\u2019s robust performance in 2020, we think its business fundamentals continue to exhibit strength, and the stock continues to reflect the fundamentals.\u201d 7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is ranked seventh on our list of 15 best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now.

NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are at the intersection of a number of important computing trends including the movement to the Cloud, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, edge computing, gaming, and more. We previously owned NVIDIA and sold it in the third quarter of 2020 as the price to value gap closed and our margin of safety was reduced. As with all our MVP companies, we continued to follow NVIDIA closely. Since that time, NVIDIA reported excellent results and its value has compounded rapidly. The technology selloff at the beginning of the year negatively affected the stock price while our estimate of NVIDIA\u2019s value per share increased. This happy combination of events created a margin of safety and an opportunity to once again add NVIDIA to the portfolio.\u201d 6.

Wilson \u2022\nJul 30, 2021 at 09:38am EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation graphics cards are quite expensive and are not recommended for use in overclocked environments unless you have a budget that allows for this. NVIDIA does not condone this type of usage of their workstation GPUs. In doing so, users can run into costly issues and, more than likely, void their warranty pushing the product past its intended use. NVIDIA Ampere RTX workstation graphics cards are meant for long-lasting use, monitored temperature levels, stable noise levels, and consistent structure of the ECC-RAM.\nNVIDIA's RTX GPUs Based on Ampere Architecture Could Be Overclocked Using MSI Afterburner\nIgor Wallossek of Igor's Lab discovered that with the current version of MSI Afterburner, version 4.6.4. Beta 3, allows for overclocking of, not only GeForce RTX cards but certain Ampere RTX workstation GPUs, a feature never unlocked in previous MSI Afterburner versions. Typically, the only values that were up for alteration were memory, core, voltage, and fan curvature.\nRelated Story Mysterious NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card With Dual-Slot & Blower-Type Cooler Spotted\"Fan curvature\" is only an option that is specifically designed for use with Turing RTX workstation graphics cards, the previous generation of NVIDIA's ray-tracing microarchitecture. So, while the current Ampere RTX graphics cards use newer and advanced technology, they are still open to being overclocked because they contain similar technology. The primary practice of overclocking is usually reserved for gaming GPUs, such as NVIDIA's GeForce RTX line.\nNVIDIA Ampere RTX Workstations Capable of Overclocking With Newest MSI Afterburner Beta. (Image Source: Igor's Lab)\nWallossek tested MSI Afterburner's overclocking ability with an RTX A5000 GPU, a GA102 GPU with 8192 CUDA cores. The RTX A5000 GPU showcases 24 GB of GDDR6 EEC memory. Under normal circumstances, the GPU processes with a maximum clock rate limit of 1440 MHz. Using the unlocked overclocking technique, Wallossek added increased performance by 5%, pushing the maximum clock rate to 1590 MHz. He was able to replicate the same test with similar results with the corresponding RTX A6000 GPU as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIgor Wallossek is planning to further test the overclocking technique in the future utilizing a water cooling system to maintain temperatures of the workstation GPU, allowing for further checks on limitations of the RTX A5000 and also the RTX A6000. He states that under the current conditions he was brave since he knows how expensive of an outcome that would have created if he pushed the GPU too far past its limitations.\nMSI Afterburner 4.6.4.

The biggest news seems to be that Nvidia will be returning to TSMC for the mass production of its consumer GPUs.\nFor 2022 Nvidia has developed the Ada Lovelace GPU for consumers, and the Hooper GPU for data centres and so on. Lovelace will be behind the upcoming GeForce RTX 40 series of GPUs. I'm not sure if the translation says that Lovelace or some other tech will be used for a next gen Nintendo Switch next year too.\n\nNvidia Hooper GPUs will feature a chiplet design with MCM advanced packaging for a significant AI processing boost. The Commercial Times asserts that Hooper GPUS will be up to 3X faster than Ampere A100 GPUs. Both Lovelace and Hooper will be fabricated on TSMC's 5nm process.\nAMD doesn't seem to be splitting the consumer and data centre GPUs in the same way as Nvidia. The Taiwanese source says that consumer RNDA 3 parts will be built by TSMC on 6nm, while the CDNA 2 data centre GPUs will be built at 5nm. However, they are both using chiplet designs with MCM advanced packaging.\n\nSchedule of production shared by Commercial Times, with some necessary translations\nMoving along to Intel, and the insiders say that some parts of Intel's upcoming consumer and data centre GPUs will be built on TSMC 6nm and 5nm processes. I think Intel will take these 'compute tiles' and use its own advanced packaging and connectivity tech to create the finished processors.\nLast but not least, the report also signals the move of Qualcomm's business from Samsung to TSMC. It says that \"Qualcomm's 5G mobile phone chips have begun to use TSMC's 6nm process in the second half of the year, and will expand the use of TSMC's 5nm and 4nm mass production next year\".\nApple orders over 100 million iPhone 13 processors\nAnother report from Taiwan, this time from United Daily News, says that Apple has ordered over 100 million iPhone processors from TSMC (If you click the link, Google translate uses 'Hon Hai' in place of 'Foxconn'). These will be A15 processors created on TSMC N5P, which started rolling off the production lines at the end of May this year.\nApparently the N5P yield is somewhat below N5, so it isn't as economical at this time, but Apple needs the newest this and that to push forward its iPhone 13 in September. The most optimistic investors were estimating that Apple would prepare 95 million iPhone 13 models, so the info from the TSMC insider. Apple is expected to have iPhones powered by TSMC 4nm produced SoCs next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n178\nCheer up!

So yeah, reserve early or play musical chairs on your downgraded processes.  Apple moving ~14-30mil macs next year without 3nm means a LOT more 4nm will be needed, so it will be interesting to see how 4/5n shakes out next Christmas and beyond.  AMD was planning on 3nm just like apple.  I'm sure NV had some 3nm plans as well, especially after samsung surely don't want to be caught with samsung for top end again for a bit.  Maybe all the lower models OK, with much more margin on clocks, watts etc down there.  NV seems to be going bigger at 5nm, and with Intel and probably apple right after M2 chips coming for gpu, I think NV is thinking less and less about AMD's R&D dept and more about the other two new guys with MASSIVE net income to throw at R&D gpu teams and drivers.  Only one of them has to get it right to do a LOT of damage potentially, as they both have basically ZERO discrete and wads of cash to throw at the best WAFERS.  I think this is why we might actually get what NV is promising next round with 3x perf.  Really it's only adding another chiplet with the shrink and TSMC (samsung 8 vs TSMC 5nm is probably a free double, then just plopping down the equivalent of one more so to speak).  Samsung 8nm is way behind TSMC 5nm in density.  IE, Samsungs 3nm is worse than TSMC 5, so NV should be able to do a 3090 (628mm^2 now on samsung8) @ less than 1/2 the space depending on who you believe.https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabricationsamsung 8 on that chart less than 1/2 TSMC 5nm EUV density. Those are updated a bit on semi-digest (semiengineering) or something, just dont' have time to find it again\u2026This one just a quick search, and has a chart down to 5nm est, but 8 etc in the books (just an extension of their 10nm so no surprise tsmc5nm 2x+).I'm torn by the fact I am excited about an Intel gpu at 6nm or 3nm\u2026LOL.  Then again I'd rather have a 5nm NV than 6nm Intel if I can get one.  But how likely is it we get a shot at something in the next year anyway?  I'm just hoping I'll at least get an Aug5th AMD chip with gpu for an HTPC build or two ;)  I can wait for a gpu flood at 3nm or something from Intel while they attempt to take every AMD/NV/APPLE wafer they can use at TSMC.  GPU seems good for ages, as they have ZERO share of discrete.  Make all the 3nm you can for a year or 18 mo Pat.  Major pain on bottom lines for NV/AMD and minor for apple with a delay of 3nm for M2 macs (still ROFL @ apple had to go 4nm).  Why does chrome paste crap fonts.  Bah, back to FFox.  Sorry if it looks as bad on your end as mine\u2026 :(\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin |\n                Register\n\nA\nA\nA\n\nFull HEXUS Site\n\nAbout Us -\n                Contact Us -\n                Advertise -\n                T&Cs \n\n\n\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

Previously, developers had to apply before they could get access to it. Unlike the official Unreal Engine or Unity plugins, the DLSS SDK is meant to be used with custom and/or proprietary engines.\nNew features of this release (version 2.2.1) also include some additional options available to game developers.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Releases New Game Ready Driver for RTX 5070 and Fragpunk (Which Has DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation)\n\nAdded Sharpening Slider \u2013 Developers can now add a slider to adjust sharpness, enabling users to make the image sharper or softer based on their own personal preferences.\n\n\nAdded Support for Linux\u00a0\u2013 Developers can now integrate DLSS in Linux games and applications.\n\n\nAdded Auto-Exposure Option\u00a0- DLSS is able to automatically calculate exposure values. This feature can potentially improve the image quality of low contrast scenes.\n\n\nBug Fixes & Stability Improvements\n\nThese are the system requirements for the DLSS SDK, by the way.\n\n\n\n\nOperating Systems\nWindows 10 64-bit\nDirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)\nLinux Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04\n\n\nDependencies\nNVIDIA RTX GPU\nNVIDIA DLSS SDK requires R470 driver or newer.\n\n\nDevelopment Environment\nVisual Studio 2017 v15.6 or later\nLinux: Visual Studio Code, gcc and g++ 8.4.0 or newer\n\n\nEngine Requirements\n\n\nDirectX11, DirectX 12, or Vulkan based\nAdditional note for Vulkan: The Vulkan path of DLSS expects the application to run on a Vulkan version 1.1 or later.\n\n\nOn each evaluate call (i.e. each frame), provide:\nThe raw color buffer for the frame (in HDR or LDR/SDR space).\nScreen space motion vectors that are: accurate and calculated at 16 or 32 bits per-pixel; and updated each frame.\nThe depth buffer for the frame.\nThe exposure value (if processing in HDR space).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe public availability of the DLSS SDK could potentially mean a much broader adoption of NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling technology, even when it comes to unofficial implementations. In fact, programmer and modder DarioSamo, creator of the Super Mario 64 PC port with ray tracing, quickly jumped on the bandwagon to implement DLSS into his project.\n\nAdded DLSS.\n\u2014 Dar\u00edo (@dariosamo) July 19, 2021\n\nLater, he added via Twitter:\nAlright, for real, the feature needs a lot more work on the UI side and tweaks. It'll likely take a few days until I figure out the licensing side and how to integrate it into the open source build tool.\nBut I'm getting results. And they're really good.\nTheir documentation and debugging tools are very good, and sm64rt already had most of the information that DLSS needs. Your mileage may vary on how easy it is depending on your engine.\nGiven how fast AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is gaining support, this is great news for NVIDIA. GeForce RTX owners may soon be able to choose between DLSS and FSR in many, many games and mods.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation Can Be Enabled for The First Berserker: Khazan Demo\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Swapper Gets A Huge Update: FSR 3.1 & XeSS Added Along With Tons of New Options\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA May Aim For Up To 16 Generated Frames With Multi-Frame Generation Tech In Future DLSS Technology\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Boss Doesn\u2019t Rule Out Possible Frame Generation Support for RTX 30 Series\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n120\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n1035\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

While some continued to chug to new all-time highs, others suffered a brutal decline amid a nasty bear market. However, many names have emerged with stronger chart setups as a result.\nMany people only prefer technical analysis or fundamental analysis. However, a blend of the two usually works the best.\nFundamental analysis may struggle with tech stocks when it comes to the valuation. While the valuations can be high, I like to look for high-quality businesses and substitute technical analysis in. A strong business plus strong technicals puts the odds in investors\u2019 favor, even when the valuation can be a bit tough to swallow.\nWith that said, let\u2019s look at seven tech stocks with the best charts. (These seven stocks also happen to be great businesses).\n\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU)\nTwilio (NYSE:TWLO)\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU)\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP)\n\nSome investors think technical analysis is just a bunch of arbitrary lines and meaningless explanations drawn to justify a certain bias. That certainly can be true. When used correctly though, I find that technical analysis is simply a visual representation of supply and demand, as well as sentiment. It\u2019s why I find it so helpful.\n\nTech Stocks With the Best Charts Amazon (AMZN)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nThe chart for Amazon showcases one of the cleanest breakouts I have seen in a while. For those that enjoy reading InvestorPlace\u2019s Top Stock Trades column, you may notice that I have highlighted this name quite a bit in recent weeks.\nThat\u2019s because Amazon has been building out a base for almost a year now. With almost zero urgency, this stock has been trading sideways for nearly 12 months. Despite incredible quarterly reports, news of CEO Jeff Bezos stepping down and lack of a stock split has likely kept this name weighted down.\nUntil now.\nBezos has stepped aside and with a new CEO at the reins, the stock is catching fire. Perhaps it will be a failed breakout but for all intents and purposes, we have to treat this like the real deal.\nOver $3,345 was the start. That set the tone and technically put Amazon over range resistance. However, $3,550 was the really tricky hurdle. The stock had failed at this level twice before.\nBlasting through it now, bulls need to see pullbacks to the 10-week moving average (and the 10-day and 21-day moving averages) act as support. They also need to see dips to the $3,550 level hold as support. This would be quite bullish and set the stock up for more new highs.\nOn the upside, $3,750 is in play at this point, followed by a potentially larger push to the 161.8% retracement just under $4,000.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nCrowdStrike is a company someone recently reached out to me about. They asked if the stock looked good. Well, it looked great if they were already long. Shares had powered through the prior high of $251.28 and had held that mark for several days.\nAnd that was exactly my response. However, I said if someone was looking to buy, they may want to wait for a reset back to the 10-day moving average. It would take about a week, but patient traders got their setup.\nInitially, the 10-day broke as support. But by the close, CRWD had recovered this mark and had closed near that critical $251.28 area with a doji candle.\nNow pushing to all-time highs once again, investors should keep an eye on the $275 to $283 area. Above that opens the door to the $300 mark, although there will likely be dips along the way.\n\nDocuSign (DOCU)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TradingView\nDocuSign was one of the hottest plays due to the novel coronavirus. The thing is, this company had a great business before the pandemic and it should have a great business even as we exit the pandemic.\nShares topped out near $300 in September 2020, before retreating into a channel. Despite months of being channel-locked, DocuSign broke below support in March. This channel support level then became resistance for several months, rejecting each of the stock\u2019s rallies. Once reclaimed, the channel once again acted as support.\nHonestly, DocuSign is a chart to print off if you want a solid look at channels. In any case, this stock has been on fire since bottoming a few months ago. Each dip to the 8-day and 10-day moving averages has ignited an even sharper rally. The latest dip sent the stock to new all-time highs this week.\nShares pulled back to the 10-day moving average and gave us a doji close. Two days later it cleared $290. From here, keep an eye on its short-term moving averages. A break could put the 21-day moving average in play. On the upside, the $300 to $310 area is in focus, along with channel resistance.\nAt some point, this stock will need to consolidate. However, there\u2019s no denying it has one of the strongest charts among tech stocks.\n\nTwilio (TWLO)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nDespite the strength in the overall market, there\u2019s no denying the bear market that hit growth stocks. Amid that decline, I made the case for buying the deep dip in high-quality growth stocks.\nNothing had changed with the businesses. It was simply a volatile change in sentiment that was souring these names. Among those names was Twilio.\nTwilio is an incredibly well-run business that will be successful for years to come. While it was a big beneficiary of the pandemic, its stock did not deserve to fall 40%, in my opinion.\nAfter suffering a peak-to-trough decline of about 40% \u2014 which is the threshold I look for on these kinds of dips \u2014 Twilio had an uphill battle to fight. It had to push through both its short- and long-term moving averages, then push through downtrend resistance (the blue line on the chart).\nSo far, it has done so with impressive strength. Now it\u2019s running into the $400 mark. This level has been a tough spot for the stock all year long. It\u2019s consolidating nicely now and if Twilio can push higher, a retest of the highs near $450 could be on the table. Above that and $500 will quickly come into focus.\nOn the downside, a break of the 10-day moving average could put the 10-day moving average in play, as well as a retest of prior downtrend resistance.\n\nRoku (ROKU)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nLike Twilio, Roku also suffered a tough decline, falling about 44% from the highs. While it has yet to recover to all-time highs, ROKU stock has enjoyed a sharp rally off the lows.\nRoku is now resetting against the 10-day moving average, giving disciplined traders a tempting risk-reward setup. More aggressive traders were buying below $427, while more conservative traders will likely wait for some sort of \u201cproof\u201d from the stock, likely in the form of a rotation.\nMore specifically, a rotation over this week\u2019s high could put the $450 to $460 area on the table. If Roku can clear the recent high (at $462.99), it could put the $480 to $485 zone in play. Above that and $500 is an obvious magnet.\nThis may be one of the strongest tech stocks out there of late. However, given the sharp rally, investors need to be aware of the potential for a dip. A close below the 10-day moving average could usher in a dip down to the 21-day, and possibly a retest of the $370 to $375 zone.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nAre we saving the best for last? It sure seems that way when Nvidia is all the way down here. Like Amazon, Nvidia had been consolidating for quite some time, despite robust earnings results and incredible management. It was only a matter of when Nvidia would break to new highs, not if.\nIn April, shares broke out over $588 range resistance and ran to new all-time highs near $650. It looked like this was the breakout we had been waiting for. But alas, the stock had one last nasty pullback in store as growth stocks endured the final leg down in their bear market.\nAfter Wall Street booed Nvidia\u2019s stellar earnings result, it didn\u2019t take long for shares to explode higher. This is without a doubt the best-looking chart among tech stocks.\nNow up for eight straight weeks, I have no idea when Nvidia will pull back and/or consolidate. The company is sporting a $500-plus billion market capitalization and now running into the 261.8% extensions from its various ranges over the last 12 months.\nWith its stock split later this month, perhaps more gains are possible. Either way, I\u2019m a big buyer of this one on the dips.\n\nShopify (SHOP)\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\nShopify and Nvidia aren\u2019t all that different. They both were weighed down during the growth-stock bear market, but didn\u2019t suffer the same painful fate as many others. Check out the price chart.\nThe $1,000 to $1,050 area was clear resistance in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2020. Then in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, it was clear support. This is what traders should be looking for when trading range-bound stocks.\nIt helps that Shopify also broke out over downtrend resistance (blue line), then saw that level turn to support as well. Tie in both of those areas with the 50-week moving average and voila, we have a trifecta of support near $1,000.\nAnd for those that don\u2019t find technical analysis meaningful at all yet made it to the end of this gallery, you may notice that it\u2019s no coincidence Shopify shares are up 50% from the May lows. If the stock breaks out and continues higher, keep an eye on the $1,750 to $1,800 zone.\nOtherwise, look to buy on the dip.\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NVDA, TWLO and ROKU.

Wilson \u2022\nJul 17, 2021 at 11:32am EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel's Avengers and Necromunda: Hired Gun recently added AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution support (also known as AMD FSR) to their games where NVIDIA's DLSS was already available. This new addition to both titles allows users to be able to choose how the game is graphically processed in relation to their graphics hardware. Based on these two titles, the difference between AMD FSR and DLSS appears to range from \"similar\" to \"visibly worse\".\nTwitter user 4r7hur (@KanaSaber) produced some examples of how both modes as well as the\u00a0 Standard 4K mode appeared in the Avengers video game. AMD FSR is visibly worse than NVIDIA DLSS (which is actually better than native in some cases due to sharper aliasing). NVIDIA DLSS also produced better quality when looking at details such as hair of the characters. @KanaSaber does explain that the mode they are using is not Ultra Quality FSR mode, but the normal FSR Quality mode. It could be speculated that if the Ultra Quality FSR mode was used that it could output a different result that could closely match the DLSS Quality modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAMD also allowed users to be able to alter the source code of the FidelityFX Super Resolution mode by publicly releasing the coding. AMD's move to reaching their audience in such a way to giving access to source code information may increase their competition with NVIDIA's technology.\nRegardless of either NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR modes, it is great for gamers to have more accessibility and compatibility when it comes to next-gen gaming. As this next decade continues, we will definitely see more advancements in technology to enhance user experience, not only in gaming, but in everyday use.\nBack4BuckPC Gamer, a YouTube influencer, showcased Necromunda: Hired Gun's ability to process 4K resolution using both AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS. In the video below, you can see how with a side by side comparison of the two modes is almost indistinguishable at their top formatting priorities.\n\nBack4BuckPC Gamer does note that due to how the graphics were processed by both AMD's and NVIDIA's modes, the AMD FSR did represent a greater quality and ability to produce a greater picture without pushing the hardware as much as NVIDIA DLSS was needing to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nSource: VideoCardz, @KanaSaber,\u00a0Back4BuckPC Gamer\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation Can Be Enabled for The First Berserker: Khazan Demo\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Swapper Gets A Huge Update: FSR 3.1 & XeSS Added Along With Tons of New Options\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s FSR 4 Support To Feature In All Titles Compatible With FSR 3.1; RDNA 4 Limitation Still Applies\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA May Aim For Up To 16 Generated Frames With Multi-Frame Generation Tech In Future DLSS Technology\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n100\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n53\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And yet, even these exclusive graphics cards are still being marketed and sold to crypto miners over regular PC owners.As spotted by VideoCardz, a Vietnamese computing store has been photographed cramming multiple Asus RTX 3080 ROG Strix Gundam cards \u2014 some of the rarest GPUs around \u2014 into mining rig-ready racks.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards are suddenly cheaperInternet world speed record broken in Japan \u2014 now this is fastJust in: Valve's Steam Deck is getting one of the PS5's most exciting featuresThe Asus Gundam series, a crossover with the iconic Japanese sci-fi franchise, only had a limited production run in Asia. The series\u2019 graphics cards are therefore both highly sought-after and extremely expensive, even by the bloated standard of generic GeForce RTX 30-series pricing: prices as high as $3,000 have been listed on eBay.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5090 GPU prices are officially out of control \u2014 now $1,400 over Nvidia's official asking price\n\n\n\n\nLooking for an RTX 5090? Scalpers are happy to sell you one for a shocking price\n\n\n\nYou\u2019d think a combination of vast expense and even greater scarcity than usual would make Asus Gundam cards a less attractive target for miners. But apparently there\u2019s no GPU prestigious enough that it can\u2019t be put to work mining cryptocurrency. Especially not when these particular models launched before Nvidia started adding hash rate limiters to its cards, intentionally crippling mining performance for certain currencies.Asus 3080 and Gundam mining again... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/cXwhzYZjs6July 13, 2021It\u2019s a costly workaround, then, but evidently not an entirely unappealing one. Twitter user I_Leak_VN posted the original photos, showing up to eight RTX 3080 ROG Strix Gundam units squished into a rack. These appear to be designed so that they can slot easily into a pre-existing, large-scale mining operation; you can see the fan mounts for adding ventilation, given the cards themselves will be too close together for their onboard coolers to be effective.Over in China, a government crackdown on crypto mining has been so forceful that miners are selling off their graphics cards at list price or lower. In Vietnam and elsewhere, though, the draw of Ethereum or other crypto riches will likely continue proving strong, making the latest graphics cards even harder to buy for personal use.More: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Super GPUs could power PCs and laptops next yearAnother view:\u00a0Steam Deck is an oddball gaming machine \u2014 and I love it\u00a0Learn how to benchmark your graphics cardToday's best gaming keyboard deals No price informationCheck Amazon No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nJames ArcherSocial Links NavigationJames is currently Hardware Editor at Rock Paper Shotgun, but before that was Audio Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide, where he covered headphones, speakers, soundbars and anything else that intentionally makes noise.

Today's Newegg Shuffle offers the chance to buy everything from an Nvidia RTX 3060 through to RTX 3090. But hurry \u2014 it's taking place on January 19 and you need to register soon.An unlikely source of cheap Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards has emerged: the China-based cryptocurrency miners that bought up so much of the precious GPU stock in the first place.As reported by The Block, an ongoing crackdown against mining farms by the Chinese government has left erstwhile bulk-buyers looking to sell their masses of graphics cards. The GeForce RTX 3060, in particular, is listed on secondhand site Xianyu for as little as 1,760 yuan: about $270.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nFinally! RTX 5090 leak points to 'stupidly high' stock coming next month\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5090 GPU prices are officially out of control \u2014 now $1,400 over Nvidia's official asking price\n\n\n\nThese are the Tom's Guide picks for the best games of 2021 so farSteam Deck pre-orders are already a messJust in: Can\u2019t find graphics card stock? Avoid buying second-hand, warns GPU makerSimilar listings have been popping up for weeks, but only recently have prices dropped this close to the card\u2019s original MSRP. It seems that so many mining operations are shutting up shop that the GPUs\u2019 current owners are competing with each other on the secondhand marketplace, forcing prices down.Since supply shortages have kept current-gen GPU prices high, an issue compounded by intense demand from crypto miners themselves, this could mean big losses for anyone who didn\u2019t already recoup their expenditure though mining. Perhaps let\u2019s all just take a moment to appreciate that irony.Sadly, other than some light schadenfreude, this isn\u2019t the good news for hopeful PC owners that it might seem. Even if you\u2019ve been having trouble finding where to buy the GeForce RTX 3060 and wouldn\u2019t mind importing, a lot of these listings are for bulk purchases as opposed to individual cards. In-person collection is also a common requirement: one ad, according to The Block, demands that buyers pick up their cards \"at power station along the Yarlung Tsangpo river.\u201dThere\u2019s also the matter of whether you\u2019d even truly want a retired crypto mining card as your everyday gaming GPU. A few hours of Cyberpunk 2077 is one thing, but these cards will have been running non-stop, at maximum capacity, for weeks or months on end. Future hardware failures are therefore a lot more likely than if you bought a used graphics card from a fellow PC gamer.Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.That\u2019s not to say that falling interest in cryptocurrency mining won\u2019t have a positive effect on GeForce RTX 3060 stock levels, including close to home. You may just have to keep being patient, until you can have a better chance at catching a restock.More: Here's what you need to know about Tom Clancy's XDefiantDiscover how to benchmark your graphics cardToday's best gaming keyboard deals No price informationCheck Amazon No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nJames ArcherSocial Links NavigationJames is currently Hardware Editor at Rock Paper Shotgun, but before that was Audio Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide, where he covered headphones, speakers, soundbars and anything else that intentionally makes noise.

Too bad most devices won't get it.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCord-Cutter Confidential\t\t\n\n\n By Jared Newman,   Jul 1, 2021 3:00 am PDT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Jared Newman / IDG \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter years of waiting, I\u2019ve landed on the the ideal menu system for streaming, one that helps you find new things to watch without overcomplicating the basic task of launching apps. And it\u2019s landed in the unlikeliest of places: the Nvidia Shield TV, a $150-and-up streaming player that runs on Google\u2019s Android TV platform and mainly appeals to tech enthusiasts.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nNvidia Shield TV (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$149.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the Shield TV received a new interface that makes all your streaming apps much easier to access, while also adding helpful recommendations on what to watch. It\u2019s smarter than other streaming platforms like Roku and Fire TV, and it has some big advantages over the similar looking\u2014but in many ways different\u2014interface on the Chromecast with Google TV.\n\nNow for the bad news: I\u2019m not sure Google is even aware of its own accomplishment. While Google has made the new interface available on the Shield TV and some other existing Android TV devices, it\u2019s pushing the separate Google TV interface on newer streaming players and smart TVs. That means the Shield\u2019s menu system is unlikely to appear on any new products going forward.\n[ Further reading: The best media streaming devices ]\nApps and content combined\nThe old Shield TV interface consisted of a single home screen, with a row of your favorite apps at the top and several rows of \u201cchannels\u201d underneath. Each of those rows represented a different app, which could highlight recommendations or recently watched videos, and users could hide or reposition those rows as they pleased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nApple TV 4K (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nNot Available at Best Buy \n\n\n\n\n\nThat basic concept hasn\u2019t gone away, and it\u2019s still a nice way to glance at some top picks from your favorite apps, but now Google has added a couple new tabs to the Home Screen as well.\u00a0The \u201cApps\u201d tab provides a big grid for all the apps you\u2019ve installed, replacing the old system of having to scroll and click on a little red \u201capps\u201d icon. (Under that system, your apps also appeared in a narrow overlay that was harder to navigate.)\n Jared Newman / IDG\n\nThe Apps tab lets you see all installed apps without any hidden menus or clumsy remote control shortcuts.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cDiscover\u201d tab suggests even more movies and shows to watch, grouped by categories such as \u201cComedies,\u201d \u201cOscar-winning movies,\u201d and \u201cTrending on Google.\u201d These recommendations come from across different apps, including Disney+, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and HBO Max, so you don\u2019t have to jump into each one to see what\u2019s on.\n Jared Newman / IDG\n\nThe Discover menu lets you browse streaming service catalogs in one place.\n\n\nTo me, this one-two punch represents the platonic ideal for how streaming menus should work: Make it easy to get recommendations, but not at the expense of a simple and easily accessible app launcher.\nOther streaming platforms haven\u2019t quite figured that out yet.\n\nThe Apple TV 4K comes close. Its \u201cTV\u201d guide app is a helpful way to see what\u2019s streaming, and from there you can click the home button for your full app list. Still, I find that double-click mechanism to be too clumsy, and while you can always reassign the remote\u2019s home button to go straight to your app list, that in turn makes the TV app harder to reach. Apple really ought to streamline this all into one menu, like Google is doing.\nAmazon\u2019s Fire TV devices, meanwhile, stray a bit further from the mark. The Fire TV\u2019s newly updated interface only lets you pin six favorite apps to the Home Screen, with the rest hiding behind a secondary menu. Underneath, you\u2019ll find row after row of recommendations with no real sense of organization. While Amazon still has some smart ideas\u2014like the ability to filter shows from your subscriptions\u2014the whole system still feels too chaotic on the whole.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRoku Express 4K+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$24.99 at  Best Buy  | \n$29.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nAs for Roku, its home screen makes no attempt to serve up recommendations outside of its \u201cFeatured Free\u201d section, which only covers ad-supported streaming services. Roku\u2019s focus on the app grid is part of what makes it so simple to use, but it\u2019s a little too simple for my liking. The Shield TV\u2019s interface offers the best of both worlds.\nNow, I should note that not everyone\u2019s thrilled with the new Shield TV interface. As 9to5Google reports, some users are incensed by the new promotional carousel at the top of the screen, likening it to a form of intrusive advertising and even review-bombing the home screen\u2019s Google Play Store listing in protest.\n\nI\u2019m not too bothered by it myself. The carousel doesn\u2019t really impede navigation like the mid-menu ads on Fire TV, and it doesn\u2019t reduce the available screen space for apps, like the banner ads on Roku players. If anything, the large teaser art gives the Shield TV\u2019s Home Screen a more modern look, in line with other streaming platforms and apps.\nAndroid TV vs. Google TV\nSadly, there\u2019s a strong chance you\u2019ll never get to use this new menu system, because it\u2019s only available on the Shield TV and a small number of other devices, such as smart televisions running Google\u2019s Android TV operating system.\nFor new Android TV devices, Google has indicated that it\u2019s pushing a different interface that it calls \u201cGoogle TV,\u201d as seen on the Chromecast with Google TV streaming dongle. While the underlying operating system is the same, the menu system has some key differences.\n Jared Newman / IDG\n\nThe separate Google TV interface, as seen on the new Chromecast, has some unique features like Watchlist support.\n\n\nAccessing your master app list, for instance, is more of an ordeal on Google TV. To reach it, you must scroll all the way to the end of your favorite apps row, then select \u201cSee All\u201d to bring up a separate menu. Google TV also puts it recommendations front-and-center on your home screen, omitting Android TV\u2019s channel row concept entirely. That means you can\u2019t get any original content recommendations from Netflix or any other app that isn\u2019t fully integrated with the new Google TV system.\n\nThe Google TV interface does have its own advantages. It lets you\u00a0save movies and shows to a watchlist from any device, for instance, and it has a \u201cLive\u201d menu that lets you browse the channel guides of either YouTube TV or Sling TV straight from the home screen.\nAnd yet, I prefer the Shield TV interface for the way it\u00a0executes on the basics. It still provides recommendations from across different apps, but it makes those individual apps easier to reach when you already know what you want. Other streaming platforms should take note of how well it works. And, perhaps, so should Google.\nSign up for Jared\u2019s\u00a0Cord Cutter Weekly newsletter\u00a0to get this column and other cord-cutting news, insights, and deals delivered to your inbox.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tTechHive helps you find your tech sweet spot.

Best Buy has been one of the best bets to find a card in the US at a reasonable price, and tomorrow they'll offer visitors to selected physical stores the chance to buy a single graphics card - without worrying about bots, scalpers and - hopefully! - price inflation. Here are all the details you need to know to get your hands on one of the best graphics cards.\n\nFirst up: the timing. Best Buy employees will start handing out tickets to those waiting in line, one per person, starting at 7:30 AM local time tomorrow, which is Tuesday (July 20th, 2021). Tickets guarantee you the opportunity to buy a single graphics card from the available supply at that location, which should hopefully allow gamers in need to get a GPU without scalpers buying dozens to sell online later. \n102 locations in all are taking part, from coast to cost, but I note that not all states or regions are covered - my home town of Santa Fe, New Mexico isn't listed, nor is the larger Albuquerque, making the nearest locations likely to be Colorado Springs about five hours' drive away. Best Buy's blog post has the full list of locations, as well as notes on safety and so on.\nIf your nearest store isn't on the list or you just don't fancy making the trek to a bricks and mortar location, don't worry - graphics card supply is still slowly improving and we hope to see cards continue to come down in price over the following weeks and months. We've rounded up all the best places to look for stock in dedicated articles for each card, which also share details like the RRP, performance figures and links to our full review. Here are those links for your convenience:\n\nWhere to buy RTX 3090\nWhere to buy RTX 3080 Ti\nWhere to buy RTX 3080\nWhere to buy RTX 3070 Ti\nWhere to buy RTX 3070\nWhere to buy RTX 3060 Ti\nWhere to buy RTX 3060\n\nIn general, the higher numbered cards are more powerful but more expensive, with the \"sweet spot\" for 1080p gaming sitting around the RTX 3060 Ti, 1440p gaming around the RTX 3070 and 4K gaming at the 3080. The two new Ti models, the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti, are only good value compared to the Titan-grade RTX 3090 at the very top of the stack - but a card you can buy at MSRP is better than an ostensibly \"better value\" card that you're paying over the odds for! \n\n\n\nThe PC Gaming Weekspot: Control Co-op!

(\ud83d\udcf7: NVIDIA)\"With the new NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial module, NVIDIA is making it possible to deploy AI at the edge in harsh environments where safety and reliability are critical priorities.\"Designed to sit in the Jetson lineup alongside the existing Jetson AGX Xavier module, the industrial variant is designed to be considerably more rugged. NVIDIA has rated the part as operational between -40\u00b0C and 85\u00b0C (-40\u00b0F to 185\u00b0F), surviving vibrational forces of 10-500Hz at 5G and shocks of up to 50G for 11ms \u2014 and more, while non-operational. Better still, it can do all this over a claimed 10-year operating lifespan.It's not just the module itself that's more robust: NVIDIA has added what it describes as a \"safety cluster engine,\" a pair of Arm Cortex-R5 real-time processing cores  operating in lockstep. \"The Cortex-R5,\" Mullins explains, \"which is in an always-on domain, can be used for safety and error correction functions.\"The company is promising a 10-year operational lifespan, even in extreme conditions. (\ud83d\udcf7: NVIDIA)Elsewhere, the module shares its specifications with the non-industrial variant \u2014 including a 512-core NVIDIA Volta GPU with 64 Tensor Cores, two NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) coprocessors, two vision accelerators, and an eight-core NVIDIA Carmel Arm-based CPU. The memory, meanwhile, includes error-correcting code (ECC) support on both the system RAM and the video memory.\"Built with components tested to demanding industrial standards and including new functional safety capabilities,\" claims Mullins, \"it\u2019s able to withstand severe shock and vibration and extreme temperature ranges. And it\u2019s pin-, software- and form-factor compatible with the existing Jetson AGX Xavier module, so upgrading is easy.\"The NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Industrial module will begin shipping in July, with pricing set at $1,449 \u2014 a hefty increase over the non-industrial variant's $999.internet of thingsindustrial automationindustrial iotartificial intelligencemachine learningGareth HalfacreeFollowFreelance journalist, technical author, hacker, tinkerer, erstwhile sysadmin.

The company showed off game demos using an ARM CPU paired with an RTX 3060 graphics card. This confirms the company\u2019s announcement in April about RTX inside Chromebooks.  While Nvidia RTX graphics Chromebooks sound like potentially great news for Chromebooks, and it is, there\u2019s quite a bit to keep in mind.\n\n\n\nFirst, Nvidia is showing this off as a developer preview. This means it\u2019s highly unlikely to arrive in any Chromebooks soon. And by soon, I mean within the next two or three years. I\u2019m not saying that because developer previews mean that. I\u2019m saying that because of my next point.\nSecond, you have to realize the preview was done with the next generation of MediaTek ARM processors. Yes, I\u2019m talking about the MT8192 and MT8195 that will supplant the MT8183 that\u2019s inside current Chromebooks. We\u2019re all looking forward to Chrome OS devices with these and I expect we see some within the next 6 to 12 months. I\u2019d say sooner but the silicon shortage is also a likely delay factor.\n\nBut those MediaTek chips inside a Chromebook alone won\u2019t simply have Nvidia RTX graphics capabilities. Nvidia will have to provide that part of the equation. And frankly, most of those chips will be in gaming laptops running Windows. There\u2019s simply far more demand for the limited supply in that market.\nLastly, and possibly the key point here to understand: You\u2019ll be paying more for Nvidia RTX graphics Chromebooks. Like\u2026 a lot more. I could easily see the price premium be $400 to $600 more for a Chromebook with this hardware capability. Even at the low end, that\u2019s more than many Chromebooks cost today alone. You\u2019ll pay in battery life too. Oh, and you want a fanless Chromebook? Not with one of these graphics cards inside.\nSo we\u2019re talking about a limited market with limited supply and higher-priced devices as a result.\nThat doesn\u2019t even take into account the fact that until there\u2019s a localized way of running PC games in Chrome OS, this functionality is sort of pointless. Yes, we keep hearing that Steam is coming to Chrome OS and I\u2019m sure that will happen. But it\u2019s not here yet.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed II on a Chromebook, anyone?\nFor at least the next year, if not two, most PC gaming on Chromebooks will be done online via Google Stadia or Nvidia\u2019s own GeForce Now, which is what I use. Heck, I was just playing Divinity: Original Sin on my Chromebook over the weekend with GeForce Now. And I\u2019ll still be playing it ** a year from now the same way.\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me: Ultimately, this is great news for the Chromebook crowd. Or at least for the Chromebook crowd that wants to play PC games. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. \nI\u2019d expect we see an ARM-based handheld gaming console with this capability before we see it in Chromebooks. So don\u2019t sell that gaming PC or cancel that cloud gaming service just yet.\n** It\u2019s a long game and I\u2019m a terrible gamer.\n\n\nChromebooks Gaming MediaTek Nvidia Nvidia GeForce NOW Nvidia RTX GeForce Chromebook PC gaming\n\n\nShare.\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Tofel\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nAfter spending 15 years in IT at Fortune 100 companies, Kevin turned a hobby into a career and began covering mobile technology in 2003. He writes daily on the industry and has co-hosted the weekly MobileTechRoundup podcast since 2006. His writing has appeared in print (The New York Times, PC Magazine and PC World) and he has been featured on NBC News in Philadelphia.\n\n \n\n\n\n2 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJames on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nJuly 19, 2021 1:47 pm\n\n \n\nQuite a few GOG games work on Chrome OS Linux straight out the box.\nYeah Steam is coming, they know Cloud streaming will take off on Chromebooks if they don\u2019t. If Steam has to go cloud and subscription itself then it will be a massive opportunity for indie companies and big companies to fight it\u2019s PC gaming monopoly. So they really know they need to modernise i.e remove Windows monopoly from gaming and present the future of gaming before it is presented on them by others.\nYeah I prefer cloud streaming to release me from having to buy high end hardware and overall it\u2019s probably better for the environment for the bulk of Hardware to be maintained by big firms. They will just be more efficient with it\u2019s use than average users.\nBut if this comes true and shuts up Windows gamers moaning about Chromebooks then I\u2019m not against it, lol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWilliam Reed on \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMarch 2, 2022 10:50 am\n\n \n\nI was playing steam windows pc games on my acer chromebook just last week. As far as I can tell steam is already avaliable for chromebook if using steam link and steam cloud. I do know just last week I played god of war that was just released for pc on my acer chromebook and intend to explore more of what this chromebook will achive. I would 10 to 1 rather put my trust into chrome anyday as windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvcruntime140.dll Not Found Issue\u00a0March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Best Free Movie Sites On Chromebook In 2025March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Games To Play On Chromebook \u2013 No Download RequiredMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Safe Are Chromebooks for Online PaymentsMarch 14, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Flash Player Plugin For ChromeMarch 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nWrite For Us\nNewsletter\nContact\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2025 About Chrome Books.

However, this report was quote-tweeted by noted leaker kopite7kimi, who claimed the GeForce RTX 3080 Super and the GeForce RTX 3070 Super won\u2019t just be coming to laptops.Find where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 TiCheck out the best PC games right nowPlus: Valve Steam Deck release date, price, specs and how to preorderOf course, none of this is even close to being officially confirmed, though kopite7kimi is one of the more reliable high-profile leakers out there; back in February they correctly tipped off that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti was incoming and had dropped from 20GB or 12GB of video memory. As such, this rumor may be worth paying attention to.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNew Nvidia RTX 5080 rumor suggests late January launch \u2014 here\u2019s what we know\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5060 Ti may come in two variants \u2014 one with 16GB VRAM\n\n\n\nNvidia introduced \u201cSuper\u201d branding on the previous generation\u2019s GeForce RTX 20-series graphics cards, with models like the GeForce RTX 2080 Super and GeForce RTX 2070 Super that offered modest performance improvements over their non-Super equivalents without drastically changing the underlying tech. The GeForce RTX 30-series has been wrought with stock shortage problems since launch, but instead of focusing on its next-gen cards Nvidia could feasibly repeat the introduction of more powerful Super models.not only laptops https://t.co/eGSv8R89wPJuly 14, 2021VideoCardz\u2019s report suggested that both the GeForce RTX 3080 Super and the GeForce RTX 3070 Super, or at least the supposed mobile versions, could potentially use a new Nvidia GA103 graphics processor. Both will allegedly stick with the GDDR6 VRAM amounts of the existing, non-Super cards: 8GB for the GeForce RTX 3070 Super and 16GB for the GeForce RTX 3080 Super.If there really are desktop versions coming too, they might pose quite the conundrum for anyone who\u2019s still waiting to find GeForce RTX 3080 stock. Especially if, as many PC owners are, they\u2019re already on a waiting list for one of the current cards: should you stay the course and hold out for the original purchase, or cancel the order and bank on being able to grab one of the newer, more powerful Super GPUs?It would be a tough dilemma if stock shortages are still plaguing the PC hardware market in a few months\u2019 time. It\u2019s hard to say if it will, as there are signs pointing in opposite ways: in China, some former cryptocurrency miners are selling their graphics cards at MSRP or below, while in Vietnam one retailer has been selling extremely rare, limited edition GPUs as ready-made mining setups.Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.More: Valve Steam Deck vs Nintendo Switch OLED: How they compareHow to update Nvidia driversToday's best Gaming Monitors deals1 Amazon customer review\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $91.77View $116.99View $129.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nJames ArcherSocial Links NavigationJames is currently Hardware Editor at Rock Paper Shotgun, but before that was Audio Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide, where he covered headphones, speakers, soundbars and anything else that intentionally makes noise.

Where once you had to apply to use Nvidia's funky machine learning game enhancer, now it's just a simple download.That means, theoretically, it should be easier than ever for game developers to start implementing DLSS into their games. We've seen how good it looks in Red Dead Redemption 2, among plenty of others now. Now there's no excuse not to squeeze in some performance boosting AI goodness into your next title.\u00a0There are three options for aspiring DLSS devs: either grab the full DLSS SDK 2.2.1 download from Nvidia itself, snag the Unreal Engine 5 and 4.26 plugins from the marketplace, or use it natively in the Unity 2021.2 beta.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, says it can help multiply frame rates by 'up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering'\n\n\n\n\nNew modder tool makes it easier than ever to swap AMD's FSR 4 scaling for Nvidia's DLSS or Intel's XeSS and vice versa\n\n\n\nDLSS is probably the most important feature Nvidia has produced in recent times. It uses advanced machine learning to understand what a game should look like in high fidelity, and then uses your GPU's AI chops to reconstruct a lower resolution input into a great-looking experience with higher frame rates than at a native res.It's worth noting that while DLSS was initially tied into Nvidia's push for real-time ray tracing in games, as the feature which made the punitive performance hit palatable, we're increasingly seeing it used completely independently in games just to increase frame rates on its own.AMD has its own spatial upscaling and sharpening tool, called FidelityFX Super Resolution, which offers a modicum of the benefits of DLSS, but on a platform agnostic basis. Nvidia's feature is just for Nvidia cards, because of capitalism, and because it does now use those silicon-based Tensor cores in its GPUs.Nvidia has also this week shown RTX features, including DLSS and ray tracing, running on an Arm CPU system with a GeForce GPUs.

There will now be a sharpening slider optionally available for developers to drop into their games, which will allow the end user to make images softer or sharper depending on their preference. DLSS is also getting a new Auto mode, which will pick an optimal DLSS setting based on the preferred resolution. That means for 1440p and under you get set to 'Quality', at 4K you're set at 'Performance', and at 8K you're given 'Ultra Performance.'\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

Neither technology will be the best in all those categories. But in the area that perhaps matters the most - the balance of visual quality and performance - generally speaking DLSS 2.0 is better, though to the degree it's better varies significantly depending on the game and playing conditions. \nWe've covered DLSS in-depth a few times as it's progressed and improved, and we recently took an early look at FSR, so without rehashing much about how they work, you should know these are two fundamentally different technologies attempting to achieve the same outcome: improve performance without a significant loss to visual quality.\nAMD's FSR is the more simple technique. It's a spatial upscaling technology that combines edge detection upscaling with a sharpening pass. Nvidia's DLSS on the other hand is more complex, incorporating temporal data including prior frames and motion vectors, and uses an AI network to assist with the image reconstruction process. Both require games-specific integration, ideally before final post-processing and UI effects are added, and both feature several modes in their standard configuration.\nThere are several games now supporting both techniques, and the two we're focusing on in this video are Marvel's Avengers and Necromunda Hired Gun. Avengers is developed by Crystal Dynamics and uses their in house Foundation Engine, similar to the prior Tomb Raider games they have worked on. Meanwhile, Necromunda is a game from Streum On Studio set in the Warhammer 40K universe that uses Unreal Engine 4. The integration of FSR in Avengers came as a bit of a surprise as it wasn't a title AMD listed in their launch presentation.\nBoth titles use the first iteration of FSR which AMD are calling FSR 1.0, and they are making it pretty clear in their documentation that they'd like people to use \"FSR 1.0\" branding in their games. Meanwhile, both of these titles use a variant of DLSS 2.0.\nThis is the kind of test that has both a performance and image quality components, so check out the video above for all those. We're mostly interested in which modes of DLSS and FSR perform the same, rather than comparing both at the same base render resolution, which is not that relevant for real world usage outside of \"for science\" investigations. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n PlayStation 5 Pro upscaling tech will move closer to AMD's FSR 4 in 2026 \n\n\n\n AMD FSR 4 is Very Impressive: 1440p Upscaling Tested \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 54 comments\n \n710 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

All of them are already using Nvidia DGX systems - a requirement to take part.\u201cCambridge-1 will empower world-leading researchers in business and academia with the ability to perform their life\u2019s work on the UK\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, unlocking clues to disease and treatments at a scale and speed previously impossible in the UK,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.\"The discoveries developed on Cambridge-1 will take shape in the UK, but the impact will be global, driving groundbreaking research that has the potential to benefit millions around the world.\u201dThe system was developed nominally to help the healthcare sector and Nvidia's efforts to build AI tools for the lucrative industry. But it was also funded as part of its effort to convince the UK to approve its $40bn acquisition of Cambridge-based chip designer Arm.At one point, Nvidia had hoped to get Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock, to its opening ceremony, but both ultimately fell through.Earlier this year, we spoke to Nvidia's VP of solutions architecture and engineering Marc Hamilton about the new supercomputer.\"We've got a lot of supercomputers in California and most of our researchers are in California,\" Hamilton said. \"[We decided] why don't we build our supercomputer somewhere where we have a concentration of Nvidia employees - current or future - and customers?\"\n\n\n\n Get a weekly roundup of EMEA news, direct to your inbox.\n\n\n Thank you for subscribing to our EMEA newsletter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08 Jan 2021\n\n\n\n\nUK regulators to review Nvidia's Arm acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 Jun 2021\n\n\n\n\nNvidia ups investment pledge in UK supercomputer to $100m as Arm acquisition faces regulators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 Jun 2021\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm says it could buy stake in Arm if Nvidia sale was blocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nKao Data\n\n\nCambridge-1\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Making technology comprehensible and relevant.for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorJul 19, 2021, 05:55pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution delivers faster frame rates at comparable image qualityAMD\nAMD recently introduced its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology. This comes on the heels of the release of its RDNA 2 GPU architecture. AMD added support for ray tracing in RDNA 2, but one of the side effects of the ray tracing is a significant slowdown in pixel processing (I\u2019ve seen up to four times slower with ray tracing enabled). With FSR, AMD introduced a better spatial image upscaler. Spatial image processing techniques use neighboring pixels from the original rendering to estimate the interpolated pixels for the higher resolution image sent to the display, it does not use motion vectors or data from previous frames. In addition to using this technique to compensate for ray tracing slowdowns, it can also be used to enhance the image quality and improve framerates for slower graphics cards. Technology like this that can extend the life of a GPU is especially important during GPU shortages. It\u2019s also helpful to increase framerates when running ray-tracing graphics.\n\n\nNvidia delt with a similar problem when it introduced ray tracing in its RTX graphics cards back in 2018. Ray tracing improves the realism of images, but the extra processing burden slows down frame rates. Nvidia solved the slowdown problem in 2019 by rendering a lower resolution image and then reconstructing the higher resolution image for display using its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. Nvidia introduced Tensor Cores in their Turing architecture, which taps into the power of a deep learning neural network for DLSS to boost frame rates and generate sharp images. When ray tracing and DLSS are combined, the RTX cards can render ray-traced enabled games with roughly the same frame rates but with enhanced visual quality. Nvidia\u2019s DLSS uses temporal information (information from previous frames and motion vectors) along with machine learning to recreate extra pixels. Nvidia trains a neural net using a generalized AI network offline via a supercomputer on game content and the games get accelerated by the Tensor Cores on the RTX GPUs to generate and reconstruct native quality image in real time.\n\nImage Upscaling with Super Resolution \n\nThe term \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d has been used to describe many different upscaling technologies and each company has a different take on it. The origins of super resolution included analog techniques such as noise reduction and spatial-frequency filtering to increase the resolution of images. Adobe uses super resolution to refer to the process of improving the quality of a photo by boosting its apparent resolution using machine learning techniques. In Photoshop and Lightroom super resolution can increase image detail and size up to four times the original image while maintaining sharp edges and image detail. There\u2019s research into a number of machine -learning techniques to upscale including denoising diffusion probabilistic models.\n\n\nThere are both single-frame and multiple-frame variants of super resolution. AMD\u2019s FSR uses a single frame (spatial) from low resolution render input and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS uses multi-frame temporal upscaling with pixel reconstruction supported by neural networks, multiple input sources, and an AI model to reconstruct the image.\nHow FSR and DLSS are different \nAMD\u2019s FSR uses what the company calls \u201da cutting-edge algorithm\u201d to detect and recreate high-resolution edges from the lower-resolution source image and does not use temporal information. Producing high-resolution edges are a critical element for making the lower resolution frame to appear as a \u201csuper resolution\u201d image. From AMD\u2019s website, FSR first performs \u201cAn upscaling pass called EASU (Edge-Adaptive Spatial Upsampling) that also performs edge reconstruction. In this pass the input frame is analyzed and the main part of the algorithm detects gradient reversals \u2013 essentially looking at how neighboring gradients differ \u2013 from a set of input pixels. The intensity of the gradient reversals defines the weights to apply to the reconstructed pixels at display resolution.\u201d A second sharpening pass called \u201cRCAS\u201d (Robust Contrast-Adaptive Sharpening) then extracts more pixel detail in the upscaled image. RCAS appears to fine-tune the image for shaper edges and extracts pixel details by adjusting pixel colors based on localized contrast.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nAMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Image PipelineAMD\n\nFSR provides a better image quality than traditional anti-aliasing techniques, but it does require integration into the rendering pipeline. Adding FSR to the rendering pipeline is reasonably straight forward process and AMD has made the technique available in its GPUOpen initiative. Also, FSR can be used on many different GPUs, including Nvidia GPUs, and can be used in Microsoft and Sony game consoles. AMD\u2019s goal was to release it as an open-source upscaling technique that didn\u2019t require specialized hardware. FSR has four settings up to UltraQuality which can be largely indistinguishable from native resolution.\n\n\nNvidia would point out that the lack of motion vectors for FSR can create visual artifacts with objects in motion, as they cannot be tracked from frame to frame without them. And a lack of temporal data means that FSR cannot look forward or backward in frames to resolve images and this can result in missing parts for the image or incorrect images altogether.\nDLSS is a more advanced image reconstruction algorithm using AI rendering technology to reconstruct native quality images while rendering only one quarter to one half the pixels. There is a generalized offline model that is generated on a supercomputer and a real-time component that executes during game play. The DLSS implementation has improved greatly since its initial release with the Turing architecture GPUs.\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/\nFrom NVIDIA\u2019s developer website: \u201cA special type of AI network, called a convolutional autoencoder, takes the low resolution current frame, motion vectors, and the high resolution previous frame, to determine on a pixel-by-pixel basis how to generate a higher resolution current frame. By looking at motion vectors and the prior high resolution output, DLSS can track objects from frame to frame, delivering stability in motion, and reducing flickering and popping artifacts. This process is known as \u2018temporal feedback,\u2019 as it uses history to inform the future. With access to prior frames and motion vectors, DLSS can track each pixel, and take multiple samples of the same pixel across frames (known as temporal supersampling), delivering better detail and edge quality than traditional upscaling by training against a large dataset of 16K-resolution images, the DLSS algorithm learns to predict high resolution frames with greater accuracy. And through continual training on NVIDIA\u2019s supercomputers, DLSS can learn how to deal with new classes of content \u2014 from fire to smoke to particle effects \u2014 at a rate that engineers hand-coding non-AI algorithms simply could not keep up with.\u201dBuilding a neural net model for Nvidia's DLSS.Nvidia\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/june-2021-rtx-dlss-game-update/\nWhile a simple scalar like AMD\u2019s FSR is a simple task for game developers to implement, and not as deep an integration as DLSS, it should not be overlooked that NVIDIA DLSS is already integrated in Unreal Engine 4 and 5 as a plugin and is now natively integrated into Unity 2021.2. It is also supported by many major private game engines. With these engine-level integrations, adding DLSS to a game is fast and easy.\nNVIDIA DLSS is now offered on over 60 titles, as well as a general plugin for all developers for Unreal Engine 4, Unreal Engine 5, and Unity 2021.2, as well as numerous first-party engines. FSR is offered in 12 games at the time of this writing and is available as a feature patch you can apply for Unreal Engine 4.26 and is available now in a special preview beta branch of Unity 2021.2 HDRP. Still, Nvidia has a two-year lead on AMD in bringing super resolution to games and major engine support. DLSS is now available in a number of popular gaming franchises such as Battlefield, Call of Duty, Cyberpunk, Death Stranding, Doom, Final Fantasy, Fortnite, LEGO, Minecraft, Rainbow Six, Red Dead Redemption, Rust, Tomb Raider, Watch Dogs, Wolfenstein and many more. Nvidia has also just announced support for Linux and for Arm processors.\nIn general, both FSR and DLSS both provide the largest benefit for higher screen resolutions, especially with 4K (3840x2160) target displays. However, DLSS potentially offers image quality comparable to native image quality at all resolutions, including 1080p.\nKey Takeaways \nNvidia and AMD have approached the super resolution challenge with different techniques. Each has benefits, but each has limitations. DLSS only runs effectively on Nvidia RTX graphics cards, and NVIDIA\u2019s approach uses more advanced graphics techniques like motion vectors and temporal data, resulting in higher image quality. Nvidia also has a two-year lead on AMD in bringing super resolution to games.\nAMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution runs on most recent graphics cards, including Nvidia cards and even Sony and Microsoft game consoles. FRS was released to developers through the GPUOpen project. AMD doesn\u2019t have neural processors in RDNA 2, so a neural net approach doesn\u2019t work for it. Instead, AMD has built a two-pass spatial approach that uses standard API to run on any hardware. It also trails Nvidia on supported game titles but may be able to catch up over time.\nAt present there\u2019s no mainstream game that has both technologies to allow a direct visual comparison, but each has a different objective and a different application, so a direct comparison is not really all that relevant. Nvidia is already on its second generation of DLSS and this is just version 1.0 of FSR. Because AMD open sourced FSR, there could be future improvements, like temporal techniques, made by either AMD or game developers. What technique is available for you to use is largely out of your control \u2013 it will depend on the game and your graphics card. But there is a choice now even if you don\u2019t have an Nvidia GeForce RTX card. And if you are the owner of a GeForce RTX graphics card, you have the option of either technique!\nTirias Research tracks and consults for companies throughout the electronics ecosystem from semiconductors to systems and sensors to the cloud.

While Red Dead Redemption 2 lacks the new lighting technique, that doesn't mean that Rockstar won't be using it in the future.\nGrand Theft Auto 5's own next-gen upgrade is launching in November so perhaps we'll see DLSS and ray tracing used in conjunction with one another to bring those towering glass-clad skyscrapers to life like never before. Otherwise, it could be that it's the elusive GTA6 that sees this tech utilized, whenever that may release.\nYou can currently play Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, with backward compatibility supported on PS5 and Xbox Series.\nSource: Tom Warren\nNext: E3 2021 Megaguide: Where To Watch, What To Expect, And More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive-Service Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriple-A Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMonopoly Go: Free Dice Rolls\n\t\t\n\n\nMonopoly Go\n\nIf you don't want to dish out the big bucks for those Monopoly Go! dice, we've got some you can have for free!\n\n\nPosts\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRoblox: Dead Rails - How To Get Bonds\n\t\t\n\n\nLive-Service Games\n\nBonds is the main currency in-game in Roblox: Dead Rails.

According to the company, integrating the AI-based technology into Enscape 3.1 means users can get better quality and performance with lower system requirements to create a more realistic experience during walkthroughs and in VR.\nAn Nvidia RTX graphics card, such as the Nvidia RTX A4000 or A5000 (which we review here) or the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, is required.\nNvidia DLSS works by rendering \u00a0internally inside Enscape 3.1 at a lower resolution then using deep learning-based upscaling techniques to output \u2018a clean and sharp high-resolution image\u2019 for high- quality videos and high-performance virtual reality walkthroughs.\nAccording to Dan Stine, director of design technology at Lake | Flato architects in San Antonio, Texas, Enscape 3.1 users with Nvidia RTX graphics cards can experience up to 30% more 3D performance on 1080p displays and up to 9x faster 3D performance on 8k displays. With VR head-mounted displays performance can go from 60 Frames Per Second (FPS) without DLSS to 100 FPS with DLSS. Video export will also be 36% faster.\n\nIn this blog post Stine explains that there are also visual quality benefits thanks to DLSS hardware-accelerated upscaling and anti-aliasing techniques. In a fast-moving scene, users can see enhanced definition in dense leaves in trees, and there is less noise and artifacts, such as ghosting around elements when moving quickly.\nEnscape 3.1 also supports the ray tracing of shadows to improve their visual quality and definition. The feature is only available when rendering a still image or a panorama. Ray-traced shadows will also be shown in the rest mode to allow previewing of a rendering.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nEnscape\u2019s AEC-focused real-time 3D rendering and VR solution works with a range of 3D CAD and BIM tools, including Autodesk Revit, SketchUp, Rhinoceros, ArchiCAD, and Vectorworks.\nEnscape 3.1 is scheduled to be released on 21 July 2021.\nMeanwhile, read our review of Enscape 3.0.\nRelated articles:Solibri signs long term deals with major AEC firmsVideo: NXT BLD 2018 London conference -  Hedwig Heinsman, DUS architects / AectualNEWS: Revizto gives away its core visual collaboration toolsRevit: Shared ParametersNEWS: Takenaka adopts Graphisoft BIMxFaro launches reality capture and collaboration platformKenesto launches beta PDF capabilityNEWS: Autodesk releases Revit 2015 R2 featuring Site Designer Extension\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Even comparing an optimized Open result to the standardized Closed division NVIDIA result, Graphcore\u2019s IPU-POD16 is slowed than NVIDIA. Where it is showing benefit and focuses on in its blog, is price. To understand what is going on here, one needs to get into pricing and how the NVIDIA A100 is sold.\nUnlike when we did the\u00a0How to Install NVIDIA Tesla SXM2 GPUs in DeepLearning12 during the NVIDIA Tesla P100 era, NVIDIA now sells GPUs as part of three primary assemblies: PCIe, Redstone, and Delta.\nThe first and easiest to understand is in PCIe form factors. Here is a shot from our\u00a0ASUS RS720A-E11-RS24U review. We will also have these in the GPU accelerated Dell EMC PowerEdge R750xa review that will likely go live in July. This form factor is perhaps the most familiar to folks.\nASUS RS720A E11 RS24U 4x NVIDIA A100 Stack 3\nAs a quick note, depending on the system, the NVIDIA A100 PCIe cards can utilize NVLINK bridges. That depends on the system layout, but there is a GPU-to-GPU communication path without going over PCIe available even with the A100 PCIe cards. Some in the market assume that the NVIDIA A100 PCIe can only utilize PCIe for GPU-to-GPU communication but that is not entirely true.\n2x NVIDIA A100 PCIe With NVLink Bridges Installed\nThe second way that the NVIDIA A100 is sold these days is in what is codenamed the \u201cRedstone\u201d platform or the HGX A100 4 GPU. This places four NVIDIA A100 GPUs on a PCB with direct NVLink between them and then is sold as a HGX platform for OEMs to integrate.\nSupermicro HGX A100 4x GPU Board Redstone Example\nAbove is a Supermicro rendering, but one can see these below in an image for the upcoming Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 review. The key change with Redstone is that NVIDIA is selling the four GPU solutions pre-assembled. If you saw our video on installing SXM2 GPUs you will see how delicate they are. One major OEM had a layer too thick of thermal paste on heatsinks for the V100 and managed to crack a large number of GPUs as a result. With Redstone, you do not buy SXM4 GPUs and install them on a vendor PCB. Instead, an OEM purchases the NVIDIA Redstone platform and integrates it into servers feeding it data, power, and cooling. The Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 below is a feat of engineering as it can air cool the four 500W A100 Redstone platforms so long as data center ambient temperatures are on the chilly side.\nDell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 EPYC 7003 To NVIDIA A100 Redstone\nThen comes the \u201cDelta\u201d platform which is known as the HGX A100 platform (both names and markings are used on the actual part from NVIDIA.) Readers of STH will recognize this as we looked at the previous version in:\n\nWe will have the next-generation Inspur A100 server review live (hopefully) next week. Effectively this takes 8x NVIDIA A100 SXM4 packages along with NVSwitches, power delivery components, and cooling and puts them onto a single PCB. The assembly is then packaged as the HGX A100 platform and OEMs integrate it into their custom chassis.\nNVIDIA HGX A100 GPUs Small\nJust to impress how standard the HGX A100 8 GPU \u201cDelta\u201d platform is, even OEM systems sold under a non-NVIDIA brand have the PCB clearly marked with NVIDIA along with the A100 heatsinks. One can see the smaller label (there are others on the PCB) which says \u201cDelta\u201d and HGX A100 8 GPU.\nNVIDIA Delta Label And HGX A100 8 GPU Label\nNVIDIA does not sell the majority of its SXM4 A100 systems in its DGX systems. Instead, DGX A100 platforms are often sold before OEMs get the HGX A100 in order to boost margins. Also, the DGX A100 is a set configuration. OEMs offer different customized configurations along with all of the rack integration, service, support, and management integrations that are part of their value add.\nThis is actually very important. NVIDIA is selling these Delta platforms to OEMs as pre-assembled units ready to integrate. Therefore, NVIDIA can extract value from its IP by providing this board. OEMs provide value by putting a server platform around it. As a great example, the aforementioned PowerEdge XE8545 uses effectively the same motherboard found in the\u00a0Dell EMC PowerEdge R7525 we reviewed. We are going to go into the Graphcore packaging later, but while OEMs will build chassis around the HGX A100 8 GPU Delta board with their own server, with Graphcore they can use standard off the shelf servers.\nCircling back to the results we saw above, this is why the Supermicro (1.0-1085) and NVIDIA (1.0-1059) results are so close. The main HGX A100 8 GPU assembly is effectively a standardized unit. In some ways conceptually similar to the A100 PCIe in terms of integration into a specific OEM\u2019s platform, just scaled way up. That is one reason Jensen sometimes calling the 8x GPU HGX A100 a single GPU makes some sense if you understand the go-to-market model. Supermicro has some customizations with Intel CPUs and cooling, but running the same software stack that is primarily stressing the same HGX A100 GPU assembly gives us effectively the same result as the NVIDIA DGX A100.\nGraphcore MLPerf Training V1.0 Closed Division Image Classification ResNet Results\nThis is key to the Graphcore discussion as Graphcore could not show a performance advantage. Instead, Graphcore focused on a price/ performance advantage, but Graphcore picked a relatively niche comparison point for pricing by using the low-volume DGX A100 instead of OEM platforms based on the same HGX A100.\nNVIDIA HGX A100 Pricing\nGraphcore used the NVIDIA-branded DGX A100 640GB (with 8x 80GB 400W GPUs) that it assigned a $299,999 price tag. Since 8x A100 systems are usually $100K+ systems, and they are usually purchased as a cluster, not as single units, pricing is generally negotiated. Companies are not going to Amazon\u2019s storefront putting in a credit card and purchasing multi-million dollar clusters of GPU systems at list price without support. Pricing is negotiated and is usually at the cluster level, not the GPU server level.\nPricing, of course, varies. Word on the street is that, at a cluster level, moving from PCIe GPUs to SXM4 GPUs in the compute nodes is a ~10-20% price uplift for the same number of GPUs. The benefit is the higher performance which is why SXM4 GPUs are very popular and why scaling power in the A100 is important. Offering higher-power A100\u2019s in SXM4 pushes buyers from PCIe systems to systems that use HGX board assemblies where NVIDIA can have more value add. One has to remember that when these AI training clusters are installed there is also networking (InfiniBand or Ethernet) involved and all of the switches, cabling, and so forth. There is also, at minimum, a high-speed tier of storage to feed GPU compute systems. Changes in GPU pricing are relatively small in the context of complete clusters.\nOn the topic of NVIDIA DGX A100 pricing, Graphcore is using $299,999 in its charts and has this to say about how it came up with that price:\nThe NVIDIA DGX-A100 640GB used in MLPerf is a 6U box with a list price of around $300,000 (based on market intelligence and published reseller pricing) and eight DGX A100 chips. (Source: Graphcore Blog)\nLet us just get to it. HGX A100 platforms, when they are sold as single servers are generally in the $130K-$180K even leaving a very healthy margin for OEMs/ resellers. One can generally upgrade from the 40GB to 80GB Delta HGX A100 (320GB to 640GB) for around $16K, potentially more or less depending on the channel and discount structures. The 40GB to 80GB premium Graphcore calls \u201c1.5x\u201d but it is actually well under 20% for an OEM HGX A100 320GB v 640GB platform. If you have lower-end CPUs, memory, storage, and networking, and the 320GB HGX A100, you can be on the lower end of that scale. If you are using the 640GB HGX A100 and higher-end components, as used in the MLPerf configurations, you are likely on the higher end of the scale. Of course, we are assuming a very healthy margin and including on-site service in those numbers. A low-margin reseller passing along NVIDIA rebates, or big deal pricing will drop pricing from there.\nIt is hard to discuss deal-specific discounts, but that $130K-$180K range is very reasonable for a single HGX A100 at list configured pricing and without deal discounts. One can configure these systems online and get that list price range quoted without talking to a sales rep about further discounts. Instead of doing a basic \u201ccheck the list price on a web configurator for a spec listed in results\u201d bit of market research, Graphcore decided to use $299,999. Over the lifecycle of a box like this (once GPUs are available outside of just DGX systems), customers either migrate to OEM HGX A100 systems if they want price/ performance or they are getting something else as an effective discount to the DGX A100 pricing.\nBringing it together, we saw the Supermicro (1.0-1085) and NVIDIA (1.0-1059) being close in terms of performance. The street list price for a NVIDIA HGX A100-based system is about half of what Graphcore is using in its price/ performance comparison. While NVIDIA may not publish list prices, it really needs to be competitive in the market with the HGX A100 systems that offer more bundling, service, and customization options in terms of its pricing. \u201cMarket Intelligence\u201d should have guided to a $150K-$180K price point for a comparable HGX A100-based server, again excluding deal discounts and leaving a healthy margin for channel partners. That may have been conservatively looking at pricing in Graphcore\u2019s favor, but it would have been at least reasonable.\nGraphcore Blog MLPerf Training V1.0 RESNET 50\nIf we use the ultra-conservative high-end of this price range even at $180K which makes me cringe as being too high, using Graphcore\u2019s comparison point above, it would show significantly worse price/performance than NVIDIA A100-based systems.\nNow that we understand that the Graphcore IPU-POD16 is slower, NVIDIA\u2019s go-to-market model, and why pricing is roughly equivalent for Graphcore and competitive NVIDIA-based offerings, we still need to look at other factors. One factor is power consumption which we will explore next.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 \n\n TAGSamdASUSCerebrasDellGraphcoreHabana LabsInspurIntelMLPerfNVIDIASupermicro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleASRock Rack ROMED4ID-2T mITX-ish AMD EPYC Motherboard ReviewNext articleIntel Optane P1600X Small Capacity SSD for Boot Launched Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

(e.g. as it is widely used in ML,  image synthesis,  etc.)  NVIDIA also has some nice tools that would be hard for GraphCore to match.  Dev(s) can even develop with laptop & desktop cards w/ NVIDIA but w/ Graphcore Dev(s) will have to fight for access to the server and put up with a slower training cycle so add it all up and they will be less productive and you\u2019ll pay back whatever you saved on the machine \u2014 if you really saved on the machine.\nIn inference there is more the case new tech can be transformative,  but not if we are talking a factor of 1.2x but more if there is a factor of 12x.

I guarantee that everyone who has working hardware ran the suite. The absence of good results should be taken as a signal that they aren\u2019t competitive, not that they didn\u2019t bother trying.\n\u2014\u2013\nAs always, great in-depth reporting!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 2, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:51 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThe text under the \u201cML Perf training: ResNet-50\u201d image states\n\u201cGraphcore highlights its 32.12 minutes to complete the benchmark while the NVIDIA DGX A100 takes 28.77 minutes which is the result 1.0-1059.\u201d\nThe time shown in that image for Graphcore is 37.12, not 32.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 2, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            3:46 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThanks for the catch Grant!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            July 2, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:19 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThere seems to be typos in:\n\u201cOne major OEM had too think of thermal paste\u201d\nand\n\u201cInstead, and OEM purchases the NVIDIA Redstone platform and integrates it\u201d\nYou might like to fix.

The first was an Overwatch inspired card splashed in an orange and black coloring and the clan insignia of the Chengdu Hunters, an Overwatch esports team, graced the card as well.\n\nThe second card, tinted in black, white, and turquoise, is inspired by the Vocaloid anime singer Luo Tianyi, who happens to not only be the original Chinese Vocaloid singer, but also the most well-known to Vocaloid fans. She is shown looking towards the left of the viewer. The card celebrates the ninth anniversary of the anime series.\nFrom left to right - Luo Tianyi inspired cards, and on the right, a card inspired by The Legend of Sword and Fairy (aka Chinese Paladin).\nLastly, the third card's theme is based on the long running Taiwanese role-playing videogame series The Legend of Sword and Fairy, more specifically Series 7. The original game was first introduced to MS-DOS in 1995. The series has been adapted into numerous sequels and also into the 2005 Chinese television series Chinese Paladin, starring Hu Ge, Liu Yifei and Ady An. The colors used for this card are primarily light blue, yellow and white.\nIT Home also states:\n[...]the Nvidia RTX 3080 graphics card uses a single fan design. It has 8704 CUDA cores, 68 RT cores, a base frequency of 1440MHz, and the graphics card is equipped with 10GB GDDR6X video memory and a bit width of 320bit.\nThese three cards on display are not for public sale, but there is speculation that the three cards could be used as prizes for competitions headlined by the three properties in collaboration with NVIDIA in the future.\nSource: VideoCardz, IT Home\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n116\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n93\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n70\nActive Readers\n\n\n\niPhone 17 Air Pricing Details Suggest It Will Occupy The Same Bracket As Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Plus, And Will Arrive With Better Battery Life, But At The Cost Of Extra Features\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1475\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here are the most important options you should look at. \n                        Opening the Nvidia Control Panel\n               \nUsually, when you install your Nvidia drivers, they'll come with the Nvidia Control Panel. Sometimes, however, there are cases where this won't happen. For example, some OEM desktops and laptops might require you to use the Microsoft Store version of the Nvidia Control Panel.\nBefore you start, search for \"Nvidia Control Panel\" in the Windows search bar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see it appear, then you already have it. If you don't see it, then go to the Microsoft Store and download the app, which is of course free. When you open it, it should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes, the UI is a little antiquated. Also, don't worry if you experience heavy lag when changing settings, that is (unfortunately) typical.\nRelated:\u00a0How to Cleanly Install and Reinstall GPU Drivers on Windows \n                        Important 3D Settings in\u00a0the Nvidia Control Panel\n               \nThe first thing we should look at is the 3D settings. You should have multiple tabs under\u00a03D Settings\u00a0(which are located on the left-hand side of the window) but the only one you'll want to click on is\u00a0Manage 3D Settings. You should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see many, many settings in this tab, but don't be overwhelmed. Most of these settings are fairly useless or nonfunctional for modern applications. We're only going to focus on a few, ordered from first to last on the list.\nThe first potentially useful setting on this list is\u00a0Background Application Max Frame Rule. Basically, you can set a maximum framerate for an app (a game for example) that only activates if you are tabbed out and no longer playing the game. This can be particularly useful if you don't want to totally shut down a game but also want to keep power usage to a minimum.\nDSR - Factors (DSR standing for Dynamic Super Resolution) can be used\u00a0instead of anti-aliasing to improve visual quality. Basically, it will render a game at a higher resolution and then downscale it to what resolution your monitor is.\nYou could play a game at 4K and see it on your 1080p monitor,\u00a0but\u00a0you obviously wouldn't see a 4K image. This might sound like a useless setting, but it can be better than anti-aliasing at eliminating jaggy graphics. However, increasing the resolution\u00a0is very graphically intensive, so take care.\nLow Latency Mode is useful if you're playing a competitive game like Fortnite where you want lag and latency to be as minimal as possible. Nvidia recommends setting this to\u00a0Ultra, but by their own testing, it doesn't seem to do very much in some of the most popular competitive games. Still, every millisecond matters sometimes.\nMax Frame Rate is similar to the first setting we looked at but it is in effect at all times if enabled. This setting too can be used to curb power consumption. However, it also has other uses. There are some games (usually older ones) that shouldn't be run at very high framerates, for example.\nMonitor Technology is a setting you definitely want to change if you have a G-SYNC monitor. If it's set to\u00a0Fixed Refresh instead of G-SYNC\u00a0Compatible, your anti-screen tearing technology might not work.\nFor most users, these will be the most relevant and applicable settings.\nRelated: Easy Ways to Fix the nvlddmkm.sys Error in Windows 10 \n                        Important Display Settings in the Nvidia Control Panel\n               \nThis time, under the\u00a0Display options, we're going to look at two different tabs:\u00a0Change resolution and Set up G-SYNC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Change resolution tab allows you to, as the name implies, change the resolution. It also allows you to change the refresh rate.\nBut more interesting than those two features (both of which are already changeable under Windows's settings) is the\u00a0Customize feature. You can set a custom resolution or a custom refresh rate, and you can even set\u00a0a refresh rate higher than what's validated for your display.\nTo do this, click\u00a0Customize then\u00a0Create Custom Resolution. This will reveal these options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, increasing the refresh rate beyond what is advertised is overclocking. No manufacturer covers damage incurred by overclocking.\nRelated:\u00a0The Best CPU Overclocking Software to Boost Performance\nChanging the resolution is totally fine though. In fact, just like with DSR, you can increase the resolution, and it will apply on your entire PC instead of just in games. Again, the physical resolution of your monitor is unchanged, but it can look a little clearer.\nThe final tab is\u00a0Set up G-SYNC and again the name is straightforward. Here's what it should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few more ways you can customize G-SYNC under this tab. If you have a G-SYNC display, you'll want to make sure it's enabled here as well as in the 3D Settings. Check the\u00a0Enable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible option and make sure you select\u00a0Enable for windowed and full screen mode.\nIf you have multiple monitors, the second section will show you what monitor you are currently modifying. The third section finalizes all your changes when you check\u00a0Enable settings for the selected display model.\nIf you have multiple monitors, it's recommended to only enable it on the monitor you game on. Enabling G-SYNC for multiple monitors can cause weird flicking issues.\nYou can enable these \"G-SYNC\" settings even if you have a FreeSync or Adaptive Sync display. Nvidia will inform you that the display is not \"validated\" but the technology behind G-SYNC Compatible is the same technology behind FreeSync and Adaptive Sync. Nvidia's validation is more to do with their seal of approval than whether or not it will actually work. \n                        The Nvidia Control Panel Has Many Settings... but Only a Few Matter\n               \nNvidia Control Panel is a very useful app, but there's a lot of frankly useless and unnecessary settings. Most users should only really care about the few discussed in this article.\nEven enthusiasts will probably not care about the half dozen settings about anti-aliasing (not including DSR of course). Still, Nvidia Control Panel is the key to utilizing some very unique features which you can't find anywhere under Windows's settings.\nIt's also important to note that the Nvidia Control Panel is a different thing than Geforce Experience. Both are great tools for gamers, but they each do different things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nGraphics Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

It further speeds thing up by sending network traffic that doesn\u2019t need to be inspected directly to its intended destination.\nNvidia\u2019s BlueField-2 DPUs are specialized chips that come with optimizations that enable them to handle certain types of infrastructure administration tasks more efficiently, including network traffic inspection. By offloading this work to the DPU, a server\u2019s central processing units can focus solely on the compute tasks they have been given, thereby improving overall performance. Nvidia claims that a single BlueField-2 DPU can handle data center infrastructure administration tasks that would otherwise have to be performed by as many as 125 CPU cores.\nIn the case of Palo Alto\u2019s VM-Series NGFW, the Nvidia DPUs act as an intelligent network filter that parses, classifies and steers traffic flows with zero CPU overhead, Nvidia explained in a blog post. As a result, the VM-Series NGFWs can support 100 gigabytes per second throughput in standard use cases, amounting to a five-times performance boost for a VM-Series firewall that runs on CPUs alone, the companies said.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s firewall also benefits from an Intelligent Traffic Offload service that\u2019s enabled by the Nvidia DPUs. As Nvidia explains, in certain environments the majority of network traffic, such as streaming traffic for video, gaming and video calls, does not need to be inspected by the firewall. And then there is encrypted traffic, which simply cannot be inspected. By forcing all of this traffic that can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be inspected through the firewall, it slows things down.\nNvidia said as much as 80% of a typical network\u2019s traffic won\u2019t benefit from firewall inspection. Intelligent Traffic Offload (pictured below) addresses this problem by examining each session to determine if it will benefit from security inspection.\nIf it determines that it won\u2019t benefit, the BlueField-2 DPU will forward all subsequent packets in that session directly to their destination without sending them to the firewall. This helps to reduce the overall load on both the firewall and the host CPU, leading to a significant performance without adding any security risk, the company explained.\n\nPalo Alto Senior Vice President of Products Muninder Singh Sambi said the company\u2019s VM-Series NGFW is aimed at enterprises and telecommunications providers who are building \u201ccloudlike data centers\u201d that need both agility and automation. \u201cThe industry-leading Nvidia BlueField DPU is ideal for cybersecurity solutions operating in cloudlike environments,\u201d he said.\nImages: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

The charts show all the progress that has been achieved by the two main GPU makers in the industry starting and each generation of GPU shows both, its strength and weaknesses.\nAMD & NVIDIA GPU Silicon Progress From The Past 10 Years Visualized\nThe data was gathered from the Techpowerup GPU database and the top parts were used to measure the performance, efficiency & cost advancements witnessed over several generations. The charts start off with the VLIW5 based AMD Radeon HD 5000 & the Fermi-based GeForce GTX 400 series graphics cards.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAMD Radeon HD 5000 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 400 Series\nSo starting off with the first GPUs in comparison, the Terascale 2 (VLIW5) based Radeon HD 5000 and Fermi-based GeForce GTX 400 series. Both GPU families were similar in performance & price but Fermi consumed more power and hence its energy efficiency wasn't on par with the AMD GPU lineup at the time. Radeon GPUs also offered higher transistor performance.\n\nThe main issue with Fermi was that the top-tier chips were suited for large-scale HPC workloads and as such, featured unnecessary hardware units which led to a hot and power-hungry design. This was rectified with the release of more mainstream options and the next lineup in the GeForce family.\nAMD Radeon HD 6000 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 500 Series\nMoving on, we have the last iteration of Terascale and VLIW architecture as a whole from AMD, the Radeon HD 6000 series versus the second incarnation of Fermi, the GeForce GTX 500 series. Both GPU families saw a little gain in performance as they were widely regarded as optimized versions of what came before them but NVIDIA made some wise decisions in optimizing its broken Fermi GPU architecture for gaming and ended up delivering a slightly better product in general.\n\nAMD did cut the costs of its Radeon HD 6000 series which were widely affordable for the masses but this generation was mostly regarded as an intermediate launch before the next generation arrived from both parties.\nAMD Radeon HD 7000 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 600 Series\nThe GCN and Kepler cards were both based on a 28nm architecture and accelerated into the next gen. AMD launched its Radeon HD 7970 first which was well received with great performance and pricing while the same happened with NVIDIA which brought a range of new features and offered a huge increase in efficiency over the GCN architecture.\n\nThe Kepler architecture could be seen as the start of NVIDIA's efficiency journey which would come into fruition in the coming generations.\nAMD Radeon R200 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 700 Series\nA year later, NVIDIA unveiled its GeForce GTX 780 Ti graphics card as a response to the AMD R9 200 series which was aimed at the enthusiast segment. AMD Hawaii cards were both a step forward & a step back, offering huge performance increases to match NVIDIA's Titan cards but also sacrificed overall efficiency.\n\nThe AMD Radeon R9 290X as a result was hot but a strong competitor to NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 780 and Titan but came short of the GTX 780 Ti. With that said, both cards had similar pricing and while performance was close, it was NVIDIA that was offering higher efficiency again.\nAMD Radeon R300 vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 900 Series\nThe NVIDIA GeForce GTX 900 series based on the Maxwell architecture was the biggest uplift in performance and efficiency the green team had delivered yet. The Maxwell lineup really pushed the energy that came from NVIDIA, but it was still just a teaser for what was to come.\n\nAMD didn't learn from their Hawaii lineup and moved to offer an even more power-hungry Fiji chip which was not only limited in terms of memory but also featured a pricing similar to the GTX 980 Ti while offering performance lower than that. AMD did become the first vendor to offer HBM memory on its consumer chips but that was the only good thing about the card aside from the liquid cooling variation. The GTX 980 Ti launched, first, delivered a massive blow to AMD in the high-end market and things started looking grim for AMD's next-gen architecture.\nAMD Radeon RX Vega vs NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 Series\nEveryone had huge hopes for AMD's Radeon RX Vega architecture which was designed by the new head of RTG, Raja Koduri. But NVIDIA also wasn't keeping silent. The company launched its first 10 series cards months ahead of AMD's Vega lineup which pushed the efficiency & performance chart even further.\n\nBut it was the GTX 1080 Ti that truly crushed AMD's high-end GPU efforts for the next several years. The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti not only offered a stunning price point but its performance was the biggest leap forward for any Ti graphics card. One that remains unmatched to this day. The Vega 64 managed to offer performance close to the GTX 1080 but it was hot, loud, and consumed way more power than what AMD had promised.\nAMD Radeon RX 5000 vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series\nEnter the David Wang era, the new head of RTG had different and more constructive plans for the red team. Focus on both efficiency and performance. AMD's goal changed from offering the best value to the best in all categories. This was seen in the first iteration of the Navi architecture with the Radeon RX 5700 XT which managed to offer great mainstream performance at an attractive price.\n\nNVIDIA on the other hand, knowing that they had the lead in the performance category, went on to expand upon their feature set with DLSS and raytracing technologies. The Turing generation saw marginal gains over the last generation but the prices saw a huge increase due to increased wafer costs and the addition of premium GDDR6 memory modules.\nAMD Radeon RX 6000 vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series\nWe finally come to the current generation where NVIDIA tried its best to reach new performance heights with its Ampere architecture but AMD really blew them away by offering a GPU lineup that tackles NVIDIA across the board, even the flagship RTX 3090. The RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT are close in pricing and while the former offers a great feature set & superior raytracing performance, the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT leads in efficiency and even manages to come up with its own feature set such as FSR which was recently revealed. Both graphics cards are great in their own rights but AMD really outdid themselves with the 2nd iteration of Navi and things are looking great with the next-generation RDNA 3 family from what we have heard in rumors.\n\nOf course, this is just a small analysis of all the generations of AMD and NVIDIA GPUs that have come in the last 10 years and we look forward to what innovations and architectural upgrades are headed our way in the next 10 years.\n\n\n\nWhich GPU are you using inside your current PC?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel Xe (or older)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n94\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

However, some experts claimed that consumers must not be fooled by these graphics card units since there's a catch. \n\n\nBest Buy is having a restock of NVDIA's RTX 30-Series GPU, and it requires people going to its physical stores to purchase it. \nScreenshot from Twitter post of @Rakunvar\n\n\nPC Upgrade \u2705 Thanks to #TeamNvidia @NVIDIAGeForce and their awesomeness! #StreamerhouseRTX 3080 Powered\u2611\ufe0fStock \"Graphics\" scores: 466.793DMark: Timespy : Fire Strike ExtremeEVGA 2080 TI: 13522 : 16016RTX 3080: 18043 : 21214 pic.twitter.com/Jnqc09MjTh\u2014 Rakunvar \ud83d\udc40P.R. for @StreamerHouse\ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f (@Rakunvar) June 26, 2021\nJust like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, the advanced Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is also really hard to find since Amazon and other retailers always run out of stock. However, this could all change since some critics claimed that AMD Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs.The information was first revealed by the Hong Kong-based news publication HKEPC Hardware.\"As can be seen from the screenshot conversation posted by ppt netizens, the miner who sells used mining cards claims to have a large number of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards,\" said the news agency.\"In addition to the next generation of RTX 30 series, Radeon 6000 series, miners also have RTX 20 series, GTX 10 series, Radeon 5000 series, Radeon RX 500 series, Radeon RX 400 series, and other display cards,\" added the Hong Kong-based news publication company.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Stock Resale's DetailsAccording to Toms Guide's latest report, the alleged Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 stock resale will come from crypto miners. Experts said this could happen since they have loads of powerful new graphics cards.\n\n\nA gamer plays a video game on a computer equipped with a Nvidia GeForce RTX graphic card during the 'Paris Games Week' on October 26, 2018 in Paris, France. 'Paris Games Week' is an international trade fair for video games and runs from October 26 to 31, 2018. \nPhoto by Chesnot/Getty Images\n\nRead also:\nNVIDIA RTX 3080: Retail Stores in the US, UK and Australia to Keep an Eye for StocksThey need lots of units since they need to mine cryptocurrencies, which need a lot of electric power consumption. On the other hand, the stock resale units of the popular GeForce RTX 380 might have been used in large crypto mining farms, which generate high temperatures and voltages for extended periods of time.Based on the released details, the upcoming units will be sold in their overuse condition. Critics compared these products just like buying a car that has been driven aggressively from its first purchase.Since this is the case, the second-hand Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 will surely have some internal issues. On the other hand, Nvidia is now advising the consumers to avoid buying used GeForce RTX 3080.The giant graphics card manufacturer said that the best thing to do is wait for new units to arrive in giant online stores and retailers, such as Amazon, Target, and other big names.Why Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Is Popular?Kotaku reported that GeForce RTX 3080 is quite popular with various gamers, especially those who love playing HD titles, such as \"Cyberpunk 2077,\" \"Genshin Impact,\" and other games.On the other hand, this advanced graphics card also allows crypto miners to maximize their profits.For more news updates about Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 and other popular graphics cards, always keep your tabs open here at TechTimes.Related Article\u00a0:\nNvidia RTX 3080 Reaches $1,300 Average Selling Mark on eBay, 85% Above MSRPThis article is owned by TechTimesWritten by: Griffin Davis  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The announcement was made at the ongoing Game Developers Conference 2021. \nWith the new Studio Driver update, NVIDIA\u2019s RTX technology is now integrated into the latest releases of the game engines mentioned above. Game developers will be able to create better-looking games while taking less time and without worrying about their systems crashing. According to NVIDIA, both Unity and Unreal Engine have recently received the benefits of RTX, where Unity natively supports DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), allowing developers to improve image quality comparable to native resolution by using AI. By doing so, they are conventionally rendering only a fraction of the pixels, thus boosting real-time performance and saving exporting times.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Unity 2021.2 integrated with the latest DLSS SDK 2.2.1 from NVIDIA brings a function to enable the optimal image quality for a particular resolution, called \u201cAuto\u201d mode, along with an optional sharpening slider to fine-tune the visuals. An upcoming build of Unity is also expected to introduce Eye-Tracked Foveated Rendering. This technique renders a single image at varying resolutions, sharpening the point of focus while blurring other parts to mimic human eyesight.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Lightmass baking built on RTX ray tracing also brings parameters, so developers have better control of lighting and levels of detail in production assets. With Marmoset Toolbag 4.03 featuring a new ray-tracing engine, it is optimized to run on all modern GPUs while faster ray-tracing results are achieved with native hardware support of NVIDIA RTX devices.\nReal-time rendering and virtual reality plugin Enscape will be releasing a new update that is expected to add a new NVIDIA real-time denoiser and support for NVIDIA DLSS. This will enable smoother viewport visibility, render at lower resolutions, and higher framerates, using AI super-resolution to upscale the image to equal if not higher visual fidelity. Lastly, Topaz Video Enhance AI brings support for Slow Motion, a new RTX GPU Tensor Core feature that generates a high-quality, smooth, slow-motion capture with minimal artifacts.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA has announced that gamers and content creators using Discord to stream content will now be able to use the new NVDEC integration, which is exclusive to NVIDIA GPUs, for accelerated video decoding. With the new codec, users can share screens and stream over Discord with reduced resource utilization.\nNVIDIA also made announcements around NVIDIA Omniverse, its platform for 3D content creation and collaboration, and Studio Shop, where students and young developers can discover and create content using the latest RTX 30-series GPU-powered NVIDIA Studio laptops. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Mobile GPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

AMD did the same thing last week, releasing their FidelityFX Super Resolution tech (or FSR to its friends) as a free download.\nThat means the two biggest leaps in overall gaming performance are free for anyone to use (even me). I await the tweet from the first developer who implements both in their game at the same time, warning us of the graphics singularity that they\u2019ve unleashed. \n\n\n\n\nArm is RTX ON! NVIDIA GDC 2021 Demos\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n60 games currently have DLSS support, the most recent addition being Red Dead Redemption 2, and it\u2019s still a big deal when a game implements it. Who wouldn\u2019t want a free performance boost if you have the relevant hardware? Anecdotally, I spotted a developer talking about downloading the SDK on Twitter. A few hours later they tweeted that they\u2019d implemented it in their game. I\u2019m kicking myself for losing the tweet. It feels like we're about to enter a new era where these things are just part of PC gaming. \nIn addition to this, DLSS now supports Linux natively. Previously, it was limited to Proton-supported titles, such as Doom Eternal, but the latest SDK adds support for native Linux games. And just to show off, they\u2019ve also started to support ray tracing on ARM-based systems. Nvidia are currently trying to acquire the CPU manufacturer. If they do end up with the chip maker as a partner, ARM\u2019s chips could move out of their current phone and Chromebook shells into proper gaming laptops. \nI think I might mark this post on my calendar to be read five years from now. I\u2019ve no idea what the future of PC gaming will look like, but the past few months has given us a hand-held Steam Deck PC with a Linux core and AMD innards. I wouldn't be surprised to see a proper Nvidia-based variant somewhere down the line. \n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCraig Pearson: I love square sausage, cats, and climbing pretend rocks.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nView comments (7)    \n\n\nRelated topics\n\nGraphics Cards\nHardware\nNvidia\nNvidia RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n        Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in\n      \n\n        Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.\n      \n\n\n\n\nSign in with Google\n\n\nSign in with Facebook\n\n\nSign in with Twitter\n\n\nSign in with Reddit\n\n\n\nSign in with email    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n                    Moroi is a top-down meatgrinder that stinks of Little Nightmares and American McGee's Alice\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Metro 4 will \"inevitably\" be shaped by Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Loot goblins and Remnant players should check out new fantasy RPG Empyreal, which launches in May\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Marvel Rivals Season 2 will add more Team-Up skills, plus the usual new heroes\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    9 Kings is a roguelike city builder that's actually just an excuse to launch rocks at people\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    The Maw: what's new in PC games this week?\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Dune: Awakening's new trailer details how its map changes every week, which sounds awful for cartographers\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Guides\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to get pets\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to smuggle resources\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to parry and deflect\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows: How to change characters\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    How to use photo mode in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    How to turn on Guaranteed Assassination in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n                    What is the Animus Hub in Assassin's Creed Shadows?\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\nTop Discussions\n\n\n\n\n                    Power up your Gamer Network ID with our Steam Integration\n                  \n\n\n119 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Ubisoft warn staff not to celebrate Assassin's Creed Shadows launch as part of \u201canti-harassment plan\u201d\n                  \n\n\n79 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Assassin's Creed Shadows review\n                  \n\n\n23 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    It's a worryingly perfect time to revive Assassin's Creed's old social stealth multiplayer\n                  \n\n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    The Half-Life 2 RTX demo proposes a nice visual upgrade and not much else\n                  \n\n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    R.E.P.O. is Steam's latest viral horror despite its high mate requirement - but the devs are working on matchmaking\n                  \n\n\n10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Total War: Warhammer 3's next updates will tackle \"anti-player bias\" and self-destructive AI\n                  \n\n\n9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock Paper Shotgun is owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis.\n  \u00a9 2025 Gamer Network Limited, 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

Instead, it is one of the highest-end dual-socket servers you can buy today for AI training. Based around dual AMD EPYC CPUs and the NVIDIA HGX A100 8 GPU (Delta) platform, this server has topped MLPerf benchmarks for AI/ML training. Now, we get to do our hands-on review of the system.\n\nInspur NF5488A5 Server Overview Video\nAs with many of our articles this year, we have a video overview of this review that you can find on the STH YouTube channel:\n\nFeel free to listen along as you read or go through this review. As always, we suggest watching this video in a YouTube tab, window, or app instead of in the embedded viewer. There is even a discussion about PCIe v. Redstone v. Delta in the video.\nInspur NF5488A5 Hardware Overview\nWe have been splitting our reviews into external and internal sections for some time. In this article, we also wanted to provide ample views of the 8x NVIDIA A100\u2019s so we are going to have a bit more on that than we would in a normal review. Instead, our plan is to start from the front of the system, move through the top to the rear, then make our way back to the front of the chassis with the GPUs.\nInspur NF5488A5 Server Hardware Overview\nThe front of the system is a little bit different than a standard 4U server. There are effectively three zones to the server. The top portion has storage, memory, and two processors. The bottom tray that you can see here has the GPUs and NVSwitches. Finally, the rear of the server has the PCIe switches, power, cooling, and expansion slots.\nInspur NF5488A5 Front\nIf the model number and the front of the chassis seem familiar, we reviewed the Inspur NF5488M5, and as you can see that looks very similar.\nInspur NF5488M5 Front\nOne can see front I/O with a management port, two USB 3.0 ports, two SFP+ cages for 10GbE networking, as well as a VGA connector.\nInspur NF5488A5 Front IO\nStorage is provided by 8x 2.5\u2033 hot-swap bays. All eight bays can utilize SATA III 6.0gbps connectivity. One set of four drives can optionally utilize U.2 NVMe SSDs.\nInspur NF5488A5 NVMe 2.5in\nThere are M.2 options, but they are a bit different than we saw in the NF5488M5 review since there is more memory. Our test system did not have this M.2 option.\nJust behind the 10GbE SFP+ ports on the front I/O and between the 2.5\u2033 drive cages, we have the ASPEED BMC along with PCIe connectivity that is not used in our system.\nInspur NF5488A5 BMC And Additional PCIe\nWe again have the heatsink array cooling the power delivery components. This solution appears to be updated for the newer A5 system than what we saw with the M5.\nInspur NF5488A5 Power Distribution\nThere is also an OCP mezzanine slot. Our sense is that this is for internal storage controllers although it is not populated in the test system.\nInspur NF5488A5 OCP Mezzanine Slot\nThis is a dual AMD EPYC 7002 (Rome) / EPYC 7003 (Milan) system. That is a huge change since this is also the first AMD system that we are aware of from Inspur. Our system has Rome generation CPUs, but Inspur has published benchmarks also using the Milan generation so this supports both. That gives up to 64 cores but also a fairly wide range of lower core count options. Still, in a system like this, even two 64-core CPUs are a relatively smaller cost component.\nInspur NF5488A5 Dual AMD EPYC And 32x DDR4 DIMMs\nEach of the two CPUs can potentially take 16 DIMMs for 32 DIMMs total, an increase of 8 DIMMs in the system.\nYou may have noticed that the heatsinks are more substantial with this generation. The 1U sized heatsinks have heat pipes to secondary fin arrays that are behind the DIMM slots.\nInspur NF5488A5 Heatsink With Heatpipes\nHere is the opposite angle. In a system like this, power and thermals are serious considerations. That is why we see more expansive cooling in this A5 server versus the previous-generation M5.\nInspur NF5488A5 Dual AMD EPYC And 32x DDR4 DIMMs 2\nThe PCIe connectivity is substantial. As a result, we see a large number of PCIe cables going from the motherboard to the PCIe switch and power distribution board below. This is how PCIe goes from the CPUs to the expansion slots and GPUs.\u00a0Inspur has a cable management solution to ensure that these cables can be used without blocking too much airflow to the CPUs, memory, and other motherboard components.\nInspur NF5488A5 Power And PCIe Cabling\nThis is a view down to the fan controller PCB, then to the PCIe switch board. One can see the second ASPEED BMC here. This server has so much going on it requires not one, but two BMCs.\nInspur NF5488A5 View To PCIe Switch Board BMC\nLooking at the rear of the chassis, one can see an array of hot-swap modules. There are three basic types. The center is dominated by fan modules.\nInspur NF5488A5 Fan Module\nTo each side, one can see power supplies. There are a total of four PSUs and each is 3kW in our system.\nInspur NF5488A5 3kW Power Supply\nThe bottom has low-profile PCIe Gen4 x16 slots, two per side in I/O modules. One side shown below has an extra COM port while the other side you can see above has an IPMI management port.\nInspur NF5488A5 2x PCIe Gen4 X16 LP And Console\nOne of the big changes with this generation is the AMD EPYC\u2019s PCIe Gen4 support. Our system did not have them configured, but these can take up to HDR Infiniband or 200GbE ports running at full speed. In a system like this, that is a great benefit as it serves as a gateway to more training servers and storage in a cluster.\nOne can see the fans associated with these removable I/O modules if we flip the view and look at the PCIe switch board. Modern high-speed networking cards require solid cooling as well and having dedicated fans on each removable I/O expansion module.\nInspur NF5488A5 Look Inside To Power And PCIe Switch Board\nThose high-speed connectors provide PCIe connectivity and power to the NVIDIA HGX A100 8 GPU \u201cDelta\u201d baseboard. It is now time to take a look at that.\nInspur NF5488A5 GPU Tray Coming Out\nThere is a cover that normally goes over the GPU tray, but we removed that for better photos. If you want to see the sheet metal panel, you can see the NF5488M5 review.\nNext, we are going to look at the GPU baseboard assembly that this plugs into in more detail.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 5 REVIEW OVERVIEWDesign & Aesthetics9.7Performance9.6Feature Set9.9Value9.4SUMMARYIn our Inspur NF5488A5 review, we see what this AMD EPYC powered 8x NVIDIA A100 Delta platform offers as a big upgrade to the previous-gen9.7OVERALL SCORE\n\n TAGSA100AmpereInspurNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleLexar NM620 1TB NVMe SSD Review A Spectacular FailNext articleACASIS M03 Dual-Bay NVMe Docking Station Type C Review Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

Icelake A100s servers don\u2019t make much sense, they simply don\u2019t have enough pcie lanes or cores to compete at the 16 GPU level.\nThere will be a couple of 8x A100 Icelake servers coming out but no 16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid O'Shea\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            June 12, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:58 am                                            \n\n\n\nIt would be nice if in EVERY system review, you include the BIOS vendor, and any BIOS features of particular interest.   My experience with server systems is that a good 33% to 50% of the \u201csystem stability\u201d comes from the quality of the BIOS on the system, and the other 66% to 50% comes from the quality of the hardware design, manufacturing process, support, etc.  It is like you are not reviewing about 1/2 of the product.

Meanwhile, the RTX 3090 costs $1,499 (\u00a31,399, around AU$2,030).\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 8K performance has blown me away already - and it's mainly thanks to Multi-Frame Generation\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle at 8K \u2013 a fitting swansong for the Nvidia RTX 4090, or a sign that we need the RTX 5090?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s still an absolutely huge amount of money, but it\u2019s a lot less expensive than the Titan RTX. If the RTX 3090 can indeed beat the Titan RTX when it comes to 8K gaming for $1,000 less, then Nvidia has pulled off a remarkable feat. Especially when the Titan RTX struggled to play many games at 8K.So, to test out just how good the RTX 3090 is compared to the Titan RTX, we\u2019ve plugged the new GPU into our 8K test rig and revisited the games we\u2019ve previously tried at 8K.Today's best Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 deals $1,789View $1,929View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3090 vs Nvidia Titan RTX: specsBefore we get into the games, let\u2019s take a look at the specs of the two GPUs:Nvidia Titan RTX:Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Architecture: Nvidia TuringVideo memory: 24 GB GDDR6Memory interface: 384-bitBoost Clock: 1770 MHzTensor Cores: 576CUDA Cores: 4608(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3090:Architecture: Nvidia AmpereVideo memory: 24 GB GDDR6XMemory interface: 384-bitBoost Clock: 1700 MHzTensor Cores: 328CUDA Cores: 10496While there are some areas where the Titan RTX is ahead of the RTX 3090, by and large, the newer GPU\u2019s specs show a decent bump in potential performance. Even where things look equal, such as the amount of memory, the RTX 3090 edges it, thanks to the faster GDDR6X memory used.Again, the fact that the RTX 3090 is so much cheaper than the Titan RTX, and yet could offer better performance from a gaming perspective, is great. However, that in no way makes the Titan RTX an outdated card. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Titan RTX wasn\u2019t really aimed at gamers \u2013 it was more for digital professionals and content creators, and when pitched against professional GPUs, the price was much more palatable.Anyway, enough about specs. Let\u2019s talk games.Red Dead Redemption 2 still looks gorgeous at 4K (Image credit: Rockstar games)Nvidia RTX 3090 vs Nvidia Titan RTX round one: Red Dead Redemption 2Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the most graphically impressive games ever made, so when it rode on to PC last year, we couldn\u2019t wait to see if the Titan RTX could handle it at 8K.As it turned out, it struggled, hitting just 18.65 frames per second (fps) with the maximum graphical settings applied.Things improved when we set the graphics to low, scoring 26fps. Still below the playable threshold of 30fps, but not quite the slideshow we were expecting.However, with the RTX 3090, things improved quite a bit. Setting absolutely everything to Ultra or highest settings saw it score 19.02fps. A jump, but still far from playable. However, with a bit of tweaking, and limiting a few options to medium or high, but sticking mainly with \u2018Ultra\u2019, we got much better results, with the game averaging 30.74fps. For many people, that\u2019s a perfectly playable frame rate, though others will argue that paying $1,499 for a GPU to only reach 30fps means 8K still isn\u2019t realistic.Lowering all the settings to their absolute minimum, however, gives you a much better frame rate of \u00a044.08fps, with it even hitting highs of 52.8fps. That\u2019s close to the magical 60fps mark, but there are sacrifices you have to make to graphical fidelity (in places it begins to look like a PS2 game).PC Deals892 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26062 deals available $15View $59.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Bethesda)Nvidia RTX 3090 vs Nvidia Titan RTX round two: Doom EternalDoom Eternal is our next game, and when we tried it earlier in the year, we were impressed with how well the Titan RTX handled it at 8K, with settings on \u2018Ultra Nightmare\u2019 hitting 39.9fps on average. Not a bad score considering the high graphical settings and frantic gameplay, but not quite reaching 60fps.Meanwhile, the RTX 3090 offered an incredible improvement. On Ultra Nightmare settings, at 8K it managed to hit on average 51.6fps, and even broke the 60fps barrier in places. Doom Eternal is a fast and frantic shooter that also looks fantastic, so for the RTX 3090 to achieve almost 60fps at 8K on its highest graphical settings is very impressive.We tested the game during some hectic firefights and large open spaces, so the RTX 3090\u2019s performance here is very promising. The step up in performance compared to the Titan RTX is also pretty impressive.We also tried Doom Eternal on its lowest graphical settings. Unlike Red Dead Redemption 2, even on low, Doom Eternal still looks very nice, and this allowed the RTX 3090 to hit 57.7fps on average. A decent jump, but still just short of the 60fps goal. Still, this is one of the closest cases of the RTX 3090 offering 8K at 60fps \u2013 something the Titan RTX never achieved.(Image credit: The Coalition)Nvidia RTX 3090 vs Nvidia Titan RTX round three: Gears 5Gears 5 is one of the most graphically-intensive games released by Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Games Studios, and it outmatched the Titan RTX at 8K, with the GPU managing just 27.4fps at medium settings.However, the RTX 3090 absolutely smashed it, hitting an incredible 58.8fps on average at Ultra settings. Sure, during some particularly heavy firefights, with explosions and debris flying around the place, we saw dips to the low 50\u2019s, this is still an incredible achievement.Even better, by simply lowering the graphical settings to \u2018High\u2019, the RTX 3090 hit a solid 60fps throughout our tests. This means 8K at 60fps is a reality, and you\u2019re not having to make too much of a compromise when it comes to graphical fidelity, as the game still looks amazing.With a bit of tweaking, we think you\u2019d be able to have a mix of High and Ultra settings and hit 60fps. Impressive stuff indeed.One thing to note is that this is the only game here that we didn\u2019t benchmark on exactly the same hardware with the Titan RTX. Still, these results offer a good idea of just how much better at 8K gaming the RTX 3090 is.Today's best Gears 5 deals No price informationCheck Amazon No price informationCheck WalmartWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: 505 Games)Nvidia RTX 3090 vs Nvidia Titan RTX round four: Death StrandingDeath Stranding was one of the most impressive 8K experiences we had with the Titan RTX when we tested it. While having every graphical setting set to its highest level made the Titan RTX struggle, with an average of 23.3fps, by turning on Nvidia's\u00a0DLSS tech, which uses the Tensor Cores of an RTX card to boost the performance of high resolutions thanks to AI and machine learning, we found that with the 'Quality' setting (and everything else turned to maximum, as usual), performance leapt to 29.9fps, with a minimum of 25.7fps and a maximum of 32fps.Even better, switching DLSS to the 'Performance' setting saw the game hitting on average 39.8fps at 8K, with a maximum of 49fps.When we set the graphics to low, but with DLSS on, we got an average of 50.9fps with the Titan RTX, and in some parts of our tests the card hit 57.2fps, tantalizingly close to 8K at 60fps on the older card.So, as you can imagine, we had high hopes for the RTX 3090\u2019s 8K performance in Death Stranding, especially as a new Ultra Performance DLSS preset created specifically for 8K has been added specifically for the GPU.The improvements are immediately apparent, with the RTX 3090 hitting an average frame rate of 29.4fps on the highest settings without DLSS. This is pretty much, then, an out-of-the-box playable 8K experience. But let\u2019s tinker.First thing we did was switch DLSS on to \u2018Performance\u2019, and left everything else as it was. The results were drastic, with an average frame rate of 55.7fps, and a maximum frame rate of 60.5fps \u2013 yet another 8K game hitting the 60fps dream.Next, we tried it with the \u2018Ultra Performance\u2019 DLSS setting. This is the new setting added especially for 8K resolution and the RTX 3090. The results are even better, with an average frame rate of 59.9fps at the highest graphical settings. This is seriously impressive stuff, as it means you\u2019re playing a modern graphically gorgeous game at 8K resolution and 60fps.Most importantly of all, this is the first time we\u2019ve felt that we could actually play the entire game at 8K resolution, rather than dropping it down to 4K for a more consistent experience.Sure, with a lower resolution and a high refresh-rate monitor, you\u2019d be able to get much higher frame rates than 60fps with the RTX 3090 and Death Stranding, but bear in mind that at the moment there are no 8K gaming monitors out there. The Dell UltraSharp UP3218K monitor we use is strictly a productivity monitor, with a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz.Overall, then, with Death Stranding, Nvidia truly has delivered on its promise of 8K gaming.PC Deals947 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26062 deals available $4.35View $17.40ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesNvidia RTX 3090 vs Nvidia Titan RTX: conclusionSo, when it comes to 8K gaming, does the Nvidia RTX 3090 deliver? Excitingly, yes, in many games we\u2019ve tried so far it does. It shows a clear performance boost in many games compared to the more expensive Titan RTX, and many games now reach that magical 8K @ 60fps experience we\u2019ve been looking for.However, not all games did achieve that, and in many games you\u2019re having to make some big sacrifices when it comes to graphical effects.However, as Death Stranding proves, perhaps the real star of the show is DLSS. This feature, which is improved with Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 3000 series GPUs, makes a huge difference, allowing games to be played at 8K and 60fps without any very noticeable loss in graphical fidelity.As DLSS continues to evolve, and more games take advantage of it, including upcoming blockbusters like Cyberpunk 2077, it looks like the 8K gaming future could finally be here with the RTX 3090. We\u2019ll be testing all the latest games at 8K when they are released.These are the best GPUs of 2020\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n8K\nGaming at 8K\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core TechMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

Worse yet, chances are that if you do manage to find one, its price has been grossly inflated, in part due to the ongoing microprocessor shortage. But if you've been patient and fancy on taking a chance, Best Buy might be able to help you tomorrow.On Tuesday, July 20, Best Buy stores nationwide will be selling new RTX 30 series stock as MSRP, with a system to try and limit scalpers as much as possible. Customers at one of the participating stores will be handed a ticket by a Best Buy employee, guaranteeing your chances to purchase a GPU when doors open at 8 AM. As expected, it seems some eager PC gamers have already started camping out to better their chances.Participating Best Buy storesBest Buy doesn't say which RTX 30 series cards will be on sale, nor does it list manufacturers, never mind how much stock each store will have on offer. That does make this a gamble, and one that might lead to more disappointment if you don't manage to secure a ticket. But it's been months since these GPUs hit the market at MSRP at launch, so this is one of those rare chances to take advantage.If you're still not sure which RX 30 series will be right for you, you can check out our reviews for the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 Ti, three of the best cards in Nvidia's lineup for high performance gaming at equally high resolutions. For something more modest (and much cheaper), Nvidia also offers the RTX 3060 for a great time at both 1080p and 1440p. Check out our guide to the best 4K gaming monitors that will help you get the best out of your new GPU purchase, too.\n\n\n \n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

If you are still looking to get your hands on one of the latest Nvidia GPUs, Best Buy has announced that select locations will sell RTX 30 GPUs tomorrow. Best Buy did not specify which RTX 30 graphics cards it would be selling, but it is likely that the retailer will have various RTX 30 cards such as the RTX 3060 and RTX 3080 available across different manufacturers such as EVGA and MSI. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti9 Images115 Best Buy locations across the United States (including one location in Puerto Rico) will be selling limited quantities of Nvidia's flagship GPU line.  In an effort to make sure as many people as possible can purchase an RTX 30 card, Best Buy confirmed that each of the eligible retail stores would be enforcing a one-GPU-per-customer rule, with employees slated to begin handing out tickets at 7:30am local time. Acquiring a ticket guarantees you the opportunity to purchase an RTX 30 GPU inside the store when the doors open at 8am local time. This marks the second time Best Buy will have sold Nvidia's RTX 30 series cards in-stores. Last month, select Best Buy locations sold limited quantities of RTX 3080 Ti Founder's Edition GPUs. Since its debut in late 2020, the sale of RTX 30 cards in retail chains like Best Buy have been handled primarily online. PlayTaylor is the Associate Tech Editor at IGN.

Here's What You Should Do if It Does\n\n\n  \n      By Harsh Chauhan\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Jul 15, 2021 at 6:10AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics card prices are coming down as cryptocurrency miners sell their chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's financials took a big hit the last time miners dumped graphics cards and caused a supply glut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA investors should focus on the bigger picture in a scenario like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-3.22%)\u00a0-$3.85\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$115.68\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:43 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs graphics card prices start sliding, NVIDIA investors may have to relive a torrid time in the company's history.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA -3.22%) has sizzled on the stock market since the beginning of 2019. Shares of the graphics specialist have jumped about 500% in just over two and a half years thanks to terrific growth in the video gaming and data center businesses.\nHowever, ominous signs are emerging in NVIDIA's biggest business, video gaming, that could give investors d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, harkening back to a regrettable period in the company's history.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nGraphics card prices are coming down as miners start dumping GPUs\nGraphics processing unit (GPU) prices have started pulling back from their astronomical highs of late due to several factors. However, lower demand from cryptocurrency miners seems to be the biggest growth driver behind the correction. That's not surprising, as miners reportedly bought a fourth of the total graphics cards sold in the first quarter of 2021 to mine cryptocurrencies, according\u00a0to Jon Peddie Research.\nBut a drop in the price of Ethereum (ETH -2.74%) and China's crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC -2.92%) have hamstrung the demand for graphics cards used for mining operations. Etherscan, an Ethereum analytics platform, recently pointed\u00a0out that the GPU power used for mining the cryptocurrency has dropped 19% in the past month. As a result, cryptocurrency miners in China are offloading their powerful graphics cards into the second-hand market, according to a report by PC Gamer.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 3070 GPU is reportedly being sold\u00a0for just over $400 in China. That's lower than the card's $499 sticker\u00a0price. It is also worth noting that the RTX 3070 was being sold for $1,300 in the first half of June, according to eBay price data collected by Tom's Hardware. As of the end of the first week of July, the card's price had come down to just over $1,080.\nGPU prices in Germany have also dropped at a breakneck pace. The price premium of NVIDIA's RTX 30 series cards has come down to 153% of the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) in the first week of July, compared to a whopping 304% in the middle of May, according\u00a0to a third-party report.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNVIDIA has been hit hard in the past\nNVIDIA was hurt big time by a GPU price crash back in 2018 once cryptocurrency miners decided to offload their graphics cards in the preowned market. The excess graphics card inventory in the wake of the cryptocurrency mining bust burnt investors as NVIDIA's fortunes declined.\nThe recent price correction indicates history may repeat itself and wreck NVIDIA's momentum. After all, the chipmaker's revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for the three months ending Jan. 27, 2019, sunk 24% year over year in the aftermath of the cryptocurrency mining bust. It took the company a year to recover from that shock. NVIDIA's revenue in fiscal 2020 dipped\u00a07% before it regained its mojo thanks to strong demand from the video gaming and the data center segments.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, long-term investors have no reason to worry, despite these developments that have caused NVIDIA pain in the past. That's because the demand for its latest cards is so strong that NVIDIA has reportedly decided to cut production of the old-generation RTX 2060 graphics card in half to increase the supply of the RTX 30 series cards. Additionally, reports indicate that NVIDIA is already working to increase the production of the aggressively priced RTX 3060 card to meet strong demand.\nSo, even if gaming enthusiasts decide to buy a preowned graphics card from miners -- which isn't always a good idea\u00a0as they may have been subjected to long hours of operation and could be prone to wearing out faster -- NVIDIA will still have enough end-market demand to fill.\nConsider this: Only 15% of NVIDIA's installed graphics card user base of 140 million is running the RTX series cards. A short-term disturbance in the GPU market's demand-supply dynamics is unlikely to change the long-term picture. Jon Peddie Research estimates that discrete GPU sales could generate\u00a0$54 billion in revenue by 2025, a sharp jump from last year's revenue of $23.6 billion thanks to the growth in video gaming. NVIDIA controls\u00a080% of this market.\nSavvy investors would do well to consider buying more NVIDIA stock if the cryptocurrency bust sends its shares packing. After all, analysts expect NVIDIA's earnings to grow at more than 26% a year for the next five years, suggesting this is a top growth stock that's worth buying on its rare dips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

In a nutshell, it provides silky smooth, tear-free gaming by allowing the monitor and GPU to talk to each other.The display draws every frame outputted by the GPU, and this variable refresh rate ensures no tears during gameplay. It is, however, not enabled by magic as soon as you hook up a G-Sync display. There's some mild setup involved, but the good news is that as long as you've at least installed drivers once for your NVIDIA GPU, you won't have any additional software to install.How to enable G-Sync on your PCThe first thing to do is to make sure you actually turn on the G-Sync setting on your PC.Right-click on your desktop.Select NVIDIA Control Panel.Expand the display item in the sidebar.Click on Set up G-Sync.Check the box next to Enable G-Sync.Below this choose whether you want G-Sync enabled for only full screen or full screen and windowed modes.How to use G-Sync in your PC gamesTo use G-Sync in your games, you'll also need to set your monitor as your primary display in this same control panel if you're using multiple monitors.In the same window as above click on Set up multiple displays.Ensure that the G-Sync monitor is in the correct location and highlighted as primary.If you need to make it your primary display then follow these steps.Open the Windows 10 Settings app.Click System.Now click on Display.Highlight the box corresponding to the display in question.Scroll down and check the box next to Make this my primary display.Now when you game you'll have crisp, tear-free on-screen action.

For the better part of the decade, PC gamers have had a tough call to make to get smooth frames without screen tearing in their games.V-sync offers one route to smooth out rendering, but can introduce stutter and input lag. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync and AMD\u2019s FreeSync have been two walled gardens, requiring specific hardware to take advantage of.Make sure you check out our pick of the best FreeSync monitors for G-Sync in 2019.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nHow to enable Nvidia G-Sync\n\n\n\n\nHow to optimize your gaming PC for 60fps performance\n\n\n\nThe issue was that there needed to be support across multiple devices to get the adaptive sync features working, and crossing brand lines between Nvidia and AMD made it impossible. To use the adaptive refresh rates of a FreeSync monitor, you needed an AMD graphic processor that supported FreeSync. And, to use G-sync, you needed both an expensive G-Sync monitor and an Nvidia graphics card at least Maxwell (i.e. the GTX 960) or newer.Pairing Nvidia graphics with a FreeSync monitor, and vice versa, left the technology sitting idle. But, Nvidia has made a huge shift to that dynamic. Now, recent Nvidia graphics cards will support adaptive sync on previously unsupported monitors, including FreeSync models.If you\u2019re looking to start gaming with G-Sync on a FreeSync monitor, here\u2019s what you need to know and what you can expect.What exactly is G-Sync?G-Sync is simply Nvidia\u2019s technology for matching the refresh rate of a gaming monitor to the frame rate of a video game.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Since video games can have wildly varying demands on hardware from moment to moment, graphics cards rarely maintain a perfectly consistent frame rate. You may see a GPU deliver 100fps only to quickly dive down to 40fps when a bunch of action kicks off.And, when the frame rate running on your PC differs from the monitor\u2019s refresh rate, issues emerge. There may be tearing as the monitor displays parts of two different frames or stutter when the monitor repeats frames while waiting for new frame data. G-Sync prevents visual issues like these by ensuring the monitor doesn\u2019t refresh faster or slower than the game\u2019s frame rate.Which GPUs are supported?Nvidia is enabling G-Sync for variable refresh rate monitors on GTX 10-Series and RTX 20-Series graphics cards. If you\u2019re running an older GPU, you\u2019re out of luck. Your graphics card will also need to connect to your monitor via DisplayPort. So, if you have a gaming laptop with only an HDMI output, you may also be left out.Which variable refresh monitors support G-Sync?Nvidia claims to have tested 400 monitors with variable refresh rates to ensure gamers know which will work effectively with G-Sync. Out of this group only 12 have passed so far, and Nvidia has labeled the best performing monitors as \u201cG-Sync Compatible.\u201d\u00a0Monitors that have received this designation passed tests ensuring they offered large variable refresh rate ranges greater than 2.4:1 (with most offering at least 48-144Hz), so the window is wide enough between the lowest and highest refresh rate for gamers to benefit. They also ensure the monitors don\u2019t blank, pulse, flicker, ghost or present other artifacts with G-Sync enabled.At this time, 12 monitors have the G-Sync Compatible designation:Acer XFA240Acer XG270HUAcer XV273KAcer XZ321QAOC Agon AG241QG4AOC G2590FXAsus MG278QAsus VG258QAsus VG278QAsus XG248Asus XG258BenQ XL2740However, even if your variable refresh rate monitor isn\u2019t listed, you can still enable G-Sync. There may be issues, but you have the option of testing it out and deciding for yourself whether the benefits are worthwhile.How do I use G-Sync on a FreeSync monitor?To start, you need to make sure you\u2019ve updated your Nvidia drivers to at least Version 417.71. Support was enabled on January 15, 2019, so drivers dated before this will not work with FreeSync monitors.You\u2019ll also need to ensure your Nvidia graphics card and monitor are connected via DisplayPort. Also, check your monitor\u2019s settings to confirm variable refresh rates are enabled.If your monitor is one of the G-Sync Compatible models, then G-Sync should automatically enable itself, as should variable refresh rates. If not, you can manually enable G-Sync using the following steps:Open Nvidia Control PanelGot to \u201cDisplay: Set up G-SYNC\u201dCheck \u201cEnable G-SYNC G-SYNC Compatible\u201d and select your preferred optionsSelect your monitorCheck \u201cEnable settings for the selected display model\u201dApply settingsYou can find more details on enabling G-Sync here.How well does it work?Just how well G-Sync works is largely going to come down to what settings you\u2019re using in your games and what monitor you\u2019re using it with. Our experience has been generally positive with G-Sync enabled on a G-Sync Compatible monitor.If you\u2019re playing a game at such high settings that you can\u2019t consistently keep your frame rate within the monitors variable refresh rate range, then the experience won\u2019t be positive. If your game does run within that variable refresh rate range, though, it should be a smooth experience without stutter or tearing.\u00a0Gaming with too high of a frame rate can also cause issues. So, it\u2019s best to keep your game\u2019s frame rate limited slightly below the maximum refresh rate of your monitor. You can see the variable refresh rates of G-Sync and G-Sync Compatible monitors at Nvidia here.As G-Sync is similar to V-Sync in some ways, gamers may be concerned about introducing input lag.

The San Francisco-based AI startup, backed by Microsoft and VC firm Khosla Ventures, introduced the 1.0 version on Wednesday, a new programming language specially crafted to ease that burden, called Triton, detailed in a blog post\u00a0that links to GitHub source code.\u00a0   OpenAI claims Triton can deliver substantial ease-of-use benefits over coding in CUDA for some neural network tasks at the heart of machine learning forms of AI such as matrix multiplications. \u00a0\"Our goal is for it to become a viable alternative to CUDA for Deep Learning,\" the leader of the effort, OpenAI scientist Philippe Tillet, told ZDNet via email.\u00a0   Triton \"is for machine learning researchers and engineers who are unfamiliar with GPU programming despite having good software engineering skills,\" said Tillet.   The fact that the language is coming from OpenAI, which developed the GPT-3 natural language processing program that has taken the world by storm, may give the code some added preeminence in the AI field.   The software is offered as open-source with the requirement that the copyright notice and permissions be included in any distribution of substantial copies of the code. \u00a0Also: The chip industry is going to need a lot more software to catch Nvidia's lead in AIThe original Triton unveiling happened with a paper put out by Tillet in 2019 while a graduate student at Harvard University, along with his advisors, H. T. Kung and David Cox.\u00a0   The problem Tillet set out to solve was how to make a language that would be more expressive than the vendor-specific libraries for AI, such as Nvidia's cuDNN, meaning, able to handle a wide variety of operations on matrices involved in neural networks; and at the same time be portable and have performance comparable to cuDNN and similar vendor libraries.\u00a0   Programming GPUs directly in CUDA, according to Tillet and the team, is just too difficult. For example, writing native kernels, or functions, for GPUs \"can be surprisingly difficult due to the many intricacies of GPU programming,\" Tillet and team write in the post.      The programming challenge of moving assigning data and instructions across the memory hierarchy of a multi-core GPU. OpenAIIn particular, \"GPUs remain incredibly challenging to optimize for locality and parallelism,\" as the Triton documentation explains.\u00a0   But Tillet also wanted the language to be easier to program than custom efforts to date, based on what are called \"micro-kernels\" that \"involve a lot of manual effort.\" In particular, Triton is presented as an alternative to the two main approaches used in place of vendor libraries, which are called polyhedral compilation and scheduling languages.\u00a0   What Tillet settled on is an approach called tiles. Tiles, which are used extensively in CUDA programming, take the matrices used in a machine learning program and break them into fragments that can be efficiently distributed across shared SRAM memory and fast register memory and efficiently operated on via multiple threads of instruction in parallel.   However, doing parallelization in CUDA is difficult because of things such as the need to make explicit synchronisation statements between instruction threads of a program.   Also: What is GPT-3? Everything your business needs to know about OpenAI's breakthrough AI language programTriton's semantics specifies tiles as built-in types so that a Triton compiler can do the work of figuring out how those fragments can be efficiently apportioned among the many cores of a GPU and their accompanying registers.\u00a0   Effectively, the work of parallelizing and optimizing code is pushed from the language down into the compiler.\u00a0   As Tillet puts it, the compiler \"automatically perform[s] a wide variety of important program optimizations.\"   \"For example, data can be automatically stashed to shared memory by looking at the operands of computationally intensive block-level operations.\"      The instruction flow, from a programmer's coding into the Trition intermediate representation, and then into LLVM compiler intermediate representation, and then into the Parallel Thread Execution, or PTX, that is the low-level language for controlling the GPU. The Triton programmer's high-level code is first turned into an intermediate representation that is inspired by the intermediate representation found in the open-source LLVM compiler infrastructure. As Tillet described it in the original paper, \"just a few data- and control-flow extensions to LLVM-IR could enable various tile-level optimization passes which jointly lead to performance on-par with vendor libraries.\"   The intermediate representation is then fed to a just-in-time compiler that does the work of fashioning the various matrices into fragments in a way that will optimally fit in the shared memory and the registers of GPU cores.\u00a0   The JIT organizes threads of instruction inside GPU cores to pull from the same values in the main memory, called \"memory coalescing.\" Likewise, the JIT places data that are of mutual interest to such threads into shared memory for efficient manipulation, known as \"shared memory allocation.\"   As Tillet describes it, the result are programs that are \"single-threaded and automatically parallelized.\" The JIT is doing the work of auto-tuning the tiles, the data fragments, to most efficiently distribute them amongst cores.\u00a0   In the original Triton paper, Tillet proposed a C-like form of Triton based on the syntax of CUDA. In this new 1.0 release, however, Triton is integrated with Python. The details are spelled out in the blog post.\u00a0   The benefit of using Triton should be an immediate speed-up in developing some essential operations of neural networks. As Tillet spells out in the blog post, \"It can be used to write FP16 matrix multiplication kernels that match the performance of cuBLAS,\" an Nvidia library that implements the open-source Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, \"something that many GPU programmers can't do -- in under 25 lines of code.\"       OpenAITillet works on the project full-time at OpenAI, he said, under the supervision of OpenAI's head of supercomputing, Chris Berner. But also has help on the Triton project from several OpenAI staff members.\u00a0   \"Recently, several OpenAI employees and researchers -- all without GPU programming experience -- have contributed code and ideas to the project,\" Tillet told ZDNet. \"We've used it to accelerate and rewrite a large portion of our GPU kernels, and we are committed to making it even more broadly applicable through subsequent releases.\"   Tillet noted that the project has received \"meaningful contributions\" from outside OpenAI, including Da Yan of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the team working on Microsoft's DeepSpeed optimization library, and commercial AI startup Anthropic.   Wednesday's blog post does not emphasize performance metrics other than to say that Triton can match CuBLAS. However, in the original paper by Tillet, the Triton-C version of the language was able to get better performance than Nvidia's CuDNN library when running what is called deep convolutions, operations that treat input as groups of locally-related data, such as image pixels.   Note that the software for the moment is only for Nvidia GPUs; it is not yet available for AMD's GPUs, nor will it compile to CPUs. The authors invite collaborators interested in those chips to join the effort. \u00a0 \u00a0   Also:\u00a0Graphcore brings new competition to Nvidia in the latest MLPerf AI benchmarksTillet's language effort comes at an interesting time for the field of AI hardware acceleration. Nvidia has substantial competition from AI chip and system startups such as Cerebras Systems, Graphcore, and SambaNova. Those companies all have various chip architectures that can apportion parallel computations to multiple on-die cores. SambaNova, in fact, has a so-called data flow architecture for its chip that shares some of the principles of Triton.\u00a0   However, all of those vendors have had to develop their own software tools to optimize the movement of PyTorch and TensorFlow programs to their computers. In contrast, Nvidia has the advantage of over a decade of development of CUDA and a wide developer base for the software.   It's conceivable that Triton could be one of the new software tools that competition needs to get a broad, open-source platform for their chips.\u00a0    Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      OpenAI wants to trade gov't access to AI models for fewer regulations\n      \n      Google claims Gemma 3 reaches 98% of DeepSeek's accuracy - using only one GPU\n      \n      What is DeepSeek AI?

This is highly helpful as you won\u2019t have to depend on a game to do the work, and you\u2019ll have more over the settings. As I only have access to Nvidia GPUs, this guide will only apply to Nvidia GPUs.\nWhy would you want to enable a frame rate limit?\nWhen a GPU is running at either an uncapped frame rate or a higher frame rate, it uses more power. The more power it uses, the hotter it gets. The hotter it gets, the harder the fans work and the louder they get. Now, depending on how your computer case is in terms of ventilation, you could be sending your GPU to an early grave. That\u2019s not to say that more frame rates are bad because it isn\u2019t. However, not every game needs 60 or more frames per second. Unless you\u2019re playing an FPS or racing game, you\u2019re just wasting power. Not to mention, if you have a monitor or TV that can\u2019t do more than 60Hz, you\u2019re wasting your precious power.\nHow to enable a frame rate cap with MSI Afterburner\n\nMSI Afterburner is perhaps the most popular GPU software suite and is used for several things. From frame rate capping, frame rate settings, overclocking, and more. For this guide, we\u2019re going to focus on setting a frame rate cap.\nDownload and install MSI Afterburner if you don\u2019t already have it. If you\u2019re downloading and installing it, the installer will include both MSI Afterburner and Rivatuner.\nOpen up MSI Afterburner by locating it either via the program menu for Windows 7/8/10/11 or by locating it in the lower right-hand corner of your desktop. It will look like a fighter jet, so you can\u2019t miss it.\nBefore you do anything else, you may want to click the \u201cStartup\u201d option. This will make sure that MSI Afterburner and Rivatuner will start on reboot. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to launch it every time you reboot/ restart your PC. You can also enable this by going to the \u201cGeneral\u201d option once you click the gear icon and select \u201cStart with Windows\u201d and \u201cStart minimized\u201d under \u201cGeneral properties.\u201d\nClose MSI Afterburner, locate Rivatuner in your Programs, select \u201cRivatuner Statistic Server,\u201d and launch it. If you don\u2019t see it, look at your desktop in the taskbar and click on the icon that looks like a monitor with red font in it and click it.\nOnce Rivetuner is opened, enable \u201cStart with Windows.\u201d\nNow, it\u2019s time to set the frame rate cap. On the right-hand side, you\u2019ll see several options. What you want is \u201cFramerate Limit.\u201d There, you need to put in your desired frame rate cap number. For example, if you want to cap your frame rate to \u201c60\u201d, you would enter \u201c60\u201d.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. Now, whenever you launch a game, the frame rate will be capped to whatever number you enter. This will override the frame rate cap in any game you\u2019re playing as well.\nHow to enable a frame rate limit with Nvidia Control Panel\nNot too long ago, Nvidia also added a method to cap your frame rate using the Nvidia control panel. And while this option is available, I\u2019ve found that using Rivatuner is the better solution. However, both methods work, and it is ultimately up to you to decide which you want to use.\n\nRight-click the desktop and select Nvidia Control Panel from the drop-down menu.\nUnder 3D settings, select \u201cMax Frame Rate,\u201d you may have to scroll down to find it.\nOnce there, click on \u201cOff\u201d and then select \u201cOn\u201d and either scroll or type in your desired frame rate. Be sure to click \u201cApply\u201d and the bottom to save the settings.\n\n\nThis will set the frame rate for all of your games. If you want to do this for a specific game, all you have to do is click on \u201cProgram Settings,\u201d locate the game and then select \u201cMax Frame Rate\u201d and apply the fourth step from above.\n\n\n\nframe rate cap MSI Afterburner nvidia Nvidia control panel PC\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Mitchell\n\n\n\nX (Twitter)\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nKeith has been a fan of geek culture and video games ever since his father gifted him his first gaming console many decades ago and has used this love of for the genres to start The Outerhaven.

Although the game is already safe to play, says Amazon, it will release a patch that caps fps on the menu screen to \"reassure\" players. Here's the full statement:Hundreds of thousands of people played in the New World Closed Beta yesterday, with millions of total hours played. We\u2019ve received a few reports of players using high-performance graphics cards experiencing hardware failure when playing New World.New World makes standard DirectX calls as provided by the Windows API. We have seen no indication of widespread issues with 3090s, either in the beta or during our many months of alpha testing.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nSurely not again: Worrying analysis shows Nvidia's RTX 5090 Founders Edition graphics card may be prone to melting power connectors\n\n\n\n\nThe unwelcome workaround for Nvidia's RTX 50-series black screen issues is to hobble your gaming monitor with a 60 Hz refresh rate\n\n\n\nThe New World Closed Beta is safe to play. In order to further reassure players, we will implement a patch today that caps frames per second on our menu screen. We\u2019re grateful for the support New World is receiving from players around the world, and will keep listening to their feedback throughout Beta and beyond.Earlier in the day, an Amazon customer service rep acknowledged an issue with \"Nvidia RTX 3090 Series & 100% GPU Usage\" in a forum post. The developer recommends turning off \"the overrides in the driver settings,\" but the only specific instruction given is to set 'Max Frame Rate' to 'Off' in the Nvidia control panel (its default state) and rely on the in-game frame rate limiting option.Original story: The closed beta for Amazon's New World MMO just went live yesterday, and today there are multiple reports that it's somehow killing GeForce RTX 3090 graphics cards.That's hardware that's mighty tough to replace right now.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The reports have come through the New World subreddit (crossposted in r/nvidia) after greyone78 posted about the death of their RTX 3090.

Software should not be able to just kill a piece of tech in 2021. There are meant to be a whole raft of fail safes built into your hardware which should stop it overheating, clocking too high, or drawing more power than it can handle.\u00a0That's how come overclocking is pretty much fool-proof these days... if a little unrewarding.But seemingly those fail safes aren't so safe in New World, with the game overheating GPUs and causing power spikes all over the place. The general consensus seems to be that it's down to uncapped frame rates in menu screens, with the graphics silicon getting far too excited and drawing too much juice through its VRMs and frying them.This isn't the first time something like this has happened: Starcraft II was another culprit back in the day.If you run New World either with a capped frame rate from the off, or with your GPU underclocked or undervolted, with a strict power limit engaged, there's a very high chance you won't kill your expensive graphics card.\u00a0Breaking: For people playing New World please cap your FPS.This will help prevent any issues that people have been having with their GPU\u2019s being fried.Go to Settings > Visuals > Max fps > Set this to 60, this will bring the utilization back down. pic.twitter.com/mXGcyixFgiJuly 21, 2021But there's no way I'm going to try and dive into the New World beta and see if my RTX 3090 can handle it until we get an update from Amazon or Nvidia about what is causing this, if these reports are accurate.I'm all for pushing hardware to the limit, but y'know, there is a limit.(Image credit: Amazon)It does also seem to be an issue peculiar to EVGA cards at the moment, though New World is evidently pushing other GPUs too hard as well, with reports of unnecessarily high power usage in menu screens and stupidly high temperatures as a result.That means there's an argument about whether it's a hardware issue or a game issue. \"Encountered same issue, EVGA 3090 FTW with power supply of over 1000w,\" says one Reddit user. \"I guess this is not a game issue, the cards were just bad and waiting for the right conditions to fail.\"\"Add me to the list.\" writes another. \"EVGA 3090 FTW3 - ran fine for about 30 mins > black screen game audio still going > fans shot up to 100% right after black screen > hard reset and now no video.\"Though the fact it's tied around one specific game, and only in the settings screens, makes it tough to swallow that the game itself has nothing to do with the issue. We have reached out to both Amazon Game Studios and EVGA for a response to these issues.It's still makes for pretty heart-breaking reading when more and more reports on reddit roll in about cards being killed by a simple game beta test: \"This just happened to me too. Booted up the game for the first time, I was on the Brightness calibration screen, and clicking Restore Defaults sent all my fans into overdrive, blasting off to Mars. Screen went black and video output wouldn't come back. I hard reset, and the GPU doesn't turn on anymore, except for the red light of death. Same card! EVGA 3090 FTW3. Been using it since Feb, no issues whatsoever.\"Around the launch of Nvidia's RTX 30-series cards there were several reports of cards failing because of their power componentry not being up to the job. A lot of the blame was put on the capacitors, but VRMs got some blame too. EVGA itself noted that some of its early boards, those that went out to reviewers, had insufficiently capable capacitors, but they supposedly never got out into retail.Nvidia salved these issues by releasing a driver that pulled back a little on the power front and since then we've not really seen any problems. Certainly with a PowerColor RTX 3080 we had which kept falling over before the patch, it was far happier after.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restI'd guess Amazon will learn its lesson\u2014with Bezos back from space, and now such a man of action, he'll probably drop in a hard coded frame limiter himself.But that's not a great look for New World, a title which is somewhat carrying the torch for Amazon in terms of its gaming credentials. It's not had a great track record after all, what with the dreadful Grand Tour game, shooter Crucible being released, unreleased, and then cancelled, and then brawler Breakaway going nowhere at all.\u00a0So, being the killer of GPUs amidst a GPU drought may be something that sticks with Amazon's new MMO even after launch.\n\n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090\nNew World\n\n\nDave JamesSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-Chief, HardwareDave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

People looking for the best mining GPU also affect the market as crypto prices can rise and fall dramatically.In a four-week span in May, prices for NVIDIA GPUs went from 238% MSRP up to 304% and then back down to 233% of their recommended price.Earlier this month, German prices for high-end GPUs fell from inflated prices as high as 304% of MSRP down to comparatively affordable prices as low as 153% of MSRP. Of course, when you consider the price of powerful graphics cards, adding 53% on top of the recommended price is a sizeable difference. That being said, current NVIDIA prices are around half of what GPUs cost at their peak in May.Graphics Card Prices in \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9 July 18, 2021\ud83d\udc49 Party is over, price reductions hit full brakes.\ud83d\udc49 Availability is the same or slightly better.\ud83d\udc49 Without any notable movement, it's difficult to predict when retail prices will come close to MSRP.https://t.co/x8VWKEZIEr pic.twitter.com/xIuOcYEDzSGraphics Card Prices in \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9 July 18, 2021\ud83d\udc49 Party is over, price reductions hit full brakes.\ud83d\udc49 Availability is the same or slightly better.\ud83d\udc49 Without any notable movement, it's difficult to predict when retail prices will come close to MSRP.https://t.co/x8VWKEZIEr pic.twitter.com/xIuOcYEDzS\u2014 3DCenter.org (@3DCenter_org) July 19, 2021July 19, 2021While the graphics card market showed promise as of earlier this month, the drops seem to have stopped. Since the beginning of July, AMD prices have gone up by three percent, while NVIDIA prices fell three percent. Overall, the GPU price trend has flattened out.As explained by Tom's Hardware, market prices are complex. Because businesses have to offset the cost of previously purchased stock, there's often a delay between events that can affect pricing and actual price drops.The analysis also only looks at German pricing. These prices are a good indicator of market trends but could vary from other regions.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Even though prices have been relatively flat for a couple of weeks, it's still a better time to buy a GPU than it has been in months.\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nSean EndicottSocial Links NavigationNews Writer and apps editorSean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

That product is the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100. The basic concept is combining a BlueField-2 DPU that includes an Arm-based CPU, Mellanox NIC, and associated memory and storage along with a NVIDIA A100 GPU. We reached out to NVIDIA about the product and did not get much back. Still, this is an early product that demonstrates the reason\u00a0NVIDIA acquired Mellanox\u00a0and also the power of a DPU so we wanted to highlight it.\nNVIDIA BlueField-2 A100\nNVIDIA has discussed a few concepts for adding Mellanox IP plus GPUs in the past. Specifically, we focused on the NVIDIA EGX A100 previously. We also heard about the NVIDIA BlueField-2X\u00a0which looks similar but with a major difference. The NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100 is a bit different. Here is the photo of the EGX A100 again:\nNVIDIA EGX A100 Converged Accelerator Cover\nThe EGX A100 is using a ConnectX-6 NIC with a NVIDIA A100 GPU, but this is not the DPU version. The PCB has a cutout at the end for a fan and the top of the PCB has NVLink connectors. We can contrast this with the BlueField-2 A100:\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 A100 DPU 800\u00d7600\nAs you can see, we have what appears to be the higher-end NVIDIA BlueField-2 ports on the faceplate. Here is the 100GbE/ IB BlueField-2 DPU as an example:\nNVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU 2x 100GbE\nWe can see that the out-of-band management port and the data ports are flipped on the A100 version. This is similar to what we saw with the BlueField-2X:\nNVIDIA BlueField 2X DPU Overview\nAt first, one may think that this looks very similar to the BlueField-2 A100. There is a significant difference though. If we look at the top portion of the BlueField-2X the edge of the PCB is flat.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2X DPU Cover\nWhen we zoom into the BlueField-2 A100 one can see that we have top edge connectors as we saw on the EGX A100 and also A100 PCIe GPUs.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 A100 DPU Zoom\nNVIDIA has three sets of top connectors on standard A100 PCIe cards that are used for NVLink bridges. Here are two A100\u2019s with the NVLink bridges attached:\n2x NVIDIA A100 PCIe With NVLink Bridges Installed\nIt seems like the BlueField-2 A100 is similar to the BlueField-2X except perhaps that it is using the A100 (BlueField-2X GPU was not listed) and has these edge connectors.\nWhy this is an exciting card is that the BlueField-2 A100 has the capability to put a NVIDIA A100 directly on network fabric without going through a traditional x86 server. Unlike with the EGX A100, the BlueField-2 A100 has CPU cores, memory, and storage and runs its own OS. Here is a BlueField-2 Ubuntu shot from our piece\u00a0A Quick Look at Logging Into a Mellanox NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU.\nNVIDIA BlueField 2 DPU Logged In\nThere are, of course, trade-offs with the BlueField-2 A100. One of them will need to be power and cooling. The BlueField-2 DPU uses enough power that going above 2.0GHz on its eight Arm cores means an auxiliary power connector is needed for the x16 card. Having a DPU that takes 60-75W from a PCIe power budget of 250W (or 300W with the new\u00a0NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe) is a fairly huge percentage.\nOur best guess is that this may not be seen as a training product in this generation. Instead, as we highlighted in our\u00a0ASUS RS720A-E11-RS24U review\u00a0each A100 can be split into up to seven Multi-Instance GPU (or MIG) instances.\nASUS 4x A100 Nvidia Smi Mig Instances\nMIG works extremely well with AI inference as we saw with\u00a0MLPerf Inference v1.0\u00a0and inference is often a lower-power workload on the A100. That effectively would allow a BlueField-2 A100 to be attached to a network and provide an AI inference node.\nFinal Words\nAll of this is fun, but we have yet to see this in the field. Still, it shows the vision of where this is headed and one can see the early precursor to the\u00a0Arm-azing Grace\u00a0in the future. If you read STH, and are still unsure about what a DPU is, we have\u00a0What is a DPU A Data Processing Unit Quick Primer\u00a0and video:\n\nIf you want to learn more about the continuum of current NIC solutions in the market to understand what is a SmartNIC v. DPU or DPU v. an exotic solution like Intel\u2019s IPU, you can see\u00a0the STH NIC Continuum Framework\u00a0with a video here:\n\nHopefully, we will see these products in the wild instead of just renderings. NVIDIA did not confirm exact specs for us, but we were told this is an A100 with a BlueField-2 DPU on a single PCIe card. We can update this if we get more specs.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSA100ARMBlueField-2DPUGPUMellanoxNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleACASIS M03 Dual-Bay NVMe Docking Station Type C ReviewNext articleAdvantech 5G Edge Carrier Server Solutions Quick Look Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

You can probably find one of these for around 2312 USD on ebay and while they were originally meant to be a collector's item they are actually ending up in prebuilt mining rigs. Considering the fact that these cards are almost impossible to find and ASUS only sent a few shipments to North America, it is hard to believe that these retailers would have received these cards without AIC involvement.\nRelated Story ASUS BETA BIOS 1202 For AM5 Motherboards \u2013 Offers Optimizations For Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D, Also Adds AI Cache Boost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe single consolation is that with Ethereum's shift to Proof of Stake mining upcoming this year, it is the beginning of the end for GPU mining. While miners will almost certainly shift to other coins, in a few years, most legitimate cryptocurrencies will have moved to staking - eliminating the need for power-hungry GPU mining. This combined with NVIDIA's push with LHR cards means that gamers should actually have access to affordable GPUs before the year is over.\nChina is a huge global market and the crackdown there, coupled with NVIDIAs introduction of LHR cards and the global cryptocurrency slump seems to have created the perfect conditions for a GPU price crash. As per data published by 3DCenter, prices in germany are down by almost 50% over the peak in May. On May 21, some cards were selling for as much as 304% the MSRP but have since crashed to a relatively more palatable level of 150%. In other words, prices of GPUs have basically halved there.\nRetailers in the US, like Newegg and Amazon are currently showing no signs of a slump but since the global markets are connected - it is almost inevitable before arbitrage forces US markets to copy German and Chinese markets. Prices in countries like Pakistan, which made headlines due to their exorbitant price scalping direct from AIBs like Palit, are also showing a major price depression in the 20% range with the RTX 3080 Ti available for 300,000 PKR (1898 USD) (or 158% the MSRP) down from the standard 200-300% MSRP price gauging. Cards in second hand dealing forums are already down to 140% MSRP and still falling.\nIt seems to be inevitable now, barring a huge cryptocurrency comeback (I am looking at you Bitcoin and Ethereum), that the US markets are all set for a huge GPU price crash. Scalpers on Amazon have already reduced pricing of the RTX 3080 Ti from $2999 ( a ridicolous 250% MSRP) to a very slightly better $2499 (200% MSRP) since the start of June.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nASUS Launches AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series-Based Zenbook S16 & 14 Laptops, Starting At $1,049\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS Overclocks The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 To 3.5 GHz GPU & 34 Gbps Memory On LN2 Cooling, Breaks Multiple Records\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS Is Asking A Whopping $3409 For RTX 5090 Astral, MSI Has Too Increased RTX 50 GPU Prices Drastically\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS\u2019s RTX 50-Series Gaming Laptops Prices Revealed at Best Buy: ROG Strix SCAR With RTX 5090 For $4,299\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n130\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy.In its newsletter sent Thursday morning, Hive said it has joined the Nvidia Partner Network (NPN) Cloud Service Provider program and entered into purchase agreements for Nvidia GPUs. It did not specify the number of units nor the model.Following China\u2019s recent crackdown on crypto mining, GPUs have dropped in price. Nvidia will deliver the data center-grade GPUs to Hive over the course of the year, with shipments arriving each month.Read more: Prices of GPUs Fall, Supply Increases as China Cracks Down on Crypto MiningIn 2017, Hive became the first cryptocurrency mining company with a green energy and ESG (environmental, social and governance) strategy to go public. Since then, its data center facilities in Sweden, Canada, and Iceland have been cloud-mining BTC and ETH, both of which the company keeps on its balance sheet.The \u201cinvestment in Nvidia GPUs strengthens Hive\u2019s ability to remain nimble and gives us the power to pivot in this ever changing and dynamic industry,\u201d said Frank Holmes, Hive\u2019s executive chairman, in the newsletter.Joining the Nvidia Partner Network will give Hive access to Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem, partners, customers and industry expertise which the mining firm hopes to use to transition towards a better computing infrastructure that brings more resources from the cloud.NvidiaGraphics CardsHIVE BlockchainCrypto MiningMyles ShermanJuly 2003 | Writing for CoinDesk | Austrian Economics and Mises Institute| Bitcoiner and Freedom MaximalistAboutAbout UsMastheadCareersCoinDesk NewsCrypto API DocumentationContactContact UsAccessibilityAdvertiseSitemapSystem StatusDISCLOSURE & POLICESCoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The likes of Nintendo have struggled to keep up with demand for the Switch, and customers looking to purchase a new Nvidia or AMD graphics card have been sorely disappointed as prices for tech skyrocket and most leave empty-handed. However, it's entirely possible that there may be a sliver of hope as retail prices begin to drop in parts of the world. \nA recent report shows that prices for Nvidia and AMD products have started dropping in Germany. While GPUs are still 53% more expensive than they ideally should be, a graph indicates that, while still costly, the price has come down to its lowest since February of this year. At its highest point, graphics cards were more than 200% higher than the recommended retail selling price, brought on largely by the deficit that's been raging on for some time now.\nRELATED: Leaked Image Shows Possible Reveal for AMD RX 6600 XT Card\nThe source shows that such cards as the GeForce RTX 3080 have dropped to as low as \u20ac1,199, or around $1,415 US, which is still much higher than normal given that the manufacturer's recommended price is around \u20ac720, or $850 US. However, it has come down significantly since around May where customers would expect to pay upwards of $3,500 US, if not more. This is arguably a good sign of things to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth reiterating that this is related to just the German market for now. There doesn't seem to be any price reductions on graphics cards for the US or other western markets. However, Nvidia recently announced it would increase production of its RTX 3060 card at the same time that prices were seen dropping in China. This suggests that there is a trend starting to happen, although quite slowly, and it's entirely possible that more countries will begin dropping prices for hardware, which could very well mean the deficit is finally on the mend.\nThis is only speculation at this stage, however. Tech companies such as IBM have warned that the current global shortages could on up until 2022, if not further. While that's not to say things won't start to get better sooner, it's still not certain what the market will look like over the coming weeks and months, and even if availability does increase, many products may still be at much higher prices. There is arguably room for cautious optimism, but many will likely have their ears to the ground to see whether prices drop in other parts of the world before making a move.\nMORE: Comparing the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080Ti Graphics Card to the 3080 and 3090\nSource: VideoCardz \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSave on GameSir Cyclone 2, a Wireless Controller With Hall Effect Triggers and Customization Features\n\t\t\n\n\nGame Deals\n\nThe GameSir Cyclone 2 controller is now more affordable, offering precise input and multiple connectivity options.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatti Robinson\n\n\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Confirms Release Date and Massive Price Tag\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nDalton Cooper\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAtari Reveals New Console\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nOph\u00e9lie Castelot\n\n\nAug 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSony Working on PlayStation Controller With Unique Feature\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCharming Holiday\n\n\nMar 11, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRumor: Sony May Be Working on Native PS3 Backwards Compatibility\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nEdiz Guner\n\n\nJun 23, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow to Change Characters in Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\t\t\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nPlayers will need to wait until the game's ninth chapter before they can switch freely between Yasuke and Naoe in Assassin's Creed Shadows.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow GDC Main Stage: A Developer's Concert Went From Experiment to Annual Tradition\n\t\t\n\n\nGDC\n\nGame Rant interviews legendary composer Austin Wintory about how GDC Main Stage: A Developer's Concert went from being an experiment to a tradition.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe Fallout Series Has Built-In Potential For a Call of Duty-Like FPS\n\t\t\n\n\nFallout\n\nFallout has a piece of important ingrained lore that would translate smoothly into an experience along the lines of Call of Duty.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBattlefield 2042 War Machine Event Adds Fan Favorite Game Mode With a Twist\n\t\t\n\n\nBattlefield 6\n\nEA updates Battlefield 2042 with an all-new limited-time event complete with a new battle pass, specialist skins, modes, and more.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReignbreaker: How to Get Keys and Resolves\n\t\t\n\n\nReignbreaker\n\nTired of dying to enemies in Reignbreaker?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorJul 02, 2021, 01:58pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Arm CEO Simon SegarsArm\nThere were a number of interesting developments regarding NVIDIA\u2019s potential $40B acquisition of Arm over the past couple of weeks. High-ranking executives from three of Arm\u2019s key chip partners \u2013 namely MediaTek, Marvell and Broadcom \u2013 all came out in favor of the deal, citing similar reasons for support. To summarize, the execs claimed that investments by NVIDIA, in conjunction with the company\u2019s deep expertise in graphics processors (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), would ultimately benefit Arm and bolster the entire chip industry that relies on Arm\u2019s IP ecosystem. They also went on record affirming their belief that NVIDIA would continue Arm\u2019s open licensing model and not limit partner access to bleeding-edge Arm technology.\n\n\nIt is no surprise that multiple industry heavyweights have spoken out about the potential deal. NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition of Arm could have far reaching implications that resonate throughout the technology industry, due to the pervasiveness of Arm\u2019s IP and the company\u2019s current business model, which licenses core processor architecture innovations to many chip partners. Arm technology is quite literally everywhere, from cellphones to cars, industrial equipment, the IoT, and the data center.\n\nArm CEO Says NVIDIA Is The Way, Not IPO\nHowever, there are some players in the space that aren\u2019t quite as keen on NVIDIA\u2019s plans. Some recent chatter also suggested that there is an opportunity for Softbank, the current Japanese owner of Arm, to consider an IPO option. In lieu of NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition, an IPO could allow some of Arm\u2019s partners to directly invest in the company, to help solidify its financial positions and maintain the status quo. Simon Segars, the current CEO of Arm Holdings plc, however, took to the company\u2019s blog today to quash the IPO idea and reaffirm his support for the NVIDIA acquisition, stating that it was essentially the only viable path forward.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen HuangNVIDIA\nSegars made a number of assertions, which seem to make sense in the current climate. With the rapid pace of innovation and advancement in the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) space, a straightforward cash infusion from an IPO isn\u2019t ideal and doesn\u2019t cater to Arm\u2019s unique needs. Segars asserts that Arm would benefit significantly more by partnering with a leader in the AI field, which is exactly what NVIDIA is, and that NVIDIA\u2019s expertise, in conjunction with the cash infusion that would come by way of the $40 billion acquisition, is the best path forward.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\u201cNow is the time for us to take our scale to the next level to address the technology challenges ahead. We contemplated an IPO but determined that the pressure to deliver short-term revenue growth and profitability would suffocate our ability to invest, expand, move fast and innovate. Combining with NVIDIA will give us the scale, resources and agility needed to maximize the opportunities ahead. This deal is the best opportunity for Arm and our customers and will enable the UK to be a meaningful industry player in the age of AI,\u201d noted Segars in his post this morning.\n\nArm Chief Underscores Commitment To Investment In The UKNVIDIA DGX SupercomputersNVIDIA\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that Softbank considered an Arm IPO last year, but ultimately decided that engaging with NVIDIA was the better move. Further, with respect to the notion that an NVIDIA acquisition would be detrimental to jobs and economic growth in the UK tech industry, Segars firmly insists that NVIDIA \u201cwill not siphon investment away from the UK,\u201d rather it will invest specifically in the expansion of Arm\u2019s Cambridge headquarters to help build a \u201cworld-class AI research facility,\u201d at the center of which will be one of the world\u2019s most powerful Arm-powered supercomputers for leading scientists, engineers and researchers to harness for the evolution of AI, which is certainly one of the most critical technology growth areas of our time.\nFurther, in an interview with the Telegraph, Segars goes on to suggest that an IPO would be the \u201cworst place to go\u201d suggesting Arm would need to cut costs after its long-term investment in staffing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got over 6,400 people today, that is significantly higher than what it was when we were acquired [by SoftBank], and our profitability is very, very low,\u201d Segars notes. In fact, this statement suggests maybe, if the acquisition isn\u2019t approved, Arm may actually have to trim head count.\nThe Arm Chief continues with reassurances that both Arm and NVIDIA are committed to maintaining the company\u2019s open licensing model, noting that it\u2019s an \u201ceconomic and commercial necessity,\u201d which makes sense as well. Arm\u2019s entire business model is centered around partner adoption and implementation of its core IP. If the combined entity moved to close this off in any significant way, it would be like biting off its nose to spite its face.\nThere\u2019s a bit more road ahead to travel with the regulatory approval process in any potential NVIDIA-Arm acquisition deal, but there\u2019s one thing for certain and it\u2019s that Arm\u2019s executive leadership is firmly behind the acquisition and truly believes NVIDIA is its best partner moving forward, not only for its massive $40 billion dollar investment, which is the biggest the semiconductor industry has ever seen, but for the strategic synergies that NVIDIA brings to the table for Arm. When it comes to AI and the breakneck pace of innovation that the technology industry in general is currently marching towards, we\u2019re bound to have at least a couple of these tectonic shift-like events like this. You learn to be surprised by almost nothing.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Thanks to a wide array of audio and video broadcasting features presented in an accessible manner. \nAs part of the NVIDIA Broadcast app, you can add various effects such as noise removal, background blur, and background removal, among others. AI makes all of this possible.\nInstalling and using the app is relatively simple if you have an RTX 20 series GPU or later. You can also use it in tandem with various video conferencing software such as Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and more. \n                        How to Set Up NVIDIA Broadcast\n               \nDownloading and installing NVIDIA Broadcast is quite simple. However, you need to take note of the system requirements. At a minimum, you must have an RTX 20 series GPU or later, 8 GB of RAM, Intel Core i5 8600, or a Ryzen R5 2600 processor.\nAnother prerequisite is that your PC should be running on a 64-bit version of Windows 10. \n            Install NVIDIA Broadcast\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Open your web browser and go to the NVIDIA Broadcast App download page.\n                        \n\n                                        Then click Download Now and run the file once it has been downloaded.\n                        \n\n                                        The installer will further download about 400 MB of additional files.\n                        \n\n                                        Follow the steps in the installation wizard, and finally click on Restart Now.\n                        \n\n                                        After your computer reboots, the NVIDIA Broadcast app is practically ready to use.\n                        \n\n\n            Setting Up NVIDIA Broadcast\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Run the NVIDIA Broadcast application. The interface is fairly minimalistic, and there is not a lot you need to do.\n                        \n\n                                        You should see three options at the top of the interface: Microphone, Speakers, and Camera.\n                        \n\n                                        Click on Microphone.\n                        \n\n                                        Under Microphone Source, select your primary mic from the drop-down menu. You can also cycle between effects using the Effect menu. Click on the toggle to activate the effect.\n                        \n\n                                        Now, click on Speakers, and similarly, select your speakers and the effect.\n                        \n\n                                        Lastly, click on Camera and choose your primary webcam. The Effect panel in Camera has multiple effects that you can choose from.\n                        \n\n                                        Now, whenever you launch an application that is using NVIDIA Broadcast as the video and audio source, the effects you selected will come into play.\n                        \n\n\n                        Use NVIDIA Broadcast With Zoom\n               \nOne of the most common video-calling programs today is Zoom. The NVIDIA Broadcast application is completely compatible with Zoom and only requires you to make a few adjustments within the Zoom application to get it working.\nRelated: Zoom Apps to Make Video Calls Better and More Productive\nBasically, you need to change your audio and video source to NVIDIA Broadcast, in the Zoom application. Here's how you can do it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Launch the Zoom desktop application.\n                        \n\n                                        Click on the Settings cog on the top right-hand corner of the app.\n                        \n\n                                        In the navigation bar on the left, click on Video.\n                        \n\n                                        Under Camera, choose Camera (NVIDIA Broadcast).\n                        \n\n                                        Again, click on Audio in the navigation bar on the left.\n                        \n\n                                        Under Microphone, select Microphone (NVIDIA Broadcast).\n                        \n\n                                        You can also choose to have NVIDIA Broadcast under Speaker as well. But it is not necessary.\n                        \n\n                                        Close Settings and use Zoom as you normally would.\n                        \n\n\n                        Use NVIDIA Broadcast With Microsoft Teams\n               \nMicrosoft Teams is another feature-rich video conferencing suite that is aimed at organizations and working professionals. Even though it has basic features such as background blur and noise suppression, it isn't as good as NVIDIA Broadcast.\nTo integrate NVIDIA Broadcast into Microsoft Teams, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Open the Microsoft Teams desktop application.\n                        \n\n                                        Click on the three horizontal dots next to your profile picture on the top-right-hand corner of the title bar.\n                        \n\n                                        Now click on Settings.\n                        \n\n                                        Head to the Devices section using the navigation bar on the left.\n                        \n\n                                        In the Audio devices section, under Microphone, select Microphone (NVIDIA Broadcast).\n                        \n\n                                        Scroll down and under Camera, choose Camera (NVIDIA Broadcast).\n                        \n\n                                        Close settings and restart Microsoft Teams to see the changes.\n                        \n\nSome users have reported not being able to use their camera with Microsoft Teams. Luckily, there are multiple ways to fix this Microsoft Teams camera not working error. \n                        Use NVIDIA Broadcast With Discord\n               \nDiscord is mostly used for having in-game conversations. But with its rapid expansion of features, it has now become a place for friends and family to meet virtually. There are several tips and tricks that all Discord users should know.\nYou can use NVIDIA Broadcast to create cool green-screen effects in Discord without the need for a green screen.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Bandai Namco)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GPUs have many settings designed to adapt to your preferences, but there\u2019s one in particular we recommend you change. Hidden within the Nvidia Control Panel is an option that may be ruining your display\u2019s color and brightness.When I jumped back into Dark Souls III last month, I noticed the game\u2019s colors were faded and that darker areas looked unnaturally bright. This issue plagued my experience for some time, but after experimenting, I found out how to ensure my GPUs dynamic range output was utilizing a full range of colors.More: How to put Windows 10 into Safe ModeHere's how to update Windows 10 graphics driversThis is how to Enter the BIOS on a Windows 10 PCLimited vs Full dynamic rangeMost PC users will have their dynamic range set to Full already, but we recommend going through the following steps just in case. Being stuck with a limited color range will greatly impede upon any game\u2019s visuals. However, before we explain how to fix it, let's go over what exactly Limited and Full dynamic ranges look like.\u00a0(Image credit: Bandai Namco)The difference between the two is easily visible with Dark Souls III\u2019s loading screen. On the left half of the above image, I've set the dynamic range to Full to allow the GPU to output the entire color spectrum from 0-255. Zero is the darkest a color can be, which is what the background is made up of, and it\u2019s why it appears as a pleasant inky black.\u00a0On the right side of this image, we see what happens when the dynamic range is set to Limited, which forces the GPU to only output values from 16-235. This means a color\u2019s darkest point is restricted to 16, which is why the background appears as a faded gray (16) rather than pitch black (0). We can also see that the white letters reading \u201cDark Souls III\u201d appear less vivid when compared to the letters on the left side. This is because its brightest point is forced down to 235 rather than a maximum of 255.This isn\u2019t just limited to black and white; setting a GPU\u2019s dynamic range to Limited restricts the range of colors that can be displayed in general. If a creator intends to display a pure bright red (RGB 255, 0, 0), the GPU will instead show a darker hue (RGB 235, 16, 16). Inaccurately displaying colors and brightness results in an unpleasant faded appearance to every scene. Without the darkest blacks and brightest whites, there will be a noticeable lack of depth in a game\u2019s world.It\u2019s also important to note that setting the dynamic range to Full doesn't change anything on your computer; it simply alters what\u2019s being sent to your monitor. If I were to take screenshots of a game on my computer while the dynamic range is set to Limited, these images would appear as if it was set to Full.Stay in the know with Laptop MagGet our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Left (Limited) vs. Right (Full) (Image credit: Bandai Namco)I experienced this issue first hand when Bluepoint\u2019s Demon\u2019s Souls launched last year. I took frequent images and recorded my playthrough with a capture card, yet both the footage and screenshots looked more vivid than what I was seeing on my display. I later discovered that my PS5\u2019s color range was set to Limited.\u00a0So, without further ado, here\u2019s how to make sure your GPU\u2019s dynamic range output is set to Full:How to set dynamic range to Full on Nvidia GPUs\u00a0Before we begin, keep in mind that this tutorial is only for PCs equipped with a Nvidia GPU. Right-click your desktop and select the \u201cNVIDIA Control Panel\u201d option.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Once the control panel is open, look under the \u201cDisplay\u201d tab and select \u201cChange resolution.\u201d(Image credit: Future)Ensure the desired monitor is selected. Ideally, this should be the one you play games on (but it\u2019s probably best to ensure all your monitors have the correct settings).\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Select your desired resolution and refresh rate.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Under \u201cApply the following settings,\u201d ensure that \u201cUse NVIDIA color settings\u201d is toggled. Once it is, you can change \u201cOutput dynamic range\u201d from \u201cLimited\u201d to \u201cFull.\u201d\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Viola! Full-screen games should now look more vivid with a noticeably greater color range. The Limited option is typically reserved for older televisions, and that setting is automatically applied if the hardware detects it\u2019s connected to one. This detection didn\u2019t work too well for me, as it seems both my PC and PS5 assumed my Dell S2721HGF was a television and automatically set the dynamic range to Limited.You can also change this setting on PS5, and we have a handy guide on how to do so.\u00a0Today's best Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3 Months deals6 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 \u00a344.97View Deal \u00a344.99View DealWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaire TabariSocial Links NavigationStaff WriterSelf-described art critic and unabashedly pretentious, Claire finds joy in impassioned ramblings about her closeness to video games.

It looks like AMD will also be taping out its first Navi 3X GPUs later this year which will surprisingly be more power-efficient than the gaming architecture powering NVIDIA's next-gen GeForce RTX GPUs.\nAMD RDNA 3 'Radeon RX' GPU Rumors: More Power Efficient Than NVIDIA Ada Lovelace, First Tape Out of MCM Design This Year\nJust a few days ago, we got to know that NVIDIA is expecting its first tape out of its next-generation Hopper MCM GPUs soon. The Hopper GPU is presumably going to be fabricated on TSMC's brand new N5 (5nm) process node whereas AMD will mix-match TSMC's 5nm and 6nm process nodes for their next-generation chiplet and monolithic RDNA 3 GPU dies.\nRelated Story AMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nAMD RDNA 3 'Radeon RX' Navi 3X GPU Tape Outs\nThe main difference lies within the production segmentation with NVIDIA Hopper aiming the server segment & AMD RDNA 3 aiming the consumer segment. The NVIDIA product line to compete with AMD's RDNA 3 GPUs will be Ada Lovelace and those are expected to feature a monolithic design. This means that AMD with its RDNA 3 GPUs will be the first to offer an MCM graphics architecture to gamers but the actual launch isn't expected until the very end of 2022.\n\nNavi31\u306f6x10\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u78ba\u4fe1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002Navi33\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u5e74\u306e\u7b2c4\u56db\u534a\u671f\u306b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3059\u308b\n\u2014 Elysian Realm (@KittyYYuko) July 22, 2021\n\n\n31 MCD Soon!32 Maybe 2022Q1?\n\u2014 Elysian Realm (@KittyYYuko) July 22, 2021\n\nAccording To KittyYYuko, a very reliable leaker with multiple correct information regarding NVIDIA & AMD GPUs posted in the past, AMD is expected to tape out multiple Navi 3X GPUs based on its RDNA 3 graphics architecture later this year. As per his latest tweet, AMD will be taping out its first MCD (Multi-Compute Die) GPU, the Navi 31, soon! In addition to Navi 31, AMD is also expected to tape out its Navi 33 GPU in the fourth quarter of 2021 while Navi 32 is expected to tape out by Q1 2022. Do remember that Navi 31 and Navi 32 are the only two chips that are said to utilized MCD while Navi 33 will feature a traditional monolithic design.\n\nWith the AMD Radeon RX 6000 series, AMD first introduced its flagship Navi 21 'Big Navi' GPUs with RDNA 2 architecture. It looks like AMD is planning to repeat the same with its next-gen 'Radeon RX 7000' series cards which would first launch in enthusiast flavors followed by mainstream offerings.\nAMD RDNA 3 'Radeon RX' Navi 3X GPU Design, Power Efficiency & Memory Layout\nMoving on, we have a series of really interesting tweets from Greymon55 who has been discussing the architectural upgrades and what to expect from RDNA 3 GPUs in general. The leaker states that while both NVIDIA Ada Lovelace and AMD RDNA 3 GPUs are going to be really power-hungry as the existing GPU lineup, AMD will have the more efficient offerings. As per current rumors, the MCD on RDNA 3 chiplet based GPUs is turning out to be very power efficient and it will take NVIDIA at least one generation to catch up to them in the gaming segment.\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1415977882526961670\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1416108295362781184\nAlso what's interesting is that both KittyYYuko states that AMD RDNA 3 'Navi 31' flagship could feature 60 WGPs which equals 120 Compute Units while Greymon55 states that the chip could reach up to 160 Compute Units. However, Kopite7kimi clarifies that 120 Compute Units per die should be the correct configuration and the full chip should reach 15,360 cores. It could be likely that the 80 WGP (160 CU) variant is a more high-end part that we haven't heard about yet like the Big Navi 21 XTX rumors.\nThere's also speculation regarding a very different CU design for chiplet based GPUs and the standard monolithic offerings such as Navi 33. There are also significant improvements to the front-end shader engine\n\n15360\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 22, 2021\n\n\nDo 31/32 use different CU design than 33? like will n31 be higher than the 10240 SP that's expected or is the CU design set in stone and just tweaked as far as core density is concerned?\n\u2014 Aldebaran (@AldebaranPRD) July 16, 2021\n\nThe memory design gets more interesting as AMD RDNA 3 GPUs are going to go insane on the Infinity Cache solution. The Navi 31 'Radeon RX' GPUs are expected to feature up to 512 MB of Infinity Cache, almost quadruple the amount featured on Navi 21 but retain the 256-bit bus interface. The cards are expected to retain GDDR6 memory dies but with faster & optimized frequency/power specs.\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1415837736943054856\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1418130096959885319\nhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1411989878598819842\nThere have been several rumors stating that the upcoming RDNA 3 GPUs are going to outperform whatever NVIDIA has to offer in terms of rasterization performance. It looks like AMD will take the lead by offering the first MCM-powered GPUs under its Radeon RX graphics card lineup. But at the same time, NVIDIA is expected to quickly transition to its MCM GPU lineup which will offer over 3x performance boost over Ampere GPUs. Following is the expected performance increase:\n\n\nNVIDIA / AMD Next-Gen Rumored GPU Performance Estimates\n\nPerf Increase\n\n\n0123\n\n\n\n\n\n0123\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Hopper (GH202)\n\n3\n\n\nAMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X)\n\n2\n\n\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace (AD102)\n\n2\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere (GA102)\n\n1\n\n\nAMD RDNA 2 (Navi 2X)\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA / AMD / Intel GPU Roadmap (Rumor)\n\n\n\n201920202021202220232024\n\n\n\n\nAMD (RDNA 1)AMD (RDNA 2)N/AAMD (RDNA 3)N/AAMD (RDNA 4)?\n\n\nNVIDIA (Turing Refresh)NVIDIA AmpereN/ANVIDIA Ampere Refresh\nNVIDIA Ada LovelaceN/ANVIDIA Hopper\n\n\nN/AXe-LPN/AXe-HPG (ARC Alchemist)TBCTBC\n\n\n\nThe AMD RDNA 3 'Navi 3X' GPU-powered Radeon RX graphics card lineup is expected to offer up to 3x performance improvement over existing RDNA 2 offerings. It would mark a major leap forward for graphics evolution and now that AMD is already onboard with next-gen technologies such as FSR and Raytracing, expect a very heated next-gen competition between the red and green teams.\n\n\n\nWhich next-generation GPUs are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X Radeon RX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (GeForce RTX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist  (ARC Graphics Cards)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D 3D V-Cache CPUs Now Available \u2013 The Best Gaming & Content Creation Package Ever!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n74\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n14\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

With the graduation from GTX to an RTX product, this means we're set to gain ray tracing and DLSS features. The latter in particular should bring a nice boost for this popular segment.\nThe RTX 3050 Ti was announced alongside the RTX 3050 for laptops a couple of months ago, but with ongoing supply constraints, it's taken us a bit longer to get samples in hand.\n\nAt the moment, pricing seems to be all over the place for laptops. Nvidia originally listed the RTX 3060 as destined for $1,000 laptops, with the RTX 3050 at $800 and presumably the RTX 3050 Ti sitting somewhere in between.\nThis would match the baseline prices of GTX 1660 Ti systems from previous generations. However these pricing targets are a bit optimistic, most realistic 3050 Ti system configurations are above $1,000, though still $100-200 less than the exact same model with the RTX 3060 inside. It's a bit hard to compare generations right now, but that should be a rough guide to where Nvidia are positioning this GPU.\n\nThe RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU is based on new GA107 silicon, which has yet to reach the desktop market. But as usual, when the RTX 3050 Ti launches on desktop, it will likely perform differently to the laptop part with the same name.\nBasic specifications comprise 20 SMs for a total of 2560 CUDA cores, 20 RT cores and 80 Tensor cores. Clock speeds up to 1695 MHz boost at 80W, or as low as 1035 MHz for the 35W configuration, giving us quite a wide power range of 35 to 80W.\nThere's also just 4GB of GDDR6 memory on a 128-bit bus, clocked at 12 Gbps. Basically the 3050 Ti is designed to be two thirds of an RTX 3060 in its SM count and VRAM capacity.\n\nNvidia is also trying to cater to both regular gaming laptops, and ultraportable systems, with the RTX 3050 Ti's large power range including 35W models that previously would have been branded as \"Max-Q.\"\nThis makes it crucially important to check the power specifications of any laptop you're buying, as 80W models won't come close to 35W models in performance, and unfortunately Nvidia is using the same name for both. Today's test system is the XMG Core 17, a neat 17-inch gaming laptop with a focus on functionality and performance.\n\nI've been positively impressed with what XMG has provided in the past in terms of cooling, build quality and overall hardware. The Core 17 is no exception and it's a simple design built for value. If you're interested in this specific XMG model check it out here, however the findings from this review should apply to many RTX 3050 Ti laptops.\n\nInternally, there is Core i7-11800H processor and 16GB of dual-channel DDR4-3200 memory, good hardware choice that won't hinder performance. There's also a 1080p 144Hz IPS display and 1TB of SSD storage. The GeForce RTX 3050 Ti inside runs at 80 - 95W with dynamic boost enabled, so we're getting a look at the highest power configuration Nvidia allows for this part. Resizable BAR is also supported.\n\nThe focus of this review will be on 1080p testing with Optimus enabled, which is the default configuration in most laptops that sees the GPU's output routed through the iGPU to the display. We've also tested at 1440p using an external display connected directly to the GPU, which gives us the least limited experience at a higher resolution. On to the charts...\nBenchmarks\nWe'll kick things off with a look at Metro Exodus, running Ultra settings at 1080p. Here the RTX 3050 Ti performs roughly on par with the RTX 2060 in average frame rate, putting it slightly ahead of the GTX 1660 Ti, all with similar power limits.\n\nHowever the 3050 Ti does have the lowest 1% low figure, despite having a powerful CPU that should not pose a CPU bottleneck for this class of GPU. In comparison to the RTX 3060, the 3050 Ti ends up 17% slower at the same power limit, and 34% slower when comparing the highest power limits each GPU has to offer.\n\nIt's a similar situation at 1440p. While the RTX 3050 Ti isn't badly unplayable, especially if you drop the quality settings from Ultra to High, this GPU still ends up 25% slower than the RTX 3060 when comparing 80W vs 80W configurations.\n\nIn Borderlands 3 tested using 1080p Ultra settings, the RTX 3050 Ti is faster than the 90W RTX 2060, a healthy 7 percent faster in fact, though this reduces to a 7 percent deficit when comparing to the 115W RTX 2060. With that said, we're looking at 11 percent faster performance than the GPU it's replacing, the GTX 1660 Ti, and 14% worse performance than the RTX 3060 at 80W.\n\nAt 1440p again you can see the RTX 3050 Ti is a class behind its RTX 3060 compatriots. In this particular game, the higher power RTX 3060 at 115W is 40% faster than the RTX 3050 Ti, which is a large performance increase though of course the higher tier GPU does have 50% more CUDA cores to go with its higher power limit.\n\nIn Red Dead Redemption 2, the RTX 3050 Ti is again on par with the RTX 2060 90W configuration at 1080p using High settings. This places it slightly faster than the GTX 1660 Ti, about 6 percent faster in this title. While this is somewhat playable at 1080p, it's a clear class below the RTX 3060, which offers 31% higher frame rates even with the lower 80-95W power model.\n\nThen at 1440p, the RTX 3050 Ti struggles. It's actually competitive with the RTX 3060 80W, but well behind the higher power variant which can offer a 60 FPS experience at this resolution and quality settings.\n\nRainbow Six Siege running at 1080p Medium settings gives us a good look at how GPU limited you'll typically be in competitive shooters. The 3050 Ti is powerful enough that it's not too far off laptops that are fully CPU limited with more powerful hardware, but it's also just slightly GPU limited, offering 220 FPS versus the 260+ FPS we know this CPU can handle. However this is clearly excellent performance for a laptop, the 3050 Ti is more than enough for this game.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla using 1080p Very High settings is a bit of a disaster for the RTX 3050 Ti. These settings present a strong VRAM limitation for a 4GB card like the 3050 Ti, with even the old GTX 1060 6GB delivering better performance due to its extra 2GB of VRAM.\nThis shows the issue with Nvidia going backwards on VRAM capacity in this price tier, the GTX 1660 Ti used to offer 6GB but the reduction to 4GB is simply not sufficient for some modern titles like this. And of course the issue is no better at 1440p, with the higher resolution straining the VRAM capacity further.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is generally not playable on the RTX 3050 Ti using Ultra settings at 1080p, this preset is simply too much for a GPU like this, so I'd strongly recommend reducing to Medium settings. VRAM does play a part in the performance deficit between this GPU and the RTX 2060, however it's not the same disaster as we just saw in Assassin's Creed. The RTX 3060 is a much better choice for this game and settings combination, offering at least 35% more performance at a similar power level.\n\nAt 1440p in this title, performance falls away even harder, now with a 1% low of just 9 FPS. This is again due to having just 4GB of VRAM, these settings are right on the edge at 1080p and probably limiting performance to some degree, then you move up to 1440p and it's just too much. This also causes issues with ray tracing, as this feature increases VRAM allocation, which in the games I tried like Cyberpunk tends to lead to a heavily compromised ray tracing experience even with DLSS enabled (you're looking at medium or lower settings with minimum level RT).\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn using maximum settings at 1080p, the RTX 3050 Ti is slightly faster than the RTX 2060 90W, delivering a nice 60 FPS experience on the native laptop display. With that said, performance is 18% behind the highest power configuration of the RTX 3060.\n\nAt 1440p, the game is still playable using the highest settings which is great to see, though you'll have to settle for below 60 FPS and ensure you aren't using Optimus.\n\nDeath Stranding at 1080p shows the RTX 3050 Ti to once again be very similar in gaming performance to the RTX 2060 90W configuration. This GPU is 15% slower than the RTX 3060 at 80W, and beyond that we start hitting CPU limitations with some GPUs.\n\nAt 1440p, while the game is playable using the Very High preset, performance is well down from the RTX 3060 in even its base 80W configuration.\n\nThe final game we're looking at in detail is Dirt 5. In this title at 1080p using the Ultra Preset, I was able to hit identical performance between the RTX 3050 Ti and the RTX 2060 at 90W, not bad. Performance ends up 15% slower than the RTX 3060 80W, and 26% slower than the higher power configuration.\n\nMeanwhile at 1440p, the 3050 Ti does hold up to some degree, though you should expect a 40 FPS experience so you might want to lower quality settings.\nPerformance Comparisons\nLooking at some head to head comparisons in the larger suite of games that we tested overall, the end result is that the RTX 3050 Ti is quite similar to the RTX 2060 at a similar power configuration.\n\nIn games that aren't VRAM or CPU limited at 1080p, on average the 3050 Ti is within a few percent. However, the reduction in VRAM from 6GB to 4GB is a killer in titles like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Control, and Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing enabled - in those games you'll need to turn down quality settings, where performance should be restored to RTX 2060 level, while the RTX 2060 is not limited in this way.\n\nThe RTX 2060 was also available in a 115W power configuration. Using a limited selection of games, the RTX 3050 Ti looks to be around 10 percent slower outside of situations where the VRAM limit comes into play. This gives a valuable look at highest power limit vs highest power limit, though I should note that the majority of 2060 gaming laptops I've seen use either an 80W or 90W limit, not 115W.\n\nThen when looking at the 3050 Ti vs GTX 1660 Ti, the 1660 Ti previously was in this weird situation where in a lot of games it wasn't that much slower than the RTX 2060 at the same sort of power limit.\nWhen comparing 80W vs 80W, the 3050 Ti was 7 percent faster in a limited selection of games at 1080p, with the best results in the 10%+ range. Though again, the VRAM limit is something to keep in mind, as the 3050 Ti has just 4GB vs the 1660 Ti's 6GB.\n\nUp against modern GPUs, the 3050 Ti doesn't fare as well. At 1080p, this mainstream GPU was 21% slower on average than the RTX 3060 configured to a similar power limit. This should give you an idea of the performance differences between the GPUs in a similar laptop chassis built for 80W, which should be useful as many laptops come with options for either GPU. This does include some VRAM limited results, without those the margin reduces to roughly 15% slower.\n\nHowever, the margin grows at 1440p, as again VRAM is a more significant factor at this resolution. While the RTX 3060 is capable at 1440p, I don't feel the RTX 3050 Ti is as suitable, and generally I'd want to stick to 1080p display options which is what this sort of GPU was designed for.\n\nComparing highest power limit vs highest power limit, it's a bit of a slaughter for the RTX 3050 Ti, as the RTX 3060 when pushed up to its maximum of 115W is a lot faster. This chart at 1080p shows the RTX 3050 TI as being 28% slower on average, though there are some large outliers in there.\nAt 1440p it gets even worse, with the RTX 3060's highest power configuration offering 50% better performance outside of VRAM limited titles, or alternatively the RTX 3050 Ti is 32% slower. This is in line with the specification differences.\n\nWhat We Learned\nStarting with the good stuff, the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti offers largely the same performance as the older RTX 2060 when configured at a similar power level. This continues Nvidia's trend of bringing improved performance on the newer generation, usually equivalent to a tier above from the previous gen. The current market makes it hard to make comparisons to previous years, but RTX 3050 Ti laptops should be cheaper than RTX 2060 laptop launch prices.\nThe 3050 Ti also offers modest performance improvements over the GTX 1660 Ti in what should be the same price class. At roughly 10% faster, it doesn't make it a must buy if GTX 1660 Ti models are available at a discount, however the RTX 3050 Ti does support ray tracing and DLSS, where the GTX 1660 Ti does not.\n\nNewer laptops should also benefit from faster CPUs which have greatly improved over the last few years. Although this is irrelevant to the RTX 3050 Ti GPU itself, it is a consideration when focusing on specific laptop models.\nOn the less stellar side, using just 4GB of VRAM feels inadequate for the performance level this GPU provides. Being RTX 2060-like in performance means the 3050 Ti should have no problem with 1080p gaming at Ultra settings, and for the most part that's true \u2013 unless texture sizes exceed the VRAM buffer, which is reduced from 6GB to 4GB of GDDR6 relative to the 2060. In some games that is insufficient even at 1080p, let alone in the future which will almost certainly see even more VRAM usage.\n\nNow, there is a place in the market for 4GB VRAM cards, entry-level options like the GTX 1650 is one example where it makes sense, as you'll often be playing on medium setting as the GPU overall isn't powerful enough for Ultra. But the RTX 3050 Ti is much faster than the GTX 1650, opening the door for gaming at higher quality settings or resolutions, where 4GB can bottleneck the card before the CUDA cores are saturated.\nThe VRAM reduction in this price category also hurts ray tracing, which tends to allocate more VRAM than traditional rasterization. It's nice to bring ray tracing to lower price tiers, but there's not much point when you don't provide enough VRAM to cope with its increased demands (or even plain rendering for that matter).\n\nThe RTX 3050 Ti also faces strong competition from Nvidia's own line-up. The RTX 3060 is much faster, offering ~35% more performance at a similar 80W power level, or 50% more when the RTX 3060 is configured at its maximum 115W limit. That's a much larger margin than in higher tiers, where something like the RTX 3070 is only 20% ahead of the 3060.\nWith the RTX 3060 usually costing $100-200 more in an otherwise equivalent laptop, the RTX 3060 is a much better deal for gamers as you get the VRAM boost and a big performance jump. Look hard enough and you can find decent mainstream or mid-range gaming laptops with this GPU without having to go too high-end.\nThat's the real stinger for those hoping for something great value that's worth buying in today's market. For less gaming centric laptops, the RTX 3050 Ti remains a solid GPU, but it's not landing that value sweet spot some were hoping for.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptops on Amazon\nCore i7 Tiger Lake Laptops on Amazon\nRyzen 7 5800H Laptops on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 13\n\n\n Got something to say?

Devices that otherwise wouldn\u2019t dream of playing the latest PC hits now have access to 1,000 fully optimized games, streamed with GeForce performance.\nThe milestone marks an increase of more than 500 games since the service left beta less than 18 months ago.\nAnd the best part? We\u2019re just getting warmed up.\nPlaying with the Best\nAll these games and more are part of the GeForce NOW library. What will you play today?\nA grand milestone like this wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the developers and publishers who opted in to stream their games on our open cloud-gaming service.\nPublishers like Riot Games, Bungie, Paradox Interactive, Epic Games and more know that bringing their games to the cloud can be easy, and enables more gamers to play their titles. And partners like Square Enix have used GeForce NOW to make sure anyone and everyone can experience their new games, like Outriders, both as a demo and at launch.\nThese tremendous partners understand the value of making sure that members can play the PC games they already own across their devices. There are more than 300 of these partners who have shown how much they believe in our cloud gaming philosophy, with more joining every GFN Thursday.\nEndless Choice\nThere\u2019s a bit of everything ready and waiting to be played on the cloud \u2014 including DLC and expansions, like X3: Albion Prelude, new this week.\nWith 1,000 games in the GeForce NOW library, including nearly 100 free-to-play games that all members have access to, there\u2019s a title for every type of PC gamer.\nWant to become a hero in a strange new land? RPGs like The Witcher 3: Game of the Year Edition put you in the middle of fantasy epics, while exploration games like ASTRONEER challenge you to survive on a strange, brightly colored planet.\nLooking for a little history lesson? Travel back to ancient Greece in Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, or rule over the Middle Ages in Crusader Kings III.\nMembers can meet up with their friends, playing cooperatively in games like Destiny 2, Valheim and OUTRIDERS, or competitively in Rocket League and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Or they can enjoy a stunning story in acclaimed titles like Death Stranding, Life is Strange 2, Alan Wake and more.\nWant to experience real-time ray tracing for yourself? Priority and Founders members play Control, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Cyberpunk 2077 and more with RTX ON.\nThere\u2019s a game for every mood. Feeling spooky? Try to survive in Dead by Daylight or Outlast. Feeling spooky and don\u2019t want to be alone? Group up in Phasmophobia and shout at some ghosts. Maybe you\u2019re only afraid of zombies? See how long you can survive in games like 7 Days to Die and Dying Light.\nFeel like a collectable card game? Try out Legends of Runeterra or Magic The Gathering: Arena. Feel like a strategy game? How about a sci-fi 4X sim like Endless Space 2, or a historical take on tactics like Hearts of Iron II Complete? Every genre is playable instantly on GeForce NOW.\nLooking for a Castaway moment, out in the middle of the ocean with only a shark and some distant dry land to keep you company? Check out Raft.\n\u201cHang on, GeForce NOW,\u201d you might say. \u201cI want to actually play as the shark. Like, literally be a shark. Can you make that happen?\u201d We\u2019ve got that, too: Maneater is for you.\nThere\u2019s always a new game to discover with a library this big, streaming instantly. And every GFN Thursday brings even more gaming goodness.\nAll of This and More\nExplore a world full of adventure in Alchemist Adventure, an action RPG releasing this week that challenges you to recall the lost memories of your past.\nOver a dozen games released this GFN Thursday, bringing GeForce NOW to the grand milestone.

Charm offensive to support Arm takeover plans?\n\n\n\n\nTim Anderson                                \n\n\n\nWed\u00a07\u00a0Jul\u00a02021                                     // \n13:30\u00a0UTC                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has launched its Cambridge-1 supercomputer, with a focus on AI for healthcare, as part of larger plans to boost AI research in the university city itself and more widely across the UK.\n\nPart of Nvidia's Cambridge-1 supercomputer\n\nThe Cambridge-1 is the highest ranking supercomputer in Britain according to the Top500 list, currently sitting in 41st place globally with maximum performance of 9,682 TFlop/s \u2013 though the world's fastest, the Supercomputer Fugaku, can manage 442,010.\nThe supercomputer was announced in October last year at which time it was slated to \"come online by year end,\" so it is somewhat delayed, but still constructed rapidly thanks to the use of Nvidia's modular DGX SuperPOD, described as a \"turnkey AI data center.\"\nThe actual deployment of the supercomputer took less than 20 weeks, Nvidia told us. Costs have increased a bit though: the October post talked of a \u00a340m investment, while at today's launch the figure given was $100m (over \u00a372m).\nThe Cambridge-A1 consists of 80 DGX A100 systems connected by Infiniband networking. Each DGX A100 has 8 A100 GPUs, 320GB GPU RAM, two AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs (64 cores each), up to 2TB system RAM, up to 30TB NVME data cache drives, and 2 1.92TB NVME SSDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe A100 GPU is Nvidia's high end Ampere GPU, following on from the Tesla V100; it is described in detail here. There are 6912 CUDA (Nvidia's GPU programming platform) cores per GPU, to support massively parallel computing \u2013 and there is a total of 640 A100 GPUs in the system.\n\nAn Nvidia A100 GPU\n\n\nThe only way is Essex\n\nThe physical location of the Cambridge-1 (despite the name) is Harlow, in Essex, at the data centre of Kao Data, chosen in part for its green credentials: the company claims to use 100 per cent renewable energy, meet the EU's data centre environmental guidelines, and use 100 per cent free cooling, meaning that cool air comes from the external atmosphere. Harlow is on the \"Cambridge to London UK innovation corridor,\" said Kao Data, doing its best to associate Harlow with Cambridge.\n\"It's our first dedicated supercomputer for healthcare, and probably in the world,\" said David Hogan, veep of Enterprise EMEA at Nvidia.\n\nScience and medicine aid\n\nThe initial setup involves five \"founding partners.\"\nThese are GSK, AstraZeneca, Oxford Nanopore, Kings College London (KCL), and Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spoke to Professor Sebastien Ourselin at KCL, head of biomedical engineering and imaging sciences. Ourselin is also deputy director of the AI Centre for value based healthcare, a joint project primarily between KCL, Guy's and St Thomas', along with other NHS trusts, universities and technology vendors including Nvidia.\n\"For the past three-and-a-half years, Nvidia has been our main partner in our program of artificial intelligence in healthcare at Kings,\" he told The Reg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOurselin said the capacity of Cambridge-1 is necessary for its healthcare AI to be equitable and accurate. \"With AI, there are two big challenges to solve. One is access to data at scale, and second, access to computational power at scale. A lot of people can build AI models. The challenge is how to make sure it can translate into an unbiased, equitable model, and to do that, especially in healthcare, you need access to a huge amount of data which are representative of your population.\n\"For Nvidia being part of a consortium like the AI Centre was a way of getting access to a lot of data in collaboration with us and help us to train these models,\" he said.\nKCL specialises in AI based on image data such as MRI scans. \"If you try to prognose or diagnose based on image information, you base everything on training. So what you ingest is what the algorithm will be able to learn with. If now your population is, let's say, only Caucasian, what happens if you now present non-Caucasian data? It might not work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What if your dataset only represents a healthy population? It might never find any disease. What if the dataset is only males? If you want to increase the dataset, the model becomes much more complex to explain all of the data. And the only way is to have large computational power. That is where Cambridge-1 came into play; it enabled us to train models at a scale we were not able to do before,\" he said.\nKCL has its own supercomputer which is \"much smaller than Cambridge-1,\" Ourselin said. This meant that testing a new model might take three weeks, limiting the number of feasible tests. \"If you can get an answer overnight you can accelerate the research,\" he said.\n\nData protection\n\nPrivacy is an issue. \"Data coming from the NHS will be transferred to the supercomputer in a fully secure enclave so the only people who can access the data are the people from the hospital. In all the experiments we are doing, the data will never be seen by anyone else. It is as if the supercomputer were an extension of the hospital.\n\"The idea is to build what I call a smart NHS where you can send a vast amount of data without having to anonymize, to get the full richness of the data, and you are able to build models which are multi-dimensional,\" he said \u2013 words that may concern privacy advocates, since leaks of supposedly secure data are not unknown.\nWhat will be the cost to KCL? \"We don't pay for this resource. It is provided pro bono by Nvidia, which invested over \u00a340m in the supercomputer. We don't pay anything. We're not charged for the usage of the supercomputer. And we keep all the intellectual property we generate. There is no financial model where we have to pay for anything.\"\nThe initial access is for one year, Ourselin told us, but he expects the subsidy to continue, \"because we show them value.\"\nWhat is the value to Nvidia?\n\"The CEO Jensen [Huang] was very keen to contribute, for society, not fully based on a financial model, but to demonstrate that AI can have a positive impact on society,\" said Ourselin.\n\"Nvidia offered not only to provide Cambridge-1 to those five founders, but to provide it to a much larger community in the future. To be able to do that, they wanted first to demonstrate through a set of concepts that adding such capability will actually be transformative.\"\n\nChinese chip designers hope to topple Arm's Cortex-A76 with XiangShan RISC-V design\nAMD opens wallet to lure scientific computing boffins away from Nvidia's CUDA onto its Instinct accelerators\nRISC-V boffins lay out a plan for bringing the architecture to high-performance computing\nBull in a cosmos shop: Edinburgh uni boffins strike deal with Atos for BullSequana supercomputer\nAmerica to get world's 'most powerful' AI supercomputer to create the most detailed 3D map of the universe yet\n\nThis may be true; but we note that Nvidia is in the process of acquiring Cambridge-based Arm, subject to regulatory approval, and keen to put this transaction in the best possible light.\nNvidia has a sub-site on the matter, including a page on \"Our vision for the UK\" which states that \"Nvidia intends to fulfill its vision of creating the leading computing company for the age of AI here in Cambridge \u2013 propelling Arm and the UK to global AI leadership.\"\nSpecific plans include a \"new world-class AI research centre\" of which Cambridge-1 is part. Cambridge-1 is AMD-based, but the company plans a future supercomputer \"powered by Arm CPUs and Nvidia GPUs \u2026 at the iconic headquarters of Arm.\" Cambridge-2 perhaps?\nStill, as Ourselin told us, Nvidia planting a supercomputer in Brexit-stricken UK is a nice boost at a difficult time. \"There is a lot of reason for celebrating why a US company comes to the UK and invests in the UK. They could have put a supercomputer anywhere in the world,\" he said. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                AWS Graviton\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                AWS Graviton\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIndia wants backdoors into clouds, email, SaaS, for tax inspectors\n\nAsia in Brief\u00a0PLUS: Malaysia teams with Arm for local chip designs; NTT warns of possible breach; Samsung strikers settle; and more\n\nSecurity9 Mar 2025 | 7\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI\nHarnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nNetwork edge?

Both demos were running on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU paired with a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 Arm processor. As a reminder, NVIDIA is attempting to purchase ARM, though the deal is still under investigation by regulators including the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nRelated Story NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDPThis is the list of the RTX technologies included in these new demos:\n\nDeep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), which uses AI to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images for games.\nRTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), which lets developers add dynamic lighting to their gaming environments.\nNVIDIA Optix AI-Acceleration Denoiser (NRD), which uses AI to render high-fidelity images faster.\nRTX Memory Utility (RTXMU), which optimizes the way applications use graphics memory.\nRTX Global Illumination (RTXGI), which helps recreate the way light bounces around in real-world environments.\n\nThe RTXDI, NRD, and RTXMU SDKS for Arm with Linux and Chromium are already available, while those for DLSS and RTXGI will be released soon.\n\nThe keenest readers will have noticed a brand new technology, the RTX Memory Utility or RTXMU. This is an open source SDK released today by NVIDIA. Its purpose is to reduce the memory consumption of acceleration structures used by applications under both DirectX Raytracing and Vulkan Ray Tracing APIs.\nSave Time\nRTXMU reduces the time it takes for a developer to integrate compaction and suballocation into an RTX title.\nEliminate Wasted Memory\nFor applications using RTXMU, NVIDIA RTX cards get a ~50% reduction in memory footprint.\nPrevent Fragmentation\nScenes with thousands of small unique BLAS benefit greatly from suballocation.\nOpen Source\nTo ensure we are able to support as many developers as possible, RTXMU will be made available as open source on GitHub.\nThe following comparisons show a significant memory footprint reduction on GeForce RTX graphics cards when RTXMU is enabled.\n\n\nNVIDIA also released a new Game Ready driver today, version 471.41. This driver is said to provide the best experience with Red Dead Redemption 2 and Chernobylite when using NVIDIA DLSS.\n\nThe latter game, due to launch out of Steam Early Access on July 28th, gets one of the biggest performance boosts yet (up to 80%) when DLSS is enabled at 4K resolution.\n\nAs usual with all NVIDIA Game Ready drivers, there are additional fixes only mentioned in the changelog document. Check them out in the below list.\n\n[Capture One]: Hardware acceleration stops working. [3338552]\nDisabled NOHud/RemoveHud filter from the game Valorant. [3332516]\n[Doom Eternal]: The game may freeze during gameplay. [3331270]\n[League of Legends]: The game may fail to launch. [200744747]\n[HDR]: Mouse cursor color may shift when connected to certain DSC monitors in HDR mode\n[200741796]\nAnsel DOF filter blurs the entire screen in some games. [3288883]\nSome displays screen resolution limited to 640x480 after driver update. [3330750]\n[HDMI 2.1][8K] HDMI audio playback may become distorted after changing display modes\n[3268312]\n[RDP] Remote desktop connection to PC with color set to 10-bit will result in corrupted\npicture.
