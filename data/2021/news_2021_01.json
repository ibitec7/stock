The graphics specialist released new graphics processing units (GPUs) across its two largest segments -- data center and gaming -- that drove high demand. \u00a0\nIn September, NVIDIA made waves in the chip industry by announcing the $40 billion acquisition of ARM Holdings, controlled by SoftBank Group.\u00a0The deal still must pass regulatory scrutiny but would significantly enhance NVIDIA's ability to deliver cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) solutions using ARM's chip designs.\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA's Ampere-based A100 GPU. Image source: NVIDIA.\n\nSo what\nTop cloud companies are deploying NVIDIA's new A100 GPUs, which are based on the latest Ampere chip architecture. This fueled a record year for NVIDIA's data center business, with segment revenue surging by 80% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, 167% in the second, and 162% in the third.\u00a0\nOn top of strong data-center results, interest in gaming exploded in 2020, delivering record sales for NVIDIA's RTX GPU business. The segment hit a quarterly record of $2.27 billion in revenue in the fiscal third quarter, up 37% year over year.\u00a0\nNow what\nOne catalyst to watch in the short term is the impact that the recent surge in cryptocurrency prices could have on growth for the gaming segment.\u00a0The RTX 30 series graphics cards have been sold out, partly due to high demand from cryptocurrency miners. This means the gaming segment is likely looking at terrific results by the time NVIDIA reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the data center segment, NVIDIA is still in the early ramp-up stage for its A100 GPU.\u00a0It is seeing tech giants and researchers\u00a0buy more of these new chips for conversational AI and recommender systems.\u00a0\nLooking at the big picture, the ARM deal could significantly extend NVIDIA's leadership in the semiconductor industry. But regardless of when the deal gets approved, NVIDIA's current leadership in graphics processing puts the company in a great position to deliver returns to investors, as organizations increasingly rely on the advanced computing power of GPUs to handle AI workloads.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard owns shares of NVIDIA.

By emitting invisible lasers at incredibly fast speeds, lidar sensors can paint a detailed 3D picture from the signals that bounce back instantaneously.\nThese signals create \u201cpoint clouds\u201d that represent a three-dimensional view of the environment, allowing lidar sensors to provide the visibility, redundancy and diversity that contribute to safe automated and autonomous driving.\nMost recently, lidar makers Baraja, Hesai, Innoviz, Magna and Ouster have developed their offerings to run on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to deliver robust performance and flexibility to customers.\nThese sensors offer differentiated capabilities for AV sensing, from Innoviz\u2019s lightweight, affordable and long-range solid-state lidar to Baraja\u2019s long wavelength, long-range sensors.\n\u201cBy pairing Baraja Spectrum-Scan lidar with perception and compute solutions from NVIDIA, our customers are able to achieve better vehicle perception outcomes at even longer ranges,\u201d said Nick Langdale-Smith, Vice President of Business Development at Baraja. \u201cWe view this as crucial in ensuring safe operation of autonomous vehicles at highway speeds\u201d\n\u201cOur new InnovizOne solution is now available on the open and flexible NVIDIA DRIVE platform,\u201d said Innoviz CEO Omer Keilaf. \u201cThis will allow seamless integration and mass adoption of our solid state lidar in the autonomous industry and other opportunities.\u201d\nA view from the InnovizOne solid-state lidar solution.\nOuster\u2019s OS series of sensors offers high resolution as well as programmable fields of view to address autonomous driving use cases. It also provides a camera-like image with its digital lidar system-on-a-chip for greater perception capabilities.\nHesai\u2019s latest Pandar128 sensor offers a 360-degree horizontal field of view with a detection range from 0.3 to 200 meters. In the vertical field of view, it uses denser beams to allow for high resolution in a focused region of interest. The low minimum range reduces the blind spot area close to and in front of the lidar sensor.\n\u201cThe Hesai Pandar128\u2019s resolution and detection range enable object detection at greater distances, making it an ideal solution for highly automated and autonomous driving systems,\u201d said David Li, co-founder and CEO of Hesai. \u201cIntegrating our sensor with NVIDIA\u2019s industry-leading DRIVE platform will provide an efficient pathway for AV developers.\u201d\nThe Hesai Pandar128 clearly detects objects and street signs at varying distances.\nWith the addition of these companies, the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem addresses every autonomous vehicle development need with verified hardware.\n\u201cBy making our solid-state LiDAR technology compatible with the scalable NVIDIA DRIVE platform, we can ensure our sensors can be leveraged at any stage of development,\u201d said Sharath Reddy, Senior Vice President, Magna Electronics.\nPlug and Drive\nTypically, AV developers experiment with different variations of a sensor suite, modifying the number, type and placement of sensors. These configurations are necessary to continuously improve a vehicle\u2019s capabilities and test new features.\nAn open, flexible compute platform can facilitate these iterations for effective autonomous vehicle development. And the industry agrees, with more than 60 sensor makers \u2014 from camera suppliers such as Sony, to radar makers like Continental, to thermal sensing companies such as FLIR \u2014 choosing to develop their products with the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform.\nAlong with the compute platform, NVIDIA provides the infrastructure to experience chosen sensor configurations with NVIDIA DRIVE Sim \u2014 an open simulation platform with plug-ins for third-party sensor models. As an end-to-end autonomous vehicle solutions provider, NVIDIA has long been a close partner to the leading sensor manufacturers.\n\u201cOuster\u2019s flexible digital lidar platform, including the new OS0-128 and OS2-128 lidar sensors, gives customers a wide variety of choices in range, resolution and field of view to fit in nearly any application that needs high-performance, low-cost 3D imaging,\u201d said Angus Pacala, CEO of Ouster. \u201cWith Ouster as a member of the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem, our customers can plug and play our sensors easier than ever.\u201d\nA street level view from an Ouster lidar sensor.\nLaser Focused\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem includes a diverse set of lidar manufacturers \u2014 including Velodyne and Luminar as well as tier-1 suppliers \u2014 specializing in different features such as wavelength, signaling technique, field of view, range and resolution. This variety gives users flexibility as well as room for customization for their specific autonomous driving application.\nThe NVIDIA DriveWorks software development kit includes a sensor abstraction layer that provides a simple and unified interface that streamlines the bring-up process for new sensors on the platform. The interface saves valuable time and effort for developers as they test and validate different sensor configurations.\nA 3D point cloud created by a Velodyne lidar sensor.\n\u201cTo achieve maximum autonomous vehicle safety, a combination of sensor technologies including radar and lidar is required to see in all conditions. NVIDIA\u2019s open ecosystem approach allows OEMs and tier 1s to select the safest and most cost-effective sensor configurations for each application,\u201d said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem gives autonomous vehicle developers the flexibility to select the right types of sensors for their vehicles, as well as iterate on configurations for different levels of autonomy.

ByteDance has leased around 58,000 sq ft of office space at Guoco Tower in Tanjong Pagar and another 100,000 sq ft at One Raffles Quay in Raffles Place at the CBD Core (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Meanwhile, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) secured the top two office floors at the recently completed 79 Robinson Road at the end of the year while CIMB is said to have leased more than 50,000 sq ft in the office podium of the recently refurbished 30 Raffles Place, notes Tay Huey Ying, JLL Head of Research and Consultancy, Singapore.  Towards the end of 2020, there was a pick-up in leasing activity from the technology and financial services sectors, says Desmond Sim, CBRE head of research for Southeast Asia. However, these were not enough to stave off a decline in both office prices and rents in the Central region in 4Q2020. Prices corrected 3.1% q-o-q in 4Q2020, reversing the 0.2% increment in 3Q2020. Meanwhile, rents fell 3.5% q-o-q in 4Q2020, a moderation from the 4.5% decline in 3Q2020. This brings the full-year drop for Central region office prices and rents to 10.7% and 8.5% y-o-y respectively. Just one-third the 23.5% rental fall in GFC The 8.5% fall in the rental index for the Central region in 2020 was just about a third of the 23.5% fall recorded in the first four quarters of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)-led correction in 2008/9, says JLL\u2019s Tay. \u201cDespite Singapore entering the worst post-independence recession in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, office rent had corrected significantly less than during the GFC,\u201d she says. In 4Q2020, islandwide net absorption was slightly positive at 21,500 sq ft, according to Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s Wong. \u201cMost areas saw small gains in net absorption except for the Downtown Core which saw a contraction of 172,200 sq ft.\u201d  For the whole of 2020, net absorption amounted to a negative 850,348 sq ft, notes Leonard Tay, head of research for Knight Frank Singapore. \u201cAs corporate occupiers critically reviewed their space strategies against the now-tested benefits of flexible working solutions, several have plans to reduce their space footprints when leases are due for renewal,\u201d he adds. The last time Singapore witnessed a full year of net negative absorption of 237,000 sq ft was during the GFC, points out Tricia Song, Colliers International head of research for Singapore.   Story continues Rental decline slowingDespite the ongoing downsizing exercises by office occupiers, 4Q2020 indicators seemed to suggest that the reduction in occupied space has slowed, observes CBRE\u2019s Sim. After three consecutive quarters of negative net absorption, the office market registered a positive net absorption of 2,000 sqm (21,528 sq ft) in 4Q2020.Most of the rental declines stemmed from older office buildings outside the Downtown Core and Orchard Road Planning Area (Category 2 office space), suffering a higher vacancy rate of 12.7%. Category 1 office space (relatively new and recently refurbished office space in the Downtown Core and Orchard Road Planning Area) registered a vacancy rate of 9.6% in 4Q2020. \u201cSome landlords are cognisant of this trend and are more open to slightly lower rents to maintain occupancy,\u201d says Sim.Table: Median Rents of Office Space, Based on Contract Date*Refers to office space in buildings located in core business areas in Downtown Core and Orchard Planning Area which are relatively modern or recently refurbished, command relatively high rentals and have large floor plate size and gross floor area.^Refers to the remaining office space in Singapore which are not included in \u201cCategory 1\u201dSource: CBRE Research, URAOffice stock was taken off the market as some landlords see the lull as an opportunity to undertake asset enhancement initiatives, adds Sim. Consequently, although prices and rents both fell by more than 3% in 4Q2020, vacancy rates have remained relatively stable falling by only 0.2 percentage points to 11.8%, he points out.\u2018Gradual and uneven growth\u2019Even though the economic recovery is expected to be gradual and uneven, 2021 is envisaged to revert to growth, observes Knight Frank\u2019s Tay. Ministry of Trade and Industry is projecting the economy to expand by between 4.0% and 6.0%. \u201cBarring new strains of the virus causing recurring waves of infection and consequent lockdowns, and with the economy improving as expected, office rents may fall by around 5% in 2021 before bottoming out and recovering in 2022, considering the combination of the above factors,\u201d he says.Although weak now, market dynamics are conducive for a recovery towards the end of 2021, Colliers\u2019 Song agrees. Key factors driving new office demand include the booming technology sector and overall business recovery. She sees CBD stock likely to be further reduced through redevelopment. So far, AXA Tower, Fuji Xerox Towers and Tower Fifteen have announced redevelopment plans, and Song expects more to jump onto the bandwagon over the next few months.See Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Committed office leases helped mitigate occupancy declines last year: Knight Frank Allianz Real Estate acquires 50% interest in OUE Bayfront for $633.8 mil Asia Pacific to shine over this decade En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Today, 7 times as many people have bought GeForce laptops than they did 7 years ago thanks to the incredible advancements made to performance, efficiency and device portability.\nNow, we\u2019re bringing our critically acclaimed NVIDIA Ampere architecture to laptops. GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop GPUs increase efficiency by up to 2X, accelerate performance, and introduce new 3rd gen Max-Q Technologies. Altogether, these give gamers the fastest gaming laptops ever seen, delivering stunning ray-traced experiences in Cyberpunk 2077 and other top titles, and enabling content creators to produce incredible art pieces in hundreds of GPU-accelerated apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting January 26th, manufacturers worldwide will begin shipping over 70 different GeForce RTX gaming and creator laptops featuring GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPUs, followed by GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPUs on February 2nd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor details on everything new we\u2019ve cooked up for these portable powerhouses, keep on reading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere Architecture, On The Go\nOur record-breaking, award-winning NVIDIA Ampere Architecture powers our complete range of GeForce RTX graphics cards, and now our laptops, too.\nOur laptop GPUs feature NVIDIA Ampere Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), which offer 2x FP32 throughput --delivering vastly improved performance with improved performance per watt-- as well as PCI Express 4.0 support and numerous other architectural enhancements.\nFor ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077, Minecraft with RTX, and other titles, as well as 3D rendering apps like Blender, new 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores have up to 2x the throughput, enabling GeForce RTX gamers and content creators to enjoy high quality ray-traced effects.\nAnd to accelerate performance we pack in new 3rd Generation Tensor Cores, with up to 2x the throughput of Turing-architecture Tensor Cores. These power our now-famous NVIDIA DLSS, which accelerates performance in titles such as Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Death Stranding and Minecraft with RTX, while generating beautiful, crisp game images that are often clearer and sharper than native resolution rendering with Temporal Anti-Aliasing.\nAdditionally, these Tensor Cores have enabled the creation of new experience-enhancing technologies, such as NVIDIA Broadcast for live streaming, video calls and voice chat.\nAnd if all that wasn\u2019t enough, you get NVIDIA Reflex to make gameplay more responsive in supported titles, GeForce Experience and its ever-expanding list of features that are used by millions of gamers, NVIDIA Studio hardware acceleration and optimization for demanding work apps, and so much more. Each designed to improve, accelerate and optimize your experience, whether that\u2019s gaming, working, or creating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Third Gen Max-Q Technologies for Optimal Power and Performance\nFour years ago, we introduced Max-Q, a system design approach that delivers high performance in thin and light gaming laptops.\nMax-Q has been a paradigm shift in the way laptops are designed and built.\u00a0 Every component and element of the laptop - GPU, CPU, software, PCB design, power delivery, thermals - is optimized for power and performance.\nFor our GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops, we\u2019ve developed new 3rd gen Max-Q Technologies that leverage our expertise and leadership in AI and new system optimizations to deliver substantial improvements to efficiency, performance, battery life, and acoustics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Boost 2.0\nTraditionally, gaming laptops statically set the power for the GPU and CPU. Yet, games and creative apps are dynamic, and demands on the system change from frame to frame.\nWith our new laptops we\u2019re introducing Dynamic Boost 2.0, which uses AI to balance power between the CPU, GPU and GPU memory. The AI networks in Dynamic Boost 2.0 manage power on a per-frame basis, so your laptop is constantly determining where power is needed the most and optimizing for maximum performance.\nWhether the application is loading the CPU, the GPU, or the GPU memory, the result is a larger performance boost than ever before. In a GPU-bound workload, like gaming or 3D rendering, the system can allocate up to 20W more to the GPU, automatically and seamlessly boosting frame rates or reducing rendering times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Boost 2.0 is available on all GeForce RTX 30 Series Max-Q laptops and is enabled out of the box, helping maximize performance in every app and game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhisperMode 2.0\nWhisperMode 2.0, debuting on GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops, delivers a new level of acoustic control for gaming laptops.\nWhisperMode has been reengineered from the ground up and is custom-built into laptops at a system level. Users now choose a desired acoustic level, and WhisperMode 2.0\u2019s AI-powered algorithms will do the rest, dynamically managing the CPU, GPU, game settings and fan speeds to deliver great acoustics and the best possible performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nOur magical AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS technology is now in over 30 games and support is coming to a bunch of new games with many more integrations in the works. In Cyberpunk 2077 it accelerates performance by up to 60%, and in Minecraft with RTX for Windows 10 the frame rate is more than doubled. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS is a breakthrough for gaming laptops. It uses AI and RTX Tensor Cores to deliver up to 2X the performance in the same power. A GPU needs to calculate almost 4 million pixels for a single 1440p frame. DLSS requires only a fraction of the pixels, which improves efficiency and increases performance.\nNVIDIA DLSS is also available in content creation apps, such as D5 Render, letting you visualize beautiful 3D environments in real time as you create them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResizable BAR Support\nThe standardized PCI Express interface features a technology called \u201cResizable BAR\u201d, which allows modern CPUs to access all GPU VRAM simultaneously, rather than the much smaller multiple requests of old. As the CPU and GPU are constantly swapping data, doing this in one big batch rather than multiple smaller ones can increase performance in certain games.\nResizable BAR improves performance without increasing power usage, helping increase efficiency and battery life, giving players more battery-powered game time.

At this year's Game Developer's Conference, ray tracing was everywhere: Unreal and Unity announced and released engine integrations, developers presented and attended ray tracing panels in droves, and studios demonstrated their latest ray-traced game builds, whilst also sharing insights on how ray tracing can also assist with game development.\nPowering all of these experiences and games were GeForce RTX GPUs, which include RT Cores - dedicated hardware designed to deliver the performance needed to run high-fidelity real-time ray traced experiences at high resolutions.\nSince the release of our GeForce RTX GPUs we've continued to optimize and enhance ray tracing, and have helped developers further improve ray tracing performance in their games. Combined, these efforts have not only accelerated ray tracing performance for all GeForce RTX gamers, but have now also made it possible for gamers with GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and higher GPUs to test drive basic DirectX Raytracing (DXR) effects via a new Game Ready Driver.\n    \nLaptops with equivalent Pascal and Turing GPUs can also enable DXR\nWhen we first announced this major update to our DXR support, there were numerous questions from the community about DXR technology and performance. The deep dive below aims to answer the community's top questions, but if you have additional questions please ask us here.\nGeForce RTX and GTX Performance\nWhen we announced the introduction of DXR for GeForce GTX GPUs last month, many of you asked how these GPUs would perform with ray tracing enabled. In short, it varies greatly depending on the game's general level of performance, the rendering resolution, the game settings, the types of ray tracing used by the game, and the selected ray-tracing quality level.\nTo understand what's happening, and how it influences performance, a quick crash course in ray tracing is required.\n  \nTo render ray-traced effects, several new workloads (tasks) are performed on the GPU. The first is determining which triangle in the game scene a ray will intersect, using a computationally-intensive technique called Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). After the rays are calculated, a denoising algorithm is applied to improve the visual quality of the resulting image, so that fewer total rays can be cast, allowing the process to be run in real-time at playable frame rates.\n   \nRT Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs provide dedicated hardware to accelerate BVH and ray / triangle intersection calculations, dramatically accelerating ray tracing. On GeForce GTX GPUs, these calculations are instead performed on the shader cores, a resource shared with many other graphics functions of the GPU.\nTo see what this means in practice, let's examine one frame of gameplay from Metro Exodus, which features ray-traced global illumination:\n    \nThe graphs look at GPU utilization on Pascal; Turing with RT cores disabled (via a special software setting); and Turing with RT cores and DLSS enabled.\nOn Pascal-architecture GPUs, we see that ray tracing and all other graphics rendering tasks are handled by FP32 Pascal shader cores. This takes longer to perform, meaning the gamer encounters a lower framerate. The Turing architecture introduced INT32 Cores that operate simultaneously alongside FP32 Cores, helping reduce frame time. And with RT Cores and Tensor Cores, execution time shrinks significantly, translating to 2-3x faster in-game performance.\n   \nA close-up of a Metro Exodus frame on a GeForce RTX GPU, using RT Cores and Tensor Cores\nThere are many ways ray tracing can be implemented in games, from reflections to shadows, lighting (global illumination), ambient occlusion, caustics, and even full scene path tracing. And each type has unique performance requirements.\n   \nRay-Traced Reflections\nBefore the introduction of real-time videogame ray tracing, the best reflection tech available was Screen Space Reflections (SSR). Developers could combine SSR with cubemaps and other techniques to build a more convincing reflection system, though no combination of tech could overcome SSR's main issues: an inability to reflect off-screen detail and detail viewed at a low angle, and an inability to reflect occluded on-screen detail.\nRay-traced reflections address all those issues, and more, to generate high-resolution, full-scene, real-time reflections that reflect details in front of, behind, above and below the player or camera; details the player couldn't see with previous techniques.\n  \nBattlefieldTM  V was the first game to launch with ray-traced reflections, and in DICE's implementation reflections are selectively applied to reflective surfaces such as water and glass.\n   \nRays are cast towards reflective surfaces visible from the player's camera, rather than from the player's camera across the entire scene. This greatly reduces the number of rays that have to be cast, which increases performance.\n  \n       \n         \nClick above for 4K and 1920x1080 performance\nAdvanced Ray-Traced Reflections\nIf a developer wishes to take ray-traced reflections a step further, they can trace additional reflections in more-complex scenes, and render reflections on curved or imperfect surfaces. Doing so rapidly increases the ray count, tracing complexity and shading difficulty, because light rays now scatter in different directions and with multiple bounces.\nA classic example of advanced reflections is the infinitely reflecting hall of mirrors effect, which is impossible to achieve with traditional screen-space reflection techniques.\n  \nTo construct scenes with these effects, Advanced Ray-Traced Reflections are required, greatly increasing the ray tracing workload through the use of additional bounced rays at each intersection point.\n   \nThe Atomic Heart and Reflections RTX Tech Demos, and 3DMark Port Royal, tested below, feature ray traced reflections, and highlight the benefits of the dedicated RT Cores in attaining smooth framerates.\n       \n       \n       \nRay-Traced Shadows\nVideo game shadows have come a long way in recent years, adding many features that have brought them closer to replicating the look of shadows in the real world. Until the advent of real-time ray-tracing, our own Hybrid Frustum Traced Shadows (HFTS) technique got closest, but ultimately it and other rasterized techniques were a collection of cleverly-programmed tricks to try and emulate what a shadow should look like.\nDevelopers needed to carefully balance the properties of their traditional shadow maps to maximize accuracy, detail and view distances, whilst avoiding shadow aliasing, shadow acne (erroneous self-shadowing) and shadow detachment (inability to fully connect with the base of the shadow caster to ground it).\nUltimately, there was always a trade-off or visible issue that reduced immersion. But with ray tracing, those issues are no longer a concern. Instead, we cast rays across a scene to realistically account for characters, objects and foliage that block light, resulting in lifelike shadows. And beyond the addition of accurate shadows, we can for the first time support large complex interactions and real-time translucent shadowing at a level of detail far beyond what was previously possible.\n  \n3DMark Port Royal, the Atomic Heart RTX Tech Demo, Control, the Justice  RTX Tech Demo, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and the Reflections RTX Tech demo all feature ray-traced shadows.\nIn Shadow of the Tomb Raider, ray tracing introduces five shadow techniques that weren't feasible to render with traditional techniques.\nOn \u201cMedium\u201d, the lowest ray tracing preset, there is a minimal amount of ray tracing, applied only to Point Lights that are occasionally encountered in the world, such as candles. For this reason, we recommend \u201cHigh\u201d, as additional ray-traced shadows are rendered throughout all levels of the game, having a continually-noticeable impact on realism.\nThe difficulty of ray tracing shadows increases with the number and type of the light sources, and also the complexity of the objects causing the shadow. Even for a single point, light sources at different angles must be traced separately to show the right shadow: the more angles and lights, the more rays needed.\n   \nThe performance of ray-traced shadows in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, using the High DXR settings, are demonstrated in the charts below:\n  \n       \nClick above for 4K and 1920x1080 performance\nRay-Traced Global Illumination\nThe real-time ray tracing capabilities of GeForce RTX GPUs also enable us to more-accurately model the effect of light bouncing off of surfaces in a scene, giving developers the power to add Ray-Traced Indirect Diffuse Global Illumination to their games.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the term \u201cGlobal Illumination\u201d, it describes the process of computing all the light interactions in a scene, including the indirect contributions resulting from light bouncing off from one surface to another. Before now, it was commonly achieved with precomputed lightmaps, Image-Based Light Probes, Spherical Harmonics, and Reflective Shadowmaps, plus artist-placed lights to help force illumination where the aforementioned techniques fail.\nThese techniques had several shortcomings, the biggest of which being that dynamic lighting failed to bounce or illuminate beyond the area that the light hit.\nFor example, imagine a dark room with bright light shining through a window. With traditional techniques, everything that is directly hit by the light is illuminated, but the illuminated areas themselves do not bounce light, and do not illuminate surrounding game elements, when in reality they would.\nWith ray tracing, we now have the ability to more accurately model the dynamic indirect diffuse lighting reflected by one or more indirect bounces off of surfaces in the scene. This enables developers to craft dynamic scenes with more-realistic indirect lighting that updates in real-time as lighting changes and events occur in the game world.\nIn other words, the light bounces naturally, illuminating and brightening surrounding detail. And if the sun moves or the window shades open, the room's lighting realistically changes; enabling you to see the room in an entirely new light.\n   \nMetro Exodus was the first game to integrate real-time ray-traced global illumination technology, enabling developer 4A Games to craft dynamic scenes with more-realistic indirect diffuse lighting that updates in real-time as lighting changes, and events occur in the game world.\nIn Metro Exodus, rays are cast per pixel, making ray-traced global illumination more performance-intensive than limited ray-traced reflections, where rays can be cast more-selectively. The cost is worth it though, as affirmed by tech site DigitalFoundry, who stated that, \u201cray tracing provides some simply spectacular 'next level' moments.\u201d\nFor GeForce GTX GPUs, the extra workload of RTGI results in a sizeable performance impact:\n  \n       \n          \nClick above for 4K and 1920x1080 performance\nRay-Traced Caustics\nCaustics refers to the focusing of light rays reflected or refracted by a curved surface or object, or the projection of that envelope of rays on another surface. This is commonly seen when the waves on a water surface bend and focus light into changing patterns of bright and dark areas. Rendering them in games has required shortcuts and approximations to achieve aesthetically-pleasing real-time results, but these were never accurate or realistic.\nWith DXR ray tracing, developers can finally render realistic caustics, and in Justice developer NetEase has done just that (for further details, check out the free, sponsored Justice and Caustic GDC sessions here).\n  \nIn addition to caustics, the Justice RTX tech demo also features ray-traced reflections and shadows, greatly enhancing the appearance of its scenes, as you can see in the video above.\n \n       \nClick above for 4K and 1920x1080 performance\nReal Time Ray Tracing: Momentum Continues\nThere's far more to come in the world of ray tracing, this year and in the future - Unreal Engine and Unity have added ray tracing tech and tools, enabling developers worldwide to craft ray-traced experiences; Remedy Entertainment is adding ray-tracing to the upcoming Control; the eagerly-anticipated Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will utilize ray-tracing when released in 2020; we're working on ray-tracing enhancements for the classic Quake II; and numerous developers are actively integrating ray tracing to games launching this year, next year, and in the years beyond. For word on those, and everything else ray-traced, stay tuned to GeForce.com.\nIn the meantime, be sure to download and try NVIDIA RTX Technology demos for Atomic Heart, Justice and Reflections for further examples of how ray tracing can enhance games.\nWe hope this comprehensive article answered all your questions about DXR support on GeForce GPUs.

As you move through a world in a game, GPU memory (VRAM) constantly transfers textures, shaders and geometry via many small CPU to GPU transfers.\nWith the ever-growing size of modern game assets, this results in a lot of transfers. Using Resizable BAR, assets can instead be requested as-needed and sent in full, so the CPU can efficiently access the entire frame buffer. And if multiple requests are made, transfers can occur concurrently, rather than queuing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Platforms Support Resizable BAR?\nGeForce RTX 30 Series laptops with both Intel and AMD CPUs will support Resizable BAR starting with their release in the coming weeks. Check with each laptop manufacturer about support on particular models.\nFor desktop systems to get the benefits of Resizable BAR, you will need a graphics card, motherboard and graphics driver that support the feature. New GeForce RTX graphics cards starting with the GeForce RTX 3060 will have support for Resizable BAR. NVIDIA and our GPU partners are also readying VBIOS updates for existing GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards starting in March.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA has been working closely with Intel, AMD and major motherboard manufacturers, including ASUS, ASRock, EVGA, GIGABYTE, and MSI, to bring Resizable BAR support to a wide range of motherboards.\n\u201cIntel has been working with NVIDIA to enable Resizable BAR, an advanced PCI-Express technology, across the PC ecosystem,\u201d said Fredrik Hamberger, GM of Premium & Enthusiast Laptop Segments at Intel. \u201cThis feature will give gamers an extra boost in gameplay FPS on Intel\u2019s new 11th generation H/S and select 10th generation systems when paired with supported graphics cards, including NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs.\u201d\nOur Game Ready Driver with Resizable BAR support will be released alongside the GeForce RTX 3060 in late February.

Please enable Javascript in order to access all the functionality of this web site. Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur latest GeForce Game Ready driver introduces support for the new GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card, and G-SYNC Compatible displays.\nTo download and install, simply fire up GeForce Experience and click the \"Drivers\" tab.\nIntroducing The GeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce RTX graphics cards are the world\u2019s fastest, giving gamers the performance to enjoy the latest and greatest games at stunning levels of detail. Now, the $349 GeForce RTX 2060 joins the action, delivering advanced ray tracing and AI features, plus levels of performance previously available only in high-end gaming GPUs, at a price point within reach of PC gamers worldwide.\n\nOffering max-setting 60+ FPS gaming at 1920x1080, and excellent high-setting performance at 2560x1440, the RTX 2060 gives users an in-game experience that beats the GTX 1070 Ti and is on average 60% faster than the prior-generation GTX 1060. Furthermore, the RTX 2060 features the same AI and Ray Tracing technology as the RTX 2080 Ti, 2080 and 2070, enabling RTX 2060 owners to enjoy BattlefieldTM V at 60 frames per second, with amazing real-time ray-tracing effects enabled.\nLearn more about the new RTX 2060, and our BattlefieldTM V and AnthemTM bundle, in our dedicated article. And be sure to download and install the new Game Ready driver if you\u2019re adding a GeForce RTX 2060 to your system.\nIntroducing G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nEarlier this month, at CES 2019, we announced support for G-SYNC Compatible monitors, which will deliver a baseline variable refresh rate (VRR) experience on GeForce GTX 10-Series and GeForce RTX 20-Series graphics cards and laptops.\n \nIf you have a compatible monitor VRR features will be enabled automatically following the installation of today\u2019s driver, and any future drivers, giving you an improved experience in games.\nIf your monitor isn\u2019t listed, you can enable the tech manually from the NVIDIA Control Panel. It may work, it may work partly, or it may not work at all. To give it a try:\n\nConnect the monitor to your GeForce RTX 20-Series or GeForce GTX 10-Series graphics card using a DisplayPort cable \nEnable the Variable Refresh Rate functionality of your display by using the monitor's controls and On-Screen Display\nOpen the NVIDIA Control Panel from the bottom right of Windows\nExpand the \"Display\" section\nClick on \u201cSet up G-SYNC\u201d\nTick the \u201cEnable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible\u201d box\nTick the \u201cEnable settings for the selected display model\u201d box\nClick \u201cApply\u201d on the bottom right\nIf the above isn't available, or isn't working, you may need to go to \"Manage 3D Settings\", click the \"Global\" tab, scroll down to \"Monitor Technology\", select \"G-SYNC Compatible\" in the drop down, and then click \"Apply\"\nAdditionally, you may need to go to \"Change Resolution\" on the left nav and apply a higher refresh rate, or different resolution\n\n \nFor the best gaming experience we recommend NVIDIA G-SYNC and G-SYNC Ultimate monitors: those with G-SYNC processors that have passed over over 300 compatibility and quality tests, and feature a full refresh rate range from 1Hz to the display panel\u2019s max refresh rate, plus other advantages like variable overdrive, refresh rate overclocking, ultra low motion blur display modes, and industry-leading HDR with 1000 nits, full matrix backlight and DCI-P3 color.\n \nBut if you\u2019re in the market for an entry level VRR experience, G-SYNC Compatible validation gives you new purchase possibilities, and the knowledge of which monitors will deliver baseline VRR benefits with your GeForce graphics card.\nLearn more and read about our other G-SYNC announcements in this CES 2019 G-SYNC article.\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nYou can download the new GeForce Game Ready 417.71 WHQL drivers through GeForce Experience, our free, game-enhancing application, which records and streams gameplay, and grants you access to giveaways.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can better assist you. A list of fixes in this driver for previously-reported issues can be found here.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He has more than 17 years of experience covering video games, movies, television, and technology.Nvidia\u2019s next graphics card is the GeForce RTX 3060, the company announced Tuesday during its Game On event at CES 2021.Scheduled to arrive in late February, the RTX 3060 will launch at $329, making it the cheapest GPU with dedicated ray tracing hardware since Nvidia dropped the MSRP of its entry-level RTX 2060 to $299 one year ago.The RTX 3060 slots in as the new base-level GPU in Nvidia\u2019s 30-series line of graphics cards, which are powered by the company\u2019s Ampere microarchitecture. It will sit below the RTX 3060 Ti, which debuted in December for $399. The RTX 3060 Ti is a very capable performer at 1440p resolution, making it a great option for people who want to save $100 over the RTX 3070. It stands to reason that the RTX 3060 will be more oriented toward folks playing at 1080p, and indeed, that\u2019s the resolution for which Nvidia provided a comparison versus the Pascal-powered GTX 1060, which launched all the way back in mid-2016.Watch Dogs: Legion on a GTX 1060 is a rough experience, with an average frame rate below 25 frames per second, according to a chart Nvidia showed during its presentation. But the company said that a PC equipped with an RTX 3060 can manage to keep the frame rate just above 60 fps in Watch Dogs: Legion and Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 even with some ray tracing effects turned on \u2014 as long as Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling technology is also enabled. The RTX 3060 delivers 10 times the ray tracing performance of the GTX 1060 (although it\u2019s worth noting that games are basically unplayable with ray tracing enabled on that old GPU) and twice the rasterization performance, according to Nvidia.Image: NvidiaOne curious element of the RTX 3060 is that it boasts 50% more video memory than its next two more powerful siblings \u2014 12 GB of GDDR6 RAM, versus the 8 GB in the RTX 3060 Ti and 3070. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how the RTX 3060 compares with its higher-priced brethren in the long term, as more games with higher memory demands are released.It\u2019s also a bit strange that Nvidia\u2019s reveal video for the RTX 3060 didn\u2019t actually show off what the GPU looks like. Presumably, it\u2019ll use the same compact pennant-shaped motherboard as the other 30-series cards, but we\u2019ll find out next month.Update: We\u2019ve edited the article to clarify the impact of the RTX 3060\u2019s video memory.See More: GamingNewsPCShoppingCyberpunk 2077Watch Dogs: LegionMost PopularBrandon Sanderson shared a list of his 10 favorite games, and they make perfect senseBring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbusterThere will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins\u2019 editorThe Lord of the Rings illustrated box set is on sale for its lowest price everWorld of Warcraft players are flocking to taverns with their altsPatch NotesThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

See our ethics statement.Nvidia resizable BAR. Image: NvidiaNvidia is officially launching its own resizable BAR support, which promises increased performance gains in some games if you\u2019ve got the right CPU, motherboard, and graphics card. Resizable BAR has been part of the PCI Express specification for years, but AMD only recently made it an important feature to support with the introduction of Smart Access Memory.AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory effectively provides its Ryzen 5000 processors direct access to the GPU memory to bypass I/O bottlenecks. This allows CPUs to access the full graphics frame buffer, instead of being limited to reading 256MB blocks. AMD previously promised up to 10 percent extra performance in certain games \u2014 if you pair its new Ryzen 5000 CPUs with its latest Ryzen RX 6000 graphics cards.But Nvidia says it\u2019s now working with both Intel and AMD, as well as all the major motherboard manufacturers, to bring the feature to \u201ca wide range of motherboards\u201d later this year.An artist\u2019s interpretation of resizable BAR. Animation: NvidiaNvidia promises it will feature in its new RTX 3000 series laptops with third-gen Max-Q technologies first, but it\u2019ll also be coming to desktops as well, starting with a driver that\u2019ll be released alongside the new $329 RTX 3060 desktop GPU in late February. Nvidia says there\u2019ll be VBIOS updates for your earlier RTX 30-series GPUs in March.Intel says that 11th Gen H and S series processors and \u201cselect 10th generation systems\u201d will support Resizable BAR when paired with the right graphics cards.AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory support.\ufeff Image: AMDResizable BAR support on the AMD side has led to some interesting results. TechSpot tested a variety of games recently using Smart Access Memory and found that performance improvements really depend on games. Some titles saw nearly a 20 percent boost at 1440p and 4K, while others actually dropped in performance.See More: CESEntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Behold: a generational jump in the company's laptop-minded GPUs, this time with Ampere architecture and RTX 3000-series branding.\nThree GPU models have been announced in all, and they're named after the GeForce RTX 3080, 3070, and 3060. They are slated to roll out in \"70+\" laptop models starting January 26. Nvidia has listed \"top OEMs\" like Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer with upcoming RTX 3000-series laptops, along with \"local OEMs and system builders.\"\nNaming convention double-check\nNvidia's sales pitch positions the RTX 3060 laptop variant as \"faster than laptops featuring the RTX 2080 Super,\" though this model may land more specifically in 1080p systems. The two higher-end models are frequently referred to as part of 1440p systems, a resolution that has long been left in the gaming-laptop cold (and will arguably benefit hugely from Nvidia's proprietary DLSS upscaling solution). While Nvidia's latest promotional materials mention a bang-for-the-buck upgrade compared to the last generation of laptop GPUs, we're still waiting to see OEMs roll out specific prices and specs for their late-January models. (Also, we're wondering if those laptops will\u00a0sell out too quickly for average humans to get them.)\nNvidia continues its naming convention of borrowing desktop model numbers for its smaller laptop variants, and in some ways, this checks out. The laptop side's jump to the RTX 3000 series is met with the inclusion of second-gen ray-tracing cores and third-gen tensor cores\u2014which have proven on the RTX 3000 desktop models to offer performance upgrades outside pure rasterization, all while reducing required space on the physical hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nvidia's official spec sheet for the RTX 3000 series laptop variants.\n              \nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's official spec sheet for the RTX 3000 series laptop variants.\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      For comparison, here are some of the RTX 3000 series' desktop specs. Obviously, these are going to differ, as they're dedicated GPUs with higher power draws.\n              \nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, here are some of the RTX 3000 series' desktop specs. Obviously, these are going to differ, as they're dedicated GPUs with higher power draws.\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's official spec sheet for the RTX 3000 series laptop variants.\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, here are some of the RTX 3000 series' desktop specs. Obviously, these are going to differ, as they're dedicated GPUs with higher power draws.\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you put the desktop and laptop specs side by side, the downgrades for each vary a little more wildly than you might expect by the names alone. The RTX 3080, in particular, see a nearly 30 percent drop in CUDA cores, compared to 13 percent for the RTX 3070. (Weirdly, the RTX 3060 laptop variant will have 6.6 percent\u00a0more CUDA cores than its desktop variant, but 21.1 percent fewer than the desktop 3060 Ti.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, the laptop version of the RTX 3080 probably deserves a different name, since it also downgrades to a 256-bit memory bus and GDDR6 VRAM (instead of the piping-hot GDDR6X variant found in the desktop model, attached to a 320-bit bus). Not that these aren't required downgrades to work within the thermal and power constraints of a laptop chassis; we're just sayin'. Speaking of which, clock speeds for the RTX 3000 laptop series also vary across the board, and Nvidia's announced ranges will certainly vary further once they're in the wild and packed into a variety of OEMs' chassis.\nAnd in a surprising turn, that RTX 3080, despite having a VRAM power downgrade, gets an optional capacity\u00a0upgrade to the tune of 16GB GDDR6. It's not quite the rumored RTX 3080 Ti (which reportedly could come with as much as 20GB GDDR6X VRAM), but if you're looking for serious VRAM in a studio-grade laptop in 2021, you may want to crack a few more piggy banks ahead of January 26.\nDefine \u201cwhisper,\u201d Nvidia\nThe rest of this week's announcement mentions a few efficiency-minded gains that may prove difficult to test, since their boosts revolve around claims like \"balancing power... on a per-frame basis\" and \"accessing all GPU VRAM simultaneously.\" (The latter, dubbed Resizable BAR, won't be ready at launch and will require a driver update.) There's also the matter of \"WhisperMode 2.0,\" which will apparently let users pick a fan-noise level of their choice and see system performance adjusted accordingly.

Getting to the end of Netflix\u2019s endless content well. Going 10 months without a haircut.\nOver the past year, we all found different ways to keep ourselves occupied.\nGaming, however, is a longer-term trend that promises to continue remaking global culture for years to come.\nOver 2.5 billion gamers are now engaged in playing, creating, sharing and connecting with one another.\nTogether we watched over 100 billion hours of gaming content on YouTube \u2014 twice as much as 2018. That\u2019s like 11 million people watching non-stop for a year.\nAnd esports viewership is nearly half a billion people globally \u2014 up 100 million from 2018 \u2014 with another 150 million new viewers expected over the next three years.\nBuilding on a long-term surge that has made gaming an integral part of all our lives over the past decade, market researcher Newzoo expects gaming revenue to rise 8 percent in 2021.\nThe Gaming Market Set New Records (Again)\nAnd gaming revenue \u2014 projected by analysts at $175 billion last year \u2014 already towers over other global consumer entertainment markets such as music and radio, internet-based or \u201cover the top\u201d video of all kinds, and cinema.\nThere are now 2.6 billion people playing \u2014 over half the global online population.\nThe amount of time people played grew dramatically, with gameplay time up 26 percent in the U.S. over the past six months.\nParticipation on Discord \u2014 the leading real-time voice chat app for gamers \u2014 is up 2x in the past two years, with 140 million monthly active users who connect in over 4 billion minutes of conversation each day.\nThe Thrill of Victory\nToday\u2019s games are getting more realistic and immersive, from lifelike graphics to AI-based gameplay and realistic physics simulation.\nAnd to play the latest titles, gamers want the latest hardware \u2014 whether a recently launched console or a PC with the latest graphics technology, NVIDIA GeForce RTX.\nTwo years ago, NVIDIA introduced a breakthrough in graphics \u2014 real-time ray tracing for the ultimate realism and AI-based DLSS (deep learning super sampling) to \u201cmagically\u201d improve performance.\nWe named it RTX.\nTogether with Microsoft and top developers and game engines, we\u2019re working to bring the visual realism of movies to fully interactive gaming.\nThe momentum is unstoppable. The latest consoles and the rest of the gaming ecosystem are now onboard: Ray tracing is the new standard. There are already over 30 titles with ray tracing and many more on the way. You can find a list of select titles here.\n\nAnd some of the most popular games over the past few years \u2014 Minecraft, with over 200 million copies sold and 126 million people playing per month, and Fortnite, with over 350 million registered users \u2014 have introduced real-time ray tracing enhancements to their games, enabling much more realistic and immersive experiences.\nNew Hardware Enables Better Games\nThe hits keep on coming.\nCyberpunk 2077, released a few weeks ago, generated 8 million pre-orders (almost 5 million for PC), and sold 13 million copies in its first 10 days. It shattered the single-player record for number of concurrent Steam users within two hours of launch with over 1 million.\nCyberpunk 2077 is just one example of how production value of games continues to increase. Bigger worlds and cinematic graphics demand more of the GPU. A survey of GeForce gamers showed that 59 percent of GPU or PC upgrades are due to the low performance of a game they\u2019re playing or requirements for one that they\u2019re anticipating.\nThis increase in production value is evident in the latest sequels to these AAA games, where the GeForce GTX 1060, one of our most popular GPUs of all time, struggles to keep up.\nFor instance, gamers were playing Watch Dogs 2 (released in 2016) with high settings at 60 frames per second on a GTX 1060. But when they moved on to Watch Dogs: Legion, released in October, they only saw 24 frames per second on that system.\n\nAnd turning on ray tracing to get the best visuals makes Watch Dogs: Legion virtually unplayable on a GTX 1060.\nFear not, however. The just-announced GeForce RTX 3060 based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture brings the game back to life, at a price that makes RTX technology available to all PC gamers.\n\nWith tens of millions of GeForce GTX GPUs in use today, the upgrade opportunity is enormous. The performance gains and new features in GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs make it a great time for all PC gamers to upgrade.\nCompetitive Gaming Takes Center Stage\nWeekend basketball player? We already know you love the NBA. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that hundreds of millions of video game players like to watch pros play their games, too.\nThere are professional leagues for top games like Counter-Strike, League of Legends and Dota 2. The stakes in these contests are serious. In 2019, the prize pool for the Dota 2 International tournament reached $34 million. That\u2019s more than triple the $11 million prize purse for the U.S. Masters golf tournament.\nWhen the stakes are high, quality gear matters. Response time is critical to be most competitive at esports games \u2014 typically shooters \u2014 like Counter-Strike or Fortnite. Every millisecond matters.\nEsports pros and enthusiasts strive for the lowest latency \u2014 down to zero if they could get there. So NVIDIA invented Reflex to help get the latency of the system as low as possible.\nNVIDIA Reflex optimizes the rendering pipeline across the CPU and GPU to reduce latency by up to 50 percent, giving gamers a precious advantage. A 20-millisecond advantage can mean the difference between winning and losing in the physical sports world and esports.\nWith Reflex and our Game Ready Drivers, over 100 million GeForce gamers are instantly more competitive. Fortnite, Apex Legends, Valorant and Call of Duty: Warzone were among the first to integrate Reflex technology. With this week\u2019s announcements, seven of the top 10 competitive shooter games now support Reflex. And more are on the way.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that 99 percent of esports pros play on GeForce GPUs.\nYou Can Take It With You\nLaptops are the fastest growing gaming platform, increasing 7x in seven years. And the power of these laptops has inspired gamers to find new ways to play, whether in console mode connected to a big screen TV using a controller, or driving an ultra-wide monitor with a keyboard and mouse.\nLaptop PCs were flying off shelves so fast last year, manufacturers couldn\u2019t keep up with demand. Laptop PC sales were up 26 percent over 2019, the largest gain in many years. It would have been even higher if more supply were available.\nMany laptop buyers are looking for their PCs to perform a wide variety of activities \u2014 from keeping up on social media and streaming videos to creating and editing videos and playing the latest games. They want as much performance as they can get without having to sacrifice portability.\nTo address that demand, we\u2019ve just announced that the GeForce RTX 30 Series, powered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, will soon be available in laptops. These laptops can handle all the latest tasks and are available in slim designs using our third-generation Max-Q technologies.\nRTX 30 Series laptops bring exceptional power to gamers and creators, with the best laptops for creators meeting the specifications of our NVIDIA Studio program.\nAnd there are laptops available specifically for esports players that include 240Hz displays for fast response and low latency. Gamers can compete at the highest level on these devices.\nThis week we announced that our partners are introducing over 70 laptops \u2014 it\u2019s our biggest GeForce laptop launch ever. These are the world\u2019s fastest laptops that give gamers and creators a huge variety to choose the right device for their needs.\n\nMore to Come\nThe GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs shipping in desktops and, very shortly, in laptops, coupled with ray tracing in games, will fuel the next round of gaming PCs and upgrades.\nOver the past two decades, GPUs have revolutionized modern graphics again and again. Once the holy grail of computer graphics, ray tracing is now the standard.\nWe look forward to more revolutions to come: if the last 20 years of graphics and gaming were amazing, the next 20 will seem nothing short of science fiction.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | GamingTags: GeForce | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

New Frontier\u2019s immersive program and platform showcase stories created through new convergences of film, art and cutting-edge technology.\n\u201cDisney has the greatest storytellers in the world,\u201d said Kaki Navarre, director of content technology at Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution. \u201cBy embracing new technologies and methods, like NVIDIA RTX GPUs and interactive streaming with GeForce NOW, we can free those content creators from the processing limitations of client devices, advancing what is possible from a computational perspective, which grants significant creative freedom in how stories can be brought to life for an audience.\u201d\nDisney has selected NVIDIA RTX GPUs to power the first-of-its-kind experience, and our cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW, will deliver it.\nIn the interactive short, it\u2019s up to the audience to help Fred as he tries to contain an adorable yet destructive glitch of his own creation that causes havoc inside the head of Baymax, a compassionate, cutting-edge robot.\nNVIDIA GPUs are no stranger to cutting-edge visuals. For over a decade, every Oscar-nominated film for Best Visual Effects has taken to the big screen thanks to NVIDIA GPUs.\nThe Baymax Dreams experience is the first premium, interactive, 3D-animated content of its kind. It features touch interaction and is fully remote-rendered on our GeForce NOW cloud gaming servers. These elements allow the audience to do more than just choose the path of the story \u2014 it gives them agency.\nCharacters in the episode can respond positively or negatively depending on the speed and efficiency of participation.\nDelivering Real-time Interactive Entertainment with GeForce NOW\nUsing GeForce NOW, real-time content is streamed to a user\u2019s device in a fraction of a second. This allows seamless interaction without losing graphics quality on mobile platforms. Participants can have a high-quality experience regardless of how powerful or modern their device might be.\nGeForce NOW data centers house powerful NVIDIA RTX GPUs designed for cloud gaming. They\u2019re optimized for fast video encoding and provide high-quality visuals with reduced latency. They\u2019re optimal for gaming as well as other forms of interactive entertainment.\nIt\u2019s also the first native touch experience streaming on GeForce NOW. That\u2019s something NVIDIA will bring more of to the cloud in the future.\nThe interactive short is streaming for a limited time on GeForce NOW for iOS Safari users. GeForce NOW members can interact with the short using touch input from their iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nCategories: Gaming | Pro GraphicsTags: GeForce NOW | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Tom\u2019s Guide points out that NVIDIA has shared a not-so-subtle teaser for its mobile RTX 30 graphics ahead of its January 12th CES event. You only get fleeting glimpses, but the brief clip shows both a laptop and what\u2019s clearly a portable-oriented GPU.Store listings for RTX 30-equipped laptops might offer a clue as to what you can expect. NVIDIA is reportedly planning rough equivalents to most of its desktop GPUs, including an RTX 3060 with 6GB of RAM, a 3070 Max-Q with 8GB of memory and a flagship RTX 3080 Max-Q with 16GB of RAM \u2014 even more than the 10GB of the desktop 3080.The cards should benefit from Ampere architecture improvements like faster ray tracing, and might add Resizable Base Address Register tech that boosts communication between the CPU and GPU. Existing RTX 30 chips are technically capable, so it may be just a matter of enabling the feature through software.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementNVIDIA might also introduce a non-Ti RTX 3060 for desktops at the virtual event.There are still some unanswered questions that may have to wait until after the presentation. It\u2019s not certain how well laptop RTX 30 graphics compare with their counterparts. Power consumption is also something of a mystery. RTX 30 boards consume a lot of power, and it\u2019s not certain how NVIDIA will keep that consumption in check for portable machines.\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/AHn0BWTYBh\u2014 NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) January 9, 2021Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

We built NVIDIA Reflex to reduce latency and deliver gamers the best system responsiveness -- from the time the mouse is clicked to when the display updates. With lower latency you get the edge on opponents, and gameplay feels more responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflex has been a big hit since its introduction in September, with a dozen games adding support. And today, we\u2019re excited to announce that Rainbow Six: Siege and Overwatch are adopting NVIDIA Reflex. Now, 7 of the top 10 competitive shooters support the technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Comes To Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege\nAlready, gamers in Apex Legends, Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare and Warzone, Fortnite, and Valorant are enjoying the benefits of NVIDIA Reflex. And soon, players in Overwatch and Rainbow Six: Siege can also reduce system latency when Reflex is added to each game.\n\"NVIDIA Reflex is coming to Rainbow Six Siege soon. If you want to reduce system latency and get the best Rainbow Six Siege gaming experience, enable Reflex when it launches.\" - John Huelin, Tech Lead 3D, Ubisoft\n\u201cNVIDIA Reflex will optimize input latency in Overwatch, leading to the most responsive gameplay.\u201d \u2013 Ryan Greene, Lead Graphics Engineer, Overwatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enjoy the more responsive gameplay NVIDIA Reflex delivers, keep your system up to date with our Game Ready Drivers, and play each title using a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU.\nThe NVIDIA Reflex Software Development Kit is also now available in Unreal Engine and from our developer portal, enabling developers worldwide to quickly and easily add Reflex to their games. As with other NVIDIA technologies, this public release will accelerate adoption, ensuring more games benefit from Reflex\u2019s system latency-reducing magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew High Refresh Rate G-SYNC Monitors Include The Reflex Latency Analyzer\nIn September, we announced four 360Hz G-SYNC Esports displays that feature an innovative tool -- the Reflex Latency Analyzer. The Latency Analyzer is to an esports gamer what a heart rate monitor is to a runner -- a critical tool for measuring system health and performance.\nWith hardware built into the display, it measures full click to display latency.\nToday, we are announcing 5 new G-SYNC gaming monitors from Acer, AOC, and ASUS, all featuring the Reflex Latency Analyzer. These panels expand the Reflex ecosystem to include 1440p resolution and 34 inch ultrawide panels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new monitors, launching in the near future, are the:\n\nAcer Predator X34 S - 34\u201d, 180Hz, 3440x1440\nAcer Predator XB273U NX - 27\u201d, 240Hz, 1440p\nAOC Agon Pro 25\u201d G-SYNC Gaming Monitor (AG254FG) - 25\u201d, 360Hz, 1080p\nAOC Agon Pro 27\u201d G-SYNC Ultimate Gaming Monitor (AG274QG ) - 27\u201d, 240Hz, 1440p\nASUS ROG Swift PGM279QM - 27\u201d, 240Hz, 1440p\n\nDesigned for those serious about their system latency, the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer offers the best, quickest, easiest and most reliable way to test and measure system latency, and discern whether game and system changes positively or negatively affect system latency.\nWe\u2019re also announcing a new enhancement for the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer: the ability to automatically move the Reflex Latency Analyzer monitoring rectangle when the flash indicator is enabled. In games such as Fortnite, which implement the NVIDIA Reflex SDK\u2019s \u201cFlash Indicator\u201d, the monitoring rectangle will be automatically positioned over the top of the flash indicator\u2019s white square. When the flash indicator is not enabled, the monitoring rectangle is reverted back to its original user defined location. This makes it even quicker and easier to set up system latency testing, and removes the chance of user error that can occur when defining the measurement area. Simply update to the latest GeForce Experience, and instantly get this benefit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Mice Include Support For The NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer\nPlugging a NVIDIA Reflex-compatible mouse into a monitor with NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer technology yields click-to-display system latency measurement. This is the be all and end all of system latency testing, revealing how long it takes for your mouse click to be transmitted through hardware and software before appearing on-screen in the game.\nMice have differing latencies. Using any mouse, Reflex Latency Analyzer can capture PC Latency, Display Latency, and average mouse latency if the mouse is recognized in our average mouse latency database. For the most accurate, real-time measurement of mouse latency, we have teamed up with mouse vendors like Logitech, Razer, Asus, and SteelSeries to dynamically measure per click latency on the fly with the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer. And so, today, we\u2019re announcing the addition of NVIDIA Reflex technology to 7 mice from 4 manufacturers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer GM 310\nAcer Predator Cestus 330\nAcer Predator Cestus 350\nAlienware AW610M\nCorsair DARK CORE RGB PRO\nCorsair DARK CORE RGB PRO SE\nMSI GM41\n\nIn total, 11 gaming mice now support NVIDIA Reflex technology, and we\u2019re working on additional integrations that\u2019ll be announced in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Game Ready Driver Latency Improvements\nOne common method that savvy gamers have used to optimize latency is setting games to run in fullscreen exclusive mode. This is because Windows OS typically adds a compositing step that increases latency when running in windowed mode or borderless mode.\nWith our January 7th Game Ready Driver, we implemented new optimizations to reduce this latency in DirectX 12 and select DirectX 11 games that take advantage of a hardware and OS feature called Multiplane Overlay.\nMultiplane Overlay allows for the GPU to composite the final image planes in hardware instead of the Desktop Windows Manager (DWM), and using this gamers can get low latency while playing in their preferred window mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable this functionality you will need a GeForce GTX 16 Series (Turing) or higher GPU, which features advanced hardware support for Multiplane Overlay. Then simply update to the latest driver and the optimizations will work automatically out of the box when Windows is in SDR mode (support in HDR mode will be enabled in a subsequent driver). To verify that your system latency is lower, you can use Reflex Latency Analyzer to measure your improved responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore To Come\nAt NVIDIA, we are making it easier for gamers to both measure and optimize their PC\u2019s latency. Stay tuned for more news and updates in the months ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\n#SHOTWITHGEFORCE\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           Singapore\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nLegal\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This week, the TPC rebuked the chip biz, accusing it of not only breaking its test's terms of use but also circumventing the benchmark's constraints to artificially inflate its score.\nMichael Majdalany, administrator of the TPC, told The Register Nvidia \u201ctweaked the workloads\u201d in its tests to make its DGX A100 systems seem more powerful than they really are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are constraints in the TPCx-BB benchmark that Nvidia circumvented in order to make the claim: \u2018Nvidia outperformed by nearly 20x the record for running the standard big data analytics benchmark, known as TPCx-BB,\u2019\" he told us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In effect, they weren\u2019t running the same benchmark, so all corresponding claims are invalid.\"\n\nThey weren\u2019t running the same benchmark, so all corresponding claims are invalid\n\nThe TPCx-BB benchmark measures the performance of Hadoop-based big-data systems, which can be accelerated by graphics processors, such as those made by Nvidia. It involves running SQL queries on structured data, and uses machine-learning algorithms for unstructured data, to mimic analysis work typically performed by retail giants, be they online, offline, or both. The test comprises a specification to follow and tools to run.\n\u201cUsing the RAPIDS suite of open-source data science software libraries powered by 16 Nvidia DGX A100 systems, Nvidia ran the benchmark in just 14.5 minutes, versus the current leading result of 4.7 hours on a CPU system,\u201d Nv boasted in a blog on its dotcom in June. \u201cThe DGX A100 systems had a total of 128 Nvidia A100 GPUs and used Nvidia Mellanox networking.\u201d\nHowever, the performance council is unimpressed by Nvidia simply quoting this non-certified top-line figure as an official TPCx-BB score, which goes against the fair-use rules [PDF] of the benchmark. That policy states that organizations can only use the name TPC with a benchmark score if the results have been reviewed and published on the TPC website as an official score for people to compare with other vendors' results. Unofficial scores must be referred to \"non-TPC\" results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the paper 'State of RAPIDS: Bridging the GPU Data Science Ecosystem,' presented at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2020, and in associated company blogs and marketing materials, Nvidia claims that it has 'outperformed by nearly 20x the record for running the standard big data analytics benchmark, known as TPCx-BB,'\" the council said on Wednesday.\n\"Since Nvidia has not published official TPC results, and instead compared results from derived workloads to official TPC results, the comparisons are invalid.\"\n\"The TPC actively encourages publicizing of TPC results by all organizations, including the press, market researchers, financial analysts and non-profit organizations,\u201c added Mike Brey, chairman of the TPC Steering Committee. \"However, to ensure that users and readers of TPC results are given a fair and complete representation of TPC data, the TPC requests that all users follow the Fair Use rules, outlined in TPC policies, when publishing or publicizing results.\u201d\n\nNvidia touts another two spanking new GPUs to join its list of Ampere architecture based goodies\nREAD MORE\nA spokesperson for the council told us the org has been trying to get Nvidia to retract its claims or issue a correction. The marketing blog post is still up on Nvidia\u2019s site unchanged.\nBehind closed doors, the GPU giant said it was interested in formally participating in the benchmark and releasing its results, we understand, and even said it may join the TPC as a member. The council is supported by its members, which include AMD, Intel, and Microsoft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussions between TPC and Nvidia, however, went nowhere. And as Nvidia is a non-member, there's seemingly really not a lot else the council can do to sanction the Silicon Valley goliath. With no options left, TPC decided to go public.\n\u201cNvidia has been working in good faith with the Transaction Processing Performance Council to prepare an official submission and comply with their requests,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson told The Register.\n\u201cWe are confident in the performance of our software and hardware and look forward to sharing our results.\u201d Nvidia PRs declined to comment on how the biz measured the performance of its chips, and whether it was going to take down its blog post or issue a correction.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any additional comments here,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow legacy storage infrastructure could endanger your future\nYour data is critical to AI success.

Speaking at a tech and auto conference held by J.P. Morgan, company CFO Collette Kress admits that \"supply does remain tight at this time\" and will remain that way until Q1 is over.Hopefully, that's the general consensus on corporate calendars, that which would have Q1 ending in March and Q2 beginning in April. Nvidia's calendar is all kinds of weird, though, and would actually have Q1 rounding out at the end of April, with Q2 beginning in May, or thereabouts\u2014as per this SEC filing [PDF warning]. It's also the fiscal year 2021 for Nvidia\u2014yeah, it's a whole thing that usually relates to seasonal fluctuations relating to that business.My money, sadly, would be on that being Nvidia's definition of Q1, not the general understanding as most of us know it. Kress is the CFO, after all, she lives for this stuff, and she talks around the fact Nvidia isn't in Q1 yet\u2014which by its calendar, it's not.\"So, supply does remain tight at this time,\" Colette Kress says in the call (via Seeking Alpha). \"We expect the overall channel inventories, meaning the inventories that are with our AIC partners as well as in our e-tail and retail channels will likely remain lean throughout Q1.\"Either way, we're looking at a constrained GPU market headed well into 2021. Not the great kick-off to the year we were hoping for, but hardly surprising given the widespread reports of low availability for key components, increased costs, and of course constrained capacity.In 2020, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang tempered stock expectations by saying demand will outstrip supply until at least 2021. However, Huang focused largely on a problem of high demand, which while that may be the case, Kress now seems focused on larger macro issues as the root cause for the extended constraints.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: when only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: big-screen 4K PC gaming\"Our overall capacity has not been able to keep up with that overall strong demand that we have seen,\" Kress continues. \"We\u2019ve seen in terms of constraints, constraints really from the overall global surge of compute and the overall capacity, capacity that may be necessary for assembly and test and/or sub trades as well. But again, we remain focused on this and working each day to improve our overall supply situation.\"The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Many GPU manufacturers have increased costs of Nvidia's RTX 30-series due to these constraints, alongside other tariffs in the US on parts.It's a crying shame, too, as both Nvidia and AMD's latest graphics cards are superb on the whole. There's at least the RTX 3060 12GB launch in late February, but we're sceptical at best for both the card's specs and availability.Here's hoping May sees some improvements of the situation, and not just in graphics card supply, either.\u00a0\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

This decision indeed is not unprecedented.\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s CES 2021 spec slide for the GeForce RTX 3060 exclusively showed custom models from board partners.\n\n\nIt does make you wonder how much the GeForce RTX 3060 will actually cost when it launches, however. This generation, Nvidia released its gorgeous Founders Edition versions at each GPU\u2019s baseline MSRP, creating a set point for each product. Third-party GeForce RTX 30-series cards by the likes of EVGA, Asus, MSI, and others have all launched at higher costs, with the majority of stock seemingly allocated to the most expensive custom models. Extreme demand and logistics woes have only exacerbated the problem. It\u2019s all but impossible to find a current-generation graphics card from GeForce or Radeon anywhere near stock pricing, and they sell out instantly when they appear. Even last-gen graphics cards are selling out at wildly high prices right now. It\u2019s a bad time to try to buy a graphics card.\n\n\n\nWorse, in recent days, vendors like Asus, MSI, and EVGA have announced that graphics cards are about to get a lot more expensive. \u201cOur new MSRP reflects increases in cost for components, operating costs, and logistical activities, plus a continuation of import tariffs,\u201d Asus\u2019s statement declared.\u00a0We\u2019ve witnessed prices increase by around $70 for many EVGA models, but other vendors have increased the cost of many cards by $100 or even more, with the Zotac RTX 3090 Trinity now going for $1,900-plus, compared to the $1,580 it launched at in late September.\nOof. Massive premiums like that are more common on higher-end models, however.\n Asus \nIt remains to be seen whether the GeForce RTX 3060 truly launches at its advertised $329 price tag next month. Given that it\u2019s a custom-only launch, and custom board makers are already announcing broad price increases, don\u2019t be surprised if Nvidia\u2019s latest GPU winds up costing closer to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s $400 price tag instead. Fingers crossed that Nvidia took the supply chain concerns into consideration before announcing the RTX 3060, and the higher prices are already baked into the price. Considering the pricing of the rest of Nvidia\u2019s lineup though, and the RTX 3060\u2019s ample 12GB of memory, don\u2019t count on it.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble getting hold of a graphics card, give Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now game-streaming service a whirl. It holds up surprisingly well for what it is, and better yet, you can play for free in a pinch. Depending on the specific games you play it could tide you over until graphics card prices become sane again.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Since 2014, the automaker has been leveraging NVIDIA for its seamless infotainment experience. And now, with NVIDIA DRIVE powering automated driving features in its future vehicles, NIO is set to redefine mobility with continuous improvement and personalization.\n\u201cAutonomy and electrification are the key forces transforming the automotive industry,\u201d said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. \u201cWe are delighted to partner with NIO, a leader in the new energy vehicle revolution\u2014leveraging the power of AI to create the software-defined EV fleets of the future.\u201d\nAn Intelligent Creation\nSoftware-defined and intelligent vehicles require a centralized, high-performance compute architecture to power AI features and continuously receive upgrades over the air.\nThe new NIO Adam supercomputer is one of the most powerful platforms to run in a vehicle. With four NVIDIA DRIVE Orin processors, Adam achieves more than 1,000 TOPS of performance.\n\nOrin is the world\u2019s highest-performance, most-advanced AV and robotics processor. This supercomputer on a chip is capable of delivering up to 254 TOPS to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles and robots, while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nBy using multiple SoCs, Adam integrates the redundancy and diversity necessary for safe autonomous operation. The first two SoCs process the 8 gigabytes of data produced by the vehicle\u2019s sensor set every second. The third Orin serves as a backup to ensure the system can still operate safely in any situation, while the fourth enables local training, improving the vehicle with fleet learning as well as personalizing the driving experience based on individual user preferences.\nWith high-performance compute at its core, Adam is a major achievement in the creation of automotive intelligence and autonomous driving.\nMeet the ET7\nNIO took the wraps off its much-anticipated ET7 sedan \u2014 the production version of its original EVE concept first shown in 2017.\n\nThe flagship vehicle leapfrogs current model capabilities, with more than 600 miles of battery range and advanced autonomous driving. As the first vehicle equipped with Adam, the ET7 can perform point-to-point autonomy, leveraging 33 sensors and high-performance compute to continuously expand the domains in which it operates\u00a0 \u2014 from urban to highway driving to battery swap stations.\nThe intelligent sedan ensures a seamless experience from the moment the driver approaches the car. With a highly accurate digital key and soft-closing doors, users can open the car with a gentle touch. Enhanced driver monitoring and voice recognition enable easy interaction with the vehicle. And sensors on the bottom of the ET7 detect the road surface so the vehicle can automatically adjust the suspension for a smoother ride.\nWith AI now at the center of the NIO driving experience, the ET7 and upcoming NVIDIA-powered models are heralding the new generation of intelligent transportation.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The technique helps capture scenes like the night sky, but it introduces blurring in the final image, as in the example at right.\nIt\u2019s not too different from cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, which scientists use to study the structure of tiny molecules frozen in vitreous ice. But while motion-induced blur in photography can create beautiful images, in structural biology it\u2019s an unwanted side effect.\nProtein samples for cryo-EM are frozen at -196 degrees Celcius to protect the biological structures, which would otherwise be destroyed by the microscope\u2019s high-energy electron beam. But even when frozen, samples are disturbed by the powerful electron dose, causing motion that would blur a long-exposure photo.\nTo get around it, UCSF researchers use specialized cameras to instead capture videos of the biological molecules, so they appear nearly stationary in each frame of the video. Correcting the motion across frames is a computationally demanding task \u2014 but can be done in seconds on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\u201cIf the motion was left uncorrected, we\u2019d lose the high-resolution picture of a molecule\u2019s 3D structures,\u201d said Shawn Zheng, scientific software developer at the University of California, San Francisco and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. \u201cAnd knowing the structure of a molecule is critical to understanding its function.\u201d\nZheng and his colleagues run MotionCor2, the world\u2019s most widely used motion-correction application, on NVIDIA GPUs to align each molecule in the video from frame to frame \u2014 creating a clean image researchers can turn into a 3D model.\nThese 3D models are essential for scientists to understand the complex chains of interactions taking place in an individual protein, such as spike proteins on the COVID-19 virus, speeding drug and vaccine discovery.\nSolving the Bottleneck\nUCSF, a leader in cryo-EM research, has been the source of groundbreaking work to improve the resolution of microscopy images. The technology enables scientists to visualize proteins at an atomic scale \u2014 something considered impossible just a decade ago.\nBut the pipeline is lengthy, involving freezing samples, capturing them on multimillion dollar cryo-EM microscopes, correcting their motion and then reconstructing detailed 3D models of the molecules. To keep things running smoothly, it\u2019s critical that the motion-correction process runs fast enough to keep pace with the new data being collected.\n\u201cCryo-EM microscopes are very expensive instruments. You don\u2019t want it just sitting there idle. But if we have a backlog of movies piled up in the machine\u2019s data storage, nobody else can collect more,\u201d said Zheng. \u201cIt\u2019d be a waste of this expensive instrument, and slow down the research of others.\u201d\nTo achieve rapid motion correction, UCSF\u2019s Center of Advanced Electron Microscopy uses workstations with eight NVIDIA GPUs for each microscope. These workstations are needed to keep up with the cryo-EM data collection, which acquires four movies per microscope per minute.\nThe GPU setup can run eight jobs concurrently, taking on the iterative process of motion correction for videos with as many as 400 frames, each with nearly 100 million pixels.\nTo speed the development of new applications, Zheng, who\u2019s used NVIDIA GPUs for his research for a decade, uses a workstation powered by two NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs. The system can analyze a 70GB microscope movie in under a minute.\nAccelerating COVID Research\nZheng and his colleagues also use GPUs to run alignment software for cryo-electron tomography, or cryo-ET. This technique is better suited to study slightly heterogeneous specimens like macromolecules and cells. Samples are tilted at different angles, collecting a series of images that can be aligned and reconstructed into a detailed 3D model.\nNVIDIA GPUs can fully automate the reconstruction process, taking a half hour on a single GPU, he says.\nIn a recent paper in Science, Zheng collaborated with lead researchers from the Netherlands\u2019 Leiden University Medical Center to use cryo-ET to study molecular pores involved in COVID-19 virus replication in cells. A better understanding of this pore structure could help scientists develop a drug that targets it, blocking the virus from replicating in an infected patient.\nTo learn more about Zheng\u2019s work, watch this on-demand talk from the GPU Technology Conference.\nMain image shows a cryo-EM density map for the enzyme beta-galactosidase, showing the gradual increase in quality of the cryo-EM structures from low to high resolution.

The film crew had planned to make the movie primarily using real-life miniature figures. But they switched gears once they experienced the power of real-time NVIDIA RTX graphics and Unreal Engine.\nDirector Peter Hyoguchi and producer Joan Webb used an Epic MegaGrant from Epic Games to bring together VFX professionals and game developers to create the film. The virtual production started with scanning the miniature models and animating them in Unreal Engine.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working as a CGI and VFX supervisor for 20 years, and I never wanna go back to older workflows,\u201d said Hyoguchi. \u201cThis is a total pivot point for the next 100 years of cinema \u2014 everyone is going to use this technology for their effects.\u201d\nHyoguchi and team produced rich, photorealistic worlds in 4K to create rich, intergalactic scenes using a combination of NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPU-powered Lenovo ThinkStation P920 workstations, ASUS ProArt Display PA32UCX-P monitors, Blackmagic Design cameras and DaVinci Resolve, and the Wacom Cintiq Pro 24.\nStepping Outside the Ozone: Technology Makes Way for More Creativity\nGods of Mars tells the tale of a fighter pilot who leads a team against rebels in a battle on Mars. The live-action elements of the film are supported by LED walls with real-time rendered graphics created from Unreal Engine. Actors are filmed on-set, with a virtual background projected behind them.\nTo keep the set minimal, the team only builds what actors will physically interact with, and then uses the projected environment from Unreal Engine for the rest of the scenes.\nOne big advantage of working with digital environments and assets is real-time lighting. When previously working with CGI, Hyoguchi and his team would pre-visualize everything inside a grayscale environment. Then they\u2019d wait hours for one frame to render before seeing a preview of what an image or scene would look like.\nWith Unreal Engine, Hyoguchi can have scenes ray-trace rendered immediately with lights, shadows and colors. He can move around the environment and see how everything would look in the scene, saving weeks of pre-planning.\n\nReal-time rendering also saves money and resources. Hyoguchi doesn\u2019t need to spend thousands of dollars for render farms, or wait weeks for one shot to complete rendering. The RTX-powered ThinkStation P920 renders everything in real time, which leads to more iterations, making way for a much more efficient, flexible and faster creative workflow.\n\u201cRay tracing is what makes this movie possible,\u201d said Hyoguchi. \u201cWith NVIDIA RTX and the ability to do real-time ray tracing, we can make a movie with low cost and less people, and yet I still have the flexibility to make more creative choices than I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d\nHyoguchi and his team are shooting the film with Blackmagic Design\u2019s new URSA Mini Pro 12K camera. Capturing such high-resolution footage provides more options in post-production. They can crop images or zoom in for a close-up shot of an actor without worrying about losing resolution.\nThey can also color and edit scenes in real time using Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve Studio, which uses NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate editing workflows. With the 32-inch ASUS ProArt Display PA32UCX-P monitors, the team calibrated their screens so all the artists can see the same rendered color and details, even while working in different locations across the country.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro 24 pen displays speed up the 3D artist\u2019s workflow, and provides a natural connection between the artist and the Unreal editor, both when moving scene elements around to create the 3D environment and when keyframing actors for animation.\nLearn more about Gods of Mars and NVIDIA RTX.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Dubbed the MBUX Hyperscreen, the system is powered by NVIDIA technology and shows how AI can create a truly intuitive and personalized experience for both the driver and passengers.\n\u201cThe MBUX Hyperscreen reinvents how we interact with the car,\u201d said Sajjad Khan, executive vice president at Mercedes-Benz. \u201cIt\u2019s the nerve center that connects everyone in the car with the world.\u201d\nLike the MBUX system recently unveiled with the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, this extended-screen system runs on high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA GPUs for instantaneous AI processing and sharp graphics.\nA vehicle\u2019s cockpit typically requires a collection of electronic control units and switches to perform basic functions, such as powering entertainment or adjusting the temperature. Using NVIDIA technology, Mercedes-Benz consolidated these components into one AI platform \u2014 with three separate screens under one glass surface \u2014 to simplify the architecture while creating more space to add new features.\n\u201cZero Layer\u201d User Interface\nThe driving principle behind the MBUX Hyperscreen is that of the \u201czero layer\u201d \u2014 every necessary driving feature is delivered with a single touch.\nHowever, developing the largest screen ever mounted in a series-built Mercedes-Benz was not enough to achieve this groundbreaking capability. The automaker also leveraged AI to promote commonly used features at relevant times while pushing those not needed to the background.\nThe deep neural networks powering the system process datasets such as vehicle position, cabin temperature and time of day to prioritize certain features \u2014 like entertainment or points of interest recommendations \u2014 while always keeping navigation at the center of the display.\n\n\u201cThe system always knows what you want and need based on emotional intelligence,\u201d Khan explained.\nAnd these features aren\u2019t just for the driver. Front-seat passengers get a dedicated screen for entertainment and ride information that doesn\u2019t interfere with the driver\u2019s display. It also enables the front seat passenger to share content with others in the car.\nExperience Intelligence\nThis revolutionary AI cockpit experience isn\u2019t a mere concept \u2014 it\u2019s real technology that will be available in production vehicles this year.\nThe MBUX Hyperscreen will debut with the all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQS, combining electric and artificial intelligence. With the first generation MBUX now in 1.8 million cars, the next iteration coming in the redesigned S-Class, and now, the MBUX Hyperscreen in the EQS, customers will have a range of AI cockpit options.\n\nAnd with the entire MBUX family powered by NVIDIA, these systems will constantly deliver new, surprising and intelligent features with high performance and a seamless experience.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The new release also supports the NVIDIA GPU Operator, a software framework that simplifies GPU deployment and management.\nPowerful Performance for Power Users\nNVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software is a major component of the vGPU portfolio, designed to help users run graphics-intensive applications on virtual workstations. With NVIDIA A40 powering NVIDIA RTX vWS, professionals can achieve up to 60 percent(1) faster virtual workstation performance per user and 2x(2) faster rendering than the previous generation RTX 6000 GPUs.\nNVIDIA A40 includes second-generation RT Cores and third-generation Tensor Cores to help users accelerate workloads like photorealistic rendering of movie content, architectural design evaluations, and virtual prototyping of product designs. With 48GB of GPU memory, professionals can easily work with massive datasets and run workloads like data science or simulation with even larger model sizes.\n\nNVIDIA A40 support with the latest vGPU software enables complex graphics workloads to be run in a virtualized environment with performance that is on par with bare metal.\n\u201cWith support for NVIDIA\u2019s latest vGPU software, and the new NVIDIA A40 with Citrix Hypervisor 8.2 and Citrix Virtual Desktops, we can continue providing the performance customers need to run graphics-intensive visualization applications as their data and workloads grow,\u201d said Calvin Hsu, vice president of product management at Citrix. \u201cThe combination of Citrix and NVIDIA virtualization technologies provides access to these applications from anywhere, with an experience that is indistinguishable from a physical workstation.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA vGPU January 2021 software release supports the NVIDIA A100 80GB to deliver increased memory bandwidth, unlocking more power for large models. This builds on the September release, which introduced compute features that included support for the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, the most advanced GPU for AI and high performance computing.\nAdditional new features include simplified GPU management in Kubernetes through NVIDIA GPU Operator, which is now supported with NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server and NVIDIA RTX vWS software. Containers, including the GPU-optimized software available in the NGC catalog, can be easily deployed and managed in VMs.\nWith this new release, customers and IT professionals can continue managing their multi-tenant workflows running in virtual machines using popular hypervisors, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, while the certified GPU Operator brings a similar experience to containerized deployments on top of Red Hat virtualization platforms using Red Hat OpenShift.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe combination of NVIDIA\u2019s latest generation A40 GPU and NVIDIA vGPU software, supported with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Virtualization, offers a powerful platform capable of serving some of the most demanding workloads ranging from AI/ML to visualization in the oil and gas as well as media and entertainment industries,\u201d said Steve Gordon, director of product management at Red Hat. \u201cAs organizations transform and increasingly use containers orchestrated by Kubernetes as key building blocks for their applications, we see Red Hat OpenShift as a likely destination for containerized and virtualized workloads alike.\u201d\nTo find a certified server, see the NVIDIA vGPU Certified Server page.\nLearn more about NVIDIA vGPU software portfolio, which includes:\n\nNVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (RTX vWS) (formerly known as Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation or Quadro vDWS)\nNVIDIA Virtual Compute Server (vCS)\nNVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC) (formerly known as GRID vPC)\nNVIDIA Virtual Applications (vApps) (formerly known as GRID vApps)\n\n\u00a0\n1.

They include the #1 Battle Royale game, the #1 RPG, the #1 MMO and the #1 best-selling game of all time \u2013 Minecraft.\nNow, we\u2019re announcing more games that support RTX technology, including DLSS, which is coming to both Call of Duty: Warzone and Square Enix\u2019s new IP, Outriders. And Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security Breach and F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch will be adding ray tracing and DLSS.\nFor more details, read our January 2021 RTX Games article.\n\u201cThe momentum is unstoppable,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cAs consoles and the rest of the ecosystem are now onboard \u2014 ray tracing is the new standard.\nlast year, NVIDIA launched its second generation of RTX, the GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs. Based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, it represents \u201cour biggest generational leap ever,\u201d Fisher said.\nNVIDIA built NVIDIA Reflex to deliver the lowest system latency for competitive gamers \u2013 from mouse click to display. Since Reflex\u2019s launch in September, a dozen games have added support.\nFisher announced that Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege are also adopting NVIDIA Reflex. Now, 7 of the top 10 competitive shooters support Reflex.\nAnd over the past four months, NVIDIA has launched four NVIDIA Ampere architecture-powered graphics cards, from the ultimate BFGPU \u2014 the GeForce RTX 3090 priced at $1,499 \u2014 to the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti at $399.\n\u201cAmpere has been our fastest selling architecture ever, selling almost twice as much as our prior generation,\u201d Fisher said.\nGeForce RTX 3060: An NVIDIA Ampere GPU for Every Gamer\nWith gaming now a key part of global culture, the new GeForce RTX 3060 brings the power of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture to every gamer, Fisher said.\n\u201cThe RTX 3060 offers twice the raster performance of the GTX 1060 and 10x the ray-tracing performance,\u201d Fisher said, noting that the GTX 1060 is the world\u2019s most popular GPU. \u201cThe RTX 3060 powers the latest games with RTX On at 60 frames per second.\u201d\nThe RTX 3060 has 13 shader teraflops, 25 RT teraflops for ray tracing, and 101 tensor teraflops to power DLSS, an NVIDIA technology introduced in 2019 that uses AI to accelerate games. And it boasts 12 gigabytes of GDDR6 memory.\n\u201cWith most of the installed base underpowered for the latest games, we\u2019re bringing RTX to every gamer with the GeForce RTX 3060,\u201d Fisher said.\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 starts at just $329 and will be available worldwide in late February.\n\n\u201cAmazing Gaming Doesn\u2019t End at the Desktop\u201d\nNVIDIA also announced a new generation of NVIDIA Ampere architecture-powered laptop GPUs.\nLaptops, Fisher explained, are the fastest-growing gaming platform. There are now 50 million gaming laptops, which powered over 14 billion gaming hours last year.\n\u201cAmazing gaming doesn\u2019t end at the desktop,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nThese high-performance machines also meet the needs of 45 million creators and everyone working and studying from home, Fisher said.\nThe new generation of NVIDIA Ampere architecture-powered laptops, with second-generation RTX and third-generation Max-Q technologies, deliver twice the power efficiency of previous generations.\nEfficiency Is Paramount in Laptops\nThat\u2019s why NVIDIA introduced Max-Q four years ago, Fisher explained.\nMax-Q is a system design approach that delivers high performance in thin and light gaming laptops.\n\u201cIt has fundamentally changed how laptops are built, every aspect \u2014 the CPU GPU, software, PCB design, power delivery, thermals \u2014 are optimized for power and performance,\u201d Fisher said.\nNVIDIA\u2019s third-gen Max-Q technologies use AI and new system optimizations to make high-performance gaming laptops faster and better than ever, he said.\nFisher introduced Dynamic Boost 2.0, which for the first time uses AI to shift power between the CPU, GPU and now, GPU memory.\n\u201cSo your laptop is constantly optimizing for maximum performance,\u201d Fisher said.\nFisher also introduced WhisperMode 2.0, which delivers a new level of acoustic control for gaming laptops.\nPick your desired acoustics and WhisperMode 2.0\u2019s AI-powered algorithms manage the CPU, GPU system temperature and fan speeds to \u201cdeliver great acoustics at the best possible performance,\u201d Fisher explained.\nAnother new feature, Resizable BAR, uses the advanced capabilities of PCI Express to boost gaming performance.\nGames use GPU memory for textures, shaders and geometry \u2014 constantly updating as the player moves through the world.\nToday, only part of the GPU\u2019s memory can be accessed at any one time by the CPU, requiring many memory updates, Fisher explained.\nWith Resizable BAR, the game can access the entire GPU memory, allowing for multiple updates at the same time, improving performance, Fisher said.\nResizable BAR will also be supported on GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards for desktops, starting with the GeForce RTX 3060. NVIDIA and GPU partners are readying VBIOS updates for existing GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards starting in March.\nFinally, NVIDIA DLSS offers a breakthrough for gaming laptops.

Catch up on all of our automotive posts, here.\nEven with advanced driver assistance systems automating more driving functions, human drivers must maintain their attention at the wheel and build trust in the AI system.\nTraditional driver monitoring systems typically don\u2019t understand subtle cues such as a driver\u2019s cognitive state, behavior or other activity that indicates whether they\u2019re ready to take over the driving controls.\nNVIDIA DRIVE IX is an open, scalable cockpit software platform that provides AI functions to enable a full range of in-cabin experiences, including intelligent visualization with augmented reality and virtual reality, conversational AI and interior sensing.\nDriver perception is a key aspect of the platform that enables the AV system to ensure a driver is alert and paying attention to the road. It also enables the AI system to perform cockpit functions that are more intuitive and intelligent.\nIn this DRIVE Labs episode, NVIDIA experts demonstrate how DRIVE IX perceives driver attention, activity, emotion, behaviour, posture, speech, gesture and mood with a variety of detection capabilities.\n\nA Multi-DNN Approach\nFacial expressions are complex signals to interpret. A simple wrinkle of the brow or shift of the gaze can have a variety of meanings.\nDRIVE IX uses multiple DNNs to recognize faces and decipher the expressions of vehicle occupants. The first DNN detects the face itself, while a second identifies fiducial points, or reference markings \u2014 such as eye location, nose, etc.\nOn top of these base networks, a variety of DNNs operate to determine whether a driver is paying attention or requires other actions from the AI system.\nThe GazeNet DNN tracks gazes by detecting the vector of the driver\u2019s eyes and mapping it to the road to check if they\u2019re able to see obstacles ahead. SleepNet monitors drowsiness, classifying whether eyes are open or closed, running through a state machine to determine levels of exhaustion. Finally, ActivityNet tracks driver activity such as phone usage, hands on/off the wheel and driver attention to road events. DRIVE IX can also detect whether the driver is properly sitting in their seat to focus on road events.\n\nIn addition to driver focus, a separate DNN can determine a driver\u2019s emotions \u2014 a key indicator of their ability to safely operate the vehicle. Taking in data from the base face-detect and fiducial-point networks, DRIVE IX can classify a driver\u2019s state as happy, surprised, neutral, disgusted or angry.\nIt can also tell if the driver is squinting or screaming, indicating their level of visibility or alertness and state of mind.\n\n\u00a0\nA Customizable Solution\nVehicle manufacturers can leverage the driver monitoring capabilities in DRIVE IX to develop advanced AI-based driver understanding capabilities for personalizing the car cockpit.\nThe car can be programmed to alert a driver if their attention drifts from the road, or the cabin can adjust settings to soothe occupants if tensions are high.\nAnd these capabilities extend well beyond driver monitoring. The aforementioned DNNs, together with gesture DNN and speech capabilities, enable multi-modal conversational AI offerings such as automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and speech synthesis.\n\nThese networks can be used for in-cabin personalization and virtual assistant applications. Additionally, the base facial recognition and facial key point models can be used for AI-based video conferencing platforms.\nThe driver monitoring capabilities of DRIVE IX help build trust between occupants and the AI system as automated driving technology develops, creating a safer, more enjoyable intelligent vehicle experience.\n\n\nCategories: DRIVE Labs | DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, however, it\u2019s starting to show its age as the production values of the latest and greatest games continue to improve, demanding more and more from your GPU.\nFor example, gamers were playing Watch Dogs 2 with high settings at 60 frames per second on the GeForce GTX 1060, but with Watch Dogs: Legion, released last October, they only get 24 frames per second. And an even bigger change is underway: turn ray tracing on and these games become unplayable on the GeForce GTX 1060. Furthermore, the GeForce GTX 1060 lacks the latest enhancements and features of the newest GPUs; features that can further improve your experience.\nEnter the GeForce RTX 3060, a $329 upgrade launching late February that brings the power of Ampere, our 2nd Generation RTX architecture, to every gamer. With it, you get twice the raster performance and 10x the ray tracing performance of the GeForce GTX 1060 - a massive increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 has the power to dazzle you with immersive ray-traced effects in Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Minecraft with RTX For Windows 10, Watch Dogs: Legion, and many other titles. And of course, NVIDIA DLSS is included, too, greatly accelerating frame rates in over 40 RTX games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 is built with a 192-bit bus, which allows us to equip this latest addition to the 3060 family with 12 GB of fast GDDR6 memory. The 12GB of faster GDDR6 also makes it a great choice for creators working with large datasets, models, and detailed scenes.\nHaving been built using the same NVIDIA Ampere Architecture as the rest of the GeForce RTX 30 Series, the new GeForce RTX 3060 offers all the same advancements, benefits and features, improving your gaming, live streaming, content creation, and work.\nResizable BAR will be supported on the GeForce RTX 30 Series, too, starting with the RTX 3060. When combined with a compatible motherboard that supports the feature, this advanced PCI Express technology enables all of the GPU memory to be accessed by the CPU at once, providing a performance boost in many games. Read more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores give you the hardware to run the latest ray-traced titles with solid performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe critically acclaimed, AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS uses 3rd Generation Tensor Cores to boost frame rates in ray-traced and rasterized games. Enjoy Cyberpunk 2077, Minecraft with RTX, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and other games at 60 FPS by simply enabling GeForce Experience\u2019s One Click Optimal Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency in competitive multiplayer games, helping get shots off faster, which can make all the difference between success and defeat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast uses Tensor Cores and AI to enhance your live streaming and conference calls with near-magical noise removal, virtual green screens, and more features that transform your space into a home studio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows content creators to significantly reduce the time it takes to create amazing content, be it videos, photos, or 3D animations.\nTake your creative projects to a whole new level with the GeForce RTX 3060. Creators get full support from the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem, which provides content creators with the best performance and experience, including hardware acceleration in leading creative apps, AI-assisted workflows, and NVIDIA Studio drivers for increased stability.\nBuilt to perform in record time \u2014 whether that\u2019s 3D rendering, video editing in UHD, or livestreaming with the best encoding and image quality \u2014 the GeForce RTX 3060 gives you the performance to create your best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs are also the first to include support for the latest industry advancements, such as HDMI 2.1, DirectX 12 Ultimate, AV1 decode support, and Direct Storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this tech, and our feature-rich apps like GeForce Experience and NVIDIA Broadcast, make your gaming, live streaming, video calls, and work faster, smoother and all round better. No other platform offers this breadth of technology, or the range of enhancements for gaming, work and everyday tasks.\nAnd with the GeForce RTX 3060 we\u2019re bringing these features to every gamer, starting late February.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Based on the same Ampere architecture and the same GPUs as NVIDIA\u2019s existing desktop GeForce cards, the RTX 30 series for laptops will bring Ampere\u2019s features and much of its performance to laptops, just tuned to the sub-150 Watt power requirements that come with a laptop. Laptops will be getting versions of the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060, with the first of these new generation of laptops set to become available later this month, on January 26th.\nThough an obligatory step in the roll-out of a new GPU architecture, the release of laptop parts is an important one for NVIDIA and its OEM partners. Laptops represent an ever-growing share of the PC gaming market, and perhaps just as importantly for NVIDIA, it\u2019s a market that, above entry-level discrete graphics, they have virtually complete control of. So a big part of NVIDIA\u2019s fortunes hinge in part on getting laptop gamers to upgrade to new machines with the latest and greatest in NVIDIA graphics technology. In fact in some respects laptops are more important than desktops, as the low power needs for laptops means that these machines get some of the best chips NVIDIA bins \u2013 which in turn tends to be reflected in the prices of some of these laptops.\nFor their latest generation, while not being explicitly noted by NVIDIA, it looks like a change in nomenclature is at hand. In the past couple of generations the company has simply referred to their mobile parts with the same name as their desktop parts \u2013 e.g. GeForce RTX 2080. However for the RTX 30 series, we\u2019re seeing parts listed as \u201claptop GPU\u201d, e.g. \u201cGeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU\u201d. It\u2019s a small change, but an important one: as we look at the specifications, it\u2019s clear that NVIDIA isn\u2019t always using the same GPU in a mobile part as they have its desktop counterpart, so any kind of true equivalency between laptop and desktop has gone out the window. In practice, laptop graphics adapters have always been their own product family, and now by returning to having distinct naming and specifications for their laptop adapters, NVIDIA has gone back to more clearly defining this structure.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop Specifications\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3080\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3070\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3060\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n6144\n5120\n3840\n\n\nROPs\n96?\n80?\n64?\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1245 - 1710MHz\n1290 - 1620MHz\n1283 - 1703MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n?Gbps GDDR6\n?Gbps GDDR6\n?Gbps GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n8GB / 16GB\n8GB\n6GB\n\n\nTDP Range\n80 - 150W+\n80 - 125W\n60 - 115W\n\n\nGPU\nGA104\nGA104\nGA106\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm?\n\n\nLaunch Date\n01/26/2021\n01/26/2021\n01/26/2021\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU\nDiving into specifications and features, the new GeForce RTX 30 series adapters cover the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 families. And though NVIDIA\u2019s own specifications don\u2019t explicitly list what GPUs are driving these configurations, based on the number of CUDA cores and other factors, it looks like NVIDIA is using a mix of the existing GA104 GPU and what would be their new GA106 GPU to drive these parts. Notably, RTX 3080 in the desktop uses a cut-down GA102 part, not GA104, and with GA102 being unsuitable for anything short of a quite literal desktop replacement notebook, GA104 instead sits at the heart of the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU as well as all flavors of RTX 3070.\n\nThe leading member of their new laptop adapters, the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU \u2013 or what I'm calling 3080L for short \u2013 appears to be based on a fully-enabled GA104 GPU. All 48 SMs are enabled, as are all 8 memory channels, so 3080L stands to be GA104 in its top form. Clockspeeds for mobile parts are highly variable owing to differences in laptop cooling and TDP headroom, but officially NVIDIA is giving the boost clock for the 3080L a pretty wide berth, with a range of 1245Mhz to 1710MHz.\nMeanwhile, for memory NVIDIA is using tried and true (and lower power) GDDR6. Unfortunately memory clocks are not disclosed \u2013 so it\u2019s not immediately clear if this is going to be 12Gbps or 14Gbps memory \u2013 but for the 3080L the adapter will come with 8GB or 16GB of memory on a 256-bit bus. The inclusion of a 16GB option is a welcome change after years of 8GB being the largest laptop configuration, and it\u2019s interesting to note that due to laptop space requirements, this strongly implies that NVIDIA is using 16Gb memory modules, which just recently hit the market, rather than their usual 8Gb modules (which need to be in a clamshell configuration to allow for 16GB of VRAM).\n\nFinally, while power consumption/TDP is largely up to the OEMs, NVIDIA\u2019s official guidance is that the 3080L is designed for 80W to 150W+ operation. Towards the lower-end will be Max-Q laptops and other thin and light designs, getting some of NVIDIA\u2019s finest silicon. At the other end of the spectrum will be true DTR laptops, which can handle the 150W or more of power consumption from a graphics adapter with near-desktop performance.\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU\nFollowing the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU is the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU (3070L). This appears to be a cut-down version of the GA104 GPU, with fewer SMs enabled and a narrower TDP range. Overall, 40 SMs are enabled here, with boost clocks ranging from 1290MHz to 1620MHz. Meanwhile memory is available in just an 8GB GDDR6 configuration, with the complete 256-bit memory bus enabled.\nWith an 80W to 125W TDP window, the biggest change here is likely to be felt at the high-end, where relative to the 3080L, the 3070L has both lower peak clockspeeds and fewer SMs. NVIDIA doesn\u2019t offer a lot of performance guidance here \u2013 clearly the new laptop parts are going to be a good deal faster than the old ones, based on what we\u2019ve seen in the desktop \u2013 but it\u2019s worth noting that NVIDIA is pitching the 3070L as being well-suited for 1440p gaming. Which is the first time we\u2019ve seen them seriously float the idea of 1440p with anything less than an 80-class laptop graphics adapter.\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU\nLast but not least in the new mobile family is the GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (3060L). Like the desktop GeForce RTX 3060 also announced today, the specifications for the RTX 3060L point to it being based on a new GPU, which in NVIDIA\u2019s usual naming schemes would be GA106. At this point we don\u2019t have any detailed information about GA106 in particular, so we only know how it\u2019s configured for the desktop and laptop 3060s respectively.\nIn any case, the 3060L comes with 30 SMs enabled, for a total of 3840 FP32 CUDA cores. With the usual disclaimer about TDPs applying here as well, the adapter\u2019s boost clock is rated for anywhere between 1283MHz and 1703MHz. This would put overall performance, in terms of FP32 FLOPS, between 9.9 TFLOPS and 13.1 TFLOPS.\nThe memory subsystem on the 3060L has been cut down relative to the other laptop parts. Here there\u2019s just a 192-bit memory bus, meaning that memory can only be installed in multiples of 6GB. In this case, NVIDIA has opted for 6GB for 3060L whereas desktop 3060 gets 12GB. 6GB shouldn\u2019t be too much of a deal-breaker here, but it will stand out a bit when NVIDIA is doing more on the desktop. Otherwise, as we don\u2019t have specific information on memory clockspeeds, it\u2019s not clear right now if 3060L comes with 12Gbps or 14Gbps GDDR6 \u2013 though as the lowest-power SKU, the former is increasingly likely.\nSpeaking of power, NVIDIA\u2019s official TDP guidance for 3060L is 60W to 115W. This puts the floor below both the 3070L and 3080L, and interestingly, also 5W below that of the RTX 2060 it replaces, which had a floor of 65W. Meanwhile 115W will be more likely to show up in DTR-like designs, which will be better able to reach the higher-end of the part\u2019s rated boost clock.\n\nThird Gen Max-Q Technologies\nAlongside the hardware itself, NVIDIA also briefly alluded to what they\u2019re calling their third generation of Max-Q technologies that go alongside their new Ampere-based laptop parts. Calling all of these technologies AI-powered, NVIDIA is probably paying a little fast and loose with \u201cAI\u201d, but at the end of the day these should be useful features for laptops. It\u2019s also worth noting that even with the Max-Q designation, it\u2019s likely that some of the new functionality available here will also show up in non Max-Q laptops.\n\nKicking things off is Dynamic Boost 2.0, the latest iteration of NVIDIA\u2019s Dynamic Boost technology that was first introduced last April. As we wrote back at the time:\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Dynamic Boost is designed to take advantage of the fact that in many laptop designs, the GPU and the CPU share a common thermal budget, typically because they are both cooled via the same set of heatpipes. In practice, this is usually done in order to allow OEMs to build relatively thin and light systems, where the cooling capacity of the system is more than the TDP either of the CPU or GPU alone, but less than the total TDP of those two processors together. This allows OEMs to design around different average, peak, and sustained workloads, offering plenty of headroom for peak performance while sacrificing some sustained performance in the name of lighter laptops.\n\nDynamic Boost 2.0, in turn, is the latest version of NVIDIA\u2019s dynamic power allocation technology. This new iteration has been expanded to include not only the CPU and the GPU, but the GPU VRAM as well \u2013 indicating that NVIDIA is taking full advantage of Ampere giving its memory controller its own power rail, rather than sharing it with the GPU. Memory power consumption continues to be a hot topic, as while VRAM power consumption on the whole pales to GPU power consumption, the gap narrows in laptop designs. Unless it\u2019s asleep, GDDR6 can be quite power hungry, especially at higher clockspeeds.\nWe\u2019re still waiting on a briefing or technical paper from NVIDIA for additional details on Dynamic Boost 2.0, and in particular any additional information on the gains from including GPU memory in their dynamic power allocation budgets. Clearly it is expected to have some kind of an impact, but from the outside it\u2019s not clear what that impact might be.\nLike Dynamic Boost 1.0, 2.0 adjusts power allocations on a per-frame basis. Meanwhile, it\u2019s worth noting that unlike Dynamic Boost 1.0, Dynamic Boost 2.0 is a mandatory feature for Max-Q laptops. So all RTX 30 series Max-Q laptops have the feature, and ship with it enabled out of the box.\nNVIDIA is also rolling an updated version of their Whispermode performance/noise optimization technology. As a refresher, Whispermode is designed to throttle down a game\u2019s performance and image quality to more optimally balance a game\u2019s performance with the amount of noise being generated from cooling a laptop \u2013 in essence allowing the user to control whether they want full performance, or will accept some tradeoffs for a quieter system. Whispermode is particularly effective for high framerate games, since these games can be dialed down while still maintaining reasonable performance.\nAccording to NVIDIA, Whispermode 2.0 has been reengineered from the ground up so that it\u2019s now being designed into laptops on a system design level. NVIDIA\u2019s published details are very thin here, but it is worth noting that NVIDIA specifically mentions Whispermode 2.0 controlling the system fans as well, something that wasn\u2019t a feature of 1.0. Otherwise, NVIDIA is mostly reiterating the user-controllable nature of the feature, with users being able to select their \u201cdesired acoustic level\u201d.\nWrapping up the Max-Q 3.0 technology family, NVIDIA is now putting their existing DLSS technology under this umbrella. Similarly, support for a PCIe resizable BAR, which is coming to laptops and desktops, is also being lumped in with Max-Q. In fairness, RTX 30 series laptops are getting the technology first (desktops are a couple of months behind), and although helpful, it\u2019s by no means a Max-Q exclusive technology.\nGeForce RTX 30 Series For Laptops; Biggest Laptop Launch Ever\nOutside of Max-Q specific features, the GeForce RTX 30 series for laptops will also bring to laptops for the first time the rest of the new technologies that were introduced with the Ampere architecture last year. Particularly notable here is HDMI 2.1 support, giving suitable RTX 30 series laptops the ability to drive 120Hz 4K TVs, and even 8K TVs. \u00a0These new GPUs also come with AV1 decoding support, which although we\u2019re still in the very early days of AV1 support, will in time come in handy, especially on laptops using Intel Comet Lake (10th gen Core) CPUs, as the iGPU there doesn\u2019t support AV1 decoding.\n\nAnd, of course, all of these parts come with Ampere\u2019s general architecture optimizations. The doubled FP32 CUDA core count, the doubled RT hardware, and so on will filter down into the RTX 30 series laptop parts. Overall, NVIDIA is touting a 2x efficiency improvement for their Ampere laptop parts versus the last-generation Turing parts, which is notably better than what we saw with the desktop parts, which tended to deemphasize efficiency in the name of higher total performance. But of course with laptops having very hard (and relatively low) TDP ceilings, NVIDIA and its OEM partners need to dial in their GPU clockspeeds in a more conservative and power-friendly manner.\nCoincidentally, NVIDIA isn\u2019t proving a whole lot of guidance about expected performance \u2013 at least, not relative to prior generation parts. At iso-power, 2x efficiency means 2x performance, but as TDPs are closer to design guidelines than hard limits, iso-power is a big assumption. In which case, we\u2019re left with NVIDIA\u2019s sole published performance chart, comparing the 3080L to its 2080 and 1080 laptop counterparts. Here it\u2019s around 50% faster than the 2080, and opens up further against the 1080.\n\nBroadly speaking, NVIDIA operates on an N + 2 cycle for GPU upgrades \u2013 which is to say that they assume, plan for, and promote their latest-generation hardware as being a suitable upgrade for hardware that is two generations old. So with the RTX 30 series for laptops, NVIDIA\u2019s primary focus is going to be on getting GTX 10 series laptop owners to upgrade, hitting on both the performance differences as well as all the feature differences such as ray tracing and DLSS that were introduced in successive hardware generations.\nMeanwhile NVIDIA\u2019s product stack layout as whole is not changing much for this generation. In the back-half of the last generation, laptops with NVIDIA\u2019s mainstream-enthusiast GPU, RTX 2060, started at $999. For the RTX 30 series, the story is much the same, with RTX 3060L laptops starting at $999. Meanwhile RTX 3070L laptops will start at $1299, and RTX 3080L laptops at $1999.\nOverall, NVIDIA and its OEM partners appear to be very optimistic about the market opportunities for RTX 30 series laptops. If you haven\u2019t already noticed the flood of laptop announcements on AnandTech today, according to NVIDIA over RTX 30 series laptops are being introduced in this launch period, with NVIDIA calling it their bigger laptop launch ever. With suitable CPUs available from both Intel and AMD this cycle, NVIDIA\u2019s partners have more choices than ever for configuring laptops, and a market that in the last 9 months has proven to be very hungry for laptop hardware as we all remained cooped up inside.\n\nThe first RTX 30 series laptops will go on sale later this month, with retail availability expected on January 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n22 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nromrunning - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\n\"The first RTX 30 series laptops will go on sale later this month, with retail availability expected on January 26th.\"Make sure you get in line now to get one of those two laptops!  ;)\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nSimply not true...\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Wednesday, January 13, 2021 - link\nTo be fair - if they've been binning these ever since Ampere launched, they might actually have a few built up to sell.\n\n\n\nyeeeeman - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nsuch a shame they didn't bake these on tsmc 7nm. the improvements over turing are quite small.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nThe improvements over Turing seem healthy to me, but yeah it's a shame it's not on TSMC 7 nm from a technical perspective.

Top system makers are delivering the first wave of NVIDIA-Certified Systems, the industry\u2019s only servers tested for modern workloads.\nThese systems speed AI thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPUs riding NVIDIA Mellanox networks. They spin up machine learning techniques that unearth insights from growing mounds of corporate data, gems that traditional systems miss.\nDell Technologies, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information and Supermicro are all shipping certified servers today. NVIDIA is collaborating with top OEMs around the world to drive AI forward across every industry.\nThe first systems off the line using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs include:\n\nDell EMC PowerEdge R7525 and R740 rack servers\nGIGABYTE R281-G30, R282-Z96, G242-Z11, G482-Z54, G492-Z51 systems\nHPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 System and HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 Server\nInspur NF5488A5\nSupermicro A+ Server AS\u00a0-4124GS-TNR and AS\u00a0-2124GQ-NART\n\nThey all carry the NVIDIA-Certified Systems badge that gives customers confidence they\u2019re buying systems that meet NVIDIA\u2019s best design practices. That means they can tackle the toughest tasks in machine learning, data analytics and more.\nLeading makers of accelerated servers have NVIDIA-Certified Systems ready today.\nA Tipping Point for Enterprise AI\nThe systems arrive as leading corporations are getting traction in AI.\nAmerican Express is using the latest AI models for real-time fraud detection. Ford taps generative adversarial networks to generate data it needs to test self-driving cars. And Dominos applies AI to improve predictions of when orders will be ready for the 3 billion pizzas it delivers every year.\nThey are among many companies plugging into a powerful new form of computing, born on the web and now spreading into sectors from retail and logistics to banking and healthcare.\nGartner estimates 37 percent of all organizations have AI in production today and predicts that will double to 75 percent by 2024.\nScaling a Big Data Mountain\nCompanies seek strategic insights hidden in a rising mountain of data. Walmart, for example, processes more than 2.5 petabytes of data every hour.\nAI models to sift through that data have grown in size by nearly 30,000x in just five years, driving the need for accelerated computing. And the diversity of models and workloads using them continues to expand, so businesses need the flexibility of GPUs.\nThe rising tide of data and the expanding AI models to sift through it are spawning an exponential increase in network traffic both in the data center and at the network\u2019s edge. To cope, companies need a secure, reliable and high-speed infrastructure that scales efficiently.\nAcing the Test for AI\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems deliver the performance, programmability and secure throughput enterprise AI needs. They combine the computing power of GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture with secure, high-speed NVIDIA Mellanox networking.\nTo pass the certification, the systems are tested across a broad range of workloads, from jobs that require multiple compute nodes to tasks that only need part of the power of a single GPU.\nThe systems are optimized to run AI applications from the NGC catalog, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for GPU-optimized applications.\nNGC is also the home for an expanding set of software development kits that bring AI to vertical markets such as healthcare (Clara) and robotics (Isaac). In addition, it holds frameworks that help companies get started in emerging use cases like recommendation systems (Merlin) and intelligent video analytics (Metropolis).\nSpecifically, NVIDIA-Certified Systems must pass tests on:\n\nDeep learning training and inference\nMachine learning algorithms\nIntelligent video analytics\nNetwork and storage offload\n\nThe tests focus on real-world use cases. They use popular AI frameworks and containers, all available in the NGC catalog.\nAs a result, NVIDIA-Certified Systems let every company access the same hardware and software behind some of the most powerful AI computers on the planet.\nAll of the world\u2019s largest cloud service providers and eight of the world\u2019s top 10 supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA technology. And NVIDIA-based systems lead in AI benchmarks such as MLPerf.\nA Peek Under the Hood\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems include powerful data center servers with as many as eight A100 GPUs and high-speed InfiniBand or Ethernet network adapters. Others are mainstream AI systems tailored to run AI at the edge of the corporate network.\nOEMs certify the systems using NVIDIA Mellanox cables, switches and network cards such as ConnectX-6 InfiniBand or Ethernet adapters and BlueField-2 DPUs. In addition to high throughput at low latency, these adapters support multiple layers of security from a hardware root of trust at boot time to connection tracking for applications.\nEvery system was certified using either an NVIDIA Mellanox 8700 HDR 200G InfiniBand switch or the Mellanox SN3700 Ethernet switch.\nAll NVIDIA-Certified Systems are available with enterprise support across the full software stack, including support for open source code. That\u2019s because we want to ensure enterprises across all vertical markets can quickly enjoy the benefits of AI.\nWith the latest systems from Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, HPE, Inspur Electronic Information, and Supermicro, every company can start its own journey to enterprise AI.\nTo date, 14 servers from six systems makers are certified and ready to provide accelerated computing. They are among 70 systems from at least 11 system makers engaged in the program.\nStay tuned for news of more NVIDIA-Certified Systems from more partners.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | GPU Computing | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She was tried in December 2019 and received a conditional discharge and \u00a3300 court costs.\n\u201cThe realisation that there is a climate emergency comes in waves, and it comes more and more.\nI organised a \u201cHeading for Extinction Talk\u201d in our local library, part of that talk was about rebelling, and part of that was about being arrested, so I was pretty sure I would be arrested at one point. And then we did the the NVDA, (Non-Violent Direct Training) in March. My friend Sarah and I were both on it and agreed we would both get arrested.\n\u201cI have five grandchildren and when I got carried off, I said to the tourists who were taking photos that I was doing this for my grandchildren.\u201d\nBoth of us are older respectable people and when I tell people I was arrested \u2013 I can see the shock on their faces \u2013 it is a way of really showing how very strong my convictions are.\nIt was Easter Sunday, we had been in parliament square the day before as we\u2019d been helping in the kitchen, but when we arrived the next day the police had already started to dismantle the kitchen and the tents. The police were obviously moving into the blockades, so we went and sat down in one of the places where people were chained together \u2013 to make it longer for the police to get to them \u2013 and that\u2019s when we were picked up. I have five grandchildren and when I got carried off I said to the tourists who were taking photos that I was doing this for my grandchildren.\nI feel frightened when I think about the climate emergency, I am frightened for my children and grandchildren.\nEven in my lifetime it is going to make a big difference. It is scary, it\u2019s very scary. We need to rebel because this government is not doing anything, they are business as usual. I\u2019ve watched a lot of parliament recently and nobody has mentioned climate change. Humans just need to realise they are part of the ecosystem they are not above it \u2013 they have to be part of it.\u201d\nDoro\u2019s story was covered in the Camden New Journal http://camdennewjournal.com/article/grandmother-how-i-found-myself-locked-up-by-fighting-to-stop-climate-change and the Guardian

This means that now could be an opportune time to take a look at the best vice ETFs to buy and cash in on pent up demand for sinful behavior.\nSource: Shutterstock\nVice funds typically hold what are casually referred to as sin stocks, including companies involved in businesses such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, leisure and entertainment. Vice funds are unique in that they can have the defensive qualities of consumer staples but also the offensive growth potential of consumer discretionary stocks.\nHere are 7 vice ETFs to buy as the world gets back to normal:\n\nAdvisorShares Vice ETF (NYSEARCA:VICE)\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLY)\nInvesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment\u00a0(NYSEARCA:PEJ)\nInvesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ)\nVanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (NASDAQ:BJK)\nVanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NASDAQ:ESPO)\nETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ)\n\nSince the demand for some sin stocks, such as alcohol and tobacco, can remain relatively stable or even increase during recessionary periods, they earn the defensive label. But other sinful areas, such as gambling and entertainment, are often considered to be consumer discretionary or cyclical in nature. These are areas that could see big gains in a post-Covid world.\n\nVice ETFs To Buy: AdvisorShares Vice ETF (VICE)\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBoasting a new ticker but the same focused vice strategy, AdvisorShares Vice ETF (NYSEARCA:VICE) appears primed and ready to take on a new world of sinful behavior.\nAs of Nov. 1, 2020, VICE, which was formerly ACT, took on it\u2019s new ticker. This actively-managed ETF still invests in vice industries, such as alcohol, tobacco, e-sports and gaming. As such, VICE shareholders get exposure to sin stocks, such as recent top holdings, Boston Beer Company (NYSE:SAM), Turning Point Brands (NYSE:TPB) and LVMH Moet Hennessy (OTCMKTS:LVMUY).\nThe underlying investment philosophy that fund manager Dan Ahrens follows is to buy vice stocks that can perform in any environment, including recession. Ahrens seeks long-term growth as well, which makes VICE a long-term holding in addition to its defensive qualities.\n\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY)\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you want a vice ETF holding a broad selection of cyclical stocks, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLY), is a good way to do it.\nIt can be a mistake to assume that all sin stocks must be categorized as consumer staples. Yes, consumers will generally sin in all economic conditions. During hard times, consumers may continue buying alcohol (and maybe more of it, as we saw in 2020) but consumers like to sin in other ways during good times.\nAs the economy opens more in the post-coronavirus world, pent up demand for goods and services in the consumer discretionary sector has potential to grow faster than the broader market. Put simply, a stronger economy generally translates to a happier consumer, which generally translates to greater discretionary spending.\nConsumers living in a mask-free world will have a compounding effect on this growth potential. This tends to support cyclical stocks, such as XLY top holdings Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and McDonalds (NYSE:MCD).\n\nInvesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment (PEJ)\n\n\nSource: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a post-coronavirus world, consumers will be ready to spend more on the leisure and entertainment industries. This potential sets up opportunities for investors to hold funds like Invesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment (NYSEARCA:PEJ).\nA three-word phrase you\u2019re likely to see in 2021, especially in the second half of the year, is pent up demand. Consumers are ready to return to a normal world of planning vacations, staying at hotels, going to theme parks and partying at casinos. PEJ is among the best vice ETFs to buy for this type of opportunity.\nThe PEJ portfolio consists of 30 stocks of companies in the leisure and entertainment industries, such as Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT).\n\nInvesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (PBJ)\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestors that want to play both offense and defense in a vice fund should take a look at Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ).\nPBJ tracks the Dynamic Food & Beverage Intellidex Index, which consists of 30 U.S. food and beverage companies, with top holdings such as Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE:KDP) and Hershey (NYSE:HSY).\nStocks in the food and beverage industry have offensive and defensive qualities because consumers tend to buy these products in good times and in bad. Since 2021 can potentially be a year that contains qualities of both a weak and strong economy, PBJ could be a smart play that rides the fence of those opposing environments.\n\nVanEck Vectors Gaming ETF\n\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a momentum play in a gaming fund, VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (NASDAQ:BJK) is well worth your consideration.\nThe BJK portfolio seeks to replicate returns of the MVIS Global Gaming Index, which tracks a basket of stocks investing in casinos, hotels, gaming technology and gaming services.\nIn Q4 2020, BJK put up a three-month gain of 20.3%, beating the majority of funds in the consumer cyclicals sector. With the first half economic conditions of 2021 appearing to look similar to the second half of 2020, BJK could be primed for category busting returns in the foreseeable future.\nBut it could be the second half of 2021, when the global economy may begin to normalize, that pent up demand for gaming begins to take off. That\u2019s why betting on these gains in advance could pay off.\n\nVanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO)\n\n\nSource: Roman Kosolapov/ Shutterstock\n\nInvestors that believe gaming technology can continue its red hot 2020 performance may want to make that play now with the VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NASDAQ:ESPO).\nESPO attempts to mirror the performance of the MVIS Video Gaming and eSports Index, which represents 25 stocks of companies involved in video game development, e-sports and related hardware and software.\nThe kind of stocks shareholders will see in ESPO include technology bellwethers like Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\nESPO put up a market-crushing 83.9% gain in 2020. Could the momentum carry forward? The coronavirus pandemic increased demand for mobile gaming and this industry appears to be here to stay for the foreseeable future.\n\nETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a resurgence of cannabis stocks in 2021, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ).\nIn fact MJ could already be in the midst of a comeback now, if Q4 2020 is any indication. Although December was negative, the last three months of the year saw MJ jump by 39%. As is the case with the fund\u2019s history, the price movement is almost certain to be much more volatile than the broader market.\nAs for the MJ portfolio, this cannabis ETF tracks the Prime Alternative Harvest Index, which consists of 33 stocks within the cannabis industry. The largest sub-sector of the portfolio, with an allocation of 44%, is stocks of companies related to cannabis production.

Founded in 2015, the startup is carrying packages for UPS and has partnerships with Navistar, Penske, and US Xpress.\nThough TuSimple has more competitors than it did five years ago, the company believes its head start on rivals like Waymo, Aurora Innovation, and Ike (when it comes to focusing on trucks, anyway) has allowed it to build a lead over them in an industry that could be worth $2 billion by 2027. Jeff Herbst, the vice president of business development at Nvidia, a TuSimple supplier and investor, agrees.\n\n\n\"They seem to have escaped the pack,\" he said.\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Herbst explained why Nvidia decided to invest in TuSimple and why he believes the startup has a bright future. Nvidia declined to disclose the size of its investment.\nHere's what Herbst said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIndustry-leading technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuSimple.\n\n\n\n                                                TuSimple\n                                                  \n \n\n\nHerbst said TuSimple's technology appeared to be \"incredibly good\" when he first met with the company, and that hasn't changed, as Herbst believes TuSimple has better tech than any other company that's developing self-driving-semis.\nHe highlighted the startup's long-range perception system, which he said is particularly important for a semi-truck since it can't stop as quickly as a car. TuSimple found the right balance between cameras and lidar sensors, which bounce beams of light off nearby objects to measure how far away they are, Herbst said.\n\nRead more: VCs say Aurora and TuSimple are among the self-driving startups best poised to become the next Waymo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA wise strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuSimple.\n\n\n\n                                                TuSimple\n                                                  \n \n\n\nTuSimple was one of a small number of autonomous-vehicle companies that were focusing on trucks when Herbst first met with them. The decision to focus on big rigs instead of consumer vehicles was smart for two reasons, Herbst said.\nFirst, building an automated-driving system for trucks is easier than doing the same for consumer vehicles because trucks tend to drive along fixed routes on highways, which limits the number of unexpected situations they might encounter. Second, TuSimple's technology has obvious benefits for potential customers in the trucking industry, who often making slim margins and count drivers among their biggest costs. The fact that TuSimple's competition \u2014 which now includes Waymo, Aurora Innovation, Ike, and Kodiak Robotics \u2014 has grown since TuSimple's 2015 founding is evidence that the company identified a promising opportunity, Herbst said.\n\nRead more: TuSimple's CEO reveals how the startup sold UPS and Penske on its self-driving semi trucks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA founder with energy and vision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuSimple co-founder and CTO Xiaodi Hou.\n\n\n                                                Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile for Web Summit via Getty Images\n                                               \n\n\nHerbst said he was impressed with the energy and vision of TuSimple co-founder and CTO Xiaodi Hou, as well as the team he and co-founder Mo Chen had assembled. Herbst also got the sense that Hou wouldn't be too stubborn. If it made sense to tweak the company's business plan, Herbst was confident Hou would do so.\n\"I had the confidence that he was going to be able to pivot the company in whatever way needed to be done,\" Herbst said.\nAre you a current or former TuSimple employee?

The new GeForce RTX 3060 with 12GB GDDR6 was widely leaked ahead of the GeForce RTX: Game On event at CES 2021 but nevertheless it is good to see the official specs, as well as the host of partner designs, pricing and availability details that have become available.\nThe new RTX 3060 is key to Nvidia's ambition of bringing the \"Ampere architecture to millions more PC gamers,\" and the firm is eagerly making comparisons to the hugely popular Pascal gaming GPU (as per Steam's stats), the GTX 1060. Thus Nvidia has felt comfortable using the RTX 1060 as the main reference point in its PR blurb and performance stats.\nOf course the Pascal '60 comparison will be probably very welcome to some but many gamers and enthusiasts would probably like a more modern day reference point while waiting for third party reviews. So, I'm happy to report that Nvidia did provide an AAA gaming performance chart which included an RTX 2060 too.\n\nClick to zoom chart\nSince this chart its 1080p only it looks like this GPU is going to be pitched at AAA gaming at 1080p with RT and DLSS (four out of six selected titles use RT and DLSS). A quick guesstimate of the uplift compared to an RTX 2060, using this chart is to expect about a 12 per cent uplift on average. Note that the RTX 2060 Super was about 10-20 per cent faster than the RTX 2060 across a swathe of titles when it was launched.\nSo, what are the specs of the GeForce RX 3060 12GB? If you go to the official product page you will see that the new GPu is part of the RTX 3060 Family, and thus Nvidia has shared the table below with consumers:\n.\nIn summary the RTX 3060 has 36 per cent fewer CUDA cores but runs at approx 6 per cent faster clock, however its 12GB GDDR6 memory is on a narrower 192-bit bus. The new GPU's power consumption of 170W is 30W lower than the RTX 3060 Ti.\nNvidia says that its new $329 GPU will become available in late February.\n\nPartner graphics cards from the usual suspects are already being announced. Gigabyte has launched four GeForce RX 3060 12GB models in its first wave, for example. It has triple fan Vision OC and Gaming OC cards, as well as a pair of twin-fan Eagle models in regular/OC clocks that it is showing off already. More to come on these and rival offerings at a later date.\n\nWrapping up, the RTX 3060 12GB is pretty much as expected but we were hoping for some other cards to join it; like an RTX 3060 6GB version, an RTX 3080 Ti, and even some RTX 3050/Ti graphics cards.Furthermore, Resizable BAR PCI Express technology (like AMD SAM) has been introduced for its potential gaming performance boosts. Meanwhile, a decent range of RTX 30 Mobile GPUs for laptop making partners have been launched, as you will see in the next article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nHEXUS Week In Review: Radeon RX 6600 and RTX 3070 Noctua Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

When he was at the age of 22, he worked at a sports club where he was involved in selling equipment and services to various clients. People around him noticed that he had selling skills which were extremely extraordinary. He had the ability to form a quick compassionate bond with the clients and make them understand why a particular service is of interest to them.

It was almost as it was destined, Matthias Nezzar met international entrepreneur David Michigan through a Facebook advertisement. Matthias recognized David's quality of being an ''attraction\" visibility expert and a \"conversion\" sales specialist. Soon after, Matthias left his job at the sports club despite receiving major promotion offers. David Michigan and Matthias Nezzar partnered to introduce the hybrid coaching model to the world of sports coaches and teachers. It is a revolutionary coaching model which enables a sports coach to earn locally (physically, at regional level) and on the Internet through various clients and prospects. Under this, Matthias and David help sports coaches to form and develop themselves digitally. This digital image then attracts various potential clients and prospects ready to buy the services of the coach. There is a direct increase in revenue generation and quality of work experience.

The Internet has effectively removed physical and geographical barriers and helped people form a large customer base. This is exactly what Matthias and David promote, encourage and enable among sports coaches who find it difficult to make their services available to an international market. The Hybrid Coaching and Hybrid Partners business of Matthias Nezzar and David Michigan has achieved international recognition and has earned a turnover of 1,397,000\u20ac for the year 2020, amidst the Coronavirus pandemic.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)Gamers everywhere have undoubtedly read the news by now. In January of 2019, Nvidia started announcing a number of AMD FreeSync monitors that the company has officially certified as being able to run its rival adaptive sync technology, G-Sync, as well as releasing a software-based version of G-Sync.Since then, some have found additional FreeSync displays that can run G-Sync. But for our purposes, we\u2019ll concentrate only on the panels tested and approved by Nvidia.Getting StartedTo see the complete list of G-Sync Compatible displays, as Nvidia calls them, visit Nvidia\u2019s website. At the bottom, you\u2019ll see a group of monitors labeled as \u201cG-Sync Compatible.\u201d Again, users have reported using G-Sync on non-certified FreeSync monitors, but Nvidia\u2019s list provides the full group of monitors it has tested and confirmed can successfully run G-Sync.You\u2019ll also need an Nvidia GeForce GTX 10-series graphics card or better in your PC.You must connect the monitor via DisplayPort. It won\u2019t work over HDMI. (For more on the difference between the two and what that means for gaming, see our DisplayPort vs. HDMI analysis).\u00a0Next, download an Nvidia Game Ready Driver. Support for this little trick began with 417.71, and we managed it with 419.35, dated March 5, 2019.Once the new drivers are installed, reboot Windows and turn on the FreeSync option in your monitor\u2019s on-screen display (OSD).Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The \u201cSetup G-Sync\u201d field should now appear in the Nvidia Control Panel.\u00a0If the Setup G-Sync option doesn\u2019t appear after you\u2019ve performed the above steps, go to the 3D Settings field, and click Global. Scroll down to Monitor Technology, and choose \u201cG-Sync Compatible.\u201dThat\u2019s it! You can now run G-Sync on your FreeSync monitor.The CaveatsOf course, there are a few caveats. The Acer Nitro XV273K is a 4K-resolution monitor with HDR. We found that turning on HDR removed the \u201cSetup G-Sync\u201d option from Nvidia control panel. You cannot use G-Sync and HDR at the same time on a FreeSync monitor. And that's a bit of a bummer, as adaptive sync and HDR together is one of the key selling points of AMD's latest FreeSync 2 HDR tech. So if you own one of those monitors, you might want to switch to an AMD card. Otherwise, you won't get the full experience that the FreeSync 2 HDR screen is capable of delivering.Second, there is no support for overdrive at variable refresh rates on any of the Nvidia-approved monitors. So you might see a bit of motion blur when the action drops below 100 frames per second (fps).You may also encounter problems when running G-Sync in windowed mode. We saw a lot of flickering when we tried the Nvidia pendulum demo, which is supposed to demonstrate the benefits of G-Sync. That\u2019s the best way to test your new configuration, by the way. If you see flickering or other artifacts, try lowering the refresh rate. Monitors certified by Nvidia will run G-Sync at the max speed, but others may not, especially if they\u2019re overclocked. And most issues will go away when running full-screen.For more on the downsides and what Nvidia and monitor vendors think about running G-Sync on monitors that haven't been Nvidia-certified, check out our article Should You Care if Your Monitor Is Certified G-Sync Compatible?Bottom LineYou can successfully run G-Sync on a FreeSync monitor if it\u2019s on Nvidia\u2019s approved list. You\u2019ll have to give up HDR and overdrive to do so, but it works fine otherwise. We had no issues during our testing. With two different monitors, the Acer Nitro XV273K and AOC Agon AG241QX, gaming looked the same whether in G-Sync or FreeSync mode.If you\u2019re considering saving a few bucks and hooking a FreeSync monitor up to your Nvidia-based gaming system, you might want to consult Nvidia\u2019s list of FreeSync monitors approved to support G-Sync and give one of the approved displays a try.Image Credits: Tom's HardwareMORE:\u00a0Best Gaming MonitorsMORE:\u00a0How We Test MonitorsMORE:\u00a0All Monitor Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Gaming Monitors How To\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nFreeSync\nHardware\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nChristian EberleSocial Links NavigationContributing EditorChristian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US.

AMD was the first to bring the feature to the consumer space with its Smart Access Memory (SAM) technology but NVIDIA is going to be the first to bring the technology to both mobile and desktop platforms.\nNVIDIA Brings Resizable-BAR Support For GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs on Desktop & Notebook Platforms, Available on Both Intel & AMD PCs\nNVIDIA has stated that they will be adding support for the feature through GeForce Game Ready Drivers and it will be compatible with both Intel and AMD CPU based systems. Having support on both AMD and Intel platforms might give NVIDIA an edge since AMD's solution only works with its Ryzen 5000 lineup and compatible X570 motherboards. The driver is said to launch in late February so around the same time as the availability of the GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\nWhat Platforms Support Resizable BAR?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops with both Intel and AMD CPUs will support Resizable BAR starting with their release in the coming weeks. Check with each laptop manufacturer about support on particular models.\nFor desktop systems to get the benefits of Resizable BAR, you will need a graphics card, motherboard and graphics driver that support the feature. New GeForce RTX graphics cards starting with the GeForce RTX 3060 will have support for Resizable BAR. NVIDIA and our GPU partners are also readying VBIOS updates for existing GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards starting in March.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA has been working closely with Intel, AMD and major motherboard manufacturers, including ASUS, ASRock, EVGA, GIGABYTE, and MSI, to bring Resizable BAR support to a wide range of motherboards.\n\u201cIntel has been working with NVIDIA to enable Resizable BAR, an advanced PCI-Express technology, across the PC ecosystem,\u201d said Fredrik Hamberger, GM of Premium & Enthusiast Laptop Segments at Intel. \u201cThis feature can give gamers an extra boost in gameplay FPS on Intel\u2019s new 11th generation H/S and select 10th generation systems when paired with supported graphics cards, including NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs.\u201d via NVIDIA\n\nThe technology will not require you to invest in a PCIe Gen 4 platform as it will be supported by PCIe Gen 3 too. Based on what we know so far, BAR essentially defines how much discrete GPU memory space can be mapped and today's PCs are typically limited to 256 MB of mapped memory. AMD claims that with SAM, they can access all of the GPU memory, removing any bottlenecks to allow for faster performance.\n\nAMD themselves have shown gains of up to 11% which can put the competitive advantage to their side in AAA gaming titles over NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series. We can also expect similar gains for NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 GPUs.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n119\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n102\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n77\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1291\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Dating from 2019, the patent promises a trackball device that offers the precision of a mouse but with the 'velocity control' of a joystick.The patent notes that, currently, there\u2019s no such thing as a one size fits all controller for games. \u201cWhile one type of input, either a mouse input or a joystick input, may be preferred for one type of a game, it may not be preferred, or even compatible, for another type of a game,\u201d the filing explains.\u201cFor instance, a mouse input (e.g., as might be used with a computer system) provides relative movement to a video game by reporting incremental movement in a particular direction, and is particularly useful for video games requiring absolute accuracy and precise positioning.\u201cOn the other hand, a joystick input (e.g., as might be used with a gaming system) provides a video game with absolute offset from center information, and is useful for video games requiring \u2018velocity control,\u2019 for example where the more offset from center the joystick there is, the faster a cursor or camera in a video game will move in that direction,\u201d the filing continues.Sitting comfortably?(Image credit: Secretlab)Best chair for gaming: the top gaming chairs around\nBest PC controller: sit back, relax, and get your game onThe solution, apparently, \u201c is a game controller that employs a dedicated input, which is capable of the absolute accuracy of a mouse input or trackball input, but is also capable of measuring how far off center the input is (e.g., how far off center it has moved), and can also return to center when released, as is present in a joystick input.\u201dThe result is a single controller that does it all. \u201cThe introduced game controller integrates a touch sensing trackball to enjoy the benefits of both the mouse type input and joystick type input, in a single dedicated input, providing a user freedom to play any type of game without worrying about the compatibility of their game controllers,\u201d the patent claims.Further details of the filing include a processor located within the housing and configured to generate a simulated joystick input and a conductive core to enable the capacitive touch interface. Of course, the annals of gaming history are littered with earlier attempts at game controller alchemy. And yet here we are in 2021 and that keyboard and mouse combo simply refuses to disappear.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It\u2019s not clear whether the controller is a passing patent whim or a device on its way to retail reality and a PC near you.

I didn't see how it was ever going to be as good as just owning a gaming desktop PC or console. Having pretty poor internet speeds by modern standards; I didn't think it would ever be worth it to me.But what a difference a year makes. Not only has my own opinion completely reversed, but the technology has seen some serious improvements, and even on lower speed networks, it's now possible to play AAA games on a phone or any computer with a connection and have a good time.Right now, there are three major players: Google Stadia, NVIDIA GeForce Now, and Xbox Game Pass. Amazon Luna will likely become part of the conversation pretty soon, but since it's limited access right now (and not being in the U.S. completely excludes me), that will come later.But of these three, which is the best? That's harder to answer. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and which serves best for you will depend on what you're looking for. I've played a lot of games on each in the past couple of months, so I'm going to try and break it down and help you decide which might be for you.Stadia vs GeForce Now vs Xbox Game Pass - Platform availabilitySource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)The good news is that combined, all three of these cloud gaming platforms are available to play on a wide variety of devices. Here's what we're currently looking at when it comes to official support:Google Stadia - Android, iOS, Chrome OS, Windows 10, Mac OS, Chromecast Ultra, LinuxXbox Game Pass - AndroidNVIDIA GeForce Now - Android, iOS, Windows 10, Mac OS, Chrome OS, NVIDIA Shield TVAlready we see one big difference between the three. Xbox Game Pass cloud streaming is lagging behind the others in terms of how you can play. Officially it's only currently supported on Android devices, though sideloading to Android TV and Google TV is possible. In the past, it's been pretty solid to use on a Chromebook. However, the latter of these seems to have died in my experience.NVIDIA and Google have a big advantage already in who can play. Stadia and GeForce Now effectively work everywhere you could want them to. On iOS and Chrome OS, both leverage the web browser's power to deliver games, and it's in the same way we're expecting to see Xbox Game Pass branch out in the future. NVIDIA has desktop apps for PC and Mac, too, with both joining Xbox in having a native Android client.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Additionally, you can also get Stadia and GeForce Now working just fine on Linux thanks to the same browser-based play as on Chrome OS, and the two also have their own ways onto the TV. This is also going to expand later in 2021 as both are going to be pre-loaded on LG TVs. As yet, Microsoft has no official planned support for TV devices when it comes to cloud streaming.Xbox Game Pass - Huge value and innovative touch controlsSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Xbox has one clear strength, and that's bundling cloud streaming into the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. This is quite simply one of the best value packages in gaming. While Xbox console owners get the most from it, access to the Game Pass PC library means you don't have to be an Xbox owner.It's probably not worth signing up just to get access to cloud gaming, and it would be nice to see Microsoft offer a cloud-only subscription in the future, but for now, you simply can't ignore how much you get for a very reasonable monthly fee.The library is also quite big and getting bigger every month. All of Microsoft's first-party console games are going in there, with titles like Gears 5, Halo MCC, and Forza Horizon 4 all playable on smartphones. The best Xbox Game Pass games alone are enough to blow the mind.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)One of the most notable features that sets Game Pass streaming above the others is the innovative touch control system that Xbox is developing for the platform. Instead of a generic on-screen controller, each game gets its own unique layout designed to make playing on a phone or tablet easier and more enjoyable. If you haven't yet tried Minecraft Dungeons touch controls, please do. It's astonishingly good.Stream stability is good even on my less than stellar broadband, though artifacts in the games are fairly common. Minecraft Dungeons often turns into a mess of even more blocks than you already get. The system is very responsive and supports a decent amount of controllers beyond the official Xbox offering.NVIDIA GeForce Now - PC gaming for everyoneSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)GeForce Now's big selling point is that you already own the games you're playing on the service. Whether you have a gaming desktop PC or you're just buying them to play on GeForce Now, the games, unlike on Xbox Game Pass, are yours. And not just from one source, either. Steam and Epic both have a big library of supported games, as does Ubisoft Connect, and GOG is now also starting to be seen with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.For all intents and purposes, GeForce Now gives you a gaming PC on any machine. You have both controller and full keyboard and mouse support on tap. There's no clue that you're not actually playing on your own gaming PC. GeForce Now also has the ability to be played on the TV, with NVIDIA's own Shield set-top box. Alongside Stadia, it will be coming to select LG TVs later in 2021.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Performance is fantastic, even on slower connections. In particular, on Windows 10 and Mac, you have quite a lot of control over quality settings to get the most from your own connection and hardware. The web client doesn't have as many of these features, but you can still either set it to auto or turn it down yourself. Games load quickly, and when you're inside playing, too.Games also look better on the whole on GeForce Now compared to the other two, and as you're running PC versions of these games on a proper, powerful PC in the cloud, you get both ray tracing (where supported) and good frame rate, too. Playing through the Destiny 2 on GeForce Now has been virtually indistinguishable from playing it on my gaming PC.What GeForce Now does is deliver a high-quality PC gaming experience to everyone. You don't need an expensive, ultra-powerful rig or a gaming laptop anymore. All you need is the phone in your pocket or an affordable Windows laptop or Chromebook. That's probably the best thing about it. It's also free to try, but if you're going to use it a lot, you will certainly get the value from the founder's subscription.Google Stadia - Impressive performance and innovative featuresSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Google Stadia has the least gaming pedigree behind it, in that this is Google's first real attempt at being a gaming platform. Stadia follows a more console-like model in so much as you're actually buying games specifically to play on Stadia-supported devices. It does have a subscription, Stadia Pro, but this is more like Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus in that you're getting free games to play so long as you stay subscribed. It isn't required to play on Stadia, though.What is certainly true of Stadia is that it has many good ideas and does a lot right. Whichever platform you choose to play on, the performance is excellent. The backend hardware has an incredible amount of power compared to Xbox Game Pass; thus, you get 4K HDR gaming though supported displays (and fast enough connections) and 60 FPS. Controller or keyboard and mouse are fine, and while Google has its own Stadia controller, you only need this if you're playing on the Chromecast Ultra on a TV. An Xbox, PlayStation, or third-party controller will work just fine.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Stream stability and quality are also excellent on Stadia. When I first tried it almost a year ago, I didn't give it much time because it was janky and clearly struggled on my connection. Now, I can happily play at 1080p for hours on end without so much as a hiccup. Whatever Google did, it worked, and right now, I'm playing more games on Stadia than on console. Loading times are minimal, and whether it's my phone, PC, or Surface Go 2, I can be gaming in seconds. Pro-tip; play in Edge on Windows 10, not Chrome. Thank me later.Stadia also has some exciting features. For one, anybody can stream their gameplay straight to YouTube in high quality with their microphone included with ease. There are also more innovative tools like Stream Connect, which can overlay another person's game on top of yours so you can see their perspective while you play. And the newest is game state sharing, launched with Hitman 3. You can share snippets of your game for other players to jump into and experience first hand.The not so good bitsSource: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)Each platform has a lot of good, but each has its own negatives to consider.Starting with Xbox Game Pass, and the obvious one is performance. It is slow. Because it's currently based on Xbox One S hardware, loading games is slow, loading inside games is slow, frame rates are more likely 30 FPS than anything else, and you're hardly getting 1080p, let alone 4K. Granted, resolution isn't a big issue right now since we're confined to playing on small screens, but the overall performance of Xbox Game Pass streaming is pretty bad compared to the other two. It is due for an upgrade at some point, and that can't come quick enough.The other big downer is one already touched on, and that's platform availability. Microsoft is dragging its feet compared to both Google and NVIDIA, and I fear that it could get left behind without a big push in 2021.What about Google Stadia, then? You can't ignore the size of the library. It's got a lot better in recent times, and there are some big titles in there now with support from the likes of Rockstar and Ubisoft, but compared to any other console or even the other cloud platforms, it's still lacking. Google is talking a big game for 2021 and beyond, but only time will tell.Source: Nick Sutrich / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Nick Sutrich / Windows Central)I'd also like to see a little more attention applied to how games look on Stadia. You only really notice when comparing directly to another platform, but Destiny 2 is the best example. The Stadia version looks flat and muted and a bit dull when comparing it to the same game on either Xbox Game Pass or GeForce Now. This isn't going to be the case for all games, but it's something I feel Google needs to work with its developer partners on.GeForce Now is, in many ways, the strongest of the three. It has the sheer horsepower of NVIDIA's GPUs behind it, it supports ray tracing, has a large and continually growing library, and is available on pretty much everything. But it's not perfect. The biggest downer is the fact that some games on GeForce Now flat out are no bueno for controller play. Disco Elysium and Path of Exile, for example, are straight PC ports and do not support gamepad. That's a bit of a blow for someone playing on a smartphone.GeForce Now is also messier to live with than the other two platforms. I'm not sure it's something NVIDIA can ever do something about on account of how fragmented PC game delivery is, but it's still a mess, and it's worse on phones. Steam works well since you can link your account natively, but Epic and Ubisoft, for example, don't support this, and you have to log in to their respective launchers inside GeForce Now. Often, you can't just hit play and start playing a game like you can on the others.So which is best?Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)Simply put, there is no one best platform right now. There is no single easy recommendation to say, \"go and use this one.\" In fact, the best option right now is to try them all and see which suits you best. Only Xbox Game Pass actually requires payment to try it out, and if you're not already a sub, there's almost always an offer to get the first month for $1.If you're primarily a PC gamer looking for a way to enjoy games you already own on other devices, GeForce Now is a no brainer. Performance is excellent, the library continues to grow, and the experience is essentially identical to playing natively on your gaming rig.Source: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)If you're an Xbox owner, then firstly, you should definitely have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate because the value is immense. And then secondly, assuming you have an Android phone, you need to try game streaming. It's not the best performance you'll see, but the innovative touch controls in games like Minecraft Dungeons make it incredibly accessible to mobile gaming.So what about Stadia then? Well, it is free to use, and since Destiny 2 is one of a couple of free to play games on Stadia, you can try out what's on offer before committing any money. There's also no requirement for a subscription to keep Stadia rolling; you buy games like you would on an Xbox or PlayStation. The Pro subscription is of great value, though, with a pretty massive library of games you can claim. Stadia is the most console-like of the three, and while I'm not sure it's a definite alternative to Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo right now, it could well be very soon.But if you can, try each and see which sits best with you.\n\n\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate\n\n\n $16.99 at Best Buy $19.99 at Amazon $19.99 at Walmart\nIs the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate the best value in all of gaming? It's possible. Ultimate bundles your Xbox Live Gold subscription, an Xbox Game Pass subscription for both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs, and Xbox Cloud Gaming for on-the-go. That means access to hundreds of games, with more, added all the time, for a single monthly subscription cost.\n\n\n  GeForce Now NVIDIA's cloud game streaming service is one of the best available today, delivering lag-free gaming at 1080p/60fps. The fact that you can access NVIDIA's servers for free makes it an easy sell, and the $4.99 plan makes it an immediately enticing option for seasoned gamers.View Deal\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nXbox\nGaming\n\n\nRichard DevineSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor - Tech, ReviewsRichard Devine is a Managing Editor at Windows Central with over a decade of experience.

Here's how they explained it in the press release:\n\nGeForce NOW Thursday is our ongoing commitment to bringing great PC games and service updates to our members each week. It\u2019s taking what we\u2019ve already established and adding emphasis. It also coincides with the launch of our\u00a0GeForce NOW blog, where you, your readers and GeForce NOW members can come back every Thursday to discover what\u2019s new in the cloud, including games, exclusive features, and news.\nSo, why Thursdays?\nSince we launched GeForce NOW nearly a year ago, we found that many of our most played games either launched or released major season updates on Thursdays \u2014 and we aim to support these launches as soon after their release as possible.\u00a0We focus a ton of effort into\u00a0supporting these content releases on Thursday, with updates rolling out to members across all our data centers, in all of our regions.\n\nThis week, GeForce NOW Thursday brings the following additions to NVIDIA's cloud streaming service:\nRelated Story GeForce NOW Adds 6 Games, Including Atomic Heart & Sons of the Forest, Ahead of Planned Xbox/Bethesda Addition\nThe Medium\u00a0(Steam,\u00a0Epic Games Store)\nImmortals Fenyx Rising\u00a0Demo (Ubisoft Connect,\u00a0Epic Games Store)\nBeholder\u00a0(Steam)\nCaves of Qud\u00a0(Steam)\nDyson Sphere Program\u00a0(Steam)\nKathy Rain\u00a0(Steam)\nNeon Abyss\u00a0(Epic Games Store)\nGods Will Fall\u00a0(launching Friday on\u00a0Steam,\u00a0Epic Games Store)\n\nThe Medium also supports RTX and DLSS effects on GeForce NOW, just as it does on PC when using GeForce RTX graphics cards. Keith checked out how the game runs on the GeForce RTX 2060, by the way; you can watch his video analysis here.\nNVIDIA did also say the first GeForce NOW Thursday of the month will generally be a big one in terms of additions to the service and announcements. Next Thursday (February 4th) should be even bigger since NVIDIA will celebrate the first anniversary of GFN.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft to Bring All Its Xbox PC Games to GeForce NOW, Including Activision Blizzard\u2019s If the Deal Passes\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Adds Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak and 10 New Games\n\nUle Lopez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Brings Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 and an Exclusive Reward for Dying Light 2\n\nUle Lopez\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW Celebrates its Third Anniversary with 25 New Games and Rewards\n\nUle Lopez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

(Or follow my questionable advice to sell your GPU and make 2021 the year of DOSBox gaming on integrated graphics. Either one.)\nOn the mobile front the new Geforce RTX 30 Series laptops just dropped via a number of new SKUs from the usual suspects, but there\u2019s this little thing about Max-Q and TDPs this time around. With the RTX 3080 and 3070 GPUs for notebooks there won\u2019t be a Max-Q specification, though 3rd generation Max-Q is part of the deal. Make sense?\n \n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptops page showcases the technologies that make up the latest incarnation of Max-Q, calling it \u201ca system wide approach to deliver high performance in thin and light gaming laptops\u201d. We now have to start thinking about the available performance of a given GPU based on TDP limits, making this feature independent of any specific branding this time (i.e. RTX 2080 Max-Q vs. RTX 2080).\nAs NVIDIA explains:\n\n\u201cEvery aspect of the laptop, chip, software, PCB design, power delivery, and thermals, are optimized for power and performance. Our 3rd gen Max-Q technologies use AI and new system optimizations to make high performance gaming laptops faster and better than ever.\u201d\n\nThe technologies making up this 3rd gen Max-Q are (quoting NVIDIA):\n\n\nDynamic Boost 2.0 \u2013 New AI-powered Dynamic Boost 2.0 automatically delivers the needed power between the GPU, GPU memory, and CPU for a larger performance boost than ever before.\u00a0 The AI networks in Dynamic Boost 2.0 manage power on a per-frame basis, so your laptop is constantly optimizing for maximum performance while you\u2019re gaming and creating\nWhisper Mode 2.0 \u2013 WhisperMode 2.0 delivers a new level of acoustic control for gaming laptops. It\u2019s been reengineered from the ground up and custom built into laptops at a system-level. You pick your desired acoustic level, and WhisperMode 2.0\u2019s\u00a0 AI-powered algorithms manage the CPU, GPU, system temperatures, and fan speeds to deliver great acoustics and the best possible performance\n Resizable BAR \u2013 Resizable BAR is an advanced PCI Express feature that enables the CPU to access the entire GPU frame buffer at once, improving performance in many games\nDLSS \u2013 NVIDIA DLSS delivers a massive performance boost at the same power by using the Tensor Cores to do groundbreaking AI rendering\n\n\n \n\n\nYes, resizable BAR \u2013 everyone\u2019s favorite new/old PCI Express feature \u2013 is available with the new RTX 30 Series notebook GPU platforms\nTechnically-minded people who read websites like this probably won\u2019t have any trouble seeking out TDP info about a GPU, provided that all vendors follow NVIDIA\u2019s recommendation \u2013 \u201cwe strongly encourage OEMs to list clocks and other technologies a laptop supports\u201d (via Tom\u2019s Hardware). But even with technical disclosures about a given model\u2019s specs this 30 Series launch has the potential to create confusion for average consumes, as there will be multiple performance levels available with the same product name.\nFor a look at what to expect from these RTX 30 Series notebook GPUs, check out Notebookcheck\u2019s RTX 3070/3080 performance testing. They also offer this handy chart to help understand the differences between the notebook and desktop versions of each GPU:\n \n\n\nTable via Notebookcheck\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVideo News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousPNY\u2019s Powerless Petite Port Provider, A Dock Without A Power Brick \n\nNextGo With Your Gut, Alexa\u2019s Hunches \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nSebastian Peak\nEditor-in-Chief at PC Perspective.

The enhancement aims to help development teams boost AI inferencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough billed as reference architecture, the Vast Data storage system is the same one sold as a standalone product. The new packaging does, however, give Vast Data access to Nvidia resellers and a first-mover position for Nvida's GPU DirectStorage, which is in beta.\nThe Vast Data storage is multi-petabyte storage geared for random access. Universal Storage targets hyperscalers and large enterprises that operate private scale-out clouds. The container-based system packages Vast Data's file servers with its LightSpeed NVMe-enabled commodity flash nodes. The network topology runs the NFS storage protocol on RDMA over Converged Ethernet to parallelize all network cards.\nVast Data serves all data from flash. Low-cost QLC SSDs provide bulk storage. Intel Optane storage class memory cards accelerate data access. Every Vast Data server has access to data in the flash pool.\nThe Vast Data storage controller is a Docker container. File and object protocols are accessed as microservices. The vendor claims its architecture ensures high availability with fast storage.\nRegarding performance, Vast Data rates its system to feed AI workloads with up to 140 Gb/s and more than 1.5 million IOPS. The inclusion of Nvidia's DGX-based compute will push those performance numbers higher, said Jeff Denworth, Vast Data's vice president of products.\n\n\n\nVast Data Universal Storage is all-flash for AI.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAI storage: the next growth sector\nIT research firm IDC estimates unstructured data will fuel demand for AI-enabled storage technologies. IDC said files and objects will generate most new data by 2024.\n\"The fact that data must be handled in real time is driving significant changes in the underlying storage infrastructure requirements,\" Eric Burgener, an IDC research vice president for storage, said during a Vast Data-Nvidia webinar last week.\nBurgener said about 70% of organizations plan to upgrade server, storage or data protection infrastructure in the next two years to support digital transformation efforts.\nA few years ago, a product designed around QLC as the bulk tier would have been deemed too costly compared to using hard disk drives. However, improved endurance and lower NAND pricing gives Vast Data and other vendors a chance to innovate storage and networking topologies. Investors have injected $180 million in Vast Data since 2016, including a $100 million funding round last summer.\nMost major storage vendors offer versions of their arrays that include Nvidia GPUs. Dell EMC added an all-flash model to its Isilon scale-out NAS lineup, while flash specialist Pure Storage partnered earlier with Nvidia on Pure AIRI, which injects DGX compute in Pure's NVMe-based FlashBlade NAS.\nNvidia DGX is part of a reference architecture put together by NetApp and Lenovo. That product incorporates NetApp's OnTap storage operating system and Lenovo ThinkSystem servers.\nVast Data said its LightSpeed enclosure will support Nvidia GDS. Nvidia has yet to specify a date for general availability. Five mutual resellers will set pricing for the Vast Data-Nvidia reference design: Cambridge Computer, Mark III Systems, Trace3, Uclick and Xenon.\nIn addition to storage partnerships, Nvidia made other storage-related moves last year, acquiring object storage startup SwiftStack and storage networking company Mellanox Technologies.\n\n\nNext Steps\nNvidia releases new AI software, hardware\nVast Data uses DPUs to simplify, secure AI clouds\nVast unveils InsightEngine, a move to support enterprise AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on Flash memory and storage\n\n\n\nAI-focused storage choices, features and considerations\n\nBy: TechTarget Storage Editorial\u00a0Staff\n\n\n\n\nStorage technology explained: AI and data storage\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antony\u00a0Adshead\n\n\n\n\nStorage vendors work with Nvidia to broaden AI portfolio\n\n\n\n\nBy: Adam\u00a0Armstrong\n\n\n\n\nGTC 2024: Storage suppliers queue up to ride the Nvidia AI wave\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antony\u00a0Adshead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nThe Future of Private AI: How Industries Take Advantage of AI\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\nPrivate AI Demystified\n\u2013Equinix\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nLeading storage for AI tools address workload ...\n\u2013 Search Storage\n\n\nNvidia finalizes GPUDirect Storage 1.0 to accelerate ...\n\u2013 Search Storage\n\n\nStorage technology explained: AI and data storage\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisaster Recovery\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Backup\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSustainability and ESG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Disaster Recovery\n\n\n\n\nHow to assess pandemic risk in 2025\nBusinesses learned a lot about disaster recovery and risk from COVID-19.

Performance always hinges upon having the latest platform hardware, so perhaps it's no surprise that the laptop we're looking at today has one of NVIDIA's latest mobile\u00a0Ampere GPUs on board from its new GeForce RTX 30 family. When NVIDIA pulled the lid off mobile Ampere, it made some pretty big promises. Performance across the Ampere lineup that spans from RTX 3060 to 3080 should be faster than NVIDIA's previous mobile powerhouse, the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER. That bodes well for the middle child in NVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 30 Mobile lineup, the RTX 3070, which finds itself on board the Alienware m15 R4 we have in for review today.\n\r\nThat's not to say that this latest gaming laptop from Alienware is a one-trick pony. In fact, the newest m15 packs more tricks on board than perhaps Houdini himself. Yes, it starts with the notebook version of NVIDIA's powerful\u00a0GeForce RTX 3070, but there's a gorgeous OLED display, Tobii eye tracking, Intel's current top-end 10th gen CPU, and other top-end tech under the hood. All that gaming goodness is packed inside a relatively portable notebook with plenty of customizable RGB LED-infused eye candy, and an intricate ventilation system to whisk hot air away from the components that generate it. But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, here's a quick look at the spec rundown of the 4th coming of Alienware's m15 gaming laptop...\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlienware m15 R4\n\n\n\nSpecifications & Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nProcessor\nIntel 10th Generaiton Core i7-10870H (8 cores/16 threads, 2.2GHz to 5GHz, 16MB L3 cache)\n\n\nDisplay\n15.6-inch 4K (3840x2160) OLED display (60Hz, 1ms, 400 nits, Tobii Eyetracking)\n\n\nGraphics\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8GB GDDR6\n\n\nStorage\n1TB (2x512GB) PCIe M.2 SSD RAID 0\n\n\nMemory\n16GB DDR4-2933\n\n\nAudio\nStereo speakers\n\n\nCamera\n1080p FHD webcam\n\n\nNetworking\nKiller Ethernet E3100X 2.5Gbps NIC, Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650i, Bluetooth 5.1\n\n\nPorts: Left\n1x LAN (Killer E3100X 2.5Gbps)\r\n            1x USB 3.2 Gen 1\r\n            1x 3.5mm headset jack\u00a0\n\n\nPorts: Right\n2x USB 3.2 Gen 1\r\n            1x microSD card reader\n\n\nPorts: Rear\n1x HDMI 2.1\r\n            1x mini DisplayPort 1.4\r\n            1x Thunderbolt 3.0 Type-C\r\n            1x Alienware Graphics Amplifier port\r\n            DC-In power\n\n\nKeyboard\nAlienware mSeries four-zone AlienFX RGB\n\n\nTouchpad\nMulti-touch gesture premium precision-point glass with integrated scrolling\n\n\nBattery\n6-cell, 86WHr\n\n\nWeight\nStarting at 4.65 pounds (2.11 kilograms)\n\n\nDimensions\n14.19 x 10.87 x 0.72-0.807 inches (360.3 x 276.2 x 18.3-20.5 millimeters)\n\n\nWarranty\n1 year\n\n\nOperating System\nWindows 10 Home 64-bit\n\n\nPrice\n$2,499 As Tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's Powering The New Dell Alienware m15 R4\r\nNormally we'd begin by considering about the CPU, storage and memory subsystem at the core of many notebooks, but let's be honest. We want to know all we can find out about this mobile GeForce RTX 3070 GPU first. NVIDIA's own control panel tells us about as much as we can learn with publicly-available tools. In this case, the GeForce RTX 3070 has 5,120 CUDA cores and a graphics boost clock of 1,620MHz. There's also 8 GB of 14 GT/s GDDR6 VRAM on a 256-bit memory bus, which is good for 448 GB per second of bandwidth.\n\r\nIt's not surprising to learn that some of these specs are toned down a bit from the desktop version of the GeForce RTX 3070, which has 15% more CUDA cores. The mobile variant's top boost speed is only down 105 MHz from the 1,725 MHz boost clock of the desktop card. All told that's an 18% dip in maximum performance from 20.3 shading TFLOPS for the GeForce RTX 3070 Founder's Edition, to 16.65 TFLOPS for this mobile version. Regardless, there are still a pretty nice GPU specs to squeeze into a laptop platform, where power consumption will almost assuredly have to be less than the maximum 220 W of the desktop version. Those who need a bit more horsepower still have the GeForce RTX 3080 as well, at the top end of NVIDIA's mobile lineup.\u00a0\n\r\nThe rest of the hardware in the m15 R4 isn't all that different from the previous iteration m15 R3 which we reviewed back in October. Intel's 10th generation CPUs are still the order of the day, though our review sample this time out has an eight-core, 16-thread Core i7-10870H with a 2.2 GHz base speed and a maximum single-core boost of 5 GHz. There's also the Core i9-10980HK available as an upgrade. We don't expect that our CPU will spend very much time at its base clock rate, and so this notebook should have plenty of gaming performance under the hood. Much like the m15 R3 before it, the R4 has Alienware's 6-phase CPU voltage regulation circuitry and a 12-stage regulator for the GPU.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\r\nAlienware gave the CPU 16 GB of DDR4-2933 memory to work with. Additional configurations offer between 8 and 32 GB of RAM. That RAM is soldered, however, so buyers should be sure to order all they think they'll need now and down the road. For primary storage, a pair of 512 GB M.2 NVMe solid state drives in a RAID 0 configuration come along for the ride, as well. The m15 comes in configurations with up to three SSDs. Single-drive models top out at 2 TB of onboard storage, where the dual-drive systems can double that to 4 TB with striping for the best performance. Lastly, RAID 0 Plus configurations can optionally add a 512 GB SSD on top of the other two, maxing out at 4.5 TB combined.\u00a0\n\r\nNetworking did get a refresh this time around. Now the 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet controller is a Killer E3100X. Wi-Fi is provided by a Killer AX1650i, which has a 2x2 MIMO antenna configuration and Bluetooth 5.1. We're also weirdly excited about the 1080p full-HD webcam, as it feels like laptops have been stuck with subpar 720p cameras for far too long.\u00a0\nAlienware m15 R4 Design, Display And Features\r\nOn the outside, not a whole lot has changed about the m15 since the last version. Alienware still offers the Dark Side of the Moon and Lunar Light finishes, which are polycarbonate bodies with Alienware's trademark mysterious alien-style design with lots of hexagons and lighting. The rear vents have RGB lights that outline them like twin exhaust pipes on a tricked-out car, and the keyboard has per-zone RGB lighting. Lastly, the Alienware logo-style badge on the lid and power button both have RGB bling.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\r\nOnce you open the m15 R4 the fast hardware under the hood is even more accentuated, at least on our review model, by a gorgeous 15.6-inch 3,840x2,160 OLED display panel. The panel's brightness maxes out at 500 nits, which is plenty bright for indoor or outdoor use, in most cases. Nobody's going to burn their retinas on HDR content like a 1,000-nit display would, but this panel's contrast ratio is striking, thanks to its inky OLED saturation and pop. Speaking of which, the OLED panel's deep contrast ratio also meets the HDR500 specifications, so high dynamic range content will be rendered with accuracy and vibrance.\n\r\nRight below the display sits the Alienware m15's Tobii eye tracker. The red lights you see in the photo above are just proof that the infrared lights are present to detect faces, even in the dark. To the naked eye they're totally invisible, but the camera sees all. As we've seen in previous reviews, Alienware put these facial tracking features to good use. Whenever we move our head to look away from the display, the panel would dim to save power after a couple of seconds. However, once we reverted our attention to the display, it would automatically brighten back up to where we had it. This had to be disabled for battery tests and photography, however.\u00a0\n\r\nAbove the display rests the 1080p HD webcam and noise-canceling microphone array. These worked great for Skype calls, as we could be seen and heard well. This system also has some powerful speakers for a notebook, and had no problem filling the room with sound. Alienware says the m15 R4 has discrete woofers and tweeters for its stereo audio output, and it makes a big difference. Nobody will mistake the internal speakers for a pair of externals bookshelf boxes, but there's definitely more oomph to these speakers than smaller, less endowed laptops can muster.\u00a0\n\n\n\r\nBelow the display sits Alienware's big, m Series keyboard with four RGB lighting zones. This feels like basically the same keyboard that was on the previous model. We had no problem typing on this machine, and produced this entire review using it. There's ample key travel (1.7 mm according to Alienware's specifications) which felt great as we typed. It also worked well for gaming, as the keys are approximately the same size as most full-sized keyboards on which we've typed. Many 15\" notebooks try to squeeze in room for a numpad to the right of the traditional QWERTY keyboard but that's not the case here, and we think the system is better for it. When a number pad is present, it shifts the user to the left but few (if any?) laptops don't shift the display alongside it.\u00a0\n\r\nThe smallish but totally usable trackpad doesn't seem updated this time around, either. It's responsive to the touch and has left-click and right-click integrated as well. We think that most gamers will opt to use a traditional mouse when gaming, so the size of the trackpad isn't a big deal, and it handles virtually any productivity task with ease and Windows 10 multi-gesture support.\n\nAlienware m15 R4 IO Expansion Ports And Software\n\n\n\r\nAlienware was generous with the port selection array on this gaming laptop. On the left, we find a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port, a single USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) Type-A port and a headphone jack. On the right we find two more 5 Gbps USB ports and a micro SD card reader. Both sides are also outfitted with additional vents, so along with the big vents on the rear, warm air can escape the system in a multitude of ways. Speaking of the rear of the m15 R4, Alienware included one HDMI 2.1 port, one Mini DisplayPort 1.4, and one Thunderbolt 3 Type-C connector. We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the expansion slot for Alienware's Graphics Amplifier next to the barrel power jack. The power adapter can provide up to 240 W of power to simultaneously charge the battery while gaming.\u00a0\n\n\r\nFor software, Alienware includes its Command Center utility, which allows firing up one of the included overclocking profiles. They take effect after a reboot, and we had no problem using the more aggressive of the two for playing games. We've included results for our gaming benchmarks in our testing. Disconnecting the m15 R4 from power will revert to the default power state, so there's no overclocking while using the battery.\n\n\n\n\r\nAlienware Command Center can also control the multiple lighting zones. The rear, lid logo, and keyboard can all be controlled independently. They keyboard has four zones organized left to right, so they can have a rotating color wave in addition to any single solid color. Finally, the power button can be colored, but seems to always light up amber in color when the power adapter is disconnected and the system is running on battery reserves. Lastly, Command Center can also act as a game library manager, similar to the way GeForce Experience does, by detecting games it knows to look for and displaying them on a single menu. You can then customize power and fan profiles, and even lighting, to kick into gear when a specific game from your library is launched.\u00a0\n\r\nFinally, Alienware was very good about not loading the system down with additional bloat, so there's really not much else to cover here. Just the way we like it. Now that we've gotten a tour of the system, it's time to see how this GeForce RTX 30-series equipped beastie performs...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Dell, laptop, Alienware, alienware m15, geforce-rtx-3070-mobile\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXiaomi Mi 11 Review: A Loaded, Value-Priced Android Flagship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S21 5G Review: Packed With Features And Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative SBS E2900 2.1 Speakers Review: Big Sound, Small Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlienware m15 R4 Review: A GeForce RTX 30 Series Invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop Performance: What To Expect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN MOBILE\n\nHow To Optimize Your Retro Gaming...\nOnePlus Watch Review: A Great First...\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano Review: A Petite...\nHP Spectre X360 13 (2021) Review:...\nOnePlus 9 and 9 Pro Review: Great 5G...\nXiaomi Mi 11 Review: A Loaded,...\nSamsung Galaxy S21 5G Review: Packed...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

One of the biggest themes of SIGGRAPH this year is ray tracing, with many new RTX accelerated applications, and 10 new RTX Studio laptops to power them, being announced and shown.\nAnd with SIGGRAPH, comes updates for many of the industry\u2019s top creative applications. To support these latest updates, NVIDIA is releasing our latest Studio Driver, which delivers the best performance and reliability for creative applications via extensive testing of creator workflows.\n   \nAvailable today, the latest NVIDIA Studio Driver provides optimal support for the latest releases of top creative applications including Magix VEGAS Pro v17, Autodesk Arnold, Allegorithmic Substance Painter 2019.2, Blender 2.80, Cinema 4D R21, and Otoy Octane Render 2019.2.\n30-bit color support \nIn addition, this new NVIDIA Studio Driver introduces support for 30-bit color across all product lines, including GeForce and TITAN, for the first time, allowing for seamless color transitions without banding. With 24-bit color, a pixel can be built from 16.7 million shades of color. By increasing to 30-bit color, a pixel can now be built from over 1 billion shades of color, which eliminates the abrupt changes in shades of the same color. \n   \nImage courtesy of Farhan Perdana (24-bit and 30-bit differences simulated for demonstration on non-30-bit capable displays. 30-bit color requires supported display, software, and content)\nMultiple creative applications currently take advantage of 30-bit color including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Autodesk RV, Colorfront Transkoder, Assimilate Scratch, and Foundry Nuke.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA GPUs accelerate content creation and our new RTX Studio laptops, then download the latest Studio Driver and provide us your feedback on the NVIDIA forums.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We have obtained the first pictures of a custom GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card which is designed by ASUS and to our surprise, the 12 GB models will be regarded as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra.\nNVIDIA Readies GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra 12 GB GDDR6 Graphics Card, First Custom Model From ASUS Pictured, Pricing Starts at $449 US\nAs per our sources, NVIDIA is rebranding the GeForce RTX 3060 as the GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra. It is stated that the Ultra tier is spec'd above the Ti and SUPER variants and as such, this card features a beefier memory interface and top of the line cooling solutions even though the GPU it is based on is a mainstream design.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostComing to the specifications, well the GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra will feature 12 GB of GDDR6 memory which is more than the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, GeForce RTX 3070, and GeForce RTX 3080 cards. ASUS will be offering the GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra in several custom flavors including its ROG STRIX design but we have the\u00a0 TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra (ASUS TUF-RTX3060U-O12G-Gaming) for your eyes to feast upon.\n\nThe card itself features a 2.7 slot design and a large aluminum shroud with three massive fans that come with 0dB technology. The heatsink underneath the card is a massive aluminum fin array with several copper heat pipes running through it. The card makes use of a custom PCB design but the cooler and the backplate extend beyond it. Based on previous implementations, ASUS might go for either a single 8-pin or a dual 8-pin connector configuration for this graphics card. Display outputs include a single HDMI and 3 DisplayPort outputs.\nOnce again, it is interesting to see NVIDIA changing the branding behind the scenes. The GeForce RTX 30 Ultra series branding confirms one thing that we are bound to get more variants with this specific naming convention. It is also likely that the higher memory variants or the SUPER variants that were recently reported will also be using the Ultra branding which sounds cooler than the SUPER branding. There's also a chance that NVIDIA could feature three graphics cards within its GeForce RTX 3060 lineup, the Ti, the Ultra, and the standard variant. The Ultra variant is said to feature a pricing of $449 US and is expected to be announced on the 12th of January at NVIDIA's CES 2021 keynote.\nWe will keep you posted once we get more details on the GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra and the rest of the Ultra series graphics cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n110\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nA Mac Studio Cluster Of Four Units, All Featuring Apple\u2019s Latest M3 Ultra, Consume Less Than Half The Power Of A Network Switch When Running At Idle\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims;

You should now be able to use either to play GeForce or other games on the device.

Please enable Javascript in order to access all the functionality of this web site. Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new GeForce Game Ready WHQL drivers are optimized for the upcoming release of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, Civilization VI, Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope, and Ubisoft's Eagle Flight. To download and install, simply click on the \"Drivers\" tab.\n\nGame Ready For Battlefield 1\nEarlier in the year 13.2 million gamers blew each other to smithereens in the Battlefield 1 Open Beta. Now, the finished version of the game is about to launch, first to Early Enlister Deluxe Edition buyers on the 18th, and then to everyone else on the 21st.\nIf you're one of the many who intend to play the full release, EA's Battlefield 1 system requirements recommend NVIDIA gamers gear up with a GeForce GTX 1060 for 60 FPS action at 1920x1080, with High graphical details. \u00a0 \n \nOS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later\nCPU: AMD FX 8350 Wraith, or Intel i7 4790 or equivalent\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB\nRAM: 16GB RAM\nDirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent\nOnline Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection\nAvailable Disk Space: 50GB\n\n\nFor higher resolutions, detail levels, and framerates, look to other 10-Series GeForce GTX graphics cards. And to ensure you get the smoothest, fastest SLI-enabled experience on any GPU, system or laptop, be sure to snag our new Game Ready driver through GeForce Experience, an indispensable application for GeForce GTX gamers, enabling instant, easy driver updates, plus game setting optimization, gameplay recording and streaming, giveaways, and much more.\n\nGame Ready For Titanfall 2\nOn October 28th, Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall 2 comes out swinging, delivering a story-driven single-player campaign, grappling hook-enhanced multiplayer modes, and fast-paced Sci-Fi action that builds upon the first game's excellent gameplay. Last month, we unveiled the world's first look at Titanfall 2 running on PC at 4K, at 60 FPS, with every game setting maxed out:\n\n\nAnd recently we spoke with Titanfall 2 producer Drew McCoy to learn more about the single-player campaign, new Titans, new Pilot abilities, and much more:\n\nTo experience Titanfall 2 at 4K at 60 FPS, with every setting maxed out, Respawn Entertainment is recommending gamers equip their systems with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080, the only consumer graphics card capable of playing Titanfall 2 at that level of detail at the time of writing.\nIf you lack a GeForce GTX 1080 and a 4K monitor don't fret, you can still have a fantastic Titanfall 2 experience with other GPUs. For instance, the GeForce GTX 1060, which starts at $249, can play Titanfall 2 with nearly every setting maxed at 60 FPS at 1920x1080, or with a lower framerate a 2560x1440.\nWith settings virtually on max you'll see Insane-quality textures, NVIDIA HBAO+ Ambient Occlusion effects, and higher-quality anti-aliasing, effects and shadows. And with a high level of performance you'll have smooth, stutter-free gameplay even during the most explosive moments in Titanfall 2's fast-paced multiplayer matches.\n\nTitanfall 2 also supports several NVIDIA game and experience-enhancing technologies, and is overflowing with graphics settings, configuration options, and everything else you'd expect out of a good PC game. Learn more here.\n\n\nGame Ready For Sid Meier's Civilization VI\nOn October 20th take one last look at your loved ones and set up an automatic feeder for your pets, because October 21st sees the release of Sid Meier's Civilization VI, the latest release in the addictive franchise that consumes every waking hour of your life.\n\nDownload our new Game Ready driver for the smoothest strategy experience.\n\nGame Ready For Ubisoft's Eagle Flight\nSoar into the sky as an eagle, and then peck or claw your enemies to death in Ubisoft's Eagle Flight, a Virtual Reality multiplayer game set in a world where humanity has vanished.\n\nFor the smoothest and fastest Eagle Flight experience, free of stuttering and other issues, swoop down and grab our new Game Ready driver.\n\nGame Ready For Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope Early Access\nSerious Sam, the less-than-serious action hero of several first-person shooters, returns in Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope, a new Virtual Reality shooter that's now in Early Access on Steam.\n\nSave the galaxy by slaughtering Mental's ever-advancing hordes, but make sure you do it with the highest possible framerates, and lowest frametimes, by downloading our new Game Ready driver.\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nYou can download the new GeForce Game Ready drivers through GeForce Experience, our free, essential, game and system-enhancing application, which also records and streams gameplay, and grants you access to giveaways.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can better assist you. \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In fact, you know that fancy Virtual Cockpit by Audi? It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most popular digital gauge clusters and it\u2019s powered by Nvidia.\nRecently, Huang spoke to Autonews Europe and touched on many topics, including autonomous technology, challenges faced by car companies and software in general.\nRelated: NIO Partners With Nvidia To Develop Autonomous Tech For Its EVs\n\n\nWhen asked directly how many fully autonomous cars we can expect to see on the road by 2030, the Nvidia boss gave an estimate of 20% percent \u2013 featuring a high level of automation, with most of those having Nvidia tech inside.\n\u201cThe vehicles making up the 20 percent will account for 50 percent of the miles driven in the locations where they are available,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is because autonomous vehicles will come in many forms \u2013 passenger vehicles, trucks, taxis, shuttles, robot delivery \u2013 and all of them will be able to work around the clock.\u201d\nRegarding the level of automation, he said that we will only see Level 4 for \u201cthe delivery of goods on campuses, at compounds or other areas that can be closed off. It is the most cost effective and safest option because, unlike humans, robots don\u2019t mind going slow. Robots have plenty of time. They don\u2019t get impatient. Therefore those area should be completely Level 5.\u201d\nWith passenger cars, he said that most of them will still be at Level 2 by 2030, yet a very advanced Level 2 compared to what we have today.\n\n \n \n\n\n\u201cIt will almost be like driving with your mind. You think it and the car does it all while keeping you out of harm\u2019s way. By then parking and retrieving your car, highway driving and driving in traffic jams will be completely autonomous. Level 2 alone is going to be a completely transformative driving experience.\u201d\n\u201cAI [artificial intelligence] and robotics are not supposed replace the need for humans. They will enhance our work. They won\u2019t replace driving, but they will enhance driving. And, while I really enjoy driving, I also love using the Autopilot in my Tesla. It is very relaxing.\u201d\nHis take on EVs is also very interesting, as Huang feels that fully electric cars as a consumer product are much more about luxury now than protecting the environment, even though the latter remains an important factor.\nIn his eyes, an EV\u2019s ride is \u201csilky smooth, it\u2019s quiet, it doesn\u2019t make any bad smells, and its full every morning because you can charge at home. I haven\u2019t been to a gas station in years. That\u2019s a luxury. The industry initially missed this very important point, which is that this new functionality creates joy and delight through its convenience. The whole auto industry now understands that the EV is about luxury more so than energy savings.\u201d\n\n \n \n\n\nWhen asked about the VW Group and how it has struggled to develop its own proprietary software, Huang was adamant that large car companies will absolutely have to own their own software.\n\u201cThe reason is that they are no longer building cars, they are operating fleets. Car companies will be like media companies because they will have systems on the road and they need to provide services to those systems. I have every confidence that transition will be made. However, not every company will make the transition in equal time and with equal skill. Therefore, the positions of car companies will change a little bit. However, there is no question in my mind that the companies that make that transition will be richly rewarded.\u201d\nRegarding software, he feels as though most carmakers will have to make a major transition within the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTAGS\nAutonomous Electric Vehicles Tech \n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSN Start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\nCare For A NASCAR Chevrolet Monte Carlo Once Raced By Jeff Gordon?All-New Lotus Sports Car To Be Unveiled This Summer With Production Set For 2022\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                        Sergiu Tudose                                    \n\nAuthor\n\n\n                                        ...                                         \nRead full bio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad more comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nAbout Us\nPolicy\nAdvertising Inquiries\n\n\n\nPowered by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"

However, until stock becomes readily available again, scalpers are currently experiencing a boon in profit to the tune of millions. \nA recent report indicates that even when Nvidia is able to meet the high demand of the new RTX cards, it needs to be cautious of scalper bots. These bots have been poised and ready to buy them out, having already made a profit of around $15.2 million US so far, with the 3080 alone bringing in around $6.3 million of that total. Purchasing a slew of hardware in quick succession means they can resell the cards on sites such as eBay for inflated prices in the hope that desperate people will pay the much higher prices once businesses run out. It isn't just the scalpers who are profiting either, as sites such as eBay, Paypal, and StockX have made a combined total of around $6.8 million US in seller fees.\nRELATED: Gamer's Mom Creates RTX 3080 Cake\nThe RTX 30 series cards are not the only ones being scalped, either. According to the report, previous generations of Nvidia cards - going as far back as the 900 series from 2014 - have been selling for at least 33% of the retail price, with some going for 100% of the original. This isn't the first time graphics card companies have been dealt a severe blow. Early last December, around $300,000 US worth of RTX 3090 cards were stolen from a factory in China. It seems PC gamers cannot catch a break at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation seems dire enough that stockists have even started to reintroduce older generation Nvidia cards, such as the RTX 260 and RTX 2060, back into the market while everyone waits for the 30 series to come back into stock. However, these aren't being introduced at lower prices, but they will hopefully fill a hole that RTX 30 cards are struggling to maintain at the moment.\nBoth Nvidia and AMD are having a tough time of it at the moment, as even AMD's latest RX 6000 series, which was launched in December 2020, is struggling to keep up with demand. Overall, it seems that gamers looking to upgrade their systems to GDDR6 GPU hardware in 2021 are left to twiddle their thumbs until supplies start pouring in again, and all while scalper bots rake in the profits. Hopefully, things will be back to normal soon.\nMORE: Game Rant's Favorite Graphic Cards of 2020\nSource: PC GamesN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWin a PlayStation 5 Pro With Game Rant\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nBy participating in Game Rant's Threads, you can be in the draw to win a PS5 Pro.

Apparently, it will be a 2.7-slot card using a triple-fan cooling solution, as pictured.(Image credit: Wccftech)Nvidia RTX 3070 is one of the best graphics cards of all timeCheck out all the\u00a0best PC gamesWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCWhile this is the TUF model, Wccftech asserts that Asus will make others including a more powerful ROG Strix version. The site says its sources believe that the \u2018Ultra\u2019 GPU will be above the Ti and Super models (or presumably could even replace the Super versions we saw with Turing GPUs).If true, that\u2019ll mean we will have an RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 Ultra, with possibly a vanilla RTX 3060 eventually nestling beneath those two cards.We\u2019ve recently been hearing a fair bit of chatter on the GPU grapevine regarding a 12GB version of the RTX 3060 \u2013 Lenovo spilled some rumored details in PC spec listings very recently \u2013 so the theory is that this could be it.Nvidia has a GeForce Special Broadcast event scheduled for CES 2021, on January 12, and this is where the RTX 3060 Ultra will purportedly be revealed with a claimed price tag of $449.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.However, despite the weight of rumors around all this, we should still be very careful about drawing any firm conclusions here \u2013 there are some major caveats to be aware of.Odd move?For starters, other sources, such as Igor\u2019s Lab, have noted that they have been unable to get any indication that this RTX 3060 Ultra version is coming from other graphics card makers \u2013 and that seems a little odd given that the launch is supposedly so very close.Not that we can discount this speculation on that basis, by any means, but just in general terms, pushing out an RTX 3060 Ultra loaded with 12GB of memory seems rather a strange move by Nvidia.Remember, this would mean that there would be an RTX 3060 model out there with more memory than the RTX 3070 \u2013 much more memory, in fact, as the latter only runs with 8GB. And indeed, 12GB is more than the 10GB found on the RTX 3080, even \u2013 so owners of the latter could find their noses put out of joint in some respects (although the 3080 does have faster GDDR6X RAM, rather than GDDR6 in this rumored GPU).Of course, there could be Ultra variants of the RTX 3070 and 3080 in the wings, too, as seen in other rumors, such as the existence of an RTX 3080 with 20GB of VRAM (which was rumored to be happening, then not happening, and is supposedly back in the cards, so to speak).And some folks are theorizing that perhaps Nvidia needs a fresh and pepped up take on the RTX 3060 to head off AMD\u2019s incoming\u00a0Radeon RX 6700\u00a0offerings, which could arrive in January \u2013 potentially with 12GB of VRAM on-board.It\u2019s a rather confusing picture of arguments and possibilities, then, but if this new RTX 3060 Ultra rumor is true \u2013 and these Asus images are genuine \u2013 we\u2019ll find out soon enough (in a week\u2019s time, in fact).

It comes with 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit memory interface and Nvidia has to its AIC partners to come up with their own custom designs from day one.\nSingle cards in both Dual and StormX series\nAs a part of the mid-range offering, the RTX 3060 will get a lot less attention than some other graphics cards in the RTX 30 series lineup, and Palit is keeping it simple, with just single cards in both the Dual and the StormX series, at least for now. Of course, it is possible that we might see the GamingPro or other factory-overclocked cards in the future.\nThe Palit RTX 3060 Dual series will use two 90mm fans on a dual-slot solution with a big cut-through piece that should provide much more airflow. It uses Palit's 0-dB tech, which means that fans won't spin up in idle, and has subtle RGB lighting.\nIt sticks to standard Nvidia specifications with 1320MHz base and 1777MHz GPU Boost clocks and 12GB of 15Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit memory interface. As expected it needs a single 8-pin PCIe power connector due to its 170W TDP.\n\n\n\nThe Palit RTX 3060 StormX on the other hand, features a more compact design with a single fan at the center of the PCB. The card is 17cm long, but still a dual-slot design. It also sticks to the same clocks as the standard RTX 3060, with 1320MHz base and 1777MHz GPU Boost clocks, as well as the same 12GB of 15Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit memory interface.\nThe cooler also has a copper base and 0-dB tech, as well as RGB lighting, but this time around, it should fit mini-ITX designs, thanks to its 170x125x39mm size.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Palit did not reveal any details on the actual price or the availability date but we suspect it should not be much higher than Nvidia's $329 MSRP, or that we should wait for it that long.\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\nLast modified on 13 January 2021\t\t\t\n\n\nRate this item\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n(1 Vote)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nPalit\nGeforce\nNvidia\nrtx 3060\nstormx\ndual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this category:\n\n\t\t\t\u00ab Powercolor teases upcoming RX 6900XT/6800XT Liquid Devil cards\t\t\n\n\t\t\tFirst Intel Iris Xe DG1 for desktop is an 80 EUs 30W card for OEMs \u00bb\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about:\nIntel releases XeSS 2 SDK \nMSI snubs AMD\u2019s RDNA 4 lineup \nBolt Graphics brings RISC-V to the GPU market \n\n\n"

The teaser includes four new announcements that NVIDIA has planned for its CES event that's bend held on the 12th of January at 9 AM (PST).\nNVIDIA Teases Its GeForce RTX 'Game On' Announcements For CES 2021, Event Takes Place on 12th January at 9 AM (PST)\nThe teaser shows at least four announcements that NVIDIA is planning to make during its CES 2021 virtual keynote. They range from new GPU announcements to brand new tech showcased so let us start with the laptop GPUs that are more or less confirmed for the keynote.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/AHn0BWTYBh\n\u2014 NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) January 9, 2021\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPU Announcement\nWe know for a fact that NVIDIA is going to announce its GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPUs at CES 2021. We have already seen the GeForce RTX 3080, GeForce RTX 3070 and the GeForce RTX 3060 appear in several leaks and even listed online in various laptop configurations. To learn more about these leaked GPUs, you can check out this article.\n\nA major thing for NVIDIA GeForce RTX Mobility GPUs this generation would be that they will be featured inside both flagship Intel and AMD notebooks. Almost every previous generation, Intel would get the top-cream of NVIDIA GPUs but that won't be the case anymore. AMD's Ryzen 5000 mobility CPUs based on the Zen 3 architecture will be featured alongside NVIDIA's top RTX cards including the GeForce RTX 3080 mobility. The specifications for the mobility GPUs can be seen in the table below:\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Desktop CPU Announcement?\nNVIDIA may not limit its CES 2021 announcements to just the mobility segment. The company is already preparing a range of new GeForce RTX 30 series desktop graphics cards & it is likely that a few of these cards will be unveiled at CES 2021. The GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB is already making its rounds in several leaks so we might get an official introduction next week.\n\nThere are also chances that NVIDIA could announce faster GeForce RTX 3070 & GeForce RTX 3080 variants with higher VRAM or the highly anticipated GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card during the event but that remains to be seen.\nNew Game Technologies Included Resizable-Bar Support?\nNVIDIA has also teased what seems to be its own implementation of resizable-BAR and the direct competition to AMD's SAM (Smart Access Memory) technology. A picture showcasing the GeForce GPU communicating with the CPU that is directly accessing its entire VRAM buffer seems to be a hint that NVIDIA is ready to make a public announcement of the feature next week. The solution will work similarly to AMD's SAM and motherboard makers such as MSI have already enabled the resizable-BAR support for NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs on both AMD and Intel platforms.\n\nSince NVIDIA has its GeForce RTX 30 GPUs coming to the mobility segment, they might just be the first to implement on laptops just like AMD was the first to enable this feature on desktops.\nNew RTX / DLSS Titles To Be Present At CES 2021 Too\nFinally, we are bound to get more RTX announcements. Outsiders, a third-person shooter RPG that is being developed by the developer, People Can Fly, the same devs behind Bulletstorm, Gears of War & Fortnite, is showcased so it might implement NVIDIA's DLSS and Ray tracing features.\n\nThis might not be the only game present at the showcase so stay tuned for next week as NVIDIA has a whole load of announcements for the PC Gaming community inbound.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Or if you\u2019d prefer a deep dive on each and every effect and aspect of\u00a0Control, head on over to our\u00a0comprehensive\u00a0Control\u00a0Graphics and Performance Guide.\nThe Setup\nRemedy Entertainment has a long history of crafting narratively led, cinematic action games, starting with their 2001 classic,\u00a0Max Payne. Now, they\u2019ve unleashed\u00a0Control, a third-person supernatural action shooter set in the Federal Bureau of Control.\nOrdinarily, the FBC protect the U.S. populace from things that go bump in the night, while also covering up their existence, but recently the supernatural has invaded the Oldest House, the FBC's paranormal New York headquarters.\n   \nPlayers investigating the commotion at the FBC play as Jesse Faden, who just happens to arrive at the Oldest House when it all goes a bit\u2026 wrong. Explore, fight, and use abilities to give you an edge. And if you\u2019re the type of gamer who loves to explore every nook and cranny, there\u2019s plenty of\u00a0Metroidvania-style secrets to discover and exploit as your arsenal expands.\n   \nFor\u00a0Control, Remedy has rolled out a new iteration of their Northlight Engine, first seen in the transmedia-enhanced\u00a0Quantum Break, which marked a new chapter in Remedy\u2019s search for a filmic, cinematic look. Accordingly,\u00a0Control\u00a0is super-realistic, with soft, yet detailed visuals, that on PC are upgraded with several lifelike ray-traced effects that take graphical fidelity to new heights.\n   \nThese five ray-traced effects enhance shadows, reflections, lighting, and more, and when enabled simultaneously complement and improve one another, enhancing every moment of your time in\u00a0Control.\nDark hallways are illuminated by reflected ray-traced light. Light is colored by objects and diffused naturally. Transparent and opaque surfaces feature realistic real-time reflections. Shadowing is improved, naturally shading occluded areas. And combat appears more dynamic with all ray-traced effects applied to fractured marble, broken wood, and other destructible objects.\n   \nIn general, ray tracing improves image quality immensely when applied selectively, but by employing multiple ray-traced effects simultaneously, nearly everything gains lifelike realism. And when your movements, attacks and actions are constantly affecting the appearance of the world, you feel more connected to the gameplay, as if your actions are having a real impact. That\u2019s why movies ray trace their CG, so it looks and feels real, immersing the viewer in the action.\n  \nHaving seen how it all comes together as a whole, let\u2019s take a quick tour of each individual ray-traced effect.\nRay-Traced Reflections\nMuch of our world is to some degree reflective. Look around you right now - aged hardwood floors reflect light and show coarse object reflections; rough white walls reflect light; and pretty much anything that isn\u2019t matte black to some extent reflects light and/or detail.\nBut because screen space reflection techniques struggle to accurately reflect a lake, let alone a lamp, most games lack reflectivity on both big and small game elements. And without this subtle reflectivity, which we observe every waking minute of every day, immersion and realism is greatly reduced.\nBy employing ray-traced reflections, reflectivity can be applied to all suitable surfaces and objects above, behind and around the camera, creating new, accurate reflections, in addition to improving the quality of existing screen space reflections. And with each adhering to the\u00a0Fresnel Effect\u2019s reflection equations, reflections appear as they would in the real world, maximizing realism and immersion.\n   \nScreen space effects can only account for visible detail, whereas rays can bounce under objects and around the scene, which is why subtle details like the undersides of the desks are seen when ray tracing is enabled\nFurthermore, ray-traced lighting, shadows and effects can be reflected, leading to the creation of accurate shadowing around objects, more realistic lighting on surfaces, and more dynamic combat encounters. And of course, each improvement is rendered and updated in real time, so as the environment changes so do the effects, which prior screen space techniques were unable to realistically achieve.\n   \nBy enabling ray-traced reflections, light accurately bounces from objects onto walls, surfaces and other game elements; improved shadowing and shading is seen; and even the tiny Newton\u2019s Cradle gains accurate real-time reflections\nThese stunning reflections, along with the other effects detailed on this page, are created by firing rays across the scene from the player\u2019s camera, which are traced and combined to form the real-time results seen on-screen. NVIDIA\u2019s Tony Tamasi, Vice President of Technical Marketing, demonstrates and details the process in his latest Tech Explainer:\n  \nRay-Traced Transparent Reflections\nAdding ray-traced reflections to glass is no different than ray tracing a puddle, if the background is opaque. When it\u2019s transparent, with detail visible on the other side, in an office for instance, extra work is required.\nEnter stage left, Ray-Traced Transparent Reflections, which trace rays from transparent surfaces to surrounding detail, enabling realistic mirror-like reflectivity without blocking the visibility of detail beyond the window.\n   \nIn the interactive screenshot comparison above, we see\u00a0Control\u2019s generalized cubemap reflections replaced with real-time transparent reflections capable of showing characters, NPCs and other dynamic game elements moving across the scene. And when we enable\u00a0Control\u2019s other ray-traced effects, we take image quality up another notch.\n   \nThe Federal Bureau of Control is chock-full of offices and windows that make full use of this technology, and once you\u2019ve experienced it, it\u2019s impossible to return to the cubemaps of old.\n   \nRay-Traced Indirect Diffuse Lighting\nControl\u00a0is illuminated with a mixture of lighting techniques, including precomputed global illumination. To add some extra pizzazz to proceedings, players can enable Ray-Traced Indirect Diffuse Lighting, which in simpler terms means that rays are traced, and if a ray strikes a bright light or surface, surrounding game elements will be naturally illuminated.\nIn addition, if the ray\u2019s point of contact happens to be colored, that color will naturally spread to surrounding detail.\nFor an example, check out the interactive comparison below. Without ray tracing, a bright white spotlight simply illuminates green foliage. But with ray tracing, the bright light realistically bounces from the foliage, absorbing its color, naturally bathing the floor, walls, and deeper layers of foliage with green light.\n   \nA secondary benefit of increased lighting precision is that additional, accurate shadows may be rendered, and existing shadows improved, further improving fidelity. For instance, in the comparison below, our heroine gains realistic shadowing around the folds and creases of her jacket, and objects are more accurately shadowed where light is occluded.\u00a0\n   \nRay-Traced Contact Shadows\nControl\u2019s shadows are formed with traditional shadow maps, which serve its angular, functional offices rather well. When it comes to fine detail, however, they struggle \u2013 small and thin geometry is shown at low resolutions or omitted altogether, and objects far from the shadow caster may be barely perceptible.\nIf you\u2019ve played plenty of games, you\u2019ll know these are common issues caused by shadow mapping\u2019s limitations, and the necessity for developers to manually balance visibility and quality of shadows, without tanking performance or using oodles of VRAM.\nBy enabling Ray-Traced Contact Shadows, we can give the shadow maps a helping hand, tracing rays to light sources to create accurate real-time shadows that improve what\u2019s already there, and to render the detail they couldn\u2019t.\n   \nOur comparison above perfectly demonstrates the benefits of ray-traced shadowing: contact hardening shadows with realistic penumbras are cast from each chair; additional shadows are cast around our heroine\u2019s feet, grounding her to the scene; office furniture gains soft shadows; and additional shadows are cast on and around clothes, objects and other game elements.\nThese naturally and effortlessly enhance shadow maps, ensuring each scene\u2019s realism is improved.\nLater, players reach industrial areas deep beneath the shiny, reflective offices. Here, machinery and chain link fences feature shadowing that is entirely absent without ray tracing, further improving fidelity.\n   \nAnd when the rockets start flying, ray-traced contact shadows can be dynamically drawn as the light-emitting missiles pass through the scene, giving you an extra level of visual refinement.\n   \nRay-Traced Debris\nAs you fight your way through the Federal Bureau of Control, it\u2019s scenery and objects will take a beating, temporarily filling the vicinity with debris. Switching on ray tracing enhances each piece, enabling them to cast shadows, to be reflected on surfaces and other objects, and to affect the scene\u2019s lighting.\n   \nThis seemingly minor enhancement quickly becomes a scene stealer once you encounter an otherworldly enemy that destroys everything in its path:\n    \u00a0    \nBy enabling debris to be shadowed and reflected, it gains extra presence within the scene. And by enabling it to affect lighting, image quality is refined once more, taking us a step closer to photorealistic visuals.\nAccelerate Performance With NVIDIA DLSS\nNVIDIA has made great strides in improving the performance of ray tracing, optimizing game engines, game content, and our own drivers. Nevertheless, simultaneously enabling a multitude of complimentary ray-traced effects will be performance-intensive.\nTo ensure you can experience these breathtaking effects at smooth, enjoyable framerates, we\u2019ve added NVIDIA DLSS to\u00a0Control, increasing performance by up to 74% in our testing:\n   \nRTX ON: every ray-tracing effect is fully enabled and utilized in our benchmark\nTo provide extra flexibility,\u00a0Control\u2019s DLSS includes a new option that allows users to select the underlying target render resolution -- effectively a DLSS quality knob. Upon selecting NVIDIA DLSS in the settings menu, users can choose from one of two Render Resolutions. The lower of the two provides the biggest performance boost, while the other, shown in our benchmarks above, emphasizes higher image quality. This flexibility allows gamers to tune to their preferred experience.\nOptimize Your Experience With Our Game Ready Driver\nFor the best\u00a0Control\u00a0experience we recommend updating your system with the new\u00a0Control\u00a0GeForce Game Ready Driver. This includes day-1 optimizations and fixes, and will ensure the best possible experience from the second you start playing.\nTo download, head to the Drivers tab in GeForce Experience, or download manually from our website.\nControl: Available Now\nControl\u00a0raises the bar for realism, immersion, image quality, and graphical fidelity. By marrying lifelike real-time ray-traced effects with cinematic visuals, previously impossible sights are seen for the very first time.\n   \nBefore now, these were simply impossible to render, but with ray tracing, lifelike visuals become a reality.\nTo see them in action for yourself, pick up a copy of\u00a0Control\u00a0with the purchase of a GPU, desktop or laptop participating in our\u00a0current bundle. But before you play, download and install our\u00a0Control\u00a0Game Ready Driver\u00a0for the best possible day-1 performance.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, during CES 2021, Nvidia's senior VP of GeForce, Jeff Fisher, unveiled its new generation of mobile GeForce RTX  processors, bringing the Ampere RTX 3080, 3070, and 3060 GPUs to gaming laptops.The company provided a quick look at three laptops across the RTX range, starting with the Lenovo Legion Slim 7, powered by the new RTX 3060, which clocks in at 1.3x the power of the PS5. At 1080p, the laptop can reportedly achieve an average of 90 FPS on Ultra settings \"across multiple popular graphics-intensive games.\"Nvidia CES 2021 - GeForce 30-Series Laptops4 ImagesThe next step up comes in the form of the ASUS G15, which is equipped with a 1440p panel and RTX 3070 mobile GPU. Nvidia states that its average performance at 1440p is 90 FPS. Finally, Nvidia's high-end example is the Alienware m15, which comes packed with the RTX 3080 mobile GPU and 16GB of GDDR6 memory, and is reportedly capable of delivering over 100 FPS on ultra settings across a range of games.Nvidia notes that this is the company's biggest launch ever; those examples are just three of more than 70 'gaming & studio' laptop models that are in production. The hardware will be available from January 26, with a starting price of $999 for the RTX 3060 models. The Alienware m15 will be priced at $1,999, with an Intel i7 CPU.The laptop range will feature the third generation of MAX-Q technology, including Dynamic Boost 2.0 - an AI that automatically routes power around your system - as well as WhisperMode 2.0 for thermal management and resizable BAR. Naturally, these being RTX-powered machines, DLSS will also be supported for applicable games.The presentation also noted that the devices are the lowest latency esports laptops thanks to Nvidia's Reflex technology. Average latency stats were provided for Overwatch (20ms), Rainbow Six Siege (17ms), Valorant (16ms), and Fortnite (17ms), with all games running at well over 250 FPS on a Razer Blade laptop at 1080p.For more from Nvidia's CES 2021 presentation, check out the announcement of the RTX 3060, which makes ray-tracing PC gaming relatively affordable (if the cards will stay in stock anywhere).IGN LogoReviews\u2022Editor Columns\u2022News\u2022Guides\u2022How to Watch Guides\u2022Elden Ring DLC Interactive Map\u2022GTA 5 Cheats\u2022IGN Store\u2022HowLongToBeat\u2022Deals\u2022Contact Us\u2022IGN YouTube\u2022IGN TikTok\u2022IGN Twitter\u2022Map Genie"

Following in the footsteps of the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090, this is the third of the new Nvidia Ampere architecture GPUs. In terms of performance, price, and features, these new GPUs rank at the top of our GPU benchmarks hierarchy and are some of the best graphics cards right now. Except, they're still almost impossible to find in stock. Will the RTX 3070 suffer the same fate at launch, and how does it stack up against the other current and previous-gen GPUs? That's what we're here to find out.Fundamentally, the GeForce RTX 3070 will be similar in a lot of ways to the RTX 3080 and 3090 \u2026 except, not really, because changes to the core counts, memory capacity, and memory speed can all have a pretty significant impact on performance. Nvidia claimed during the Ampere reveal in September that the RTX 3070 was \"faster than the RTX 2080 Ti,\" which would be an impressive result if it's true. It has more cores and higher TFLOPS ratings, but less memory and bandwidth. Here's the block diagram for GA104 along with the full spec sheet for the Ampere GPUs, along with the RTX 2070 / 2070 Super that the newcomer replaces.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Swipe to scroll horizontallyGPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 3090RTX 3080RTX 3070RTX 2070 SuperRTX 2070ArchitectureGA102GA102GA104TU104TU106Process TechnologySamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)28.328.317.413.610.8Die size (mm^2)628.4628.4392.5545445SMs / CUs8268464036GPU Cores104968704588825602304Tensor Cores328272184320288RT Cores8268464036Base Clock (MHz)13951440150016051410Boost Clock (MHz)16951710172517701710VRAM Speed (Gbps)19.519161414VRAM (GB)2410888VRAM Bus Width384320256256256ROPs11296966464TMUs328272184160144GFLOPS FP32 (Boost)35581297682031490627880TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)142 (285)119 (238)81 (163)7263RT TFLOPS69.558.139.727.323.8Bandwidth (GBps)936760512448448TDP (watts)350320220215185Launch DateSep-20Sep-20Oct-20Jul-19Oct-18Launch Price$1,499 $699 $499 $499 $499-$599The RTX 3070 is both a big step up from the previous-gen cards it replaces, as well as a relatively large step down from the RTX 3080. On paper, it has about 32 percent less compute than the RTX 3080, and 41 percent less bandwidth. For comparison, the 2070 had 25 percent less compute than the 2080 but had the same bandwidth. Compared to the RTX 2070, however, the 3070 should be a significant jump in performance. It has over 150 percent more FP32 compute and 67 percent more RT TFLOPS, though it still only has the same 448 GBps of bandwidth. Going into the review, we were very curious to see how the 3070 would stack up against the previous-gen cards in real-world benchmarks, and Nvidia's claims of beating the RTX 2080 Ti seemed unlikely.It's also interesting to note the massive difference in power requirements compared to the RTX 3080. There's a 100W gap in TDP, and we know from our testing that the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 can use every bit of their power budgets. This is the first Ampere GPU where we have a basically direct TDP comparison point with the previous-gen Turing GPUs. Both the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 have 215W TDPs, so this will finally be Nvidia's chance to prove that, yes, Ampere actually can be significantly more power efficient than Turing.Meet the GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\u00a0Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The design and aesthetics of the GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition are similar in many ways to the RTX 3080 and 3090 Founders Editions \u2014 it's just nowhere near as large. You get the finned radiator look on the main body, with dual fans that include a built-in rim to improve static pressure, all in a dark gray color with silver highlights. There are several noteworthy differences between the 3070 FE and the 3080/3090 FE, however.First, both fans are on the same side of the cooler (the side that normally faces down in a typical ATX case). There's also no 'X' silver cross on the side that faces up. Instead, a large grooved rectangular piece with a cutout at the back of the card allows the air to still flow through the radiator fins. Nvidia talked a lot about redesigning the 3080/3090 to handle the higher TDP. Obviously, the 3070 isn't in the same category of power and heat, and being a smaller card, it perhaps wasn't as beneficial. The card still runs cool and quiet, as we'll see later.The other big change in terms of aesthetics is that there's no lighting at all, RGB or otherwise. The GeForce RTX logo on the top of the card is pretty tame compared to some graphics cards, though for some people, this would be a positive change. There's also only a small RTX 3070 logo on the side of the card, which is a bit weird to me as there's a ton of room for a larger logo. All of Nvidia's previous-gen 20-series Founders Edition models at least had a green GeForce RTX logo on the top edge, and the 3080 and 3090 have RGB logos (though the tool to configure the RGB lighting still hasn't been released). The RTX 3070 eschews all such nonessentials and just provides the basics as far as looks go.Image 1 of 16(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)There's not a lot to say about the rest of the card. It has the same triple DisplayPort 1.4a outputs and a single HDMI 2.1 port and can drive four monitors without trouble. The rest of the IO bracket is for the front fan's exhaust, but the bracket is silver instead of the matte black finish used on the 3080 and 3090 FE cards.The RTX 3070 Founder Edition also uses Nvidia's new 12-pin power connector, but this time, instead of a y-combiner that takes dual 8-pin PEG connectors, it's just a single 8-pin port that's converted to a 12-pin port. Was this really necessary? I mean, I sort of like the extension cable because it's far easier to leave it connected and just detach the 8-pin connector. But then again, I swap GPUs pretty much daily, so my usage is not at all like a typical user. Also, the 12-pin connector is basically the same length as an 8-pin connector and is only a few millimeters narrower, but the orientation is such that putting on an 8-pin connector instead wouldn't have been a problem.We haven't had time to do a full teardown of the 3070 Founders Edition yet, as we wanted to finish benchmarking before taking it apart. We'll update this section with additional images and commentary in the near future.MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0Desktop GPU Performance Hierarchy TableMORE:\u00a0All Graphics Content\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition Review\n\n\n\nNext Page Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Overclocking\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nScanners\n4K\nGeForce RTX 3090\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nGeForce RTX 3070\nrtx\nHardware\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (21)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

There are reasons behind that, but the short summary is that the managing editors at Tom's Hardware are now redirecting the original URL into the new paginated version. The text and charts have not changed, on any of the reviews. It's just a change in the presentation. The original review was posted at https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review and the new version with pages is at https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review -- which is why the comments reset.

You can buy one at that price, albeit with infamously extreme difficulty. Use Hotstock and keep an eye on stores that are not Ebay for stock. Literally just bought a 3070 on 1/6/21 for MSRP after 3 weeks of waiting. On Best Buy, which another comment was complaining was facilitating bots to instantly sweep up everything. \n\nStop being so dramatic, it's just a graphics card. It will not change your life. If you want to complain about paying $1000 bucks to scalpers, go for it. But you paid the idiot tax and put money in their pocket. Do not assume the rest of us need to as well.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 21 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeydous NJ98-CP V2 HE Review: Dedicated calculators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicron 4600 2TB SSD Review: The New Baseline in SSDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex Review: A very close second\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock PG-1600G Phantom Gaming power supply review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID-Cooling FX 360 INF Pink Review: Stylishly pink, but loud in more ways than one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWD Black SN7100 SSD Review: The power efficiency king, with caveats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review: Stunning gaming performance meets top-tier productivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025) review: Blue skies ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Mac Studio (Early 2025) Review: Renewed vigor with M4 Max and M3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Featuring a unique mechanic whereby players tackle challenges and puzzles simultaneously in two realities, The Medium offers a new experience for fans of the genre.\nFor the PC edition of The Medium, NVIDIA has worked with Bloober Team to introduce three immersion-enhancing ray-traced effects, and our performance accelerating NVIDIA DLSS technology, giving GeForce RTX gamers a superior experience. In fact, playing The Medium with RTX ON (ray tracing and DLSS) provides the best visual experience at equivalent or higher frame rates than RTX OFF (no ray tracing or DLSS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS\nWith gameplay occurring simultaneously in two different realities, The Medium essentially renders two games at once, greatly increasing the demands on your GPU. To help, we\u2019ve collaborated with Bloober Team to bring our critically acclaimed AI-accelerated NVIDIA DLSS to The Medium, boosting performance by up to 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is available for both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 in The Medium, can be used with or without ray tracing, and has three presets: High, which equates to \u2018DLSS Quality\u2019, is recommended for 1920x1080; Medium, which equates to \u2018DLSS Balanced\u2019, is recommended for 2560x1440; Low, which equates to \u2018DLSS Performance\u2019, is recommended for 3840x2160.\nIn addition to greatly accelerating performance, NVIDIA DLSS also matches or exceeds the fidelity of The Medium\u2019s temporal anti-aliasing technique, further improving the experience for GeForce RTX gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view fullscreen comparison\nAltogether, NVIDIA DLSS gives GeForce RTX gamers a faster, high-fidelity experience, as you can see in our new The Medium NVIDIA DLSS video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay Tracing\nThe horrifying dual realities of The Medium are enhanced with ray-traced reflections, ray-traced ambient occlusion, and ray-traced transparent reflections, greatly increasing immersion, realism and fidelity. And with NVIDIA DLSS, we give you the performance to enjoy these effects on a wide range of configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Ambient Occlusion\nAmbient occlusion helps ground objects and gives scenes a realistic sense of depth by calculating the extent to which objects occlude light. Based on the results, subtle shadows are added around objects and geometry.\nUsing ray tracing, the fidelity and accuracy of ambient occlusion effects can be significantly increased, improving immersion and revealing more detail on and around objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view fullscreen comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections\nReflections are the most immediate beneficiary of ray tracing, coming to life with accurate, high-res detail that is otherwise impossible to render. In The Medium, these ray-traced reflections are applied to all suitably reflective surfaces, adding reflective detail that is otherwise missing, and enhancing previously-seen screen space reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view fullscreen comparison\nAs in other titles, enhanced reflections noticeably improve scene detail, realism and immersion, giving GeForce RTX gamers an even-better experience. And when Ray Tracing is set to \u201cUltra\u201d, the quality of reflections is further improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Transparent Reflections\nGlass, windows, and other transparent surfaces and objects feature ray-traced reflections when The Medium\u2019s \u201cUltra\u201d Ray Tracing mode is enabled. Using Hybrid Translucency, the environment, character, NPCs and other game elements can be reflected on transparent surfaces just as they are on opaque ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view fullscreen comparison\nNew reflections are seen, existing screen space reflections are improved upon, and overall scene detail, realism and immersion are improved, taking fidelity up an extra notch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Settings\nThe Medium handles its ray tracing options differently than other titles, as the transition from reality to a split reality results in the rendering of a second game, decreasing FPS. To help clarify, here\u2019s a breakdown of how The Medium\u2019s Off/On/Ultra Ray Tracing options work:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOff\nRay Tracing On\nRay Tracing Ultra\n\n\nRT Ambient Occlusion\n-\nEnabled in single-reality view\nEnabled in single and split-reality view\n\n\nRT Reflections\n-\nEnabled in select locations in single-reality view\nEnabled in most locations in single and split-reality view\n\n\nRT Transparent Reflections\n-\nDisabled\nEnabled in single and split-reality view\n\n\nRT Reflection Enhancements\n-\nDisabled\nHigher-fidelity reflections in single and split-reality view\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSplit-reality\u201d refers to instances where The Medium\u2019s protagonist interacts with the world and its characters in two realities simultaneously, often using a supernatural ability to explore areas inaccessible in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRealities often look different, and therefore require their own set of effects and new rays to be traced, essentially doubling the workload for your graphics card. Per Bloober Team, split-reality accounts for about a third of the gameplay, so users with less performant systems will still be able to enjoy ray tracing in the majority of The Medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Game Ready For The Medium With Our New Driver\nIf you like what you see and want to explore The Medium\u2019s world of psychological horror at its very best, with ray tracing and DLSS, be sure to download and install our newest Game Ready Driver. There are day 1 optimizations and enhancements, and our usual raft of improvements for all the games you\u2019re playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMystery Comes to GeForce NOW Thursday\nIf you don\u2019t own a ray tracing-capable PC, or you\u2019re away from your rig, you can still play The Medium with DLSS and beautifully ray traced graphics. And it\u2019s no mystery, it\u2019s streaming on GeForce NOW as the headline game in this week\u2019s GFN Thursday release!\nAll members, including gamers on free memberships, will be able to stream The Medium on launch day. Founders members have instant access to the game allowing them to skip the queue during peak hours, extended session lengths and can play with the highest quality visuals thanks to RTX and DLSS technologies.\nBoth the Steam and Epic Games Store versions are streaming with GeForce NOW. Buy the game once and play it on your PC, plus stream it to nearly any PC, Mac, Chromebook, SHIELD, Android or iOS device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Medium, Out Now\nYou can download and play The Medium today from Steam, the Epic Game Store, and from Microsoft on Game Pass.

You're in luck, as Nvidia has updated its Android TV software to work with next-gen controllers. \u00a0\n\nThis means both controllers can be used to play Android games and titles available on Nvidia's own game streaming service, GeForce Now, on a Shield TV or Shield TV Pro device. Better yet, it's simple to connect both the controllers.\u00a0See the\u00a0best PC games\u00a0and\u00a0best Xbox Game Pass PC games\u00a0to play nowCheck out the\u00a0Xbox Series X games\u00a0and\u00a0PS5 games\u00a0confirmed so farSee our reviews of the\u00a0Xbox Series X\u00a0and\u00a0PS5The Nvidia Shield TV update can pair the PS5 controller and Xbox Series X controller via Bluetooth. Navigate to the Bluetooth section of the Nvidia Shield TV, and to pair a PS5 controller,\u00a0press down on the PlayStation home button\u00a0until a blue light flashes. \n\nAs for a Xbox Series X or Series S controller, press down on the pairing button until the Xbox button starts flashing. The devices should show up on the TV. Presto, next-gen controller support is in full effect. \n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't mean users will be getting the same affects such as the DualSense's rightfully hyped up haptic feedback, or even the adaptive triggers.

If you own a Shield TV or Shield TV Pro device, you can now pair the PS5 DualSense or Xbox Series X controllers to play Android games or PC titles through Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now streaming service.To pair a PS5 DualSense controller, you can head into the Bluetooth section of the Shield TV, and then hold down the PlayStation button until the light pulses blue. For Xbox Series X / S controllers, you can hold the pairing button until the Xbox button starts blinking.Alongside the controller support, Nvidia is also adding Control4 home automation system support in this Shield TV 8.2.2 update. This allows the Control4 remote or app to navigate around the Shield TV UI to launch apps. This Shield TV update also brings the devices up to Android\u2019s December 2020 security patch level.Nvidia has consistently updated its Shield TV software for years, improving its AI-powered 4K upscaling features last year along with improvements to remote control customizations. Nvidia also added IR and CEC volume controls last year to its latest devices.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Nvidia\u2019s new RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti and 3090 and the AMD RX 6800 and 6800 XT are all incredibly hard to find, selling out instantly whenever they appear, due to an incredible level of demand that makes these GPUs worth many hundreds of dollars more than MSRP. A Trump tax and surging cryptocurrency prices may be about to make them even more expensive, too. Many older graphics cards are sold out online as well.This week, Nvidia and AMD finally have some updates \u2014 and it\u2019s bittersweet news.On the plus side, AMD tells The Verge it expects to sell more of its own reference design RX 6800, 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT cards on its own website in the first quarter of 2021 at their sticker prices, which should mean $579, $649 and $999 instead of inflated ones. But AMD is only committing to make them available \u201cto as many gamers as possible,\u201d which may not reassure buyers who felt AMD had a paper launch to begin with.Nvidia, meanwhile, is now saying that supplies of its GPUs to both consumers and partners \u201cwill likely remain lean through Q1,\u201d and we\u2019re not even talking about the first quarter of the year \u2014 Nvidia\u2019s fiscal Q1 doesn\u2019t end until late April. That\u2019s an awfully long wait.RelatedThe true price of a PlayStation 5Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 reviewNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti reviewAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT reviewAMD Radeon RX 6800 reviewAgain, it\u2019s demand, not just supply constraints, that are keeping graphics cards out of our hands. Nvidia tells us that since launch, its $499-and-up RTX 30-series GPUs have sold almost twice as much as the RTX 20-series did after the same amount of time. (The RTX 30-series is a much bigger upgrade than the previous gen was, mind you \u2014 there weren\u2019t a lot of games that took advantage of Nvidia\u2019s ray tracing at the time, and people\u2019s GTX 10-series cards were still holding up just fine.)Nvidia does at least seem to think crypto miners aren\u2019t snapping up all the cards quite yet, despite the sky-high prices we\u2019ve recently seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201cIf crypto demand begins or if we see a meaningful amount,\u201d said CFO Colette Kress at a recent investor conference, \u201cwe can also use that opportunity to restart the CMP product line to address ongoing mining demand.\u201d CMP refers to Nvidia\u2019s dedicated crypto mining GPUs, which strip away the video ports miners don\u2019t need because they aren\u2019t driving graphics to a monitor, making them them more profitable for Nvidia.Only Asus has admitted to higher GPU prices so farAs far as whether Trump\u2019s taxes might impact the price of graphics cards, Nvidia isn\u2019t saying much \u2014 but board partners EVGA and Zotac may have answered that themselves, adding $70 to $100 (or more!) to the price of each card with price increases this past week. AMD CEO Lisa Su claims the company is trying its best to keep prices down but without specifics. Here\u2019s a quote transcribed by AnandTech:We knew about the expiration of some tariff policies, and in advance worked towards a more flexible supply chain as it relates to AMD. We are committed to keeping GPU pricing as close to our suggested retail pricing as much as possible, because it\u2019s the only way to be fair to the users. Normally when we have GPU launches, our own branded cards are available initially but then fade away for our partners to pick up. This time around we\u2019re not phasing out our RX 6000 series, enabling us to sell direct to customers as low as possible. We\u2019re encouraging partners to do the same. Not only tariffs, but the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.That sounds good, but it\u2019s still fairly noncommittal \u2014 and feels like a step back from what AMD told Hardware Unboxed in November, about how partners should be able to sell the RX 6800 XT at its original $649 MSRP within eight weeks.During their back-to-back CES 2021 keynotes today, AMD praised how its new graphics cards gave the company \u201cleadership at the high end\u201d and noted that \u201cmany gamers are excited about the Radeon RX 6000 series,\u201d while Nvidia acknowledged that \u201cthese products have been hard to find, and we want to thank you for your patience as we continue to work hard to catch up.\u201dIt\u2019s going to be a wait, and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if Nvidia\u2019s just-announced $329 GeForce RTX 3060 is hell to buy, just like its predecessors. Like many have asked: why can\u2019t we just buy one and they ship it when it\u2019s ready?RelatedThe gaming industry keeps failing miserably at selling its most important productsUpdate January 13th, 11AM ET: Added AMD CEO Lisa Su\u2019s thoughts on Trump\u2019s tariffs and pricing, thanks to AnandTech, and EVGA and Zotac price bunps.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: CCL)\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve long known that Nvidia has a GeForce RTX focused event coming up on January 12, and while we\u2019ve always suspected it involves the RTX 3060 GPU and RTX 30 mobile chipsets, the company has all but confirmed some of the contents in a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it teaser video on Twitter.For a nine-second video, there\u2019s a surprising amount you can glean from it, so here\u2019s a full breakdown. First, though, the video itself:GeForce RTX: Game OnJanuary 12 at 9AM PSTTune in via Twitch + YouTubeJanuary 9, 2021Nvidia RTX 3080 vs. RTX 2080 Ti: How much better is it?Where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080PLUS: Black PS5 retailer says it's cancelling all orders \u2014 blames it on 'threats'The interesting bits all occur at the four-second mark, where four images are quickly flashed up in quick succession. First up, something that looks suspiciously like a gaming laptop, which is the strongest indicator yet that Nvidia is planning on giving its mobile GPUs an Ampere-based shot in the arm, in the same way that desktop GPUs were upgraded last year.\u00a0This isn\u2019t wholly surprising. Not only is it a little odd that top-end gaming laptops currently max out at the RTX 2080 Super, when desktops can have RTX 3070 or 3080 cards installed, but we\u2019ve already seen (quickly pulled) listings of RTX 30 based laptops, suggesting an official release is imminent. If the last leak was accurate, we can expect an Nvidia RTX 3060 with 6GB GDDR6 memory, a RTX 3070 Max-Q with 8GB of GDDR6 and a RTX 3080 Max-Q with 16GB of GDDR6 RAM.The second quickly flashing image isn\u2019t about hardware, but relates to a likely software tie-in. It\u2019s a still from People Can Fly\u2019s upcoming co-op shooter Outriders. Expect the game to have some fancy effects that make it an especially strong showcase of Nvidia\u2019s hardware.Next up we get a quick flash of the GeForce RTX logo, which could mean nothing given the whole event is GeForce RTX focused, but our guess is that it relates to the unveiling of the RTX 3060 GPU. The entry-level RTX 30 card has long been rumored, and is set to undercut the $400 3060 Ti for mainstream gaming PCs. Rumor has it that we\u2019ll see both 6GB and 12GB versions, but we\u2019ll have to wait until Tuesday to be sure.The final shot is a picture of what seems to be Resizable BAR (Base Address Register) technology. As our sister site Tom\u2019s Hardware explains, this clever tech boosts throughput between your CPU and GPU to improve gaming performance. Ampere GPUs already support it, but it needs to be enabled via a software update. The inclusion of it in the video suggests that Nvidia is almost ready to hit that switch.Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The remaining seven seconds of video are just logos and a reminder that all will be revealed soon, with details of how to tune in to the event.

It looks like NVIDIA is still deciding on what to do next with its Ampere lineup and as such, there are new rumors emerging from Kopite7kimi (via Videocardz), according to who, NVIDIA is preparing two brand new SKUs which might possibly by the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER Reportedly Under Consideration, Could These Feature 16 GB GDDR6(X) VRAM?\nFor starters, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER are not going to affect the upcoming card lineup which would include the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti & the GeForce RTX 3060. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti could be a whole different story since we have heard about this SKU for a while now but nothing has been formulated aside from some rumored specifications. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti have also been canceled and relaunched with different specs a couple of times now.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is even going to be introduced earlier than the RTX 3070 Ti so the status of this particular SKU is not confirmed yet. At the same time, one thing to note about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 is how both of them feature much higher memory capacities than their predecessors. The RTX 3080 Ti replaces the RTX 2080 Ti with 9 GB higher VRAM (11 GB vs 20 GB) and the RTX 3060 replaces the RTX 2060 with twice the memory buffer (6 GB vs 12 GB). The same might just be the case with the SUPER series that NVIDIA has planned.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER & RTX 3070 SUPER\nWe don't have any concrete specifications of these two chips but if we go back to earlier rumors, then we can tell that NVIDIA had initially planned higher VRAM variants of both RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 graphics cards. The RTX 3080 was expected to feature 12-16 GB VRAM while the RTX 3070 also had been expected to feature similar VRAM amounts. However, that plan was scrapped in favor of NVIDIA going literally bonkers with its RTX 3090 design and keeping the rest of the lineup capped to 10 GB VRAM due to limited availability of GDDR6(X) modules.\n\nI know there are some new SKUs recently, but I don't know their names yet, maybe 3070 Super and 3080 Super.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31, 2020\n\nBy the time the RTX 3080 Ti launches, the memory supply will be far better. NVIDIA themselves have also confirmed that supply would get better by the end of the first quarter of 2021 so that is probably when NVIDIA can devise a better plan to re-release their GeForce RTX lineup in a SUPER fashion.\n\nFor this purpose, the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER could be the first entrants in the lineup. Similar to the previous generation, NVIDIA wouldn't want to touch the high-end models since they will be positioned right against the competition. It's the RTX 3080 and below lineups such as the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti which would require a SUPER refresh to tackle AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6700 series.\n\nGA102 and GA103S\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) December 31, 2020\n\nFor that purpose alone, NVIDIA could end up featuring 16 GB of GDDR6(X) memory on both, the RTX 3080 SUPER (GDDR6X) & the GeForce 3070 SUPER (GDDR6). As for core configurations, they might also change with the GeForce RTX 3070 SUPER expected to utilize the GA103S GPU while the GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER would retain its GA102 GPU.\nHowever, one critical thing to consider here would be the prices. Whether NVIDIA offers a price cut on existing variants and ends their production to make room for the new cards which is similar to what they did in the last generation or keep the existing cards and offer the SUPER variants with a slight premium, that remains to be seen. Lastly, don't expect the SUPER cards anytime soon as the green team has yet to be done with the original lineup. We can probably expect an announcement around Computex or during Summer which was also the case with the GeForce RTX 20 SUPER line.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler Sees 10x Increase In NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Capacity And A 35x Decrease In Model Inference Costs As Seeds For The Upcoming \u201cAI Wave 2\u201d\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 & RTX 5060 Ti Specs Leaked: 5060 Ti Gets 4608 Cores & Up To 16 GB G7, 5050 Gets 2560 Cores & 8 GB G6, Both at 128-bit\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n155\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Board Partners Silently Increase Prices Of Radeon RX 9070 Series;

Even overclocked with the power limit set at the maximum 110 percent isn't going to be too bad, as that's only around 220W. For these tests, we run Metro Exodus at 1440p ultra, without ray tracing or DLSS. We also use FurMark running at 1600x900 in a window using the stress test mode. We'll look at power, GPU clocks, temperatures, and fan speeds.We also measured the noise levels of the RTX 3060 Ti from a distance of 15cm. At idle, from that distance, our PC's noise floor is 46.0 dB (or 34 dB from where my head is relative to the case on the floor). After running Metro for 15 minutes, the 3060 Ti FE noise levels were barely above that \u2014 46.9 dB. For reference, that's basically the same result as the 3070, which you'd expect considering the two share the same core design.Clock speeds, temperatures, fan speeds, and power are all interrelated. Drop the clocks, and you reduce the power and temperature. Raise the fan speed, and you reduce the temperature and maybe even power use, potentially allowing for higher clocks. It's a four-way balancing act, and utilities like EVGA Precision X1 and MSI Afterburner allow you to customize your particular card (within limits).Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)As we've seen with several other Nvidia GPUs, power use ends up being slightly higher than the official TDP. I don't think anyone will cry foul about a card using 205W instead of 200W, but it's interesting that the 3070 so far is the only Ampere GPU that came in below its official TDP (while gaming). Overclocked, the 3060 Ti actually exceeded the 3070 in power use.\u00a0Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Nvidia tends to be quite conservative with its advertised boost clocks, and the RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition proves that yet again. The official boost clock is only 1665 MHz, but during our Metro Exodus test, the GPU averaged 1900 MHz. Overclocking pushed that up to 2070 MHz. FurMark does drop the GPU clock just a bit below the rated boost clock (1623 MHz), but it's higher than the base clock of 1410 MHz. Much as you'd expect, our 150 MHz overclock also translates into a 155 MHz average clock speed increase for FurMark.\u00a0Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Temperatures for the RTX 3060 Ti FE are good as well. Most GPUs can happily run at 70C, and that's basically where the card ends up at stock. Because of the higher fan speeds we applied during overclocking, that actually drops the temperature (but increases the noise levels). Both Metro and FurMark top out at around 69-70C.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Interestingly, the 3060 Ti's fan speeds are slightly higher than the 3070. That could just be variance on the cards and fans, or perhaps more likely, the GA104 silicon in the 3060 Ti was binned and determined to be a better fit for a lower-tier card, with the higher-quality silicon going into the 3070 cards. At stock, the 3060 Ti fans ran at around 1380 RPM in Metro and 1440 RPM in FurMark. Our aggressive fan speed curve for overclocking bumped the RPM up to around 2350. We could certainly tune things better, but this was sufficient for our testing purposes.\u00a0MORE:\u00a0Best Graphics CardsMORE:\u00a0GPU BenchmarksMORE:\u00a0All Graphics Content\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti: Power, Temperatures, and Fan Speeds\n\n\n\nPrev Page Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti \u2014 Ray Tracing and DLSS Performance \n\n\nNext Page Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition: Impressive Mainstream Appeal \n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nScanners\n4K\nRadeon RX 6800\nTitan\nBenchmark\nGeForce\nGeForce RTX 3060\nGeForce RTX 3070\nrtx\nHardware\nray tracing\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (10)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

At 1440p, DLSS Quality mode still manages a decent 67 fps, and the 3060 Ti continues to lead AMD's options.\"\nI don't know what their talking about. I have a 3060 Ti and at 1080p ,even on High/Ultra settings, I get 144fps on most games. The lowest I've come across so far has been around 80fps. And even without DLSS at 1440p the frames are still around 80-100fps.\nNot to mention that the 3060 Ti is not an AMD card. Maybe that's not what the author meant when he said, \"the 3060 Ti continues to lead AMD's options.\", but that's what that wording means. It means that the 3060 Ti is AMD's best offering.

Especially if you're writing a lot of reviews and such.\n\nEdit: I know I'm responding to a fairly old post, but the article that lead me here was one of the top recommendations when I searched for info on Google. So I figure, even if a post is old, it's still relevant if people are still being directed to it.There are several issues with what you\u2019re saying, mostly to do with reading comprehension. When I say the 3060 Ti \u201cleads AMD\u2019s options,\u201d I obviously mean in the context of this review: the Nvidia 3060 Ti is ahead of AMD\u2019s competing cards.\n\nThat also goes with the FPS metrics. If you play lighter games, you will get higher performance. The \u201c67 fps\u201d refers specifically to a game tested in this review. You quoted one specific sentence that refers to one specific game. That should be enough to give you context:\n\n\u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War uses ray tracing effects for shadows, with a higher fidelity (and more demanding) result in the previous Modern Warfare (2019) reboot. The 3060 Ti breaks 60 fps at 1080p native, and DLSS can further improve its performance. At 1440p, DLSS Quality mode still manages a decent 67 fps, and the 3060 Ti continues to lead AMD's options. The 6800 XT does squeak ahead at 4K, probably thanks to its 16GB of memory, but we doubt many people are going to want to play multiplayer Call of Duty at 30 fps.\u201d\n\nThe data is all there for you to see. If you want to know how the games tested in late 2020 performed on a 3060 Ti, look at the charts. Other games will perform differently. You can look at the current GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy for more recent testing on newer games that didn\u2019t exist when the 3060 Ti came out.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 10 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASRock PG-1600G Phantom Gaming power supply review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID-Cooling FX 360 INF Pink Review: Stylishly pink, but loud in more ways than one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewSonic XG2536 25-inch FHD IPS 280 Hz gaming monitor review: Incredibly quick and value priced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWD Black SN7100 SSD Review: The power efficiency king, with caveats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review: Stunning gaming performance meets top-tier productivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025) review: Blue skies ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Mac Studio (Early 2025) Review: Renewed vigor with M4 Max and M3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo Yoga Slim 9i review: The most luxurious ultrabook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElgato Wave Neo Review: I hope you got this as part of a bundle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetgear Orbi 870 Wi-Fi 7 mesh router review: Solid performance can\u2019t mask high price and feature regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Claiming twice the raster performance of the GTX 1060, and 10 times the ray tracing performance \u2013 which shouldn't be surprising, since the GTX 1060 doesn't have any dedicated ray tracing cores.(Image credit: Nvidia)It will also feature 12GB VRAM, which is four more than the 8GB RTX 3060 Ti, which is interesting to say the least. As our Computing Editor pointed out in their live blog, this could make the 3060 Ti obsolete \u2013 though we'll have to actually test the card to see if that ends up being true.Most importantly though, is the price. At $329 (about \u00a3255 / AU$460), this definitely puts the RTX 3060 within the price range of just about every PC builder out there. And, it's even cheaper than the RTX 2060, which was dropped to $349 (about \u00a3275, AU$500) when the RTX 2060 Super launched in 2019.\u00a0The card is expected to be released worldwide in late February. Hopefully it won't run into nearly as much of a shortage issue as its more powerful predecessors.Check out all of TechRadar's CES 2021 coverage.

The Steam game platform saw records broken for all its peak statistics in 2020 - 21% more games purchased, and 50% more hours played.But it means avid gamers are facing a big problem: graphics cards, the heart of a gaming PC, are incredibly hard to get hold of. For months, we've seen gamers compete for supply, camping out in front of stores, crashing websites and most of all, paying hugely inflated prices in the hunt for high-end gaming. What's the problem?An office PC might work fine with built-in graphics power, but if you want to do any serious gaming, a dedicated graphics card (GPU) is a must. It can be half the cost or more of a gaming PC.Better lighting, higher resolution output, and more frames per second - the key to ultra-smooth gameplay - are all usually determined by the GPU.That's a big deal for gamers like Leonora Tomlinson-Bennett, who works in the gaming industry and dabbles in streaming. She was \"quite excited\" about the release of Nvidia'a new 3000 series of cards in September.\"Part of my job is content creation, so I'll go into the game and capture content - and obviously if you want to present that [publicly], you want it to look the best it can.\" One of the reasons demand is so high is that the new cards are actually much better than many expected, with performance improvements of anywhere from 50-90% over the previous generation.At the same time, new games like Cyberpunk 2077 are crippling older consoles, and stretching the limits of older PC cards.\"They're a massive step up and my graphics card is really quite outdated,\" Leonora explained. WATCH: Marc Cieslak meets Cyberpunk 2077's creators and explores its worldShe's been unable to find the high-end RTX 3080 card she wants, and has had to resort to paying in advance for a not-quite-as-powerful 3070 on back-order.\"I'm on the waiting list. I think I'm something like number 3,000 in the queue.\"The shortage hit the ultra-top end, too. Several people told me they'd wanted a 3080, starting at \u00a3649.But the shortage meant some shelled out on the semi-pro 3090, at a whopping \u00a31,399, because it was the only high-end card available.Why is there a big shortage?There's no single reason for the huge demand.Early last year, Chinese manufacturing was temporarily limited due to the coronavirus outbreak; later, shipping delays hit the electronics market; and the price of Bitcoin has made \"mining\" - using GPUs - more lucrative.All this has led to some remarkable scenes. In the US, when lockdown restrictions were lighter, people were queuing around the block at electronics retailers or camping overnight, hoping to secure one of a handful of cards that might be delivered in the morning.Retailers handed out vouchers to those in the top slots of the queue, while dealers tried to buy those spots - not the actual cards - for hundreds of dollars. And shoppers created sign-out procedures to allow for toilet breaks and food runs. But for most people, buying limited stock online has been the only option.Is it getting better?The two main graphics card makers - Nvidia and AMD - can't make product fast enough.\"Gaming demand is off the charts,\" Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said during CES. \"Our overall capacity has not been able to keep up\".She warned that supply \"will likely remain lean throughout Q1.\"EbayThe 3080 \"founders edition\" has a list price of \u00a3649It's a similar story for AMD, where company boss Lisa Su said after its CES announcements that shortages are the result of demand \"rather than manufacturing issues\".\"We're putting in additional capacity,\" she told enthusiast site Anandtech. But she warned: \"It will take time to catch up\u2026 there will be tightness in the first half of the year\".Added to that, the retailers have warned that automated bots are a big problem, buying cards up for re-sellers before real consumers have a chance - leading to massively inflated prices on eBay and other sites.What about older cards?There was some hope that the release of the new cards from AMD - the Radeon 6000 series - would help, two months after Nvidia's release. But they quickly sold out too. And it isn't just a problem for the new products.One regular upgrader told me mid-range cards now cost twice what they used to - and his two-year-old card is selling for almost the same price it did in 2018.Why bots will beat you to the hot-ticket giftsSold-out new Xbox console listed on eBay for \u00a35,000Gareth Bellamy from Herefordshire is buying for his son.The family had been donating the gaming PC's computing power to medical research for the coronavirus through the Folding at Home project. He thought it was time to upgrade a five-year-old machine.But new cards \"all seem quite pricey,\" he says. So he looked at the older, less powerful models.\"Everything seemed to be out of stock - or if it was in stock it seemed even more expensive than the newer cards that were coming out.\"In the end, he gave up - unwilling to pay twice the list price.What are retailers doing?Sellers have been struggling to meet demand since the cards launched. Automated stock alert bots are widely used by the obsessive, alongside Discord chat groups where enthusiasts will trade tips and rumours about incoming stock.Finding one available for immediate purchase is almost impossible.For most, the solution has been to pay for the entire cost of a card on a pre-order, with little idea of when it will be shipped. That way, they are paying above recommended retail prices - but not by much.Why bots will beat you to the hot-ticket giftsSold-out new Xbox console listed on eBay for \u00a35,000Restock of new PlayStation 5 causes chaos onlineComputingGamingAMDNvidiaRelatedPowerful quantum computers in years not decades, says Microsoft19 Feb 2025TechnologyCoding prodigy swapping GCSEs for Silicon Valley13 Feb 2025London'Our dad helped to build the Colossus computer'9 Nov 2024Beds, Herts & BucksMore2 days ago'I skipped college to make games - now I'm Roblox's top developer'Osian started making games under his staircase at home when his parents thought he was at college. 2 days agoWales4 days agoIt's not a competition!

Desktop GPU Performance At 1440P\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                As we've mentioned earlier, the particular MSI GS66 Stealth laptop configuration we received for testing may or may not be offered for sale, so we're not going to dwell too much on the system's acoustic and thermal characteristics.\u00a0 We had to do SOME poking and prodding though, to see how the GeForce RTX 3080 laptop GPU behaved in such a thin (18mm) form factor...\n\n\n\r\nThis data was gathered by the system's sensors using the latest version of GPU-Z, while the machine was configured in its \"Balanced\" thermal profile, running Furmark's CPU and GPU burn-in tests -- both the processor and GPU were concurrently under a sustained load for an extended period. The data shows the GeForce RTX 3080 laptop GPU settling in around 67\u00b0C, with the CPU topping out at a toasty 88\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal System Power Consumption\n\n\n\n\nTested at the Outlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd also like to cover a couple of final data points regarding power consumption and acoustics. Throughout all of our benchmarking and testing, we monitored noise output and tracked how much power the notebook was consuming under various conditions. Note, this is not the GPU power alone, but power measured at the outlet, being drawn by the entire machine...\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWhile idling, the particular MSI GS66 Stealth we tested pulled very little power from the wall. Taxing the CPU resulting in a peak of 87 watts, and whacking the GPU pushed power up to 130 watts. Hitting both the CPU and GPU concurrently resulted in a peak of 157 watts being pulled from the wall.\n\n\r\nHigh-end gaming laptops packed with powerful components don't typically offer stellar battery life. With that said, despite having one of the most powerful, truly-mobile gaming laptop configurations available, the MSI GS66 Stealth with GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU went for over an hour an forty minutes running PCMark's gaming battery life test, which put it well ahead of a number of notebooks that don't offer near the same level of performance.\n\n\n\r\nKeeping high-performance laptop components cool in only 18mm requires a capable cooling solution. The fan in out MSI GS66 Stealth test vehicle ran constantly, even when the machine was at idle. The fan generated only a dull whir when the machine was idling though, and registered about 39dBa on our sound pressure meter from about a foot away from the display. Putting the machine under a heavy load, however, results in significantly higher fan speeds. Under load, the system output nearly 49dBa, which is relatively loud, but in the same ballpark as many other high-end gaming notebooks.\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobile - The Verdict\nThe GeForce RTX 30-series laptop GPUs are somewhat of a departure from previous-gen mobile GPUs. With the 16nm Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10-series, there was little to distinguish between the desktop and mobile parts. Save for the GeForce GTX 1070 mobile variant, which actually had more CUDA cores than its desktop counterpart, the other members of the family were very similar to their desktop namesakes. The complexity and power requirements of the GeForce RTX 20-series mobile GPUs changed that a bit, and the new GeForce RTX 30-series laptop GPUs shift the desktop and mobile disparity somewhat further. It's just physics though -- there's only so much power and thermal headroom available in mobile form factors. And while the GeForce RTX 30-series mobile GPUs have more tame specs and don't perform at near the same level of their similarly-branded desktop counterparts, they're still quite speedy.\n\nFind MSI GS66 Steal Laptops With GeForce GPUs @ Amazon\n\n\r\nThe fact remains that the GeForce RTX 30-series laptop GPUs are the fastest, most feature-rich mobile GPUs available today, bar none. Playing AAA games, with high image quality settings, on a high-refresh rate, top-quality 1440p panel with G-Sync support elevates the mobile gaming experience. We achieved playable framerates with all of the games we tested and performance over previous-gen offerings was significantly better. There was a lot of buzz regarding NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30-series mobile GPUs in the lead up to this year's CES, and now we know why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong Performance\nTargeting Attractive Form Factors\nFull Ampere Feature Support\nNew Platform Capabilities\n\n\n\n\nDesktop/Mobile GPU Branding May Lead To Confusion\nCooling Solutions May Get Fairly Loud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, GPU, Laptops, (nasdaq:nvda), ampere, geforce rtx 30, rtx 30 mobile\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlienware m15 R4 Review: A GeForce RTX 30 Series Invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop Performance: What To Expect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 5000 Mobile Explored: The Future Of Zen 3 Laptops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoto One 5G Ace Review: Solid 5G Phone, Battery Life Champ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Prestige 14 EVO Review: Great Performance And Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT STUFF IN PC COMPONENTS\n\nAlienware m15 R4 Review: A GeForce RTX...\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop...\nAMD Ryzen 5000 Mobile Explored: The...\nMoto One 5G Ace Review: Solid 5G Phone,...\nMSI Prestige 14 EVO Review: Great...\nSamsung Galaxy Tab Active3 Review:...\nOnePlus Nord N10 5G US-Edition: A Solid...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEEP INFORMED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITE\n\nHome\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n\n\nLeisure\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nNews Tips\n\n\nContact\n\n\nPrivacy And Terms\n\n\nHotTech\n\n\n\nMORE\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            As an Amazon and Howl Technologies Associate, HotHardware earns a commission from qualifying purchases made on this site.

Yes, you heard that right, a year old graphics card for the same price as a higher-performant and current-gen product.\nNVIDIA's Partners Planning To Reintroduce NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Series To Meet High DIY & OEM Graphics Card Demand\nThe rather surprising piece of information comes from overclocking.com who have confirmed with their sources, which happen to be 3 major AIBs, that they are indeed planning to revive the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 series. NVIDIA is given the green light to its partners and it looks like there could be several reasons why this decision was made.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostNVIDIA may possibly still be sitting on a huge inventory of Turing GPUs, mainly the mainstream TU 104 and TU 106 chips. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 series consists of graphics cards based on the two GPUs. The GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB is powered by the TU106 GPU while the GeForce RTX 2060S (SUPER) is powered by the TU104 GPU and features 8 GB memory. Since there is already a shortage of GPUs in the market and demand is ever rising within the DIY and OEM segments, NVIDIA and its AIBs could be taking advantage of the situation by selling off the access inventory.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB was priced at $299 US after a price cut by NVIDIA while the GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER was priced at $399 US. The prices are good but here's the thing, the two cards will never be sold at that rates again. Starting February which is when both of these cards will re-enter the retail segment, The GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER will be priced over $400 US while the GeForce RTX 2060 will be priced at over $300 US. So based on the price figures alone, the GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB will be close to the GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB while the GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER should end up close to the GeForce RTX 3070's MSRP.\nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Segment/Tier Prices\n\n\n\nGraphics Segment2023-20242022-20232021-20222020-20212019-20202018-20192017-20182016-20172014-2016\n\n\n\n\nTitan TierGeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3090GeForce RTX 3090Titan RTX (Turing)Titan V (Volta)Titan Xp (Pascal)Titan X (Pascal)Titan X (Maxwell)\n\n\nPrice$1599 US$1599 US$1999 US\n$1499 US$1499 US$2499 US$2999 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US\n\n\nUltra Enthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4080 SUPERGeForce RTX 4080GeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 TiGeForce GTX 980 TiGeForce GTX 980 Ti\n\n\nPrice$999 US$1199 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US$999 US$699 US$649 US$649 US\n\n\nEnthusiast TierGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPERGeForce RTX 4070 TiGeForce RTX 3080 12 GBGeForce RTX 3080 10 GBGeForce RTX 2080 SUPERGeForce RTX 2080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 1080GeForce GTX 980\n\n\nPrice$799 US$799 US$799 US$699 US$699 US$699 US$549 US$549 US$549 US\n\n\nHigh-End TierGeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 4070GeForce RTX 4070\nGeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GBGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERGeForce RTX 2070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 1070GeForce GTX 970\n\n\nPrice$599\n$549$599 US\n$499 US$599\n$499$599\n$499$499 US$499 US$379 US$379 US$329 US\n\n\nMainstream TierGeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\nGeForce GTX 1660GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 960\n\n\nPrice$449\n$299$399 US\n$299 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$349 US\n$279 US\n$229 US\n$219 US$249 US$249 US$249 US$199 US\n\n\nEntry TierRTX 3050 8 GB\nRTX 3050 6 GBRTX 3050RTX 3050GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 950GTX 750 Ti\nGTX 750\n\n\nPrice$229\n$179$249 US$249 US$159 US\n$149 US$159 US\n$149 US$139 US\n$109 US$139 US\n$109 US$149 US$149 US\n$119 US\n\n\n\n\nEven as of right now, the cheapest GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB variants are listed anywhere from $450 to $550 US so it's kind of hard to think that the 300/400 Euro prices being mentioned will be real or not.\nNews Source: Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n110\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs;

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series will launch in both Max-Q and Max-P flavors, featuring different core, clocks and memory configurations.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPU Power Configurations Leak Out, GeForce RTX 3080 Up To 165W For Enthusiast Notebooks\nThere are three power profiles within which the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPUs will operate. These include the base TGP (Total Graphics Power), cTGP (Configurable Total Graphics Power), and PPAB which is a dynamic AI-accelerated boost range. PPAB is mostly going to be optimized by OEM laptop makers for their solutions based on the cooling capabilities.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryFor Max-P variants, PPAB would deliver 15 Watts of additional power to the GPU while in Max-Q variants, this will be rated up to 20 Watts. The reason why Max-Q variants offer a higher PPAB range is that they feature lower TGP, to begin with, whereas the Max-P variants ship with higher minimum TGPs.\n\nNow there's a report by NotebookCheck that NVIDIA has removed the Max-Q and Max-P labels from their GPUs and that OEMs are free to decide the TGPs they wish to set for their notebooks running GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPUs. This means that the minimum TGP should therefore be intact but other metrics such as cTGP and PPAB ranges will be entirely dependent on what OEMs plan to do with them.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 16 GB Mobility GPU - Laptops Starting at $1999 US\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card will be the flagship offering within NVIDIA's RTX 30 series notebook GPU family. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility will feature 48 SMs on the GA104 GPU SKU (GA104-775). This chip would feature a total of 6144 cores, a base clock of 1245 MHz, and a boost clock of 1710 MHz.\nThe graphics card also features 16 GB VRAM which runs across a 256-bit wide bus interface but it remains to be seen if NVIDIA is utilizing 12 or 14 Gbps DRAM modules for its mobility lineup. In the case of 14 Gbps, the GPU will be able to offer a maximum bandwidth of 448 GB/s.\n\nThe Max-Q variant of the GeForce RTX 3080 Mobility GPU will feature a starting TGP of 80W which will be configurable up to 165W. The GeForce RTX 3080 laptops will start at a price of $1999 US and will offer 100+ FPS at 1440p resolution in several gaming titles.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8 GB Mobility GPU - Laptops Starting at $1299 US\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobility will feature 40 SMs on the GA104 GPU SKU (presumably, the GA104-770). This chip would feature a total of 5120 cores, a base clock of 1290 MHz, and a boost of up to 1620 MHz. The graphics card also features 8 GB VRAM which runs across a 256-bit wide bus interface but it remains to be seen if NVIDIA is utilizing 12 or 14 Gbps DRAM modules for its mobility lineup. In the case of 14 Gbps, the GPU will be able to offer a maximum bandwidth of 448 GB/s.\n\nThe TGPs for the GeForce RTX 3070 will feature a base TGP of 80W too but could be configured only up to 150W. The GeForce RTX 3070 laptops will start at a price of $1299 US and will offer 90 FPS 1440p gaming.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB Mobility GPU - Laptops Starting at $999 US\nLastly, we have the GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB which was also announced for the desktop segment today but with 12 GB GDDR6 memory. Both the desktop and mobility variants feature the GA106 GPU but the notebook variant comes with 30 SM units enabled, resulting in a total of 3840 CUDA cores. The graphics chip will feature clocks starting at 1283 MHz base and go up to 1703 MHz boost frequencies.\n\nAs mentioned before, the GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB graphics card will come with a total of 6 GB GDDR6 memory running across a 192-bit bus interface. The memory pin speeds are to be configured at 12 Gbps which should result in a total bandwidth of 288 GB/s. The GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB will feature TGPs of 60W and all the way up to 130W.\nAccording to NVIDIA themselves, the RTX 3060 laptops will start at $999 US and will offer 30% better performance than Sony's PS5 console. It seems like NVIDIA is targeting the laptop as a 1080p 90 FPS gaming solution.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPU Lineup:\n\n\n\nGPU NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 ANVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nGPU SKUGA107GA107AD106GA107GA106GA104GA104GA104GA103\n\n\nSMs161614203040464858\n\n\nCUDA Cores204820481792256038405120588861447424\n\n\nBase Clock1057 MHz1042 MHzTBD1035 MHz1283 MHz1290 MHz1035 MHz1245 MHz1125 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1740 MHz1470 MHzTBD1695 MHz1703 MHz1620 MHz1485 MHz1710 MHz1590 MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 GbpsTBD12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Size4 GB6 GB4 GB4 GB6 GB8 GB8 GB8/16 GB16 GB\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit96-bit64-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nBandwidth192 GB/s168 GB/sTBD192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s512 GB/s\n\n\nTGP35-95W35-95W35-50W35-95W60-115W80-125W80 - 125W80-150W+175W\n\n\nConfigurationsMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PTBDMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-P\n\n\nLaunchQ2 2021Q1 20242024?Q2 2021Q1 2021Q1 2021Q1 2022Q1 2021Q1 2022\n\n\n\nNews Source: HXL\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Customers who buy certified systems will also receive enterprise support from Nvidia and OEM partners\nAdel El-Hallak, director of product management for NGC at Nvidia, said while the chipmaker will continue to support those who want to build their own systems, the company will recommend customers to buy servers that are certified under the new program.\n\u201cIdeally, we\u2019d like them to buy the Nvidia-certified systems because we know that these will run optimally [and] meet the performance threshold that we expect,\u201d he said.\nEl-Hallak said Nvidia partners should focus on adding new value around the creation of AI applications rather than trying to tinker with systems when Nvidia is already doing the groundwork.\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather that they spend the time doing what they do best, which is creating AI and deriving new business values rather than spending time figuring out how to [put] these systems together,\u201d he said.\nThe Nvidia-Certified Systems include servers with as many as eight A100 GPUs as well as high-speed InfiniBand or Ethernet adapters from the company\u2019s Mellanox networking business. The systems can also include Mellanox ConnectX-6 SmartNICs and BlueField-2 DPUs.\nIn order to pass certification, the servers must pass tests on deep learning training and inference, machine learning algorithms, intelligent video analytics and network and storage offload, all of which are based on software from Nvidia\u2019s NGC catalog.\nServers that have been certified so far include the Dell EMC PowerEdge R7525, Gigabyte R281-G30, HPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 System, Inspur NF5488A5 and Supermicro A+ Server AS -4124GS-TNR.\nMatthew DuBell, a consulting solutions architect for the Business and Analytics Advisors group at St. Louis, Mo.-based World Wide Technology, a top Nvidia AI partner, said the new certification program shows that GPU computing and accelerated computing are \u201chere to stay in the enterprise.\u201d\n\u201cNvidia has definitely taken a huge lead in being able to offer these types of programs, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how other players in the market react,\u201d he said.\nDuBell said the program will help take out a lot of the guesswork of how to optimize systems for AI while also giving customers more confidence in the infrastructure investments they\u2019re making.\n\u201cOrganizations don\u2019t want a heterogeneous mix of server vendors or types. They tend to prefer a baseline from an OEM, so being able to offer a validated design and performance from a preferred OEM is going to be a benefit to a lot of IT organizations,\u201d he said.\nFor World Wide Technology, the certification program will allow the value-added reseller to focus on providing its own differentiated services for AI and data science, which include managing the data, the building out of initial AI pipelines and deploying large production environments, according to DuBell.\n\u201cA lot of people will talk about how data is the next oil. But when you think about oil, it\u2019s not useful until it\u2019s refined,\u201d he said. \u201cSo being able to help a company refine its data so that it\u2019s truly insightful and allows them to grow their business is really what we\u2019re focusing these data services on.\u201d\nDominic Daninger, vice president of engineering at Burnsville, Minn.-based Nor-Tech, an Nvidia high-performance computing system integrator, said he is not concerned that the certification program puts more emphasis on pre-built systems over those that Nor-Tech may custom build.\n\u201cIf there aren\u2019t other issues in the way, we would probably go for a certified system just because it\u2019s one less surprise you might get,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s usually many factors weighed [when selling servers], and certification, we look at it as a plus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A lot of this has to do with a shortage of materials as well as the impact of COVID as a pandemic but there remains a very large number of variables at play here.\nNVIDIA And AMD GPU Availability Will Not Improve Significantly In Q1 2021\nTSMC remains a core bottleneck for GPU production as Samsung has yet to pick up in yields and it really does not help that ETH mining has made a full comeback. Till Ethereium switches to Proof of Stake (which would be sometime this year), you can expect miners to keep gobbling up boatloads of GPUs out of what is available and driving prices up in this scarce supply scenario.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM MemoryAMD had the following to say about the shortage:\nWe knew about the expiration of some tariff policies, and in advance worked towards a more flexible supply chain as it relates to AMD. We are committed to keeping GPU pricing as close to our suggested retail pricing as much as possible, because it\u2019s the only way to be fair to the users.\nNormally when we have GPU launches, our own branded cards are available initially but then fade away for our partners to pick up. This time around we\u2019re not phasing out our RX 6000 series, enabling us to sell direct to customers as low as possible. We\u2019re encouraging partners to do the same. Not only tariffs, but the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\n\u2014 AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su to AnandTech\nOn the plus side, AMD tells The Verge it expects to sell more of its own reference design RX 6800, 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT cards on its own website in the first quarter of 2021 at their sticker prices, which should mean $579, $649 and $999 instead of inflated ones. But AMD is only committing to make them available \u201cto as many gamers as possible,\u201d which may not reassure buyers who felt AMD had a paper launch to begin with.\n\u2014 Sean Hollister, The Verge\nAccording to NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress, the company is experiencing supply constraints which make them unable to meet demand through Q4 2020. This not only includes wafers and silicon but also substrate and components. This means that gamers will not be able to buy anything at affordable rates throughout 2020 and likely through the first quarter of 2021.\nConsidering global efforts to distribute the COVID vaccine will start in 2021, it is also possible that global shipments will be disrupted even further as the vast bulk of vaccines is moved which would mean that gamers might not see prices normalize until late 2021. Of course, this also does not include the effect of cryptocurrency mining as ETH has already breached the $600 mark and mining is profitable once more.\n\"We do have supply constraints and our supply constraints do expand past what we are seeing in terms of wafers and silicon, but yes some constrains are in substrates and components,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Colette Kress, CFO of Nvidia, at Credit Suisse 24th\u00a0Annual Technology Conference. \"We continue to work during the quarter on our supply and we believe though that demand will probably exceed supply in Q4 for overall gaming.\"\nOf course, even if the supply constraint was solved right now, it would take a couple of months for the production and supply channels to catch up with demand.\n\"We do expect it probably to take a couple months for it to catch up to demand, but at this time, it is really difficult for us to quantify,\" said Kress. \"So, we stay focused on trying to get our parts to the market for this very important holiday season. Each day things continue to improve. But before the end of the quarter, we will be able to provide some more information.\"\nI personally believe [caution: opinion] that we are not going to see prices stabilize until March 2021 at the earliest. This is because a big part of the problem is the supply constrain at TSMC and until capacity expands there, there are simply too many mouths to feed for the pure-play foundry. NVIDIA's partnership with Samsung to solve this exact problem also does not seem to be yielding the result they wanted.

With more software engineers than hardware engineers on staff, it\u2019s software and ecosystem plays that have really cemented NVIDIA\u2019s position as the top GPU manufacturer, and created a larger market for their GPUs. At the same time, it\u2019s these ecosystem plays that have allowed NVIDIA to build a profit-printing machine, diversifying beyond just GPU sales and moving into systems, software, support, and other avenues.\nTo that end, NVIDIA this morning is formally rolling out a new ecosystem play aimed at high-end deep learning servers, which the company is branding as NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Soft-launched back in the fall, today the company is giving the program a more proper introduction, detailing the program and announcing some of the partners. Under NVIDIA\u2019s plan, going forward customers can opt to buy NVIDIA-Certified systems if they want an extra guarantee on system performance and reliability, as well as opt in to buying support contracts to get access to direct, full-stack technical support from NVIDIA.\nConceptually, the certification program is rather straightforward, due in large part to its hardware requirements. Systems first need to be using NVIDIA\u2019s A100 accelerators, along with Mellanox Ethernet adapters and DPUs. Or in other words, the servers already need to be using NVIDIA silicon where available. OEMs can then submit systems meeting these hardware requirements to NVIDIA, who will test the systems across multiple metrics, including multi-GPU and multi-node DL performance, network performance, storage performance, and security (secure boot/root of trust). Systems that pass these tests can then be labeled as NVIDIA-Certified.\n\nThose certified systems, in turn, are eligible for additional full-stack technical support through NVIDIA and the OEM. Customers can opt to buy multi-year support contracts, which entitles them to support through the OEM and NVIDIA. NVIDIA essentially assumes responsibility for all software support above the OS, including their hardware drivers, CUDA, their wide collection of frameworks and libraries, and even major open source libraries like TensorFlow. The latter is what makes NVIDIA\u2019s support proposition particularly valuable, as they\u2019re essentially committing to helping customers with any kind of GPU or deep learning-related software issue.\nOf course, that support won\u2019t come for free: this is where NVIDIA will be making their money. While NVIDIA is not charging OEMs for certification (so there\u2019s no additional certification tax baked into the hardware), support contracts are priced based on the number of GPUs. In one example, NVIDIA has stated that a 3 year support contract for a dual-A100 system would be $4,299, or about $715 per-year per-GPU for support. So one can imagine how quickly this ratchets up for larger 4 and 8 way A100 systems, and then again for multiple nodes.\n\nFor NVIDIA and its OEM partners, the creation of a certification program is a straightforward way to try to further grow the market for deep learning servers, especially for mid-sized businesses. The market for AI hardware has been booming, and NVIDIA wants to keep it that way by making it easier for potential customers to use their wares. NVIDIA already has the top-end of the market covered in this respect with their direct relationships with the hyperscalers \u2013 and by extension their small-cap cloud computing customers \u2013 so a hardware certification program fills the middle tier for organizations that are going to run their own servers, but aren\u2019t going to be a massive customer that gets personalized attention.\nAs for those customers, NVIDIA\u2019s server certification and support programs are designed to eliminate (or at least mitigate) the risks of making significant investments into NVIDIA hardware. That means being able to buy a system where the vendor (in this case the duo of NVIDIA and the OEM) can vouch for the performance of the system, as well as guarantee it will be able to properly run various AI packages, such as NVIDIA\u2019s NGC catalog of GPU-optimized and containerized software.\n\nAltogether, NVIDIA is launching with 14 certified systems, with the promise of more certified systems to come. For the first wave of systems, participating OEMs include Dell, Gigabyte, HPE, Inspur, and Supermicro, all of whom are frequently participants in new NVIDIA server initiatives.\nWith all that said, NVIDIA\u2019s server certification program is unlikely to significantly change how things work for most of the company\u2019s customers; but it\u2019s a program that seems primed to address a specific niche for NVIDIA and its OEM partners. For companies that are interested in GPU computing but are looking for a greater degree of support and certainty, this would address those needs. Which, to bring things full circle, it\u2019s exactly by addressing those sorts of needs with ecosystem plays like server certification that NVIDIA has been so successful in the server GPU market over the last decade.\nGallery: NVIDIA-Certified Systems Press Deck\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n9 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nabufrejoval - Tuesday, January 26, 2021 - link\nHmm, from what I understand, traditionally 3rd party vendors had to pay the OEMs to have their hardware certified, e.g. Broadcom would have to pay HP.Since Nvidia needs to pay for the ARM aquisition and their new position on the planet, I'd hazard it's now the OEMs that have to pay up to Nvidia so they are permitted a slice of the ML cake.Either way the buck will be passed on to the end user eventually.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Tuesday, January 26, 2021 - link\nNVIDIA isn't having its hardware certified. NVIDIA is certifying that the hardware works with its software libraries the way it is intended to. People looking to buy these certified systems are people who are presumably looking to use the NVIDIA software stack.And yes, of course the buck will be passed on to the end user. It is a service the end user is looking to pay for. The certification is going to be advertised as if it adds value to the server. Whether it does or not, well, that's what IT divisions are paid to figure out, isn't it? NVIDIA is not demanding that all servers be certified. It's optional. NVIDIA is offering a certification program so that the users who want to make sure that things are working correctly can have the certification. And if they buy certified server they can sign up with direct software support from NVIDIA.NVIDIA doesn't need more money to pay for the ARM acquisition. It already has the money.Anytime there's something with NVIDIA on any site there's going to be people in the comments looking to spin a tale of how NVIDIA is fleecing the world with whatever new is going on. It's tiresome.\n\n\n\nnadim.kahwaji - Wednesday, January 27, 2021 - link\nToo bad , is anandtech now only report news concerning GPUs??? Just a small comparison between CPU reviews and everything else including GPUs and you realize the unexplainable  huge gap , hope that CPU reviews quality  will be the norm for all categories including GPUs !!!!!\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Thursday, January 28, 2021 - link\nThere have been at least 7 CPU reviews/tests since the last GPU review/test from what I have seen, and that's only going back to October. I haven't checked to see when the actual last GPU review or test was. (I'm not counting SoC reviews that have both CPU and GPU elements). That despite there being multiple major GPU launches over the past 4 months. If you go to the GPUs tab and click on the 5th page of news from the site you get back to April 27, 2020. If you go to the CPUs tab and click on the 5th page of news you get to July 20, 2020. If you click on the 10th page for each, for GPUs you get to July 16, 2019 and for CPUs you get to December 13, 2019. I'm really not sure what you're talking about. \n\n\n\nGreenReaper - Sunday, January 31, 2021 - link\nNVIDIA has wares... if you have coin.

Reflected the continued progression of the Ampere architecture into smaller and cheaper video cards as NVIDIA continues its product stack rollout, the RTX 3060 marks the introduction of Ampere into their popular mainstream-enthusiast 60-series video card tier. Long the backbone of NVIDIA\u2019s desktop sales in North America and elsewhere, the 60-tier cards typically strike a solid balance between price and performance. And with prices set to start at $329, at launch the RTX 3060 will become the cheapest RTX card that NVIDIA has ever offered.\nOnce it\u2019s launched next month, the GeForce RTX 3060 will mark the next step in the progression of NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-based desktop cards. Though the company already launched the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti last month \u2013 using a cut-down GA104 GPU \u2013 the RTX 3060 is the real McCoy in terms of being a 60-tier card. It\u2019ll be the cheapest that NVIDIA has ever launched an RTX series card, and it will be the card that they hope will entice owners of GTX 1060 series cards, one of NVIDIA\u2019s most successful card series of all times, to finally upgrade to an RTX card.\nThe release of the RTX 3060 comes on the heels of what was a fragmented product lineup in the last generation. Owing in large part to the significant die space requirements for NVIDIA\u2019s RTX family of features \u2013 ray tracing, tensor cores, etc \u2013 NVIDIA bifurcated their lineup at the 60 level. At $349 we had the RTX 2060, which was a decent card, but not especially impressive on a price/performance basis. Alternative, the GTX 1660 series of cards offered much better pricing for only a small drop in performance, but these cards lacked the hardware RTX features that are now becoming a baseline as part of the DirectX 12 Ultimate specification.\nAs a result, NVIDIA is undertaking a reintegration of sorts with its GeForce lineup. While we don\u2019t have any direct visibility into what comes after the RTX 3060, the smaller die sizes afforded by Samsung\u2019s 8nm process mean that NVIDIA isn\u2019t facing the same pressure to bifurcate. So for the moment, at least, the RTX 3060 is taking the mantle as the true successor to NVIDIA\u2019s 60-tier of video cards. And with that comes the need to please both performance and budget enthusiasts, a tall order for a card that is set to start at $329.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3060\nRTX 3060 Ti\nRTX 2060\nGTX 1060\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n3584\n4864\n1920\n1280\n\n\nROPs\n64?\n80\n48\n48\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.78GHz\n1.665GHz\n1.68GHz\n1.709GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14Gbps?

But at a high level, NVIDIA is confirming that the GeForce RTX 3060 is based on a new NVIDIA GPU, which following their\u2019s usual product cascade is GA106. It does not appear that this is a fully-enabled GA106 part \u2013 the RTX 3060 Laptop GPU offers slightly better specs \u2013 but for the moment we don\u2019t know what a fully-enabled GA106 might look like.\nIn any case, the RTX 3060 as it\u2019s shipping will come with 28 SMs enabled, for a total of 3584 FP32 CUDA cores. Everything else in Ampere should be in proportion to NVIDIA\u2019s usual layout, so this means there will also be 112 TMUs, 112 tensor cores, and 28 RT cores. Meanwhile, as NVIDIA has bound the number of ROPs to the SMs (or rather, the GPCs that encompass them), it\u2019s not clear right now how many ROPs the card will offer, but 64 or a good fraction thereof is a good bet at this point. The card itself will ship with a base clockspeed of 1.32GHz, and a rated boost clock of 1.78GHz.\nOn paper, this means the RTX 3060 will offer around 80% of the RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s shader and texture performance, with the card\u2019s relatively high boost clock helping to make up for the overall lack of SMs. Meanwhile the impact to ROP performance remains to be seen.\nOn the memory side of matters, GA106 introduces a smaller 192-bit memory bus, which is comprised of six 32-bit memory controllers. This is standard fare for 60-tier cards, and does come with some trade-offs, mainly in terms of memory capacity. At three-quarters the size of the bus on the likes of the RTX 3070, NVIDIA normally opts to include three-quarters the memory, which would have been 6GB. However as a 6GB card is looking kind of long in the tooth when game consoles have 16GB of total memory, likely impacting the card\u2019s long-term performance prospects, NVIDIA has decided to finally bite the bullet and make the jump to 12GB of VRAM on their mid-tier video cards. The net result is that there\u2019s currently an odd progression/regression in the GeForce RTX 30 lineup \u2013 going from 12GB down to 8GB and then back up to 10GB on the RTX 3080 \u2013 but at the end of the day it ensures the RTX 3060 ships with enough VRAM to be useful for years to come.\nOn this memory bus NVIDIA is placing GDDR6 memory, which is what they\u2019ve done for all of the cards below the RTX 3080. NVIDIA\u2019s official specifications don\u2019t spell out what speed grade of GDDR6 is being used here, but going by the many (many) vendor RTX 3060 card announcements in my inbox, I\u2019ve seen cards with memory as slow as 14Gbps GDDR6, which is consistent with what NVIDIA did for the RTX 3060 Ti as well. In that case, it gives the RTX 3060 a total memory bandwidth of 336GB/second.\nWith lower performance and memory amounts, TDP is also dropping accordingly relative to the higher-end RTX 30 series cards. NVIDIA is rating the RTX 3060 at 170 Watts, which is 30W below the RTX 3060 Ti, and making this the first RTX 30 series card with a sub-200W TDP. However, much like the other RTX 30 series cards, TDPs are rising on a generational basis. Whereas the GTX 1060 was a 120W card and the RTX 2060 a 160W card, RTX 3060\u2019s 170W TDP is a further 10W higher. If nothing else, this is consistent with what NVIIDA has done with this entire generation of cards.\nPartner Cards & Product Positioning\nWhile NVIDIA has kept things relatively low key for today\u2019s unveil since the card is still several weeks from shipping, there hasn\u2019t been any word from NVIDIA that they\u2019ll be shipping a Founders Edition of the card. So the RTX 3060 looks to be the first Ampere card that\u2019s getting a purely virtual hardware launch, with NVIDIA\u2019s AIB partners providing custom designs right out of the gate.\nConsequently, specific power figures and display I/O options look like they\u2019ll vary some. But at the end of the day, most cards should offer 3 DisplayPorts and an HDMI part, or a similar configuration. Meanwhile, expect to see plenty of factory overclocked cards, as AIB vendors will look to further stratify their RTX 3060 cards into multiple tiers between $329 and the $399 RTX 3060 Ti.\n\nThe sole slide of partner cards that NVIDIA has posted says a lot of what to expect from partner card designs: lots and lots of dual and triple fan open air coolers. For better or worse, this is the tried and true cooler method for mid-range cards, and the board partners are apt to recycle proven designs \u2013 especially if they\u2019re pin-compatible.\n\nAs always, NVIDIA is targeting an N + 2 upgrade cycle with these latest cards, meaning that the company is particularly pitching them as an upgrade for Pascal (GTX 10 series) owners. Along with the significant feature differences afforded by two generations of improvements \u2013 things like RT cores and tensor cores, HDMI 2.1 ports and AV1 decoders \u2013 there should also be a sizable performance advantage for the newer cards. Though for NVIDIA\u2019s own figures they\u2019ve opted to focus in part on features, only posting a couple of benchmark results without DLSS/RT enabled. Still, the roughly 2x performance gain is right around what we\u2019d expect over the GTX 1060, given what we\u2019ve seen from the earlier Ampere cards.\nThe bigger challenge for NVIDIA is likely to be enticing those Pascal owners to upgrade in light of the higher prices that all of the RTX cards over the last two generations have fetched. The baseline GTX 1060 6GB hit the market at $249 a bit over 4 years ago, so $329 for its Ampere-based successor is a stiff price increase. Mind you, all of the RTX 30 series cards have faced a similar challenge, but it\u2019s really once we get to 60-tier cards that NVIDIA\u2019s regular customer base becomes increasingly focused on perf-per-dollar.\nPragmatically speaking, given what we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, NVIDIA shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble there. The RTX 3060 Ti flew off the shelves at $399, and as it\u2019s even cheaper, the RTX 3060 will probably fly off the shelves even faster. In fact, keeping the card on shelves (and at MSRPs) is likely to be NVIDIA\u2019s biggest problem for the next quarter. Computer hardware shortages remain a fact of life across the industry, and that\u2019s especially the case for the latest-generation video cards. With plenty of gamers looking to upgrade, and the specter of cryptocurrency mining overshadowing the entire GPU landscape, fast GPUs remain hard to come by. Which for NVIDIA and its partners mean they\u2019ll be able to move everything they can make, but it means gamers will want to remain on their toes if they hope to get a video card.\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 will be launching in late February. We\u2019ll have more news as NVIDIA sets a release date and its partners announce the rest of their RTX 3060 series launch cards.\n\n\n\nQ1 2021 GPU MSRP Pricing Comparison\n\n\nAMD\nPrice\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\u00a0\n$1499\nGeForce RTX 3090\n\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\n$999\n\u00a0\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\n$649/$699\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n$579\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$499\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n\nRadeon RX 5700 XT\n$399\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n\n\n\u00a0\n$329\nGeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n39 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nXacTactX - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nI understand this GPU has a 192 bit bus so nVidia has to choose between 6GB or 12GB of VRAM, but putting 12GB on this card seems like overkill and it seems mismatched. The 3080 is a $700 product with 10GB of memory, the 3070 is a $500 product with 8GB of memory, and this is a $330 product with 12GB of memory. Either the higher end parts need more memory or this one has too much, IDK. 8GB would have been a good fit IMO\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nIt has too much. But it's cheaper to have too much than to have too many memory controllers. Not only this GPU will use the die, a decision to have more memory controllers would also add cost to any GPU that uses the same die, which will likely include the 1050 Ti and maybe the 1050.\n\n\n\nSamus - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nTrue, the extra 6 GB memory is like $20, whereas more silicone, complex PCB, additional power requirements and still needing some more memory (ie, 2GB to make 8GB like the Ti) would cost much more. It would also probably compete too closely to the Ti in performance too, especially if overclocked.\n\n\n\nOperandi - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\n12GB is the right amount for the long term viability given the options of 6GB being too small and 8GB not fitting the memory controller design.  This is the first Nvidia card this generation aside from the 3090 with the right amount of VRAM, the 3080 and 3070 are both way under equipped.\n\n\n\nim.thatoneguy - Thursday, January 14, 2021 - link\nThis is the correct answer. It's not that this has too much, it's that 8GB was embarrassingly too little.  They need to refresh the 3080 with a 20GB Ti ASAP.  \n\n\n\nfcth - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nIt only looks out of place because Nvidia skimped on memory on their higher end cards. Maybe GDDR6X really is so expensive that the couldn't reasonably do it on the 3090/3080, but there's really no reason they couldn't have done a 16GB 3070, at least as an option, given current memory prices (except perhaps not wanting to upstage their top level cards). \n\n\n\nKjella - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nThe double capacity GDDR6X to create a 20GB RTX 3080 doesn't exist yet, it's coming later this year. They only way the 3090 has 24GB is by using over twice as many memory chips. They could have made 16GB versions of the 3060 Ti/3070 though but didn't. \n\n\n\nlemurbutton - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nIt's comical that the 3080 has 10GB and the 3070 has 8GB but the 3060 has 12GB. Yea, I get it. It has to do with the type of memory used. But it's still comical.You have to believe that Nvidia will update the base 3080/3070 soon with 16GB of RAM.\n\n\n\nDribble - Wednesday, January 13, 2021 - link\nIt might signal a shift from using 1GB to 2GB chips so we start to see double the memory in all new cards going from 8GB on a 3050 to 20GB on a 3080Ti.\n\n\n\nSivar - Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - link\nWhen does nVidia launch the 3080 and 3090?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

The newest titles and the greatest classics. FPS, RPG, grand strategy, squad-based tactics, single-player, multiplayer, MMO \u2014 you name it, we love it.\nThere are more than 800 games on GeForce NOW \u2014 including 80 of the biggest free-to-play games \u2014 streaming straight from the cloud. And thanks to the explosive growth of PC gaming in recent years, there are more games to play than ever.\nFun fact: those games often launch on Thursdays, right alongside our client and backend updates. That makes Thursday our favorite day of the week. So let\u2019s formalize it, right?\nThis is GFN Thursday \u2014 our weekly celebration of the newest games, features and news, streaming from the cloud to you.\nThis week\u2019s a doozy, too. But before we get into the games, let\u2019s set the stage and answer a few questions.\nWhat is GFN Thursday?\nGFN Thursday is our ongoing commitment to bringing great PC games and service updates to our members each week. Come back every Thursday to discover what\u2019s new in the cloud, including games, exclusive features, and news on GeForce NOW.\nWhy Thursdays?\nBecause Mondays are boring? Seriously, over the course of the past year, many of our most played games either launched or released major season updates on Thursdays \u2014 and we aim to support these launches as soon after their release as possible.\nMany of the top free-to-play games, from Fortnite to Apex Legends, Destiny 2 and more, also release major season updates for Thursdays. We\u2019re committed to supporting each new content release the moment it\u2019s available, with updates rolling out to members across all our data centers, in all of our regions as quickly as possible.\nOur members love to learn what\u2019s coming each week to the GeForce NOW library and plan their gaming for the weekend. We do, too. With GFN Thursday updates every week, you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s ready to play across your devices, even if you\u2019re away from your gaming rig.\nWhat if I want to know what games are coming in the future?\nOkay, then the first GFN Thursday of each month is for you. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll share the games we anticipate adding to GeForce NOW throughout that month.\nThis list may not be every game that releases in a month, however. Things move fast, and we know there will be surprises. In January alone, we shared 23 games coming to GeForce NOW, with HITMAN 3 and Everspace 2 being late-breaking additions we were also able to welcome this month.\nGames will continue to be added every week, but that first GFN Thursday of the month will give you a glimpse at what to expect. That way you can shop with confidence, knowing what\u2019s to come.\nOkay, so what\u2019s happening this GFN Thursday?\nFinally, let\u2019s get to the good stuff. The complete list of games joining GeForce NOW this week can be found below, but here are a few highlights:\n\nThe Medium (Steam & Epic Games Store)\nFounders can play with RTX ON and discover a dark mystery only a medium can solve. Travel to an abandoned communist resort and use your psychic abilities to uncover its deeply disturbing secrets, solve dual-reality puzzles, survive encounters with sinister spirits and explore two realities at the same time.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising Demo (Ubisoft Connect & Epic Games Store)\nIn this free demo from Ubisoft, play as Fenyx, a new winged demigod, on a quest to save the Greek gods and their home from a dark curse. Take on mythological beasts, master the legendary powers of the gods and defeat Typhon, the deadliest Titan in Greek mythology, in an epic fight for the ages.\nMembers with the full game and Season Pass can also play the new Immortals Fenyx Rising DLC, A New God, on Jan. 28.\n\nDyson Sphere Program (Steam)\nBuild the most efficient intergalactic factory in this space simulation strategy game. Harness the power of stars, collect resources, plan and design production lines and develop your interstellar factory from a small space workshop to a galaxy-wide industrial empire.\nHere\u2019s the full list for Jan. 28. What are you looking forward to playing? Let us know below.\nWe\u2019ll see you next week for a very exciting one-year anniversary edition of GFN Thursday!\n\nThe Medium (Steam, Epic Games Store)\nImmortals Fenyx Rising Demo (Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Store)\nBeholder (Steam)\nCaves of Qud (Steam)\nDyson Sphere Program (Steam)\nKathy Rain (Steam)\nNeon Abyss (Epic Games Store)\nGods Will Fall (launching Friday on Steam, Epic Games Store)\n\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In addition, the new Game Ready driver is a required update for anyone wanting to use the newly-unveiled NVIDIA Freestyle, and our new NVIDIA Ansel enhancements. To download and install, simply fire up GeForce Experience and click the \"Drivers\" tab.\n\nGame Ready For Fortnite\n\nEpic's Fortnite is a game of two halves: the first features a PvE co-op campaign for gamers who love building massive forts and playing cooperatively; and the second is all about PvP, putting 100 players in a Battle Royale fight to the death.\n\nOn January 10th, a Fortnite update will add our ShadowPlay Highlights technology to the Battle Royale PvP mode, ensuring every kill, death, and Victory Royale moment is captured and saved, and presented for easy sharing at the end of each match.\n\nTo activate ShadowPlay Highlights in Fortnite Battle Royale, you\u2019ll need to update to the Fortnite ShadowPlay Highlights patch on January 10th, and have GeForce Experience 3.12 and our new Game Ready driver installed. Once everything\u2019s ready, launch Fortnite and select Battle Royale. GeForce Experience will ask if you wish to enable ShadowPlay Highlights - after you click \"Yes\", Highlights will automatically be recorded without any further input.\nAt the end of your match, select the \u201cHighlights\u201d button on your lower right. This will showcase the Highlights captured, and from this screen you can select which Highlights to save to your Gallery, and which to share immediately to Facebook or YouTube.\nFor further details check out our Fortnite ShadowPlay Highlights announcement article.\n\nIntroducing New Ways To Customize, Capture and Share Your Gameplay\n\nAt CES 2018, the year's biggest tech show, we've announced new ways to customize, capture and share your gameplay using GeForce Experience. The most exciting of these is NVIDIA Freestyle, which enables you to apply real-time post-processing filters that change the look and feel of supported games.\n\nUsing Freestyle you can make subtle changes that make game elements easier to see, or completely change a game's appearance to meet your personal preferences. Learn more in our NVIDIA Freestyle announcement.\nWe also announced new enhancements for NVIDIA Ansel, which enable you to add even more customizations to game photos captured with Ansel in supported games. Learn more here.\n\nTo use these features in supported games, download and install the latest version of GeForce Experience, and today's new Game Ready driver. For further details, check out our CES announcement article. And if you're interested in other NVIDIA CES 2018 news, check out our 65\", 4K, 120Hz, G-SYNC, HDR Big Format Gaming Display, and our GeForce NOW PC Cloud Gaming Beta.\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\n\nYou can download the new GeForce Game Ready 390.65 WHQL drivers through GeForce Experience, our free, essential, game and system-enhancing application, which also records and streams gameplay, and grants you access to giveaways.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can better assist you. A list of fixes in this driver for previously-reported issues can be found here.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The platform has a range of capabilities, from differentiating between multiple people, to understanding accents, to parsing through various background noises.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang on Bringing Live Captions to a Meeting Near You \u2013 Ep. 139\nAnd now, Otter.ai, an NVIDIA Inception member, is making live captioning possible on a variety of platforms, including Zoom, Skype and Microsoft Teams. Even Liang\u2019s conversation with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz was captioned in real time over Skype.\nThis new capability has been enthusiastically received by remote workers \u2014 Liang says that Otter.ai has already transcribed tens of millions of meetings.\nLiang envisions even more practical effects of Otter.ai\u2019s live captions. The platform can already identify keywords. Soon he thinks it\u2019ll be recognizing action items, helping manage agendas and providing notifications.\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\nOtter.ai was founded in 2016 and is Liang\u2019s second startup, after Alohar, a company focused on mobile behavior services. Once Alohar was acquired, Liang reflected that he needed better tools to help transcribe and share meetings, inspiring him to found Otter.ai.\nThe company\u2019s AI model was built from scratch. Although Siri and Alexa predate it, Otter.ai needed to comprehend multiple voices that could overlap and vary in accents \u2014 a different, more complex task than understanding and responding to just one voice.\n\nTweetables:\n\u201cThough it\u2019s been growing steadily before COVID, people have been using Otter on their laptop or on iOS or Android devices \u2026 you can use it anywhere.\u201d \u2014 Sam Liang [7:32]\n\u201cOtter is your new meeting assistant.

Our core product, Haystack, is an open-source framework that enables developers to utilize the latest NLP models for semantic search and question answering at scale. Our software as a service (SaaS) platform, Haystack Hub, is used by developers from various industries, including finance, legal, and automotive, to find answers in all kinds of text documents. You can use these answers to improve the search experience, cover the long-tail of chat bot queries, extract structured data from documents, or automate invoicing processes.\nPretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA form the core for this latest type of semantic search and many other NLP applications. Although plenty of English models are available, the availability for other languages and more industry-specific terms (such as finance or automotive) is usually very limited and often complicates applications in the industry. Therefore, we regularly train language models for languages not covered by existing models (such as German BERT and German ELECTRA), models for special domains (such as finance and aerospace), or even models for client-specific jargon.\nChallenge\nPretraining language models from scratch typically involves two major challenges: cost and development effort.\nTraining a language model is an extremely compute-intensive task and requires multiple GPUs running for multiple days. To give you a rough idea, training the original RoBERTa model took about 1 day on 1024 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\nComputation costs aren\u2019t the only thing that can stress your budget. A considerable amount of manual development is required to create the training data and vocabulary, configure hyperparameters, start and monitor training jobs, and run periodical evaluation of different model checkpoints. In our first training runs, we also found several bugs only after multiple hours of training, resulting in a slow development cycle. In summary, language model training can be a painful job for a developer and easily consumes multiple days of work.\nSolution\nIn a collaborative effort, AWS, NVIDIA, and deepset were able to complete training 3.9 times faster while lowering cost by 12.8 times and reducing developer effort from days to hours. We optimized the GPU utilization during training via PyTorch\u2019s DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and enabled larger batch sizes by switching to Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Furthermore, we introduced a StreamingDataSilo that allows us to load the training data lazily from disk and to do the preprocessing on the fly, leading to a lower memory footprint and no initial preprocessing time. Last but not least, we integrated the training with Amazon SageMaker to reduce manual development effort and benefit from around a 70% cost reduction by using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this post, we explore each of these technologies and their impact on improving BERT training performance.\u00a0\nDistributedDataParallel\nDistributedDataParallel (DDP) implements distributed data parallelism in PyTorch. This is a key module that\u2019s essential for running training jobs at scale, on multiple machines or on multiple GPUs in a single machine. DDP parallelizes a given network module by splitting the input across specified devices (GPUs). The input is split in the batch dimension. The network module is replicated on each device, and each such replica handles a slice of the input. The gradients from each device are averaged during a backward pass. DDP is used in conjunction with the torch.distributed framework, which handles all communication and synchronization in distributed training jobs with PyTorch.\nBefore DDP was introduced, torch.nn.DataParallel (DP) was the standard module for doing single-machine multi-GPU training in PyTorch. The system in DP works as follows:\n\nThe entire batch of input is loaded on the main thread.\nThe batch is split and scattered across all the GPUs in the network.\nEach GPU runs the forward pass on its batch, split on a separate thread.\nThe network outputs are gathered on the master GPU, the loss value is computed, and this loss value is then scattered across the other GPUs.\nEach GPU uses the loss value to run a backward pass and compute the gradients.\nThe gradients are reduced on the master GPU and the model parameters on the master GPU are updated. This completes one iteration of training.\nTo ensure all GPUs have the latest model parameters, they are broadcasted to the other GPUs at the start of the next iteration.\n\nThis design of DP has several inefficiencies:\n\nUneven GPU utilization \u2013 Only the primary GPU handles loss calculation, gradient reduction, and parameter updates, which leads to higher GPU memory consumption compared to the rest of the GPUs\nUnnecessary broadcast at the beginning of each iteration \u2013 Because the model parameters are only updated in the master GPU, they need to be broadcast to the other GPUs before every iteration\nUnnecessary gathering step \u2013 There is an unnecessary gathering step of model outputs on the GPU\nRedundant data copies \u2013 Data is first copied to the master GPU, which is then split and copied over to the other GPUs\nMultithreading overhead \u2013 Performance overhead caused by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) of the Python interpreter\n\nDDP eliminates all such inefficiencies of DP. DDP uses a multiprocessing architecture, unlike the multithreaded one in DP. This means each GPU has its own dedicated process which runs independently and there is no master GPU anymore. Each process starts by loading its own split of data from the disk. Then the forward pass and loss computation is run independently on each GPU. This eliminates the need for gathering network outputs. During the backward pass, the gradients are AllReduced across the GPUs. Averaging the gradients with AllReduce ensures that the gradients in each GPU are identical. As a result, the model updates in each GPU are identical as well, which eliminates the need for parameter broadcast at the start of the next iteration.\nResults with DDP\nWith DP, the GPU memory utilization was skewed towards the master GPU, which consumed 15 GB, whereas all other GPUs consumed 6 GB. With DDP, the memory consumption was split equally across 4 GPUs, or about 9 GB on each. This also allowed us to increase the per GPU batch size, which further contributed to the speedup in throughput. We reduced the number of gradient accumulation steps to keep the effective batch size constant, to ensure that there was no impact in convergence.\nThe following table shows the results on a P3.8xlarge instance with 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. With DDP, the training time reduced from 616 hours to 347 hours.\n\n\n\nRun\nBatch Size\nAccumulation Steps\nEffective Batch Size\nThroughput (Effective Batches per Hour)\nTotal Estimated Training Time (Hours)\n\n\nBERT Training with DP\n105\n9\n945\n811\n616\n\n\nBERT Training with DDP\n240\n4\n960\n1415\n347\n\n\n\nThe following screenshots show the GPU performance profiles captured by the NVIDIA Nsight Systems. The first screenshot shows the profile while running with DP. Light blue bars in the box marked as \u201cGPU Utilization\u201d show if GPUs are busy. Gaps between the blue areas show that the GPU utilization is zero. The red blocks in between are CPU to GPU memory copy operations. An additional blue block is between the memory copies, which is the aggregation operation that is computed on a single GPU.\n\nThe following screenshot shows high GPU utilization with DDP, which effectively deprecates all those inefficiencies.\n\nTraining with Automatic Mixed Precision\nAutomatic Mixed Precision (AMP) speeds up deep learning training with minimal impact to final accuracy. Traditionally, 32-bit precision floating point (FP32) variables are commonly used in deep learning training. You can improve speed of training with 16-bit precision floating point (FP16) variables because it requires lower storage and less memory bandwidth. However, training with lower precision could decrease the accuracy of the results. Mixed precision training is a balanced approach to achieve the computational speed up of lower precision training while maintaining accuracy close to FP32 precision training. Training with mixed precision provides additional speedup by using NVIDIA Tensor Cores, which are specialized hardware available on NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated computation.\nTo maintain accuracy, training with mixed precision involves the following steps:\n\nPort the model to use the FP16 datatype where appropriate.\nHandle specific functions or operations that must be done in FP32 to maintain accuracy.\nAdd loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.\n\nThe AMP feature handles all these steps for deep learning training. As of this writing, all popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Apache MXNet support AMP.\nAMP in PyTorch was supported via the NVIDIA APEX library. AMP support has recently been moved to PyTorch core with the 1.6 release.\nAMP in APEX library provides four levels of optimization for different application usage. Optimization levels O1 and O2 are both mixed precision modes with slight differences, where O1 is the recommended way for typical use cases and 02 is more aggressively converting most layers into FP16 mode. O0 and O4 opt levels are actually the FP32 mode and FP16 mode designed for reference only.\nThe following table shows the impact of applying AMP along with DDP. Without AMP, batch size up to 240 could be run on the GPU. With AMP, the larger batch size of 320 could be supported, reducing the total training time from 347 hours to 223 hours\n\n\n\nRun\nBatch Size\nAccumulation Steps\nEffective Batch Size\nThroughput (Effective Batches per Hour)\nTotal Estimated Training Time (Hours)\n\n\nBERT Training with DDP\n240\n4\n960\n1415\n347\n\n\nBERT Training with DDP & AMP 01\n304\n3\n912\n2025\n243\n\n\nBERT Training with DDP & AMP 02\n320\n3\n960\n2210\n223\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, AMP O2 converts more layers into FP16 mode, so we can run DDP and AMP O2 with a larger batch size and get a better throughput compared to DDP and AMP O1. When selecting between these two opt levels, you should do a validation of the prediction results to make sure AMP O2 meets your accuracy requirements.\nThe following screenshot shows the GPU performance profile after applying DDP but running the deep learning training with FP32 variables. In this profile, we have added custom markers called NVTX markers, which show the time taken for each epoch, each step, and the time for the forward and backward pass.\n\u00a0\nThe following screenshot shows the profile after enabling AMP with opt level O2. The time to run a forward and backward pass reduced significantly even though we increased the batch size for training when using AMP.\n\nEarlier, we mentioned that AMP utilizes Tensor Cores available on NVIDIA GPU hardware for significant speedup for deep learning training. GPU performance profiles show when operations are utilizing Tensor Cores. The following screenshot shows a sample GPU kernel that is run in FP32 mode. The GPU operation is marked here as the volta_sgemm kernel.\n\nThe following screenshot shows similar operations run in FP16 mode, which utilizes Tensor Cores. Kernels running with Tensor Cores are marked as volta_fp16_s884gemm.\n \nData pipeline\nThe datasets used for training language models typically contain 10\u2013200 GB of raw text data. Loading the whole dataset in RAM can be challenging. Furthermore, the typical pipeline of first running the preprocessing for all data and then pulling batches during training isn\u2019t optimal because the up-front preprocessing can take multiple hours in which we don\u2019t utilize the GPUs on the server.\nTherefore, we introduced a StreamingDataSilo, which loads data lazily from disk just in time when it\u2019s needed in the training loop. The whole preprocessing happens on the fly. Our implementation builds upon PyTorch\u2019s IterableDataset and DistributedSampler, but requires some custom parts to ensure enough preprocessed batches are always in the queue for our trainer, so that the GPU never has to wait for the next batch to be ready. For implementation steps, see the GitHub repo. Together with an increased number of workers to fill the queue, we ended up with another 28% throughput improvement, as shown in the following table.\n\n\n\nRun\nBatch Size\nAccumulation Steps\nEffective Batch Size\nThroughput (Effective Batches per Hour)\nTotal Estimated Training Time (Hours)\n\n\nDDP with 8 workers\n320\n3\n960\n2210\n223\n\n\nDDP with 16 workers\n320\n3\n960\n3077\n160\n\n\n\nA second tricky case that we had to handle was related to the unknown number of batches in our dataset and the distributed training via DDP. If the batches in your dataset can\u2019t be evenly distributed across the number of workers, some workers don\u2019t get any batches in the last step of the epoch while others do. This asynchronicity can crash your whole training run or result in a deadlock (for a related PyTorch issue, see [RFC] Join-based API to support uneven inputs in DDP). We handled this by adding a small synchronization step where all workers communicate if they still have data left. For implementation details, see the GitHub repo.\nSpot Instances\nBesides reducing the total training time, using EC2 Spot Instances is another compelling approach to reduce training costs. This is pretty straightforward to configure in SageMaker; just set the parameter EnableManagedSpotTraining to True when launching your training job. SageMaker launches your training job and saves checkpoints periodically. When your Spot Instance ends, SageMaker takes care of spinning up a new instance and loading the latest checkpoint to continue training from there.\nIn your code, you need to make sure to save regular checkpoints containing the states of all the objects that are relevant for your training session. This includes not only your model weights, but also the states of your optimizer, the data loader, and all random number generators to replicate the results from your continuous runs without Spot Instances. For implementation details, see the GitHub repo.\nIn our test runs, we achieved around 70% cost savings in comparison to regular On-Demand Instances.\nConclusion\nLanguage models have become the backbone of modern NLP. Although using existing public models works well in many cases, many domains with special languages can benefit from training a new model from scratch. Having a fast, simple, and cheap training pipeline is essential for these big training jobs. In addition, the increased efficiency of training jobs reduces our energy usage and lowers our carbon footprint. By tackling different areas of FARM\u2019s training pipeline, we were able to significantly optimize the resource utilization. In the end, we were able to achieve a speedup in training time of 3.9 times faster, a 12.8 times reduction in training cost, and reduced the developer effort required from days to hours.\nIf you\u2019re interested in training your own BERT model, you can look at the open-source code in FARM or try our free SageMaker algorithm on the AWS Marketplace.\n\nAbout the Authors\nAbhinav Sharma\u00a0is a Software Engineer at AWS Deep Learning.

It\u2019s also capable of earning you $4.22 USD in profit per day from\u00a0mining cryptocurrency such as Ethereum.\n\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal, because at $399 MSRP, a miner\u2019s ROI (return on investment) for the RTX 3060 Ti is roughly 100 days.\n\nYep, it\u2019s 2017 all over again as potential profits from GPU-powered mining reach record highs alongside a booming interest in Bitcoin. And PC gamers are not remotely impressed.\nEstimated mining profit for a single RTX 3060 Ti as of January 20, 2021 Jason Evangelho\n\nThat\u2019s\u00a0because the\u00a0existing scarcity\u00a0of Nvidia\u2019s (and AMD\u2019s) current-gen graphics cards is exacerbated by unrelenting demand from miners \u2014 miners who typically buy in bulk. The result has been empty virtual and retail shelves, in addition to\u00a0absurdly inflated\u00a0pricing.\n\nThankfully, two new crypto-specific products spotted\u00a0by WCCFTech\u00a0are allegedly being prepped to (hopefully) alleviate the problem.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThose products are \u201cheadless\u201d GPUs from Nvidia board partner MSI: a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti MINER 8G as well as an overclocked version. The crucial difference between these cards and typical gaming cards advertised by Nvidia is that miner cards lack video outputs.\n\nMiners rarely need displays attached to their systems. They usually plug multiple GPUs into a rig, boot into a custom\u00a0Linux\u00a0OS like NiceHash OS or HiveOS, and manage everything through a web dashboard.\n\n\nBeyond that, cryptocurrency mining is all about compute performance. So even if certain components of a GPU like hardware video encoders come out defective during the binning process, it\u2019s not a loss for the manufacturer.\nInstead of trashing them, sell them to the miners.Interesting in both Ethereum and Bitcoin are climbing dramatically since December 2020Jason Evangelho\nIt\u2019s no surprise that MSI is considering this move. Nvidia itself is weighing the pros and cons of launching its own\u00a0dedicated mining cards\u00a0for the RTX 30 series.\nGlobal interest in Ethereum\u00a0has increased dramatically in the past 4 weeks following a meteoric rise in the value of Bitcoin, which tends to lift other cryptocurrencies in its wake.\nIf companies like Nvidia, MSI and other GPU manufacturers such as Asus and Gigabyte can quickly bring crypto mining cards to market, they\u2019re all but guaranteed to be eagerly swallowed up by small home operations and massive farms alike.\nThen, maybe PC enthusiasts looking for the latest and greatest hardware will have a stronger chance at getting their game on.\nBut the clock is ticking on Ethereum mining. At some point in the not-too-distant future, it will move from Proof-of-work to\u00a0Proof-of-stake, literally eliminating the need for Ethereum mining altogether.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.
