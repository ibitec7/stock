He said the high-speed transportation system could first appear in India or Saudi Arabia, even before the UAE.  Up to speed: Hyperloop offers affordable, fast, friction-free conveyance for people and goods  In case you are not aware, Dubai Expo 2020 is a six-month-long world expo being hosted by Dubai this year from October 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. Hyperloop is described as an affordable mode of high-speed transportation. It works as a system of sealed tubes with low air pressure through which passenger and cargo pods may travel devoid of wind resistance and friction.  Prophecy: Hyperloop offers 'speed of an airplane, price of a truck'  Speaking on the time scales for the Virgin Hyperloop, Sulayem said, \"I will see it either in India at first, or in Saudi Arabia at the moment.\" \"Our hope is that when we achieve economies of scale and you have long routes and it is popular, probably for the speed of an airplane you will pay with the price of a truck,\" he added.  Details: Sulayem's DP World holds majority stake in Virgin Hyperloop  Sulayem made the bold claim since DP World, the company he heads, holds a majority stake in Virgin Hyperloop. Interestingly, Virgin Hyperloop is possibly the most well-known of the several other players also developing hyperloop technology. In November last year, Virgin Hyperloop even tested human travel in a hyperloop pod for the first time. One such full-scale pod is on display at the Expo.  Coming soon!: It's not decades, it's years: Sulayem  Earlier, DP World said Hyperloop can shrink inventory movement timescales, thereby reducing finished goods inventory and cutting required warehouse space and costs by 25%. Speaking to CNN at the Expo venue, Sulayem said, \"It's not decades, it's years.\" Notably, in February 2018, Richard Branson\u2014the then chairman of Virgin Hyperloop\u2014announced plans for a Navi Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop system but the COVID-19 pandemic foiled those plans.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

At that time Nvidia unveiled four pro mining SKUs, the CMP 30HX, 40HX, 50HX and 90HX, with just the lower-end duo available initially. Now a bigger cryptomining flagship has been spotted for sale at a Dubai-based electronics outlet \u2013 the CMP 170HX \u2013 and it is available to buy at US$4,500 with discounts available for bulk purchases.\n\nKey specs and features of the Nvidia CMP 170HX can be seen in some of the screenshots from Dubai's ViperaTech above and below. You will observe that the CMP 170HX is quite a compact, thoughtful solution for miners with its dual-slow blower style cooler, 250W operation with need of just a single 8-pin power connector and a quoted hash rate of 160MH/s+.\n\nLooking at the CMP 170HX more closely, reveals that it uses the Nvidia Ampere GA100 GPU, a cut-down data centre cast-off with 70 SMs enabled, resulting in 4,480 CUDA cores being operational. This GPU, which also features 280 TMUs and 128 ROPs, runs at between 1,140MHz and a 1,410MHz boost. The CMP170HX also comes with 8GB of HBM2e memory on a 4096-bit bus, for 1.49TB/sec of bandwidth. As these are definitely not designed as display cards, there are no video outputs, and ViperaTech says they don't support DirectX either.\nRemember, the 7nm A100 GPU, was announced back in May 2020 and aimed squarely at AI and HPC computing. You can see previous implementations, as shared by Nvidia, below.\n\nImportantly, the headline hash rate of 160 MH/s+ at >250W offered by the CMP 170HX is highly impressive compared to, say, a GeForce RTX 3090 which can only achieve 110MH/s at 300W or so. In the product pages at ViperaTech you can see an example mining system with eight of these XMP GPUs installed.\n\nAt the time of writing, there appears to be 866 of these Nvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship GPUs in stock. I just refreshed the page after about 30 or 40 minutes and the \"first come, first served\" stock level didn't move (hmmm) but the price has changed to $4,435.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\nNvidia ends support for Windows 7 and 8, as well as Kepler GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 15 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Gabriel Choo   \u00b7 Contributor  6 October 2021 5 min read            Millennial Money: How much should I save, spend and invest every month? (PHOTO: Getty Commercial)  \u00b7 PrathanChorruangsak via Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 No matter what stage of life you are in, you are never too young \u2014 or too old \u2014 to save or to invest money. A whopping 75% of Singaporean youths are more concerned about their finances now as compared to before the pandemic, according to data from a SingSaver survey dated April 2021. But how much exactly should one save, spend and invest every month?  This is part of a series where Yahoo Finance Singapore will focus on different aspects of millennials and finance. In this second part, we speak to several financial experts who share their thoughts on what young adults can do. The 50-30-20 rule Most of the financial experts agreed that youths should follow the well-used 50-30-20 rule popularised by US senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cThe 50-30-20 rule advocates splitting one\u2019s income into three categories \u2013 50% on essentials, 30% on discretionary spending, and 20% on savings or investments,\u201d explained Ernest Cai, Director of Client Success at ProsperUs, a digital investment service. However, Cai cautioned that the 50-30-20 rule serves as a guideline and can always be tweaked to better suit one's profile, given that some youths are still schooling while some might already be working. The general recommendation is to save at least 20% of one\u2019s income every month. But if you cannot start with 20%, starting with 5% or 10% will help too because doing something is better than nothing, added Cai.  In particular, students should be able to save more as they are probably still staying with their parents and getting pocket money from them. \u201cStudents have low basic needs so they can afford to allocate 25% to their needs, 25% to their wants and the remaining half (50%) to savings and investment,\u201d said Ezekiel Chew, Founder and CEO of Asia Forex Mentor, an online trading mentoring service. \u201cIt is important to acknowledge that there will be different needs and wants at every stage of life but the end goal would be to achieve financial freedom,\u201d added Chew. Importance of savings Assuming a student receives an allowance of S$10 a day, and spends half of it (S$5) on needs and wants, he will have a balance of S$5 left for savings and investments. This could easily add up to S$150 a month, which is a good starting amount to save or invest. However, some students that Yahoo Finance Singapore spoke to do not necessarily save that much. University undergraduate Tay Wee Teck, 21, saves only 5% of his internship salary of S$650. He invests 30% of it and spends the rest on his wants. Similarly, fresh graduate Celestee Low, 23, saves 30% of her allowance while spending the other 70%. Low currently receives a small sum of money from her parents every month as she is still looking for a full-time job.   Story continues \u201cWhen I receive my allowance, I would transfer 30% to my savings account off the bat, but if I have money left over at the end of the month, I save that too. I have been hesitant to start investing because I don\u2019t have my own income yet,\u201d shared Low.\u201cI also do my part to be careful with what I spend on, such that I\u2019m never spending above my means and I\u2019m also saving some money.\u201dSome of the financial experts also suggest that youths who are still schooling could work with their parents to explore options of placing their savings in high-yield savings accounts or endowment plans.For young working adults, while the percentage to set aside for savings becomes smaller, the value should be larger because of higher inflows.Assuming a fresh graduate earns S$3,000 a month, he might need to spend 70% of it on basic necessities such as meals, transportation fees and bills. This leaves around S$900 for savings and investments, which is way more as compared to a student.Ironically enough, some have benefitted from working from home during COVID-19. Digital consultant Jason Goh, 26, who earns S$2,800 a month, is usually able to save at least S$1,000 a month. Now in the midst of the pandemic, he saves more than half of his salary.\u201cWorking from home allows me to save more money as I can cut costs from travelling to and from work, as well as on food. This gives me more leeway to invest in other things such as donating to charitable causes,\u201d said Goh.Responsible financial planningUltimately, financial experts believe that the planning of one's monthly income is crucial regardless of one\u2019s age, life stage or salary.\u201cRecording your monthly expenditure is an excellent way to keep track of your monetary outputs as well as actively saving for rainy days purposes,\u201d advised Eng Thiam Choon, CEO of Tiger Brokers Singapore, a brokerage firm.\u201cWhile making purchasing decisions, youths can also consider wisely the purpose of their expenditure to better manage their expenses and not overspend,\u201d added Eng.Similarly, Gregory Van, Founding Partner of Endowus, a Singapore-based financial technology company, shared some key tenets to responsible financial planning.\u201cYouths should be disciplined about their spending and differentiate between needs and wants, especially for larger ticket items,\u201d said Van.\u201cIt is also important to think about short term financial goals and work towards them. For youths, it can be saving for a down payment for their new home or even a holiday overseas.\u201d  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

A bug in a single transistor can prevent a chip from operating correctly, requiring costly revisions to fix.\nToday, verification engineers rely on two very different methods to make sure bugs don\u2019t make it into silicon \u2014 simulation and formal verification.\nThe first approach relies on millions of simulations that search for bugs, exercising corner cases in carefully designed tests.\nFormal verification, Oski\u2019s specialty, is a powerful alternative that uses mathematical analysis of a design instead of simulations to prove that a particular feature behaves correctly for all possible inputs.\nWhereas simulation injects 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s into a design to test whether numbers are added properly, Oski\u2019s approach formally verifies that \u201cc = a + b.\u201d\nA Leading Role in Formal Verification\nIn the semiconductor industry, Oski is well known for its leading edge work in formal verification. Its founder, Vigyan Singhal, also founded Jasper Design Automation. Jasper\u2019s software remains one of the most powerful software tools available for formal verification proofs. However, powerful tools require great expertise to be used successfully.\nIn 2005, Vigyan started Oski with the mission of applying the deep computer science of formal verification. Oski has since grown to become a well-recognized leader in the field and has been a valued partner to NVIDIA for more than 10 years.\nAn Office in a Rising Tech Hub\nOski has offices in San Jose, Budapest and Gurgaon. Most of its employees work in Gurgaon, a city of more than a million people less than 20 miles southeast of New Delhi. Recently renamed Gurugram, it\u2019s the country\u2019s second-largest tech hub, as well as an emerging center of finance and banking.\nIndia is already home to NVIDIA\u2019s largest group of employees outside the U.S., and the new Gurugram office will be NVIDIA\u2019s fourth engineering office in India.\nRaising the Bar for Innovation\nAs NVIDIA\u2019s products have grown in complexity and scope, now spanning markets from gaming and data center computing to networking and autonomous vehicles, the importance of designing perfect first silicon has never been higher. And new autonomous machine applications where safety is the highest goal make verification vital.\nWith this acquisition, we have the opportunity to dramatically increase our investment in and commitment to formal verification strategies to achieve that goal.\nPowerful verification methods directly enable more rapid innovation, and we are very excited to join forces with the Oski team to deliver even more amazing products for years to come.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This capability requires a robust perception software stack that can comprehensively identify and track the vehicle\u2019s surrounding environment.\nStartups worldwide are developing these perception stacks, using the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA DRIVE AGX to deliver highly accurate object detection to autonomous vehicle manufacturers.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform processes data from a range of sensors \u2014 including camera, radar, lidar and ultrasonic \u2014 to help autonomous vehicles perceive the surrounding environment, localize to a map, then plan and execute a safe path forward. This AI supercomputer enables autonomous driving, in-cabin functions and driver monitoring, plus other safety features \u2014 all in a compact package.\nHundreds of automakers, suppliers and startups are building self-driving vehicles on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX, which is why perception stack developers across the globe have chosen to develop their solutions on the AI platform.\nDevelopment From Day One\nNVIDIA DRIVE is the place to start for companies looking to get their perception solutions up and running.\naiMotive, a self-driving startup based out of Hungary, has built a modular software stack, called aiDrive, that delivers comprehensive perception capabilities for automated driving solutions.\nThe company first began building out its solution on a compute platform with NVIDIA DRIVE in 2016. With high-performance, energy-efficient compute, aiDrive can perform perception using mono, stereo and fisheye cameras, as well as fuse data from radar, lidar and other sensors for a flexible and scalable solution.\naiDrive fuses data from vehicle sensors for flexible, scalable perception.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using NVIDIA DRIVE from day one,\u201d said P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs, aiMotive\u2019s senior vice president of aiDrive. \u201cThe platforms work turnkey and support easy cross-target development \u2014 it\u2019s also a technology ecosystem that developers are familiar with.\u201d\nStradvision, a startup based in South Korea, was formed by perception specialists in 2014 to build advanced driver assistance systems at scale. By developing on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX, the company has deployed a robust perception deep neural network for AI-assisted driving platforms.\nStradvision\u2019s robust perception solution operates in poor weather conditions, such as snow.\nThe DNN, known as SVNet, is one of a few networks that meet the accuracy and computational requirements of production vehicles.\nPerformance at Every Level\nEven for lower levels of autonomy, such as ADAS or AI-assisted driving, a robust perception stack is critical for safety.\nPhantomVision uses cameras around the vehicle for complete, 360-degree coverage.\nSilicon Valley startup Phantom AI has leveraged years of automotive and tech industry experience to develop an intelligent perception stack that can predict object motion. The computer vision solution, known as PhantomVision, covers a 360-degree view from the vehicle in a combination of front-, side- and rear-view cameras.\nThe real-time detection and target tracking on the bird\u2019s-eye view provides an accurate motion estimate of road objects. The high-performance processing of DRIVE AGX enables the software to perform live perception functions.\nCalmCar\u2019s perception solution emphasizes safety, with automotive-grade compute at its core.\nWith the mission of creating a safer road environment for all users, Chinese startup CalmCar has built a multi-camera active surround view perception system. With the automotive-grade NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier at its core, CalmCar\u2019s solution enables Level 2+ driving, valet parking and mapping.\nBy developing comprehensive solutions on NVIDIA DRIVE, these startups are delivering accurate and robust perception to AI-assisted and autonomous vehicles around the world.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This is especially likely if the artists were to hail from opposite ends of the world.\nSimilarly, developers across the globe use the same tools to create different AI-based applications, each solving challenges relevant to their local community.\nGive an NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit to an AI enthusiast in San Francisco, for example, and they will create an AI-based app that analyzes yoga poses. With that same tool, developers in the tinyML Kenya community are building AI systems for wildlife monitoring and conservation. Innovation is happening in each place, so long as the developers have access to technologies and enablement tools.\nNVIDIA Emerging Chapters is a new program that enables local communities in emerging areas to build and scale their AI, data science and graphics projects. It provides technological tools, educational resources and co-marketing opportunities for these developers.\nMembers of Emerging Chapters have access to training and development opportunities through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). This includes free passes to take select self- or instructor-led courses on AI and data science. Upon course completion, developers can receive an NVIDIA DLI Certificate to highlight their new skills and help advance their careers.\nSince the program\u2019s launch this year, 30+ African developer community groups \u2014 including seven founded by women \u2014 have joined Emerging Chapters, fostering a growing network of AI experts. The program is now expanding to Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and other emerging markets that are hungry for more AI and related technology.\nReflecting the World\u2019s Diversity\nWith Emerging Chapters, NVIDIA hopes to help mend what\u2019s called the technology fracture \u2014 the gap between developers in the global North and those in emerging markets.\n\u201cThis program is not about charity, it\u2019s about innovation and business,\u201d said Amulya Vishwanath, strategic program lead on NVIDIA\u2019s emerging areas team. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to get communities in emerging areas access to AI technology, which they can then use to make their own, ensuring the developer community is more reflective of the world\u2019s true diversity.\u201d\nBy spurring innovation in collaboration with local communities, the program can cultivate AI solutions that most pertain to grassroot developers and their direct ecosystem, while also democratizing the global AI movement.\n\u201cWith Emerging Chapters, NVIDIA is taking active steps toward positively contributing to the growing trend of technology in emerging markets,\u201d said Michael Young, co-founder of the Python Ghana community. \u201cNVIDIA helped us bring growing AI engineers from across the country together for live, online training sessions with experts.\u201d\nFueling Innovation in Africa\nAfrica is an emerging market in which the AI revolution is underway. African developers are using AI and NVIDIA technology, for example, to maximize crop yields and honor Olympic athletes.\nEarly members of the Emerging Chapters program include DeepLearning.AI Kenya, an education technology company that empowers individuals in the AI workforce; NERD Ethiopia, a youth center that provides a hacker space and educational resources for AI research; and tinyML Kenya, a community of machine learning researchers and practitioners.\n\u201cTinyML Kenya joining NVIDIA Emerging Chapters was such a timely, game-changing move for our community,\u201d said Clinton Oduor, the foundation\u2019s lead organizer. \u201cThe program has allowed our members to meet industry leaders, learn new skills, earn certifications and solve real-world problems.\u201d\nZindi, Africa\u2019s first data science competition platform, is also a member. The organization has an ambassador program made up of data science community leaders from 20+ African countries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to support people doing such excellent work with the help of the Emerging Chapters program,\u201d said Celina Lee, Zindi\u2019s co-founder and CEO.\nAllowing AI Access for All\nTo bolster individuals who seek to work with AI, HPC, graphics and more, NVIDIA offers a range of opportunities including the NVIDIA Developer Program \u2014 which has more than 2.5 million members \u2014 and NVIDIA Inception, which offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for AI and data science startups.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s GTC conference, running Nov. 8-11, will feature a track focused on emerging markets. The conference is virtual, free and has sessions 24/7.\nOver 20,000 developers from emerging markets tuned in to learn about AI innovation at our last GTC \u2014 and the appetite for developer resources is only growing.\nFor more on global AI innovation, register for GTC.\nRead more stories about NVIDIA Emerging Chapters and join the program.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning Institute | Developer Program | GTC | GTC 2021 | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Some games mistakenly use the onboard graphics card instead of the dedicated one, and since the onboard graphics card isn't powerful enough to process games, you're going to end up with very low frames and graphics. That is, if your game doesn't crash first, anyway. \nFortunately, you can manually tell your computer to utilize the dedicated graphics card for specific programs and games. Here's how. \n                        Integrated vs. Dedicated Graphics Cards\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The major difference between integrated and dedicated graphics cards is that integrated GPUs don't have their own processors or RAM. Instead, the integrated graphics card uses the resources from the CPU and the computer RAM. So if you have 8GB of total RAM, and 1GB of shared graphics RAM, that's gonna reduce your available RAM to 7GB. All these handicaps reduce the processing power of an integrated graphics card and make it unsuitable for playing demanding video games.\nA dedicated graphics card, on the other hand, comes with its own processor, RAM, and cooling system. This gives the dedicated graphics card the capacity to run high-end video games smoothly, but also makes the dedicated graphics card bulky, and a lot more expensive in price. If you want to learn more, read our article on what's the difference between integrated and dedicated graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Most modern processors come with an onboard integrated graphics card. So then, if you have a dedicated graphics card along with a modern processor, then you've got two functioning graphics cards. In this case, your computer's software decides when to use each graphics card, to give you better performance or longer battery life.\nSometimes, this software gets confused and uses the wrong graphics card for a program. Now if that program is a high-end video game, and your computer is trying to use the integrated graphics to run and render it, you're going to get terrible performance. The workaround for scenarios like this is to instruct the software to use the dedicated graphics card for that video game, manually.\nRelated: The Best Budget Graphics Cards for Cheap Gaming \n                        How to Set a Video Game to Use the Dedicated Graphics Card\n               \nThe software responsible for switching graphics depends on your dedicated graphics card. If you've got an NVIDIA, then it's going to be NVIDIA Control Panel, but if you've got an AMD then it'll be AMD Radeon Software. We're going to cover the steps for both of these softwares in this article. However, the very first step is to identify the program. \n            1. Identifying the Executable for Your Game\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The executable or .exe file that runs the game is usually obvious as it mostly goes like GAMENAME.exe but sometimes that's not the case. The absolute method to find out what process is responsible for running the game is through the Task Manager. \n\n                                        Launch the video game.\n                        \n\n                                        Once the video game has fully launched, minimize the game. You can do this by pressing Win + D to go to the desktop.\n                        \n\n                                        Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard to bring up Task Manager. Alternatively, you can search for Task Manager in the start menu.\n                        \n\n                                        Find the game process and then right-click on it.\n                        \n\n                                        From the menu, select Open file location.\n                        \n\n                                        A window in Explorer will open to show you the executable file in its location. This is the file that you need to instruct to use the dedicated graphics card.\n                        \n\nRelated: Do You Really Need a Powerful GPU? \n            2. Changing the Settings in NVIDIA Control Panel\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Now that you know what the file is and where it is, you can add it to the control panel for your graphics card and set it to use the dedicated graphics card all the time. As mentioned before, this is done through the NVIDIA Control Panel for NVIDIA graphics cards. \n\n                                        Right-click on your desktop.\n                        \n\n                                        From the menu, select NVIDIA Control Panel. If you're on Windows 11, select Show more options and then select NVIDIA Control Panel.\n                        \n\n                                        Inside NVIDIA Control Panel, from the bar on the left, select Manage 3D settings.\n                        \n\n                                        Click Program Settings.\n                        \n\n                                        Under Select a program to customize, select Add. This will open a limited list of your programs.\n                        \n\n                                        In the Add window, click on Browse.\n                        \n\n                                        Go to the file location you discovered in the previous section and then select the game file.\n                        \n\n                                        Click Open. Now your game will appear on the program list.\n                        \n\n                                        Under Select the preferred graphics processor for this program, select High-performance NVIDIA processor.\n                        \n\n                                        Finally, from the bottom right, click on Apply.\n                        \n\n                                        Your game will now utilize your dedicated graphics card to give you much better performance.\n                        \n\nRelated: How to Update Nvidia Graphics Card Drivers on Windows \n            3. Changing the Settings in AMD Radeon Software\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you've got an AMD graphics card, you'll need to add the game to the AMD Radeon Software and then set it to the Gaming profile there. \n\n                                        Right-click on your desktop.\n                        \n\n                                        From the menu, select AMD Radeon Software. If you're using Windows 11, select Show more options and then select AMD Radeon Software.\n                        \n\n                                        Inside AMD Radeon Software, select the Gaming tab from up top.\n                        \n\n                                        Select the three vertical dots on the right, and then click Add A Game.\n                        \n\n                                        Select the game file and then click Open. This will add the game and take you to its settings page.\n                        \n\n                                        Under Graphics, click on Graphics Profile and then select Gaming.\n                        \n\nThat's it! The next time you launch that video game, it'll be your AMD graphics card doing the hard processing work and earning you more FPS. \n                        Dedicated to Performance\n               \nThough integrated graphics have greatly improved in recent years, with some being able to run demanding games, they're still nowhere as fast as dedicated graphics cards. Now that you've learned to switch to your dedicated graphics card, your games should run smoother and perform better.\nHowever, if even your dedicated graphics card can't handle the games properly, perhaps it's time for a GPU upgrade. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nGraphics Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will enjoy streaming at up to 1440p resolution and 120 frames per second on PCs and Macs, and 4K HDR at 60 FPS on SHIELD TV, with ultra-low latency that rivals many local gaming experiences.\nFounders and Priority members in North America and Western Europe now have early access to preorder GeForce NOW RTX 3080 memberships \u2014 with six-month memberships available for $99.99. Memberships will be limited at launch, and the exclusive preorder window gives our earliest supporters the first opportunity to upgrade to next-generation gaming.\nGFN Thursday means more games for more gamers, and starting today members can stream the wildly popular New World, which is one of nine games joining the GeForce NOW library this week.\nNext-Gen Gaming, Everywhere\nGeForce NOW is the easiest upgrade for gamers who want to transform their low-spec devices into high-performance GeForce gaming rigs. Members play the latest PC games without waiting for downloads, installs, patches or updates.\nThe new GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership delivers an instant upgrade in performance for common hardware \u2014 a 70x increase for the average laptop on Steam, 13x for an M1-based Macbook Air and 7x for the most popular desktop configuration on Steam.\nThe next generation of cloud gaming is powered by the GeForce NOW SuperPOD, built on the second-gen RTX, NVIDIA Ampere architecture.\nThis performance leap is rendered in the cloud. Members connect to gaming servers supercharged with GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO CPUs deliver leadership performance and industry-leading bandwidth.\nTranslation: GeForce NOW RTX 3080 equals warp-speed gaming.\nGeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will have exclusive access to the new servers, streaming at up to 1440p at 120 FPS on PC, 1600p at 120 FPS on most MacBooks, 1440p at 120 FPS on most iMacs, 4K HDR at 60 FPS on NVIDIA SHIELD TV and up to 120 FPS on select Android devices.\nPlay PC games at 1440p and 120 FPS on nearly any laptop with a GeForce NOW RTX 3080 memberships.\nThat means any underpowered PC or laptop \u2014 even with four-year-old integrated graphics \u2014 is instantly transformed into a gaming rig capable of displaying the hottest PC games in 1440p at 120 FPS with a compatible monitor that supports a refresh rate of 120Hz or higher.\nGaming on a Mac? Play at native display resolutions, up to 1440p for most iMacs and 1600p for most MacBooks. With the new MacBook Pro, stream and game natively at 120 FPS with the ProMotion 120Hz displays. Or, connect an external monitor for 120 FPS gaming on any Mac.\nGaming in your living room? SHIELD TV can render and stream PC games at 4K HDR at 60 FPS and 7.1 surround sound, with ultra-low latency that will make console users jealous.\nGoing mobile? Take PC gaming with you at screaming-fast 120 FPS on select 120Hz Android phones, such as the Samsung S21.\nGeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will enjoy faster game rendering and dramatic latency savings on any supported device \u2014 including Chrome, Safari and Edge browsers.\nGeForce NOW RTX 3080 members also have the longest session lengths of all memberships, clocking in at eight hours, and the most control over persistent in-game settings.\nPreorder Today to Be the First to Play\nGeForce NOW members can stream AAA PC games on nearly any device.\nPreorders for the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership are now open for Founders and Priority members, and will be open to all gamers next week, pending availability. Founders and Priority members can access their exclusive preorder opportunity by logging into their GeForce NOW account, clicking \u201cMANAGE,\u201d and selecting the \u201cPREORDER\u201d option under RTX 3080 to begin the checkout flow. Preorders will only be charged when the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership becomes available.\nFounders, exclusively, will receive 10 percent off the subscription price and can upgrade with no risk to their benefits. Founders who decide to upgrade to the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 experience will be eligible to revert back to their original Founders plan and retain their \u201cFounders for Life\u201d pricing, as long as they remain in good standing on any paid membership plan.\nPreorders will begin converting to active memberships in November in North America, and December in Western Europe.\nInformation on rollout timing for GeForce NOW RTX 3080 memberships in GeForce NOW Alliance regions will be made by partners at a later time, on a region-by-region basis.\nMore info can be found in the membership FAQ.\nUpdates for Everyone\nThe latest GeForce NOW client update begins rolling out today. In addition to supporting the new membership preorder, version 2.0.34 brings beta support for Microsoft Edge on PC, giving members yet another way to play their favorite PC games.\nThe update also includes new Adaptive Sync technology, giving all members a smoother gaming experience. This technology synchronizes frame rendering to the local display, reducing stutter for many users by eliminating dropped and repeated frames. It also helps reduce latency to 60ms or less for many gamers joining the new GeForce NOW RTX 3080 tier.\nIt\u2019s Game Time\nThe world of Aeternum is mysterious, dangerous and gorgeous. Forge your destiny at full quality, streaming on GeForce NOW.\nGeForce NOW members have access to 1,000+ games, with more released every GFN Thursday.

For example, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) train perception models to detect pedestrians, road signs, vehicles, traffic lights, and other objects. Identity verification systems for the financial services industry train CV models to verify the authenticity of the person claiming the service with live camera images and official ID documents.\nWith growing data sizes and increasing model complexity, there is a need to address performance bottlenecks within training jobs to reduce costs and turnaround times. Training bottlenecks include storage space and network throughput to move data in addition to updating model gradients, parameters, and checkpoints. Another common bottleneck with deep learning models is under-utilization of expensive GPU resources due to CPU-bound preprocessing bottlenecks.\nCustomers want to identify these bottlenecks with debugging tools and improve preprocessing with optimized libraries and other best practices.\nAmazon SageMaker allows machine learning (ML) practitioners to build, train, and deploy high-quality models with a broad set of purpose-built ML capabilities. These fully managed services take care of the undifferentiated infrastructure heavy lifting involved in ML projects. SageMaker provides innovative open-source training containers for deep learning frameworks like PyTorch (toolkit, SDK), TensorFlow (toolkit, SDK), and Apache MXNet (toolkit, SDK).\nIn a previous post, the author highlights the options for optimizing I/O for GPU performance tuning of deep learning training with SageMaker. In this post, we focus specifically on identifying CPU bottlenecks in a SageMaker training job with SageMaker Debugger and moving data preprocessing operations to GPU with NVIDIA Data Loading library (DALI). We\u2019ve made the sample code used for the benchmarking experiment available on GitHub. The repository uses SageMaker training with two implementations of data preprocessing: NVIDIA DALI on GPU, and PyTorch dataloader on CPU, as illustrated in the following diagram.\n\nCV data preprocessing typically comprises two compute-intensive steps on CPUs\u2014JPEG decoding and use-case specific augmentations. GPUs can perform some operations faster than CPU with tera-floating point operations per second (tFLOPS). But for the GPU to perform such operations, the data must be available in the GPU memory. The utilization of GPUs varies with model complexity, with larger models requiring more GPU resources. The challenge lies in optimizing the steps of the training pipeline so that the GPU doesn\u2019t starve for the data to perform its computations, thereby maximizing overall resource utilization. The ratio between the required data preprocessing load on the CPU and the amount of model computation on the GPU often depends on the use-case. As explained in\u00a0another post, a CPU bottleneck typically occurs when this ratio exceeds the ratio between the overall CPU and GPU compute capacity.\nExperiment overview\nIn this post, we demonstrate an example with a PyTorch CV model to visualize resource bottlenecks with Debugger. We compare and contrast performance gains by offloading data preprocessing to GPU using NVIDIA DALI across three model architectures with increasing augmentation load factors.\nThe following is the complete architecture for the training setup using SageMaker that we use to benchmark the different training job trials.\n\nWe perform the following trials:\n\nTrial A \u2013 We decode JPEG images on CPUs with libjpeg-turbo, which is a built-in PyTorch dataloader library. We perform augmentation operations on CPUs using PyTorch transform operations. We use this as a baseline to compare the training time with Trial B. You can refer to the augmentation_pytorch method in the training script.\nTrial B \u2013 We perform GPU-accelerated JPEG image decoding with nvJPEG, which is a built-in library with NVIDIA DALI. We perform augmentation on GPUs by configuring with NVIDIA DALI Pipeline operations, which is a framework for building optimized preprocessing pipelines for NVIDIA GPU chips. You can refer to the create_dali_pipeline and augmentation_dali methods in the training script.\n\nThe goal is to balance the load between the CPUs and GPUs by moving the compute intensive operations of JPEG decoding and augmentation to the GPU. Because we\u2019re increasing the size of the computation graph that is running on GPUs, we need to make sure that there is enough unused memory for data preprocessing operations. You can do this with a smaller training batch size.\nFor both trials, we use the full-size version of imagenette2 dataset (1.3 GB), which has 13,395 JPEGs with an average size of 144 KB. We run SageMaker training jobs with the PyTorch Estimator 1.8.1 for two epochs with a batch-size of 32 images (298 steps per epoch). We use an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P3 instance of ml.p3.2xlarge that has 8 CPUs with 61 GB memory and 1 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core with 16 GB memory. We use three different CV models of increasing complexities ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet152 from the PyTorch pretrained model repository, Torchvision.\nDepending on the use case, training CV models often requires heavy data augmentation operations, such as dilation and gaussian blur. We replicate a real-world scenario by introducing a heavy data augmentation load. We use a load factor to repeat the operations of horizontal flip, vertical flip, and random rotation Nx times before resizing, normalizing, and cropping the image.\nIdentify and compare CPU bottlenecks with Debugger\nWe measure training time and system metrics with Debugger to identify possible root causes and bottlenecks. Debugger helps capture and visualize real-time model training metrics and resource utilization statistics. They can be captured programmatically using the SageMaker Python SDK or visually through SageMaker Studio.\nFor the trials conducted with ResNet18 model with an augmentation load of 12x, we used the smdebug library in util_debugger.py to generate the following heat map of CPU and GPU utilization for the two training jobs.\n\nThe colors yellow and purple in the heat map indicate utilization close to 100% and 0%, respectively. Trial A shows the CPU bottleneck with all CPU cores at maximum utilization, while the GPU is under-utilized with frequently stalled cycles. This bottleneck is addressed in Trial B with less than 100% CPU utilization and higher GPU utilization during the data preprocessing phase.\nApart from that, the Debugger ProfilerReport aggregates monitoring and profiling rules analysis into a comprehensive report that can help right-size resources and fix bottlenecks using the insights from the profiling results. You can either access this report from Studio or the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where we have the training outputs. For this experiment trial, the following is a subsection of the Debugger ProfilerReport. It shows the compute usage improvement statistics of CPU and GPU for minimum, maximum, p99, p90, and p50 percentiles for the training jobs.\nThe following screenshot shows systems statistics for Trial A.\n\nThe following screenshot shows systems statistics for Trial B.\n\nWe can observe that the p95 CPU utilization dropped from 100% in Trial A to 64.87% in Trial B, thereby addressing the data preprocessing bottleneck. The p95 GPU utilization boosted from 31% to 55% and has further potential to process more load.\nFor more information about the different options of using Debugger to gain further insights and recommendations, see Identify bottlenecks, improve resource utilization, and reduce ML training costs with the deep profiling feature in Amazon SageMaker Debugger.\nExperiment results\nThe following table shows the training time in seconds per epoch for different augmentation loads for both the trials when using a batch size of 32 in training the three ResNet models for two epochs. The visualization charts following the table summarize the insights from these results.\n\n\n\nModel\nAugmentation Load Factor\nTrial A (Seconds/Epoch)\nTrial B (Seconds/Epoch)\nImprovement Training Time (%)\n\n\nResNet18\n1\n41.67\n21.3\n48.88\n\n\n4\n49.95\n21.37\n57.21\n\n\n8\n61.92\n21.08\n65.95\n\n\n12\n77.82\n21.33\n72.59\n\n\nResNet50\n1\n72.64\n46.94\n35.37\n\n\n4\n75.21\n45.02\n40.14\n\n\n8\n81.22\n46.29\n43.00\n\n\n12\n88.89\n46.43\n47.76\n\n\nResNet152\n1\n166.96\n119.96\n28.15\n\n\n4\n169.68\n115.23\n32.08\n\n\n8\n169.03\n117.73\n30.34\n\n\n12\n173.18\n114.38\n33.95\n\n\n\nThe following chart depicts how Trial B has consistently lower training time than Trial A across all the three models with increasing augmentation load factors. This is due to efficient resource utilization with data preprocessing offloaded to the GPU in Trial B. A complex model (ResNet152 over ResNet18) has more parameters to train and therefore more time is spent in forward and backward pass on the GPU. This results in an increase in overall training time as compared to a less complex model across both trials.\n\nThe following chart depicts the percentage improvement in training times with Trial B over Trial A across different models and augmentation loads. The improvement in training time increases with increasing augmentation load and decreases with increasing model complexity. We can observe the following:\n\nResNet18 shows an increase in improvement from 48.88% to 72.59% when training with 1x and 12x augmentation load, respectively\nResNet152 shows an improvement of 33.95% compared to ResNet18 with 72.59% for the same augmentation load of 12x\nThe improvement in training time lowers with increasing model complexity because the GPU utilization is higher for training tasks and is less available for the data preprocessing task\n\n\nBest practices to address data preprocessing CPU bottlenecks\nBeyond the approach we discussed in this post, the following are additional best practices for addressing preprocessing CPU bottlenecks:\n\nIdentify the right instance type \u2013 Depending on the data preprocessing load and model complexity, choosing instances with an optimal ratio of number of CPUs and GPUs can balance the load to reduce bottlenecks. This in turn accelerates training. SageMaker offers an array of instances with different CPU/GPU ratios, memory, storage types, and bandwidth to choose from. Understanding more about choosing right-sized resources and choosing the right GPU can help you select the appropriate instance.\nBalance the load among available CPUs \u2013 Assigning an optimal number of workers in a multi-CPU core system can help balance the data preprocessing load and avoid having some CPU cores always being more active than others. When increasing the number of workers, you should account for the potential bottleneck that can occur with respect to the concurrency limits of the file system.\nOptimize the training pipeline \u2013 One of the best practices is to trade off the batch size optimally. When it\u2019s too large, there could be potential data preprocessing bottlenecks. If it\u2019s too low, it could increase the training time and affect model convergence. Another best practice is to use low precision types wherever possible and postpone casting to higher precision to the end of the pipeline. The training framework binaries also offer low-level configurations to take full advantage of CPUs, such using the advanced vector extensions, if applicable.\nMove augmentation to the data preparation phase \u2013 Identifying operations that can be moved to the raw training data creation phase can free up CPU cycles during training. These are typically preprocessing steps that shouldn\u2019t depend on a hyperparameter or need not be applied randomly. It\u2019s important not to increase the size of the training data excessively because this might increase network traffic to load the data and cause an I/O bottleneck.\nOffload data preprocessing to other machines \u2013 GPUs are the most expensive resources when training models. So an approach to address the cost and performance bottleneck is to move some of the CPU heavy data preprocessing activity to dedicated workers on separate instances with only CPU cores. It\u2019s important to consider that such a remote worker machine should have good enough network bandwidth for data transfer so as to ensure overall performance improvement.\n\nConclusion\nTraining CV models often requires complex and multi-stage data processing pipelines that include loading, decoding, cropping, resizing, and other use-case specific augmentations. They are natively run on the CPUs and often become a bottleneck, limiting the performance and scalability of training jobs.\nIn this post, we showed how you can use Debugger to identify resource bottlenecks and improve performance by moving data preprocessing operations to the GPU with SageMaker and NVIDIA DALI. We demonstrated a training time improvement of 72%, 37%, and 43% for ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet152, respectively, for a constant augmentation load.\nSeveral factors help determine whether data preprocessing on GPU will improve performance for your CV training pipeline. These include the computational complexity of the model and the augmentation operations, current utilization of GPUs, training instance types, data format, and individual JPEG image sizes. Because the cost of a training job is dependent on the instance type and training time, the demonstrated performance improvement reduces the overall cost.\nTry out the sample code used for this benchmarking experiment and the other best practices described in this post.\n\nAbout the Authors\nSayon Kumar Saha\u00a0is a Machine Learning Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, based in Berlin, Germany.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and AMD FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) are two similar seeming technologies that are part of the debate among who makes the best graphics cards. With several months' worth of FSR integration into games, and over three years of increasing DLSS use among games and game engines, we're now equipped to shed a bit more light on how the two technologies compare.\n\nWe've selected four games that each support both technologies, so we can provide direct comparisons between them. We've also tested on one AMD and one Nvidia GPU for each game. This will allow us to compare performance scaling between the different rendering modes, as well as comparing image quality.\n\nThere's more to life than pure performance, though we do track that in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. Image quality, and perhaps more importantly, image quality while reaching high frame rates, is what we really want. DLSS and FSR tackle this problem in very different ways, which we'll briefly cover here before getting into the results of our comparisons.Nvidia DLSS Overview(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia created DLSS to improve performance without drastically reducing image quality, but just as important, Nvidia wanted a good way for modern games to render at lower resolutions and then upscale, so that things like real-time ray tracing would be more viable on mainstream hardware. To that end, Nvidia added tensor core hardware to it's RTX 20-series GPUs, and basically doubled down on the tensor core performance with the RTX 30-series.\n\nTensor operations aren't something Nvidia invented, as they've been used and discussed in machine learning circles for a while now. The basic idea is to create special-purpose hardware that has enough precision combined with tons of compute to make the training and inference processes associated with artificial intelligence run better.\n\nThe RTX GPUs use FP16 (16-bit floating point) operations, and each tensor core on the RTX 20-series can work with 64 separate pieces of data, while the RTX 30-series GPUs can work on 128 chunks of data. The RTX 30-series also supports sparsity, which basically means that the hardware can skip multiplication by zero and effectively double its performance. The net result is that an RTX 2070 has a potential 59.7 TFLOPS of FP16 compute, while the RTX 3070 has a potential 163 TFLOPS of FP16 compute.\n\nAll of that computational power gets used to upscale and enhanced frames using inputs from previous frames, the lower resolution current frame, and an AI network trained on how to make lower resolution images look like they were rendered at a higher resolution.\n\nNvidia offers four DLSS modes: Quality mode renders at half the target resolution, balanced renders at one third the target resolution, performance uses one fourth the resolution, and ultra performance is one ninth the final resolution. Or, at least, that's the theory. In practice, it seems games have a bit of leeway in their rendered resolution.AMD FSR Overview(Image credit: AMD)AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution involves far less computational work. It's a post-processing algorithm that has been designed to upscale and enhance frames, but without all of the deep learning stuff, tensor cores, and massive amounts of compute. Basically, it upscales an image using a spatial algorithm (it only looks at the current frame), and then has some edge detection and sharpening filters to improve the overall look \u2014 or if you want specifics, it's Lanczos upscaling with edge detection.\n\nWhile that may not sound as impressive as DLSS, FSR does have some pretty major advantages. The biggest is that FSR can run on pretty much any relatively modern GPU. We've tested it on Intel's UHD 630, AMD GPUs going back as far as the RX 500-series, and Nvidia GPUs from the GTX 900-series, and it worked on all of them. Also, FSR is open-source, meaning others are free to adopt it, modify it, etc.\n\nThe FSR algorithm basically uses the shaders that are part of all modern GPUs to do the heavy lifting. As with DLSS, there are four modes commonly available: ultra quality, quality, balanced, and performance. AMD uses different scaling factors of 1.3x at ultra quality, 1.5x for quality, 1.7x for balanced, and 2.0 for performance. Those scaling factors apply in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, so performance mode ends up being 4x upscaling (the same as Nvidia's performance mode).DLSS vs. FSR Test SetupWe've selected four games that support both FSR and DLSS for this article. The latest release is Back 4 Blood, which came out earlier in October \u2014 you can read our full Back 4 Blood benchmarks article for more details on how that game runs and what settings are available. The Myst remake also came out in August 2021, and it uses Unreal Engine 4 to allow you to walk around a fully rendered world, unlike the original point and click adventure of the 90s. Next is Deathloop (and I refuse to capitalize the whole name, silly Arkane), which released in September. Last (and perhaps least), Marvel's Avengers originally launched without DLSS support but it was added a month later, in October 2020, with FSR support added in July 2021.\n\nThat's three relatively recent games plus an older game, but there are a few others as well. Baldur's Gate III (RPG) supports both DLSS and FSR in the latest early access branch. Other games with FSR and DLSS include Chernobylite (sci-fi survival), Edge of Eternity (a JRPG), Enlisted (multiplayer war shooter), F1 2021 (race car sim), The Medium (adventure), and Necromunda: Hired Gun (shooter). Chernobylite and Necromunda both use Unreal Engine for their DLSS and FSR support, just like Myst, and we'll probably see quite a few Unreal Engine games in the future with both DLSS and FSR.Test System for GPU Benchmarks\nIntel Core i9-9900K\nCorsair H150i Pro RGB\nMSI MEG Z390 Ace\nCorsair 32GB DDR4-3600\u00a0(2x 16GB)\nXPG SX8200 Pro 2TB\nWindows 10 Pro\u00a0(21H1)\n\nFor testing, we're using our standard GPU testbed with a Core i9-9900K CPU, 32GB RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD. We used the GeForce RTX 2060 and Radeon RX 5600 XT in Back 4 Blood, since it's the least demanding of the four games and we wanted to look at performance scaling on slightly older and less capable GPUs in that game. The other games we tested with the GeForce RTX 3060 and the Radeon RX 6700 XT. Both have 12GB of VRAM, which generally ensured we didn't run into VRAM limitations. The other three games also support ray tracing, which we enabled for all of our testing.\n\nThe RX 6700 XT normally outperforms the RTX 3060 by a decent amount (by 34% in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy), so we're not really comparing AMD vs. Nvidia performance but rather looking at how DLSS and FSR affect performance. However, the use of ray tracing does narrow the gap some, as Nvidia's GPUs generally offer better RT performance. And with that out of the way, let's look at the results from the four games.DLSS vs. FSR: Back 4 Blood(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)We have separate AMD and Nvidia charts, since only the Nvidia GPUs support DLSS. Starting with the RTX 2060, even in ultra performance mode, DLSS only improved performance by a bit less than 50%, while FSR in performance mode boosted framerates by over 90%. Each higher upscaling factor in DLSS improved performance by about 10%, with a slightly larger jump going from performance to ultra performance mode.\n\nFor FSR, each level of upscaling improved performance by closer to 20% on the RTX 2060. It's possible our use of previous generation hardware was a factor in how much performance improved, but in general Back 4 Blood wasn't a super demanding game and so CPU bottlenecks can start to be a factor.Somewhat surprisingly, the RX 5600 XT showed slightly lower overall scaling compared to the RTX 2060. Framerates improved by up to 87% using performance mode, just a bit lower than the 91% we measured on the RTX 2060 \u2014 and most of the other levels are also 1\u20132% less of an improvement, with the exception being ultra quality mode where both GPUs improved by the same 18%.\n\nAt least when looking at Turing and RDNA GPUs, then, FSR doesn't appear to favor AMD's architecture at all. But performance, as we said in the beginning, is only part of the story. Let's take a look at image quality.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 18(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)Native(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Quality(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Performance(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Ultra Performance(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)Native(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Quality(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)FSR Performance(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Turtle Rock Studios)DLSS Ultra PerformanceYou'll want to open up those 4K images and view at full magnification to see the finer details. We also saved using maximum quality JPG files, so there shouldn't be any noticeable loss in quality compared to the source PNG files (which were about 14MB each).\n\nThere's a minimal loss in visual fidelity going from no upscaling to FSR ultra quality \u2014 you can probably spot a few small details that get blurred out, but nothing particularly noteworthy, especially when the game's in motion. FSR quality also looks quite good, while FSR balanced starts to look a bit blurry and finally there's a clear loss in crispness using FSR performance mode. The branches and needles, grass, fences, ground, corrugated metal roof panels, and other elements all look a bit fuzzy using the balanced and performance FSR modes. However, in motion \u2014 this is a fast-paced zombie shooter, after all \u2014 a lot of those differences become far less noticeable.\n\nMove on to DLSS upscaling, and again there's a minimal loss in detail using quality mode, a bit more fuzziness with balanced mode, and more noticeable blurring and lack of fine details with the performance and ultra performance modes. In motion, you might register the fuzziness during less intense parts of the game, but when you're fighting zombies it's all good. Which is surprising when you consider the 1280x720 source resolution with DLSS ultra performance mode.\n\nIf all of the DLSS and FSR games we tested looked and performed like Back 4 Blood, we'd be quite happy. Unfortunately, this is one of the better results for image quality using FSR. It's not clear why some of the other games look noticeably worse, but let's see for ourselves.DLSS vs. FSR: Deathloop(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Deathloop was promoted by AMD, but it added DLSS with an update and also changed the 120 fps cap to 240 fps \u2014 both welcome changes in our book. DLSS ultra performance mode isn't supported, so that's one less scaling option to choose from this time.\n\nWe're using faster GPUs this time, but the performance scaling from the various modes ends up favoring Nvidia quite a bit for some reason. Perhaps it's because we're also using ray tracing, but we still would have expected similar gains from the FSR modes. DLSS performance scaling was also markedly better in Deathloop.\n\nFor the RTX 3060, DLSS quality mode boosted framerates by 55%, balanced improved performance by 87%, and performance mode was over twice as fast \u2014 111% faster, to be precise. Sticking with the 3060, FSR ultra quality improved performance by 47%, quality mode gave an 80% increase, balanced was 111% (the same as DLSS performance mode), and FSR performance mode yielded a 153% improvement in fps. Note that the starting point was just 28 fps, however, and only FSR performance mode got the RTX 3060 to a (mostly) steady 60+ fps.\n\nOn the RX 6700 XT, the gains were generally quite a bit lower. FSR ultra quality only improved performance by 18%, quality mode bumped that to 45%, balanced mode gave a 64% increase, and performance mode slightly more than doubled performance with a 102% gain. Interestingly, performance at native resolution without FSR was 31 fps, while FSR performance mode ended up at 62 fps, so the RX 6700 XT started out faster than the 3060 but ended up slower. (Note: I may need to retest, just to verify these numbers, because they're a bit odd.)Image 1 of 16(Image credit: Arkane Studios)Native(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Quality(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Performance(Image credit: Arkane Studios)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Arkane Studios)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Arkane Studios)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Arkane Studios)Native(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Quality(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Arkane Studios)FSR Performance(Image credit: Arkane Studios)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Arkane Studios)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Arkane Studios)DLSS PerformanceAgain, you need to click the enlarge button and access the full-size images to see the details better. This time, unfortunately, the image fidelity comparisons don't do FSR any favors. We've got two sets of images, and there's some clear aliasing present at higher FSR levels on the first set (right below the \"Expand Your Mind\" sign). But the ultra quality and quality modes can be used pretty much without complaint.\n\nDLSS image quality is interesting because this time there are things that look better with DLSS quality mode than at native \u2014 look at the railing above the roof, for example. In fact, DLSS performance mode still looks almost the same as native mode, which is quite impressive.\n\nIn the second set of images, look at the rock face of the arch, the writing on signs, and other fine details like the lights on the red arrow sign and you see a very noticeable drop in details even with FSR quality mode, and it only gets worse at the higher upscaling settings. DLSS doesn't look better than native this time, but all three modes look very close to the same.\n\nI do wonder if standing still for a screenshot perhaps benefits DLSS too much. It uses temporal data \u2014 meaning, data from previous frames \u2014 to help recover lost detail, and it could be that standing still presents a perfect opportunity for it to look nearly perfect. Still, it's when you're not really moving around that the fine details are actually noticeable, and DLSS works wonders in that case.\n\nBased on performance gains, this time DLSS gets the nod. You can play using performance mode at 4K and still get a very good overall experience visually, while FSR boosts performance but causes a noticeable loss in fine details for some areas of the game. FSR ultra quality is still worth a shot, but I wouldn't want to use the balanced or performance modes if I could avoid it.DLSS vs. FSR: Myst 2021(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Myst performance improvements are a bit better than what we saw in Deathloop, but still tended to favor the RTX 3060. Ultra quality FSR boosts fps by 51% on the 3060 and 44% on the 6700 XT, quality mode yields an 86% gain on the 3060 vs. 71% on the 6700 XT, balanced was 121% compared to 100%, and performance increased by 175% versus 132%. These are both the latest GPU architectures, so it's interesting that FSR actually appears to run better on Ampere than on RDNA2, at least in some cases.\n\nAs for DLSS, ultra performance mode basically matched FSR performance mode with a 178% increase in fps. DLSS performance mode likewise matched FSR balanced mode at 121% higher fps, while DLSS balanced mode gave a 91% improvement and even quality mode boosted framerates by 63%. Myst isn't a fast-paced action game, so high fps isn't really required, but both GPUs easily managed more than 60 fps at 4K with the right upscaling settings \u2014 DLSS balanced or FSR quality or higher for the RTX 3060, and the RX 6700 XT got slightly more than 60 fps even with native rendering.Image 1 of 18(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)Native(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Quality(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Performance(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Ultra Performance(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)Native(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Quality(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)FSR Performance(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Cyan Worlds, Inc.)DLSS Ultra PerformanceImage quality again ends up a bit of a blurry mess with FSR at higher scaling factors. It's not awful, but the trees and other details all start to look noticeably worse with the balanced and performance modes. DLSS looks better, at least up until the ultra performance mode.\n\nOur second image test scene ended up being worthless, as you can see from the screen captures. All the swirling fog makes it hard to tell what's changing from upscaling and what looks different from the fog, which is a good illustration of times where you can get away with even FSR performance mode and not really notice the loss of fidelity.\n\nOverall, DLSS looked better and performed well in Myst, but non-RTX users can certainly run FSR in the ultra quality or quality modes and get higher performance for a relatively unobtrusive drop in crispness and detail.DLSS vs. FSR: Marvel's Avengers(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Last, we have the oldest game of the bunch, Marvel's Avengers. It has some oddities that immediately stand out with DLSS, specifically that the balanced and quality modes perform basically the same \u2014 actually, quality mode performed slightly better. Other than that one oddity, though, things mostly make sense.\n\nThe AMD and Nvidia GPUs we tested were a lot closer in scaling this time, with the biggest difference being just 3% \u2014 the RTX 3060 ran 59% faster with FSR quality mode vs. native, while the RX 6700 XT improved by 57% for example.\n\nDLSS ultra performance mode ended up providing the highest performance on the 3060, though again the 9x resolution upscaling was definitely noticeable. Either way, you can potentially double your performance in Avengers with the highest upscaling modes from FSR and DLSS.Image 1 of 18(Image credit: Square Enix)Native(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Quality(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Performance(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Ultra Performance(Image credit: Square Enix)Native(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Ultra Quality(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Quality(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Balanced(Image credit: Square Enix)FSR Performance(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Quality(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Balanced(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Performance(Image credit: Square Enix)DLSS Ultra PerformanceAs with the second image set in Myst, there's a lot of vapor and clouds and such swirling around in Avengers, which makes it a bit more difficult to see what changed due to FSR and DLSS, and what changed just because of the weather. DLSS quality mode is visually indistinguishable from native rendering, though, and it's equally difficult to spot any differences between native and FSR ultra quality. FSR performance ,on the other hand, certainly looks blurrier. The trees and shrubberies also show more blockiness with FSR than with DLSS.\n\nBut when you're in the middle of a fight? Yeah, it all sort of blends together. Which is why so many console games have used upscaling in various forms for years without too many complaints from the gamers.DLSS vs. FSR, the Bottom Line(Image credit: Shutterstock, AMD, Nvidia)If you were hoping to see a clear winner, there are far too many factors in play. DLSS certainly seems to be more capable of producing near-native quality images, especially at higher upscaling factors, but it requires far more computational horsepower and, at times, doesn't improve performance as much as we'd like. More importantly, it's an Nvidia-only technology, and not just that, an RTX-only tech. All the Nvidia users with GTX cards are out of luck, as are AMD card owners and Intel GPU users.\n\nFSR doesn't win the image quality matchup, particularly in higher upscaling modes, but if you're running at 4K and use the ultra quality or quality mode, you'll get a boost in performance and probably won't miss the few details that got lost in the shuffle. FSR performance mode, however, can look pretty bad. In fact, I'd prefer running a game at 1080p and letting my monitor stretch that to 4K rather than using FSR performance mode. Balanced mode likewise should only be used if you're in dire need of improved performance.\n\nThe wildcard in this discussion is Intel's upcoming XeSS. It sounds a lot like DLSS, and one of the people who helped design DLSS left Nvidia to go work for Intel. It will supposedly work on most modern GPUs \u2014Intel, AMD, or Nvidia \u2014 but how well it works is very much unknown. It will use Intel's version of tensor cores for Arc, and fall back to DP4a calculations for other GPUs. Plus, making a good upscaling algorithm isn't the same as getting it adopted by game developers.\n\nWe also didn't get into more traditional forms of upscaling, which quite a few games have been using for years. Temporal or spatial upscaling techniques that only drop performance a few percent exist, and many games even have dynamic scaling where you target your monitor refresh rate and the game adjusts the resolution on the fly. It may not look quite the same, but there are a lot of times where you won't even notice or care.\n\nIn terms of adoption rates, Nvidia DLSS still leads AMD FSR, thanks to its lengthy head start. AMD FSR has been announced or released in at least 27 games at present, while Nvidia DLSS is now available in at least 119 games (though many on Nvidia's DLSS list are lesser known indie games). With Unreal Engine and Unity both supporting DLSS and FSR now, though, we expect we'll see plenty more games incorporating both technologies going forward \u2014 and maybe even XeSS as well.\n\nUltimately, games and game developers now have several choices available, and that's a good thing. As shown here, adopting one of the technologies doesn't preclude supporting the other. Over time, we hope to see continued improvements in both algorithms, and it's something we'll continue to monitor going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nray tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (30)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

The thing is, FSR works on pretty much everything. If you're on an old GTX 1060 and struggling to get above 60 fps, FSR can probably get you there. And for games where you only need an extra 5-10 fps, you can use the ultra quality mode and likely never really notice. But the problem is FSR (and DLSS) aren't generally used on older games, and only about a third maybe of new games. Which means you'll have to use lower resolutions and just do it the old fashioned way. I'm still hopeful FSR can improve in quality over time, or maybe XeSS will end up as a universal upscaling solution with quality matching DLSS while working on all modern GPUs. One can dream, right?\n\nAlso a fun aside: Serious image upscaling and enhancement that doesn't result in more noticeable image quality losses is certainly possible. The AMD and Nvidia images used in the article were upscaled using BigJPG.com, and the results are quite good. It also took about a minute to get the final result, but the source images were only 720p for AMD and 510p for Nvidia. And if you go look now, you'll see the denoising results of the upscaling, but it's still better (IMO) than the upscaling you get with Photoshop. I really hope the next iteration of Photoshop adds a high-end AI trained upscaling algorithm! Deep Image is the one to beat right now. Give me that level of quality at 60 fps and I'd be super impressed. \ud83d\ude43\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleepy_Hollowed\n\n\nLike others have mentioned, the AMD version has an edge just because it's Open Source and not only will it get better over time, but it's free to use for developers, which will help many smaller budget games use it instead of DLSS unless there's no tools to implement it easily.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 30 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Best Photoshop Alternatives Tested: Image Editing for Free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the most out of your processor with this motherboard's Turbo Mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwekeys Antiques Metal keycaps are Viking-themed luxury for your fingertips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD RDNA 4 and Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs start at $549: Specifications, release date, pricing, and more revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTested: Intel's Arrow Lake 140T iGPU mostly maintains an edge over AMD's older 880m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia DLSS4, MFG, and full ray tracing tested on RTX 5090 and RTX 5080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m typing this on the world\u2019s largest keyboard, a 178-key beast designed to make you more productive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontech\u2019s Heritage Pro case is like a designer handbag for your Micro ATX PC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Battlemage and Arc B-series GPUs: Specifications, release dates, pricing, and everything we know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverclocking Arrow Lake: How I set world records, plus simple tips to push your Core Ultra to the limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The EMA is working with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, various ministries and agencies and the National Climate Change Secretariat to carry out exploratory studies on the country's geothermal potential.  The studies will focus on determining the geothermal resource potential in northern and eastern Singapore, EMA said, adding that these areas have been identified to hold geothermal potential based on their higher surface temperature measurements. The studies aim to publish preliminary findings by late 2022, the energy regulator added. If they yield positive results, EMA said it will explore further research to determine the viability and scalability of deploying geothermal systems in Singapore. Because of its limited size and resources, Singapore imports almost all of its energy needs and has recently been working on plans to increase its renewable imports as well as diversify its energy sources. Conventional hydrothermal systems, which harness heat from underground resources of hot water or steam may not work in Singapore because of the lack of quality resources at shallower depths, EMA said. But advances in technology such as advanced geothermal systems have opened up the possibility of geothermal application by harnessing heat from deep, hot, dry rock, with minimal impact to environment and safety, the EMA added.

Probably the most quirky of the announcements is that \"The World's Smallest Gaming Arcade,\" situated in an iconic British phone box, is powered by GeForce Now with 5G connectivity. In other news, a recent beta update provided to the Microsoft Edge browser on the Xbox means that GeForce Now can be used on these consoles \u2013 if you have a GeForce Now (free or paid) subscription.\nThe World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade\nAs a one-day pop-up venture in Manchester, Nvidia has set up a thoroughly modern arcade in an admittedly ancient but iconic British phone box. These red phone boxes debuted in 1936, according to the blurb I received from Nvidia (so we must be looking at a K6). Nvidia goes on to say that phone boxes in the UK are largely unused, as ownership of mobile phones is very widespread, but 5,000 of these boxes around the country have been repurposed as community spaces rather than sold for scrap or otherwise removed.\n\nIn the Mancunian red K6 you see pictured, 'The World's Smallest Arcade' uses 5G mobile internet and a tablet / controller to play some of the thousands of games available via GeForce Now. Additionally, this 'arcade' includes a fridge for you to keep your drinks cold (hardly necessary for Manchester in late October, a microwave for your pasty might have been better).\n\nNvidia's little pop-up event was arranged to demonstrate that \"GeForce Now is making high-quality gaming accessible to all via the cloud, while ray tracing and DLSS are no longer being the reserve of those with a GPU and gaming rig\".\nGeForce Now on Xbox\nNvidia has unlocked its GeForce Now service for Xbox users. This week, a new version of Microsoft Edge became available for Xbox in a beta upgrade, with support for the platform.\nThis Xbox + GeForce Now solution might find special favour among users as the Edge browser on this platform supports mouse and keyboard input, giving users the benefit of controlling games this way rather than relying on controllers. However, as you can see from the video captured by The Verge's Tom Warren, below, the response in games seems somewhat laggy, at least for now.\n\nYou can now play Steam PC games on an Xbox with Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now. Here's a quick look at how it all works. Details here: https://t.co/EMGX0HRxcT pic.twitter.com/G6YcloBubM\r\n\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) October 25, 2021\n\nThe Verge notes that Microsoft's head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has recently committed to bringing full PC games to the Xbox via xCloud. For now GeForce Now is the best alternative, and it will hopefully be improved / refined in the coming weeks / months.\nLast week, Nvidia introduced GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership level streams, with up to 1440p resolution and 120 frames per second on PCs and Macs. I'm not sure how well this would play on the beta browser on the Xbox, or whether it would be worth paying extra right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nMicrosoft imagines Xbox 2042 with 1 exaFLOP processor\n\n                    Meanwhile, EA/DICE have revealed three big new maps for Battlefield 2042. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n8\nRockstar outlines Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy PC specs\n\n                    Remastered games release on PC and consoles on 11th Nov.

Get ready to say goodbye to the regular way of weather forecasting. All about weather forecasting   All about weather forecasting   For us, checking the weather is as simple as opening our phones or asking Siri or Alexa. However, the science of weather forecasting is not that simple. Meteorologists across the world have been trying hard to come up with high-accuracy predictions. After all, it\u2019s not just predicting when and where it will be sunny, raining, or cloudy. It also includes long-term predictions of the climate and affects policy and conservation greatly. Meteorologists predict the weather by casting, i.e., hourly. casting is harder as it is susceptible to several variable factors. \u201cGreat work from our team DeepMind. Understanding and predicting weather has been a topic that has intrigued and challenged humanity. Great to see learning-based AI systems making progress in this important area,\u201d tweeted Pushmeet Kohli, a research lead at the firm. More on DeepMind AI   More on DeepMind AI   According to Google\u2018s DeepMind AI, using a machine learning AI makes the task easier. With the help of AI, researchers can predict rainfall location and the possibility for the next 90 minutes. The system developed by Google and UK\u2019s meteorological office is an expert at predicting short-term weather changes. Moreover, DeepMind has immense experience with neural networks and investigating how proteins fold. \u201cOur teams research and build safe AI systems. We\u2019re committed to solving intelligence, to advance science and benefit humanity,\u201d states DeepMind\u2019s official website. Additionally, the new research published in Nature describes how the new prediction model DGMR or Deep Generative Model of Rainfall can predict changes within 90 minutes. \u201cSing a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89% of cases against two competitive methods.,\u201d stated the researchers in the study. DGMR uses the computational capacity of the neural network and picks out the uncertainty in machine learning. Hence, DeepMind AI can give the most reliable and accurate weather predictions.

The challenges, however, were manifold when it came to reaching blind children in remote regions of the country for continuing inclusive education \u2014 a key programme of Sightsavers.\n06 Oct 2021 | By  PrintWeek Team  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround a hundred children across all 33 districts of Rajasthan will receive laptops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSightsavers, with the support from HCL Foundation, demonstrated the development of a model resource room in Jhalawar and Udaipur under its Inclusive Education Programme for children with visual impairment. Further, Sightsavers, during the meeting with Rajasthan state officials of the education department advocated after demonstrating the usage and importance of equipping government resource centres with devices like Divya Nayan, Mobile, Computer INDO-NVDA, Refreshable Braille display and Geometry Kit for children with visual impairment.\nBased on the demonstration and recommendations of Sightsavers, the government of Rajasthan took big step and planned for developing a model resource room for all Children with Special Needs (CWSN) and incorporated budgetary provisions in the Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWP&B) of 2021-22 for all thirty-three districts. The model resource rooms will have several devices including Divya Nayan, refreshable Braille display, Geometry Kit (for blind), mobile phones, Daisy players, Computer with INDO-NVDA and Smart/Interactive Board for children with visual impairment. \nAround a hundred children with visual impairment across all 33 districts of Rajasthan will receive laptops this year from the education department of the government of Rajasthan. This has become an integral part of the state budget since 2019-2020.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s highly creditable efforts along with the support of our partner, HCL, have resulted in the assurance that most children with disability in the respective districts receive equal educational opportunities. The practise of inclusive education in schools will help in promoting social acceptance, rights, and inclusion of people with disabilities,\u201d RN Mohanty, CEO at Sightsavers India.\n\u201cHCL Foundation's flagship programme for rural development, HCL Grant, aims to recognise visionary organisations working towards development and nation-building in rural India. Under the programme, it has been a pleasure partnering with the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind (Sightsavers India) in efforts towards creating a conducive and inclusive environment in educational institutions,\u201d said Nidhi Pundhir, director, HCL Foundation, said.\u00a0\n\n\nTags :  Sightsavers India;\r\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending News\n\n\n\nImpel nominated for Economic Times award\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Week ignites excitement for China Print 2025\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeidelberg celebrates 175 years of print excellence   \n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnity Ads & Print invests in AccurioPress \n14 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFutura Digital chooses Canon to boost textured prints  ....\n14 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad More Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Poll\n\nWhat is packaging's top priority for 2025? \n\r\n                                    Design innovations\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                    Material focus\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                    New product development\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                    Sustainable alternatives\r\n                                    \n\n\n\nVote Now\nResults\n\n\n\nWhat is packaging's top priority for 2025? \nDesign innovations\n\n\u00a0\n0%\n\nMaterial focus\n\n\u00a0\n50.0%\n\nNew product development\n\n\u00a0\n0%\n\nSustainable alternatives\n\n\u00a0\n50.0%\n\nTotal Votes : 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors Picks\n\n\n\nPrint History: Representing The Middle-Class Printer - ....\nFeb 28,  2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint History: Red Tape in Black Type - Government Pres....\nJan 31,  2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint History: Browsing Book Bazaars \u2014 Kanupriya Dhingr....\nDec 18,  2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad More Stories\n\n\nEvents\nPackPlus South 2025\n\r\n                                Nov 07 - Nov 09  2025\r\n                                PackPlus South 2025 is a leading tr....\r\n                            \n\n\nSee All\r\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Tweets by PrintWeek\r\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2715\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2715\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp and Information\n\nAbout us\nNewsletter Archive\nFeedback\nRegister\nContact Us\n\n\n\nGlobal Sites\n\nUK\nAus/NZ\nMEA \nDeutsch\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 PrintWeek.

(PHOTO: Stephen White/CameraSport via Getty Images)  \u00b7 Stephen White - CameraSport via Getty Images By Yoolim Lee (Bloomberg) \u2014 ZujuGP is an upcoming digital community built around football, helmed by the son of secretive Singaporean investor Peter Lim and fronted by global superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese footballer has peppered his social media with posts tagged #WritingTheFutureOfFootball and linking to ZujuGP\u2019s website. One of them features the player as an umbrella-wielding warrior and another sees him clasping hands with Lim, whose company Mint Media Sports owns and administers Ronaldo\u2019s image rights.  The startup aims to drive communication and commerce in the worldwide community of four billion fans, allowing them to watch live games virtually, buy merchandise, engage with players and bet. It also aims to make it easier for club owners, agents and scouts to discover and develop talented players. Lim, 68, bought Spanish club Valencia C.F. in 2014 and is also a shareholder of English club Salford City F.C. His son, Kiat, had started working on his own stealth tech startup called Arc, a new type of a closed social space, and he\u2019d often talk to his father about it. The coronavirus pandemic took a heavy toll on the finances of the football industry and the Lims figured it was ripe for change, using technology. \u201cIt turned out he\u2019d been thinking deeply for a solution,\u201d 28-year-old Kiat said of his father in his first ever interview with media. The ambitious plan they came up with was to bring together football fans and professionals on a single platform. They brainstormed and fine-tuned the idea over the past year and plan to beta-test it in the first half of 2022. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him so excited about a project.\u201d  ZujuGP promises a lot. ZujuGamePlay will be an immersive platform for fans to watch games together and collaborate \u201cin a fully-functioning economy that spans the real and digital worlds.\u201d The company dubs it a footballverse, much in the vein of the metaverse visions posited by the likes of Facebook Inc. and Epic Games Inc. ZujuGP Exchange will offer a hiring platform where talents, professionals and hiring clubs can do business. The company says it will power it with artificial intelligence and secure it with blockchain technology. ZujuGP Rank, finally, will be a digital football academy that offers performance training and specialist drills. Zuju is a play on the name cucu, which means kicking. Its origin is cuju, an ancient Chinese game considered the earliest recorded form of football.     Ronaldo, who has 356 million Instagram fans and 95 million Twitter followers, appeared in a ZujuGP ad where he transforms into a Chinese warrior. His changing face masks signal the changing face of football as audiences shift, revenues fluctuate and digitisation and failed breakaways disrupt the industry, according to the company.   Story continues \u201cThe East and the West can be finally connected, which makes me feel even more happy,\u201d Ronaldo said in his latest Instagram post as he unveiled ZujuGP.ZujuGP users will be able to use cash to purchase credits on the platform, which would then be used to interact in the context of a live football game. Credits would also be used to buy exclusive merchandise or to bid for a private audience with pundits or other football personalities on the platform.The Lims see Asia as the next frontier of football. The region is home to 60% of the world\u2019s population and its growing fan base presents a huge market for European games and products.(Updates with Ronaldo quote)\u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Such videos will appear in the YouTube mini-player on the web. Users will see a \"Continue watching\" message under the video title. Notably, the mini-player appears in the bottom right corner when YouTube is launched on the web. Here's more.  Background: No 'Continue watching' option on YouTube mobile apps  The new feature will work in only one direction as there's no \"Continue watching\" in mini-players on YouTube mobile apps. The platform released the mini-player to all desktop users in 2018 for simultaneously watching videos while browsing through YouTube. Along with the Floating Video feature for watching videos outside the browser while doing other work, the way we use YouTube on PCs has changed.  Know-how: Sync YouTube account history to quickly reach half-finished videos  For the \"Continue watching\" feature to work, the YouTube account history must be synced. So, the login to YouTube on the desktop and the smartphone has to be from the same Google account. This feature, undoubtedly, quickens the process of reaching partially-watched videos. Earlier, users had to search for such videos in the History section or add them to the Watch Later section.  Drawbacks: Mini-player feature can't be disabled, raises privacy concerns  Some YouTube users, on Twitter and Reddit, had earlier reported the mini-player on web feature as unnecessary and annoying, saying they don't want to resume videos they already dismissed. Currently, there's no way to disable the feature. The mini-player, however, can be dismissed, every time it pops up. The feature also raised privacy concerns since a desktop is not as private as a smartphone.  What else: YouTube working on another feature for downloading videos on desktop  In other news, YouTube is also testing ways for desktop users to download videos for watching later, even in the absence of an internet connection. These tests involve some YouTube Premium subscribers in India and France, among other places, as per reports. But for now, most YouTube users can download content for offline viewing on their mobile devices only.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Major STE shareholder Temasek Holdings has indicated that it will vote in favour of this transaction.  The engineering conglomerate has undoubtedly been one of the more resilient blue-chip stocks during the recent downturn. In fact, STE has seen its order book climbing steadily since the end of 2019 and has also kept its annual dividend unchanged at S$0.15 per share over the last five financial years. This acquisition comes after a failed bid by the group to acquire Cubic Corporation back in March this year. The company\u2019s last acquisition was two years ago, where it bought Newtec, a satellite communication company, for EUR 250 million. STE\u2019s share price has surged to a seven-week high of S$3.88 on the news. Investors should feel buoyed by this news as the engineering giant had also announced a reorganisation to align the group for future growth. Here are five things you should know about this major transaction. 1. Boosting STE\u2019s smart city ambitions TransCore is a market leader in electronic toll collection solutions (ETC) and a leading provider of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The acquisition target provides a full range of solutions, including tolling systems, congestion pricing (think ERP), back-office solutions, and RFID solutions. With this acquisition, STE is looking to position itself as a leader in smart mobility, which will accelerate the growth of its smart city division. Road transportation is a key element of STE\u2019s smart city business suite of solutions which includes security, energy management, waste and water management, and cybersecurity. TransCore will strengthen the group\u2019s commitment to sustainability by reducing traffic congestion and lower vehicle emissions, adding to the group\u2019s smart mobility sub-division. 2. A strategic fit The acquisition will also be a strategic fit for STE as it already has strengths in technology and innovation for smart rail and road solutions. TransCore\u2019s domain expertise is in congestion management, which has been identified as a growth area. TransCore has long-standing customer relationships with US state transportation authorities. Over 50% of its business consists of recurring revenue with a very high contract renewal rate of 95%. There is also potential for cross-selling. STE, which has completed 60 ITS projects in more than 20 countries, can bring its ITS solutions expertise to the US while TransCore can bring its tolling solutions experience to Asia.   Story continues 3. Profitable with a strong order bookTransCore generated US$565 million in revenue in 2020 and has a backlog of US$1.2 billion as of 31 July 2021.The business is profitable, reporting a profit before tax and non-controlling interests of around US$54 million for the first half of fiscal 2021 (1H2021).If the acquisition had been completed last year, it would have raised STE\u2019s profit after tax by around 12.5%, from S$522 million to S$587 million.TransCore has a workforce with 1,900 staff handling 10 billion transactions annually and serving nine million accounts, including 11 out of the 15 largest toll agencies in the US.4. Bright industry prospectsAnother compelling reason for STE\u2019s acquisition is the potential growth in the market for both ETC and ITS solutions.The current global market size stands at US$8 billion but is projected to grow at an annual rate of 7% to reach US$15 billion by 2030.And within Southeast Asia alone, the growth rates for ETC and ITS are estimated to be 15% and 14%, respectively, higher than the growth for the wider APAC region\u2019s 12%.The market for these solutions will hit US$1.2 billion in Southeast Asia and US$4 billion in the US by 2030, illustrating the long-term growth potential for STE in these two areas.5. Healthy financial contributionsSTE is committed to continuing to invest in TransCore\u2019s team to grow the business further.The acquisition will generate operating cash flow from year one and will add on to earnings from its second year.The group has also reiterated that its dividend-paying capacity will \u201cremain strong\u201d, so investors should expect that annual dividends should not dip below S$0.15.Get Smart: A synergistic acquisitionThis acquisition looks to play on STE\u2019s strengths and augment them further.The group\u2019s consideration for TransCore is in line with other recent acquisitions of transportation and toll solutions companies.STE will convene an extraordinary general meeting in due course to seek shareholders\u2019 approval.If approved, the acquisition is expected to close by the first quarter of 2022.Here are 5 cash-rich companies so healthy, they can pay you dividends for life.

Senator Manny Pacquiao, who recently retired as a professional boxer, was among the first to formalize his presidential bid. The contest for the top post is turning out to be a colorful affair, with a heartthrob actor-turned-mayor, a former police chief and Duterte\u2019s own daughter also emerging as potential contenders.  Whoever wins the vote faces the challenge of bolstering the economy as it recovers from the pandemic and dealing with China\u2019s assertiveness over disputed territory in the South China Sea. While candidates must register their intention to run with the Commission on Elections by Oct. 8, the list of presidential contenders won\u2019t be finalized until mid-November. This means other politicians can emerge as substitutes in a final attempt to join the race \u2014 a path previously taken by Duterte, who is now eyeing the vice-presidency in a bid to prolong his time at the top levels of power. Here\u2019s a look at the likely candidates, and their stand on key issues: Sara Duterte, 43, Davao City mayor   FILE PHOTO: Sara Duterte, Davao City Mayor and daughter of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, delivers a speech during a senatorial campaign caravan for Hugpong Ng Pagbabago (HNP) in Davao City, southern Philippines on May 9, 2019. REUTERS/Lean Daval Jr  \u00b7 Lean Daval Jr / Reuters The president\u2019s daughter has succeeded him as their home city\u2019s mayor, and she could do the same as the next Philippine leader. Sara has showed openness to becoming a presidential candidate, and she\u2019s the front-runner in recent surveys even though she maintains the focus is on seeking re-election as Davao City mayor.  Sara is still someone to watch, as Duterte has signaled he is willing to drop his vice-presidential ambition if his daughter runs for the top post. On foreign policy, Sara has said the Philippines shouldn\u2019t be begging China for access to disputed waters in South China Sea, although she has shown willingness to work with Beijing on the pandemic response.   Story continues Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr., 64, ex-senator  FILE PHOTO: Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jnr, former senator and son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, gestures during a press conference in Manila on October 5, 2017. (Photo: NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 NOEL CELIS via Getty ImagesThe son and namesake of the late dictator, Bongbong could chart a path for his clan\u2019s return to the presidential palace, three decades after his father\u2019s ouster. He\u2019s been involved in local politics since the 1980s under his father\u2019s rule, and has also been elected to Congress.Bongbong narrowly lost the vice-presidential race in 2016, and is eyeing a political comeback by seeking a national post next year. He plans to run on a platform of food security and pandemic recovery, although he is facing criticism that he\u2019s using his clan\u2019s alleged hidden wealth to further his political career. Bongbong has denied knowledge of these assets.Isko Moreno, 46, Manila City mayor  FILE PHOTO: Manila City Mayor Francisco \"Isko Moreno\" Domagoso prepares to deliver his State of the City Address at Manila City Hall on July 15, 2021 in Manila, Philippines.

Born in the slums and scavenging for food as a child before he became a film star in the 1990s, Moreno has pledged to use his life experiences to address poverty if elected president.Moreno, who was once President Duterte\u2019s appointee, said he will pursue the current administration\u2019s infrastructure push, and oil exploration with Beijing in the South China Sea if elected. He also plans to expand Manila\u2019s pandemic response at a national level.Manny Pacquiao, 42, senator  FILE PHOTO: Philippine boxing icon-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao smiles as he is interpelated by a colleague after delivering his previlege speech during a session at the senate in Manila on August 8, 2016.

After stints as a lawmaker since 2010, Pacquiao is gunning for the presidency \u2014 backed by a faction in the ruling party \u2014 with a promise to fight poverty and corruption.Pacquiao was once a loyal ally to President Duterte, defending his drug war and death penalty push, but has recently been criticizing the administration, including its pandemic response and South China Sea stance.Leni Robredo, 56, vice president  FILE PHOTO: Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo attends a press conference at her office in Manila on November 14, 2019, following a meeting with members of law enforcement and military officials a week after she accepted the offer from President Rodrigo Duterte to lead a role in the deadly drug war. (Photo: TED ALJIBE/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 TED ALJIBE via Getty ImagesAs opposition leader, Robredo has been among the most vocal critics of Duterte\u2019s policies, calling the drug war \u201ca massive failure\u201d and criticizing the administration for \u201cselling out\u201d to China. A lawyer and a social activist, Robredo was thrust into the public eye when her husband Jesse, a former Cabinet official, died in a plane crash in 2012.She was elected congresswoman, and narrowly defeated Bongbong in the 2016 vice-presidential race. Robredo had brief stints as the housing chairwoman and head of the anti-drug panel under Duterte\u2019s government. Currently without a cabinet post, Robredo has been visiting remote areas, and partnering with local governments in responding to the pandemic.Panfilo Lacson, 73, senator  FILE PHOTO: Philippines Senator Panfilo Lacson gestures during a press conference at the Senate in Manila on March 28, 2011. (Photo: NOEL CELIS/AFP/Getty Images)  \u00b7 NOEL CELIS via Getty ImagesLacson, who once headed the nation\u2019s police force, was the first to officially declare his presidential bid. He was the subject of an arrest warrant in 2010 for the alleged murders of a publicist and his driver, and went into hiding briefly. Lacson has denied involvement in those murders, and charges against him were dismissed in 2011.He was first elected senator in 2001, and has been a vocal critic of the questionable use of funds in the country\u2019s annual budget. Lacson wants strict management of the public coffers and pledges a campaign against corrupt officials if elected president.Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go, 47, senator  FILE PHOTO: Then Special Assistant to the President Bong Go answers queries during the Senate proceedings on the Frigate procurement controversy at the Philippine Senate in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines February 19, 2018.

A fixture by Duterte\u2019s side during meetings with world leaders, Go has taken selfies with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.While Go was elected senator in 2019, he is often seen at the president\u2019s events and attends his weekly televised cabinet meetings. Go has been named presidential candidate by a faction of the ruling party and has declined the nomination, although that can change depending on the strategy Duterte takes in his bid to stay in power. Go has pushed for better medical facilities in remote areas in the Philippines as the Senate health committee head.\u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

The service is powered by a new gaming supercomputer called the GeForce Now SuperPod and costs double the price of the current Priority tier.The SuperPod is \"the most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built,\" according to NVIDIA, delivering 39,200 TFLOPS, 11,477, 760 CUDA Cores and 8,960 CPU Cores. NVIDIA said it will provide an experience equivalent to 35 TFLOPs, or triple the Xbox Series X, roughly equal to a PC with an 8-core CPU, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM and a PCI-GEN4 SSD. NVIDIAAs such, you'll see 1440p gaming at up to 120fps on a Mac or PC, and even 4K HDR on a shield, though NVIDIA didn't mention the refresh rate for the latter. It'll also support 120 fps on mobile, \"supporting next-gen 120Hz displays,\" the company said. By comparison, the GeForce Now Priority tier is limited to 1080p at 60 fps, with adaptive VSync available in the latest update.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIt's also promising a \"click-to-pixel\" latency down to 56 milliseconds, thanks to tricks like adaptive sync that reduces buffering, supposedly beating other services and even local, dedicated PCs. However, that's based on a 15 millisecond round trip delay (RTD) to the GeForce Now data center, something that obviously depends on your internet provider and where you're located.NVIDIA's claims aside, it's clearly a speed upgrade over the current GeForce Priority tier, whether you're on a mobile device or PC. There's a price to pay for that speed, though. The GeForce Now premium tier started at $50 per year and recently doubled to $100, which is already a pretty big ask. But the RTX 3080 tier is $100 for six months (around double the price) \"in limited quantities,\" with Founders and priority early access starting today. If it lives up to the claims, it's cheaper than buying a new PC, in any case.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

Dubbed the GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership, which gives a hint at the performance available, this subscription level costs US$99.99/\u00a389.99 for a six-month period, with a limited number of memberships available at launch. The big attraction is that, if your internet is up to the job, you should be able to enjoy streaming at up to 1440p resolution and 120 frames per second on PCs and Macs, and 4K HDR at 60 frames per second on Shield TV, \"with ultra-low latency that rivals many local gaming experiences\".\n\nLuckily for us, Nvidia, and AMD, provide some background info on the cloud servers that will be streaming. Nvidia says each GeForce Now SuperPod consists of over 1,000 GPUs for 39 petaflops of graphics horsepower. Each '3080 experience' instance provides a user with 35 teraflops of performance, which is \"nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X,\" according to the green team.\n\nAMD says that Nvidia's GeForce SuperPods leverage AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro processors \"with unparalleled core counts and high-frequency clock speeds\". It adds that each processor features 128 PCIe Gen 4 lanes for great connectivity and bandwidth. Other key specs of a SuperPod include; 28GB of DDR 3200 memory, and PCI-Gen4 SSD storage.\n\nNvidia is still signing up people to its $9.99 pcm Priority GeForce Now subscriptions ($49.99/\u00a345.99 per six months), as well as offering a stripped down and time-limited free taster experience.\n\nAs well as the server-side upgrades, Nvidia has rolled out a new GeForce Now client to make use of the expanded capabilities. Moreover, it adds beta support for Microsoft Edge (might be of interest to Xbox owners), adds Nvidia's new Adaptive Sync technology support, and should improve latency for all GeForce Now users, across all tiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\n\n                    And Nvidia's GeForce Now service becomes Xbox friendly (via updated Microsoft Edge). \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n11\nSir Trevor McDonald OBE becomes the GamesMaster\n\n                    He will take on the iconic role during the three 60-minute episodes aired later this year. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n10\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n                    This SKU won't be going on sale but will be used for competition prizes and so on. \n                \n\n\n\nGod of War scheduled for PC release on 14th January\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 12 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Called 12VHPWR, the new connector can deliver up to 600W via 12 pins, a power draw which would normally require a graphics card to be fitted with four 8-pin Molex power connectors.\nIn August last year we first saw Nvidia's own design solution to this problem, a compact new 12-pin power connector (19mm), to replace the typical two 8-pin connectors on high-end boards, and which became standard fare on Founders Edition GPUs, if not many PSUs. The new 12VHPWR can deliver much greater power, is more future-proof, and is likely to be widely adopted as backed by the PCI-SIG, which also refers to it as the 'High Power Connector (H+)'.\n\nSome PC component suppliers have already started listing 12VHPWR / H+ plugs and cables and from these sources Igor's Lab has put together a diagram, explaining various features of the connector.\nIn summary, the 12VHPWR has 12 pins, each fitting into a 3mm square spacing (8-pin Molex spacing is 4.2mm) in two rows, for a 18.85mm wide connector, which is just a tad wider than the old Molex 8-pin one. This new socket can deliver 55A of continuous current at 12V, for a theoretical max power delivery of 660W (600W plus 10 per cent redundancy).\nLooking more closely at Igor's diagram, you can see a series of four contacts below the 12 pins of the main plug. These four contacts are to carry sideband signals, but we don't know exactly what purposes they will be used for. On the cabling side of things, the spec requires higher quality cables to be used (as they will be carrying more power in less area) to prevent issues at this point of the design. Cable quality is probably going to be mentioned prominently in PC PSU and accessory maker publicity materials, but I hope they don't make the headlines for the wrong reason.\n\nIgor's Lab looks at the capabilities of each 12VHPWR pin closely, with a discussion about the pin-out diagram of the H+ connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 21 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The various systems will have a combined 7 gigawatt-peak (GWp) capacity, Sunseap said. It includes a previously announced 2.2 GWp floating solar farm on Batam island, part of the Riau archipelago south of Singapore.  The project will help Singapore and Indonesia meet their green energy goals and would be one of the largest cross-border interconnected clean energy projects in Southeast Asia, Sunseap said. \"Coupled with multiple energy storage systems totalling more than 12 gigawatt hours, it aims to provide 1 gigawatt (GW) of non-intermittent low-carbon clean energy for Singapore and Indonesia,\" the statement said, adding that the project plans to transmit the green energy to Singapore via a proposed new subsea power cable. The consortium aims to fulfil 20% to 25% of the target of 4 GW of low-carbon electricity imports by 2035 that Singapore announced on Monday as part of plans to diversify supply and boost energy security. Other signatories to the memorandum include Sumitomo Corp, Samsung C&T Corp, Oriens Asset Management, ESS Inc, Durapower Group, PT Mustika Combol Indah, and PT Agung Sedayu.

(PHOTO: LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA/AFP/Getty Images)  \u00b7 LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA via Getty Images By K. Oanh Ha (Bloomberg) \u2014 Some of Southeast Asia\u2019s old-money tycoons are boosting investment in technology startups, looking to ride a wave of surging valuations as they seek to counter the fallout of the pandemic on businesses ranging from retail to hospitality and manufacturing. Holding companies, family investing arms and other vehicles of moguls from Thailand\u2019s Dhanin Chearavanont to the Philippines\u2019 Lance Gokongwei are either plowing millions of dollars directly into promising companies or setting up venture capital funds. Partnering with Silicon Valley venture capital firms is also gaining popularity.  With the flurry of investments, these traditional brick-and-mortar business empires are also transitioning to a new world of e-commerce and digitisation, paving the way for fresh revenue streams after being crippled by months of lockdowns and travel restrictions. The pivot has gained even more urgency under a new crop of leaders \u2014 in some cases younger, third-generation heirs. \u201cThe universe of family money in Southeast Asia has become very alive to what technology and tech investments are bringing because of recent startup successes,\u201d said Vishal Harnal, managing partner of 500 Startups Southeast Asia, which was an early investor in ride-hailing giant Grab and online marketplace Carousell. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more family money coming in to chase that, and the pandemic\u2019s accelerated that race.\u201d The conglomerates, which have helped power Southeast Asia\u2019s economies for decades, are now facing some tough challenges as governments still battle to contain Covid-19 infections. The Asian Development Bank last month slashed the 2021 growth outlook for the region to 3.1%, saying \u201cdeveloping Asia remains vulnerable\u201d to the pandemic.  Although Covid-19 has decimated tourism and retail in Southeast Asia, the region is home to some of the fastest-growing internet markets. Venture backers made a record 393 deals in the first half of 2021, raising US$4.4 billion by investing in startups across Southeast Asia, according to a separate research by Cento Ventures. Southeast Asia Added 70 Million Online Consumers During Pandemic Among the leaders in the race is Charoen Pokphand Group Co., a 100-year-old Thai conglomerate spanning agri-food to retail and telecommunications. The group\u2019s senior chairman is Dhanin, the head of Thailand\u2019s wealthiest business dynasty. Bangkok-based CP Group led a series C investment round in startup Ascend Money in September \u2014 backed by Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group Co. \u2014 that spawned Thailand\u2019s first fintech unicorn with a valuation of US$1.5 billion. CP Group also partnered with Siam Commercial Bank the same month to set up a US$800 million emerging-technologies venture fund, seeding it with US$100 million each.   Story continues \u201cCP Group is actively embracing innovation and exploring advanced technologies such as robotics, logistics, cloud and other digital technologies,\u201d said Yue Jun Jiang, CP Group\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cSoutheast Asia is going into a golden era of transformation where corporations are upgrading with advanced technologies and new business models, and the pandemic has further accelerated digitization.\u201dIn Indonesia, Intudo Ventures raised US$115 million to close its third fund in September to focus on the region\u2019s biggest digital economy. Investors in the fund include more than 30 Indonesian families and their conglomerates, according to the company.Plug and PlayPlug and Play Tech Center, a Sunnyvale, California-based early-stage investor that\u2019s backed more than 20 unicorns including PayPal Holdings Inc., has signed on more than a dozen partners in Southeast Asia, most of them family-controlled groups. They include Philippine construction-to-power conglomerate Aboitiz Power Corp. in the Philippines, Thailand\u2019s CP Group and Indonesia\u2019s Astra International.While the surging valuations may be alluring, the groups face some risks as they embrace the tech strategy.Early stage companies typically burn a lot of cash before showing any signs of gaining traction in their businesses. They also require a lot more support and guidance than established corporations may be willing to offer. Plus, the conglomerates also have to jostle with investors with deeper pockets and longer experience such as sovereign-wealth and venture capital funds.But many family-owned businesses are undaunted by the challenges. Some have started pilot projects with tech startups with the aim of investing in those with promising technologies.

(PHOTO: Getty Creative)  \u00b7 tobiasjo via Getty Images By Ben Stupples (Bloomberg) \u2014The family office for Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan has set up an outpost in Singapore to boost its Asia exposure and partner with the region\u2019s wealthy. Edoardo Collevecchio, the former chief of staff for Oppenheimer Generations, is moving from London to build and lead its team in Singapore, while Yi Ling Ong joins from Temasek Holdings as head of investment for the Asia unit, the company said in a statement.  The investment firm, which represents a branch of the dynasty that founded mining giant Anglo American and turned De Beers into the world\u2019s largest diamond producer, said it hopes a presence in the city-state will help drive investments between Asia and its home market of Africa. \u201cOver the next 20 or 30 years, the synergies between Africa and Asia are going to be substantial,\u201d Collevecchio, 33, said in an interview. \u201cWe want to be here at the start of that journey.\u201d The Oppenheimer family has a combined net worth of US$8.2 billion, largely through the 2012 sale of their stake in De Beers for about US$5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Oppenheimers join a growing number of billionaires turning to Singapore as fortunes surge across Asia. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and vacuum-cleaner billionaire James Dyson have both set up investment firms to manage their wealth in the city-state, known for its high standard of living, political stability and plethora of tax treaties. Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio also signalled last year he would open a family office there to run his investments and philanthropy in the region. The number of family offices in Singapore rose fivefold between 2017 and 2019, according to government data.  \u201cWe look forward to deepening relationships with like-minded partners,\u201d Jonathan Oppenheimer, 51, the family office\u2019s executive chairman, said in the statement. The Oppenheimers trace their fortune to the 1917 formation of Anglo American in South Africa. The firm later took control of De Beers, where Nicky Oppenheimer, 76, was chairman from 1998 to 2012. Oppenheimer Generations, which was created after Anglo American bought the family\u2019s 40% stake in the diamond firm, now has more than two dozen employees in South Africa, the U.K. and Jersey, according to LinkedIn data. Its other investments include Tana Africa Capital, a private equity joint venture set up a decade ago with Temasek to invest in African companies. \u201cThis is an incredibly exciting challenge,\u201d Collevecchio said about Asia. \u201cWe see so much potential.\u201d \u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

The info leak came via the EEC electronic product import databases \u2013 so sadly all we got was some tantalizing text. The leak was quite stirring for the imagination, but mostly it made one wonder how brown and beige the 'RTX3070-8G-NOCTUA' product would be.\nA few hours ago, Asus Vietnam let the cat out of the bag by sharing some nicely detailed images from multiple angles. Asus Vietnam, appears to have been a bit premature, so you won't be able to check out the official post right now, but luckily several sites, like WCCF Tech captured the data and images before the change of heart.\n\nYou can't unsee the owl\nIn the images, you can see that the Noctua Owl is very prominent in the design, as are its signature colours. The designers have chosen to embrace this traditional palette, rather than go all modern and Chromax.\nVarious photo angles let you see the Asus x Noctua and GeForce RTX branding, as well as things like power inputs, display outputs, and provides an impression of the length and thickness of the card (it is pretty thick). We can see there is a backplate too, but we don't get a shot of the design, sadly.\n\nLast but not least, the price of the Asus x Noctua GeForce RTX 3070 looks set to be 26 million VND, which is equivalent to GBP \u00a3850.\nMore Noctua Chromax black products due soon\nNoctua is teasing the arrival of some new Chromax products. A video titled \"the wait is almost over\u2026\" premiered a few hours ago, and in it you can see a close-up of some black fans and some PC CPU coolers with black finish. Looking at the official product roadmap, Noctua is due to release the Black NF-A12-25 fans and NH-U12A CPU cooler in the current quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nHEXUS Week In Review: Asus ROG Strix Arion and Seagate Storage Expansion Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 29 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

(Photo by Ramon Costa/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)  Bloomberg   31 October 2021 3 min read          By Alex Webb South Korea is having a moment. Between the hit Netflix show Squid Game, the chart-topping boy band BTS, and the Academy Award-winning movie Parasite, the country\u2019s culture suddenly seems to be everywhere. With each allusion to Hallyu \u2013 the so-called Korean wave of cultural exports \u2013 an invocation of Seoul\u2019s soft power is often not far behind. Unlike hard power, which forces others to follow your wishes, soft power helps you win their support by demonstrating the appeal of your culture and values. That \"Squid Game\" and \"Parasite\" are an expression of Korean soft power seems to have become an accepted fact. The reality may be more complex.  The catchy songs of BTS have teens worldwide singing along.  In the seminal 1990 work in which he coined the term \u201csoft power,\u201d Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye wrote that if a nation\u2019s \u201cculture and ideology are attractive, others will more willingly follow.\u201d The catchy songs of BTS have teens worldwide singing along, but neither Squid Game nor Parasite portrays a society that others might be eager to emulate. Both are bleak depictions of wealth disparity in modern South Korea. In Squid Game, the down-on-their-luck characters compete to the death to win 45.6 billion won ($39 million). After the losers get killed \u2013 in a series of increasingly grotesque contests based on children\u2019s games \u2013 their organs are harvested for sale on the black market. With more than 111 million views in its first month, the show is Netflix Inc.\u2019s biggest series launch yet.  The impoverished protagonists of \"Parasite\", which won Best Picture at the 2020 Academy Awards, meanwhile, inveigle their way into the lives of a wealthy family across town, brutally clearing out those who stand in their path. South Korea\u2019s previous big hit on the film awards circuit, the 2016 period psychological thriller The Handmaiden, dealt with similar themes, focusing on a con man\u2019s scheme to commit a wealthy heiress to an asylum so he could steal her inheritance.  The effect of South Korea's rising cultural influence may be more economic than ideological.  It\u2019s all a far cry from the classic perceptions of US soft power. Nye wrote of Soviet teenagers who \u201cwear blue jeans and seek American recordings,\u201d and how \u201cNicaraguan television broadcast American shows even while the government fought American-backed guerrillas.\u201d In theory, Hollywood and the Billboard Hot 100 did just as much to export liberal democracy to the world as the US Marine Corps. South Korea has made other megahits \u2013 its dramas and rom-coms are lapped up across Asia. But the effect of its rising cultural influence may be more economic than ideological. US exports helped sell US values. For Korea, the exports themselves may be enough. It\u2019s not trying to sell its system of government, but it does have Samsung smartphones, Hyundai cars, and Samyang noodles to offer. And in a world of rising trade tensions, convincing China and the US alike to be open to buying your products may be a far more desirable outcome. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

As a reminder, the game was banned in India last year due to national security concerns. Krafton then relaunched the Indian version of PUBG Mobile called Battlegrounds Mobile India on iOS and Android platforms. Now, the game publisher is reportedly working on an unannounced project which could be PUBG's sequel. Battlegrounds Mobile India To Get PUBG Mobile\u2019s Mega Modes Soon.

The leakster has also shared documents on his Twitter account and identified some details which reveal a PUBG sequel. As per a report from Alt Char, PUBG 2 is touted to be a separate game instead of an update to the existing battle royale game. The tipster has also revealed that Krafton had discussed upgrading PUBG to Unreal Engine 5 in a meeting but nothing is confirmed by the game publisher yet. It is also unsure whether it will be a PUBG sequel or an engine update for PUBG, just like Overwatch 2. So this information should be taken with a pinch of salt. The upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 might also offer better graphics, improved elements to the battle royale game.

The two PC tech firms have partnered to produce the Asus GeForce RTX 3070 Noctua (OC) Edition. It arrives with multiple claims about its special qualities and appeal, probably the most important being that it is the \"coolest and quietest graphics card in its class\". We have previously seen some leaked info about this product, and the product is exactly like the renders that Asus Vietnam spilled a little prematurely. Now we have many more important details to share, though, like the official tech specs.\n\nGetting right into the tech specs, I've bullet pointed the key specifications below, via Asus.\n\n5888 Nvidia CUDA cores\nOC mode: 1845MHz (Boost Clock); Gaming mode : 1815MHz (Boost Clock)\nThis GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card with LHR (lite hash rate) delivers approx 25 MH/s ETH hash rate\n8GB GDDR6 memory at 14Gbps, on a 256-bit interface\nTwo Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM fans deliver exceptional cooling and low noise\nA tailor-made heatsink takes full advantage of the airflow characteristics of Noctua fans\nDual BIOS switch lets you toggle between Quiet and Performance BIOS profiles sans software\n0dB technology lets you enjoy light gaming in relative silence.\nPorts: 2x HDMI 2.1, 3x DP 1.4a\nPower: 2x 8-pin power, 750W PSU recommended\nDimensions: 310 x 147 x 87.5 mm (4.3-slots thick)\n\nFrom the above Asus-produced spec list, the Asus GeForce RTX 3070 Noctua Edition doesn't seem very different to every other RTX 3070 card with improved boost clocks (reference card has 1730MHz boost clock) and its sheer size (reference card is 242mm x 112mm x 2-slots thick). Additionally, the reference design has just one 8-pin power connector.\n\nLuckily for us, currently without the product in hand, Noctua provides some more technical background on the new co-engineered graphics card. It says it switched a triple fan (92mm x3) Asus TUF Gaming design to the award-winning Noctua NF-A12x25 120mm units. It also tailored the heatsink design for this dual-fan setup \"to make the most out of the fans\u2019 superior aerodynamic performance, thermals and acoustics\". This has resulted in a \"significant boost in performance-to-noise efficiency,\" according to Noctua CEO Roland Mossig.\n\n\"Asus' GeForce RTX 3070 was certainly an outstanding card already, but we\u2019re confident that the further improved cooling solution of the Noctua Edition will be the cherry on top for noise-conscious customers,\" said Mossig. Nicely for us, Noctua has shared some test charts to provide evidence for its claims of performance / noise efficiency. You can find a selection of the charts below, but more are available to study on the linked Noctua blog post.\n\nThe Asus GeForce RTX 3070 Noctua Edition will become available in the OC Edition with 1845MHz OC boost clock (as outlined in the specs above, as well as a standard edition with 1755MHz OC boost clock. Of course, you can manually OC these dual-BIOS cards. Availability is scheduled for the middle of October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nHEXUS Week In Review: Asus ROG Strix Arion and Seagate Storage Expansion Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 17 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

It noted that in October it would simultaneously drop support for the near-10-year-old Kepler architecture GPUs. Now the time seems to have come, as the latest driver from Nvidia, the GeForce Game Ready 496.13 WHQL driver, enacts both these signposted changes.\nNvidia isn't really publicising the latest driver as one that leaves behind Windows 7 and 8/8.1 users, as well as Kepler GPU owners. That isn't a surprise, as it isn't a positive action from the end user point of view. Instead, it focuses on the optimisations delivered for the newly launched Back 4 Blood (with DLSS), as well as the Crysis Remastered Trilogy, and The Riftbreaker. Meanwhile, DLSS support continues to expand, being added to Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, Chivalry 2, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Sword and Fairy 7. Last but not least this Windows 11 ready driver has added 15 new GeForce Experience Optimal Playable Setting profiles for the latest games.\n\nThe support for Windows 7 and 8, as well as Kepler GPUs being withdrawn, is basically only evidenced by these products not being mentioned any more in the release notes. That is natural, though, why would a set of release notes include lists of stuff that aren't supported (except to note the transition)? The GPUs now supported by this driver are only the Ampere, Turing, Pascal and Maxwell architectures. This is true for both desktop and mobile parts. The GeForce GTX 750 Ti, GTX 750, and GTX 745 (OEM) will continue to get support as despite being in the 700 series they feature Maxwell GPUs.\nOlder OS users, still on Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 are similarly shut off from the latest optimisations and support added in GeForce Game Ready 496.13 WHQL. The last driver for all the hardware/software mentioned above is the 472.12 WHQL version, released on 20th September.\n\nLastly, in moving to the GeForce Game Ready 496.13 WHQL driver, Nvidia is only supplying the DCH (Declarative Componentized Hardware) version of the driver. DCH needs Windows 10 or newer, and is said to facilitate a smaller package (I just checked and the new v472.13 DCH driver is 830MB, but the most recent standard driver v472.12 was 'only' 701MB) and is also claimed to be faster to install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nMicrosoft imagines Xbox 2042 with 1 exaFLOP processor\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 6 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

(PHOTO: Maverick Asio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)  \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images By Krystal Chia (Bloomberg) \u2014 Nearly one-third of Singapore\u2019s residents now support living with Covid-19, a poll showed, after a push by its leader to treat the pathogen as endemic. Some 29% of respondents support such a strategy, according to an online poll conducted by Milieu Insight, a Singapore-based consumer insight and analytics firm, compared to 23% in a prior survey conducted earlier this month after the government tightened some anti-virus measures. About 15% of the 1,201 people queried prefer a strict Covid Zero policy, down from 22%, while 43% prefer a mix of the two approaches, it found.  In a speech on Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pushed for a strategy of living with the virus, as the Southeast Asian nation doubles down on its commitment to shift away from a Covid Zero strategy, a change being followed by stalwarts Australia and New Zealand. Singapore cannot stay closed off indefinitely, though there will continue to be Covid cases, he said. The government unveiled a host of new measures over the weekend, including simplified testing protocols, home-recovery programs and banning unvaccinated people from malls. It also expanded eligibility for booster shots to those aged 30 and above who were fully vaccinated. The poll also found: Levels of frustration with Singapore\u2019s strategy for dealing with and managing Covid dropped to 18% from 28% following Lee\u2019s speech Among the new measures announced, respondents were least supportive of quarantine-free travel lanes Nearly half of respondents said the new policies were \u201cjust right,\u201d while 23% called them \u201csomewhat strict\u201d  \u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

As such, Deathloop is one of those games that support both NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s FSR techs. So, we\u2019ve decided to benchmark and compare these two upscaling techniques.\nFor these benchmarks, we used an Intel i9 9900K with 16GB of DDR4 at 3600Mhz, and NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 3080. We also used Windows 10 64-bit and the GeForce 496.13 driver.\n\nBelow you can find some comparison screenshots between native resolution (left), DLSS (middle) and FSR (right).\n     \n\nAs we can clearly see, NVIDIA DLSS does a better job than AMD FSR. After all, the game looks just as good as native 4K resolution when using NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode. On the other hand, and even in Ultra Quality, AMD FSR looks noticeably blurrier.\nNot only does DLSS looks better, but it also runs faster than FSR.\u00a0 On our RTX3080, we saw a 10fps performance boost when using DLSS over FSR. This is one of the best implementations of DLSS, and we highly recommend using it.\n\nAll in all, NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS is wonderfully implemented in Deathloop. Thus, and if you own an RTX GPU, we strongly recommend enabling it. By using NVIDIA DLSS Quality Mode, we were able to run the game with constant 60fps in 4K/Ultra/Ray Tracing. And while AMD FSR was also able to provide a constant 60fps experience, the image quality with DLSS is miles better than what FSR is currently offering.\nLastly, It would be really cool if more games supported both DLSS and FSR. I know this is me daydreaming, but all games (whether or not they are AMD/NVIDIA-sponsored) should support both of them. Thus, owners of RTX GPUs can choose the best option, whereas owners of AMD\u2019s GPUs (and older NVIDIA GTX GPUs) can simply use FSR in order to improve their performance (especially in ray-traced games).\nJohn PapadopoulosJohn is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.

While he is a die-hard PC gamer, his gaming roots can be found on consoles. John loved \u2013 and still does \u2013 the 16-bit consoles, and considers SNES to be one of the best consoles. Still, the PC platform won him over consoles. That was mainly due to 3DFX and its iconic dedicated 3D accelerator graphics card, Voodoo 2. John has also written a higher degree thesis on the \u201cThe Evolution of PC graphics cards.\u201d\nContact: Email\n \nArkane StudiosBethesdaDeathloop\n\nPost navigation\n\nPrevious PostThe Day Before releases in June 2022, gets brand new gameplay footageNext PostCall of Duty Rio Mod for COD4: Modern Warfare is available for download \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLoad Comments\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Stories\n\n\n\nSILENT HILL f gets official PC system requirements\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX 30 and RTX 20 series GPUs also suffer from black screen crashes under certain conditions\n\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Patch 1.2 Released, Is 62GB, Packs Over 1000 Fixes\n\n\n\nCS:Legacy is a fully standalone fan remake of Counter-Strike 1.6\n\n\n\ninZOI gets detailed PC requirements, will support Ray Tracing\n\n\n\nOnimusha: Warlords just got a must-have 4K Texture Pack\n\n\n\nHere are the first images for Mortal Kombat 2 Movie\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Shadows suffers from major optimization issues on NVIDIA GPUs\n\n\n\nWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 3 is in active development\n\n\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight just got an amazing X-Men Wolverine Mod\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPC Games News, Screenshots, Trailers & More\n\nHome\nNews/Screens/Videos\n\nNews\nScreen-News\nVideo-News\n\n\nArticles\n\nPC Performance Analyses\nFirst Impressions\nArticles\n\n\nSpecial\n\nUser\u2019s Articles\nReviews\nPreviews\n\n\nPatches\nMods\nBest Mods Articles\nPC Games System Requirements\nEditorial\nInterviews\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDSOGaming\t\t\t\t\n\nTerms Of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\n\u00a9 2024 DSOGaming | DSOGaming.com\nManage Cookie Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Participants in the upcoming global NVIDIA GTC conference will have the opportunity to discover over 70 innovative AI start-ups from around the world. The start-ups, which are innovating for sectors ranging from automotive to industrial safety, are participants in NVIDIA\u2019s Inception programme that supports start-up growth. Serge Lemonde, Global Head of NVIDIA Inception, explains: \u201cNVIDIA Inception is a programme for start-ups that provides critical co-marketing support, training and technology. All of the company\u2019s engineers have access to hands-on, cloud-based training through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, preferred pricing on hardware via our global network of distributors, invitations to exclusive networking events, opportunities to engage with venture capital partners and more. These benefits were specifically crafted to provide start-ups faster time to market, as well as platform acceleration, which delivers increased ROI.\u201dNVIDIA Inception has always been a key pillar of GTC, where over 200 000 AI innovators, technologists and creators will gather virtually this year for four days of knowledge-sharing and networking.This year, the NVIDIA Inception track at GTC features 70+ members, 39 of which are from EMEA, covering topics across automotive, agriculture, media and entertainment, healthcare, financial services, industrial safety and conversational AI.Says Lemonde: \u201cInception members are well represented across all sessions \u2013 not just the\u00a0Inception track. Many of our members have matured significantly since they first joined the programme and have exciting product updates to share. GTC is the right place for them to raise awareness and to reach future investors, customers and partners.\u201dGTC will also feature talks of interest to start-ups, including an Executive Strategy session and discussion on the NVIDIA Inception Venture Capital Alliance, a discussion on how to get the most out of the NVIDIA Inception programme, and a panel discussion on how start-ups are leading AI transformation in Africa.GTC, with nearly 500 free sessions, multiple tracks and in-depth training and workshops, will also feature highlights such as\u00a0Braindates,\u00a0where attendees will have the chance to network with others one-on-one or in small groups, as well as\u00a0two-hour-long free training sessions from NVIDIA DLI and full-day workshops on 8 November. Training will cover topics including 'An Introduction to Learning Deep Learning', 'Developer Tools Fundamentals for RayTracing', 'Accelerating and Scaling Inference with NVIDIA GPUs', and more.NVIDIA GTC will be held from 8-11 November and is free to attend.

If your hardware includes a recent Xbox console, then your options just widened by a huge amount. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now, a streaming platform that uses remote hardware to stream PC games to phones, tablets, and TVs (among other things), now works on the Edge browser. And because the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S can run Edge, it works on them, too. \nGeForce Now is perhaps the most impressive of the various options for high-end game streaming on the market, at least in terms of variety and accessibility. The service streams hundreds of popular games on several tiers, including a free option. But unlike Google\u2019s Stadia, which asks players to buy games one-by-one, or the Xbox Game Pass, which takes a Netflix-style subscription approach, GeForce Now leans on the collection of games that PC players have already built up. The service allows you to log into existing game stores \u2014 Steam, Epic, GOG, Ubisoft Connect \u2014 and access the games you\u2019ve already purchased. Not every game from every store is supported, but the list is over a thousand games long, including over 70 free to play games, and growing every week. \n\n\nGeForce Now works in Edge on the Xbox the same way it does in a browser on a PC (or an iOS device). Open the Edge browser and head to Play.GeForceNow.com and log into the service to try it out. (You might want to try it on your computer to set up a few games first.) The system supports playing via the standard Xbox controller or mouse and keyboard. \nTrying out the service on the Xbox One X, The Verge\u2018s Tom Warren found it a clunky experience at best. While the visual acuity is impressive, the extra lag present when playing via the browser and the somewhat distracting addition of the console-style control cursor means it\u2019s a long way from smooth. Casual games might be playable like this, but fast-paced multiplayer titles aren\u2019t really in the cards. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now play Steam PC games on an Xbox with Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now. Here's a quick look at how it all works. Details here: https://t.co/EMGX0HRxcT pic.twitter.com/G6YcloBubM\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) October 25, 2021\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia hasn\u2019t actually highlighted playing GeForce Now through Edge on the Xbox as an intended use of the service. It\u2019s possible that the company will test and tweak its support for the console, but at the moment it seems more focused on expanding its selection of games and improving the backend hardware. Just last week Nvidia announced a new tier of the service that allows gamers to play their library on a cloud-based RTX 3080 graphics card, at resolutions up to 1440p and 120Hz. This enhanced remote hardware will cost you $100 for a six-month subscription. \nWhile the GeForce Now access is neat, it\u2019s more of a novelty for now. Xbox players who want to get their stream on will probably be inclined to stick with the popular Xbox Game Pass. For $15 a month it offers unlimited play of a library of over 400 titles, split between the Xbox and PC. Some (not all) of those games can be also be streamed to Android, iOS, and Windows PCs. If you have a gaming PC on the same local network, you can also stream local PC games to your Xbox with the Wireless Display app. \n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

With Intel announcing its range of upcoming Arc GPUs, with the first being the Alchemist, there has been interest in how well it's likely to perform against its competitors. Recent developments now reveal what the hardware's specs will be, with a source indicating that it could be a rival for some already-released top graphics cards. \nAccording to a report, Intel has now confirmed what the specifications of its first Arc GPU will be, with a launch window expecting to be in the first quarter of 2022. At this year's InnovatiON event, the tech giant revealed that the maiden graphics card in the brand will have 32 Xe Cores, each of which will have 16 Vector Engines and 16 Matrix Engines, which equates to 512 Execution Units.\nRELATED: Intel CEO Believes Semiconductor Shortage Will Continue Until 2023 as Share Prices Drop\nTo put that into perspective, the report goes on, this means the Arc Alchemist is still on target to beat out some of the most powerful Nvidia or AMD graphics cards on the current market. With the specs given, it means Intel's hardware could rival the likes of the Nvidia RTX 3070 which was launched this summer, and has 8 GB of VRAM. While the report doesn't say anything about how the Alchemist will compare to a modern AMD GPU, the equivalent to the \"green team's\" hardware would likely be the RX 6700 XT, which came out a little sooner than its Nvidia rival, and has 12 GB of VRAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This means that earlier rumors that the Intel GPU would match the 3070, or even the 3070 Ti, may be true after all. One thing the company was able to show off at this year's event was the Alchemist's XeSS technology. This is Intel's equivalent of Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR upscaling features, which are fast becoming the industry standard for modern games in terms of graphical fidelity.\nIt's hard to say at this stage how well the hardware will do, but it's looking more like it should be able to take on the big leagues right from the starting block. While recent benchmark tests showed concern over Alchemist's performance, these were just brief glimpses into a product that is still being worked on. Once Intel launches its GPU, then people will know how it stacks up against the rest. The only problem then is whether it will be able to meet demand during these tumultuous tech times.\nMORE: Intel Has a Chance to Hit the Ground Running With Its Arc GPUs\nSource: PC Gamer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nIntel\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSony Reportedly Working on Fix for PS5 Pro Issue\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nNew reports indicate that Sony could be working to fix one of the worst issues that have plagued the PlayStation 5 Pro since its launch.\n\n\nPosts\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nGabriel Machado Pureza\n\n\nJan 24, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSony Working on PlayStation Controller With Unique Feature\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nCharming Holiday\n\n\nMar 11, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSome PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition Pre-Orders Are Being Canceled\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nMatthew Schomer\n\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAtari Reveals New Console\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nOph\u00e9lie Castelot\n\n\nAug 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS5 Pro Packaging Has Interesting Spin on Console's Lack of a Disc Drive\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nNov 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPS2 is No Longer the Best-Selling Video Game Console of All Time in the US\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPosts\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nAaron McKinley\n\n\nDec 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t'I Hope That's Not A ...

I write about CIOs and the strategic use of technology by businesses.Oct 04, 2021, 04:00pm EDTUpdated Apr 21, 2022, 08:18am EDTShareSaveCommentArm CEO Simon SegarsArm\nOn a sideboard in his office in San Jose, California, Simon Segars, the CEO of Arm, has a 1980s-era Motorola DynaTAC mobile phone on display that\u2019s the size of a small brick. Segars, who became the company\u2019s top executive in 2013 and lives near its U.S. headquarters, picks up the device, which he bought on eBay, and slips off the battery pack to show a visiting reporter line after line of text printed on the back of the phone\u2019s body. They\u2019re basic instructions for how to use it.\n\n\nOver the past few decades, mobile phones have gone from brick to slick, packing huge amounts of computing power into slim packages of brushed metal with touch-sensitive screens. Arm, which was founded in 1990 in a converted barn just outside of Cambridge in the U.K. and still has its global headquarters in the city, may not be a household name, but it\u2019s played a pivotal role in this transition. Its 7,000-plus employees dream up the super energy-efficient processors that are the silicon brains of most of the world\u2019s smartphones and which are also found in everything from autonomous vehicles to cloud-computing servers and supercomputers.\n\nArm doesn\u2019t make chips; instead, it licenses its designs and software development tools to other companies who use them to build and manufacture microprocessors\u2014a business that generated almost $2 billion in revenue in its latest full fiscal year. Over 100 billion Arm-based chips have been shipped by manufacturers in the past five years. The company\u2019s success has attracted some notable suitors: In 2013 Japan\u2019s SoftBank paid $32 billion for Arm and in September 2020 U.S. chip giant Nvidia launched a cash-plus-shares bid for it that\u2019s currently worth $54 billion. The proposed transaction, which has SoftBank\u2019s backing, is being reviewed by regulators in the U.S., U.K., China and the European Union.\n\nRipple effects\nArm\u2019s relationships with its 580 licensees around the world, who include chip giants such as Qualcomm, Samsung and Marvell, plus Segars\u2019 role as chair of the Global Semiconductor Alliance, an industry group with some 250 corporate members, give the 53-year-old executive a unique perspective on the chip supply crisis that\u2019s causing chaos in industry after industry.\n\nSegars believes there aren\u2019t any quick fixes. \u201cI think it will take a few years for all of the ripples to work their way through,\u201d he says. That suggests a period of prolonged pain for the auto industry, which has been hardest hit by the shortage. Manufacturers such as General Motors, Toyota and Ford have cut back production and, in some cases, idled factories as they struggle to get enough chips for vehicles. Consulting firm Alix Partners estimates that the silicon supply squeeze could cost the auto industry $210 billion in lost sales this year.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Segars, is that the swift onset of Covid-19 and fears about the spread of its variants have caused business sentiment to fluctuate wildly. \u201cEverything got tossed up in the air. You know, we\u2019re predicting doom and gloom one minute and glory the next, and then it\u2019s back to doom and gloom.\u201d That\u2019s made it particularly hard for manufacturers to estimate likely demand, which has rebounded faster than expected in some sectors.\nWhen carmakers and other companies slashed sales forecasts as the pandemic began, they triggered even deeper cutbacks in suppliers\u2019 production plans\u2014a phenomenon supply chain experts call \u201cthe bullwhip effect.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s this amplification of uncertainty as you work your way down the supply chain,\u201d says Morris Cohen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. Expanding production again isn\u2019t always easy, adds Cohen, especially in the chip industry, where new manufacturing plants cost billions of dollars, take a year or more to build and yet more time to fine tune.Everything got tossed up in the air. You know, we\u2019re predicting doom and gloom one minute and glory the next, and then it\u2019s back to doom and gloom.\nSimon Segars, CEO, Arm\nSuspicions that some buyers are hoarding chips have added to the uncertainty. Things have gotten so bad that U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo recently said the Biden administration is considering invoking the Cold War-era Defense Production Act to help identify bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. The law could be used to compel companies to share information about chip stocks and manufacturing or purchasing plans.\nSegars thinks the industry needs to work harder to fix things itself. \u201cThere could be an increase in openness between actors within the [chip] supply chain about what they need, inventory levels, predicted demand and lead time changes,\u201d he says, adding this would help change the dynamic \u201cfrom a collection of transactional relationships where one side wants to spend the least and the other side wants to make the most.\u201d\nHyperconnected computing\nLooking beyond the current supply crunch, Arm\u2019s boss, who joined the company in 1991 as its 16th employee and has been awarded multiple patents as an engineer, is excited by a series of technological advances that are converging to create huge new markets and money-making opportunities.\nArtificial intelligence (AI), the rise of 5G wireless connectivity and the proliferation of tiny sensors that collect and share data from machines of all kinds are already transforming many businesses. \u201cThis hyperconnected world of things, as opposed to just people carrying smartphones, enables all of this data to get moved. And then AI as a technology helps process and get insight from [it]\u201d says Segars. \u201cI think this opens up a whole new realm of computing\u201d.\nThe pandemic is accelerating the rate of change, as companies collect and analyze more data from offices and factories to ensure workers can return to them safely. That\u2019s led to a spending spree on connected devices such as motion sensors and cameras, many of which use Arm-based chips. The company says 25 billion processors based on its designs were shipped in 2020, a 10% year-over-year increase, and forecasts that 300 billion more will follow over the next 10 years.There could be an increase in openness between actors within the [chip] supply chain about what they need, inventory levels, predicted demand and lead time changes.\nSimon Segars, CEO, Arm\nAlthough there\u2019ll still be a need for general purpose microprocessors, Segars believes more and more chips will be built to handle specific tasks. It\u2019s a shift that\u2019s already playing out in the AI world where specialized semiconductors now power things such as neural networks, or machine learning algorithms loosely modeled on aspects of the human brain and nervous system. \u201cIf you [create] a dedicated processor for machine learning, you end up with something way more efficient,\u201d says Segars.\nA conviction that Arm needs significant new investment to help it seize this and other opportunities led him to negotiate the acquisition deal with Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s charismatic CEO, who\u2019s transformed his company into a semiconductor powerhouse with a $511 billion market cap thanks to its leadership in chips for gaming, AI and other uses. Since the bid was announced last year, its value has risen from $40 billion to $54 billion, as Nvidia\u2019s share price has soared on the back of impressive sales numbers. In August 2020, the company said revenues in its latest fiscal quarter hit a new record of just over $6.5 billion.\nSegars and Huang have spent the past year proselytizing a marriage between their respective companies and addressing opposition to it. Some Arm licensees such as Qualcomm are concerned the deal will allow Nvidia to restrict their access to Arm\u2019s intellectual property and would prefer that the company pursue an IPO rather than a sale. Segars has said in a blog post that Arm considered a public offering but decided against it because it would lead to a focus on short-term profitability that would harm the company\u2019s ability to innovate.\nRegulatory hurdles\nThe fate of Nvidia\u2019s bid now rests in the hands of regulators and politicians. The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority has already conducted an initial review of it. Dr. Andrea Coscelli, the agency\u2019s chief executive, said in August that it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the transaction\u2019s potential impact on competition and recommended the U.K. government allow it to scrutinize the bid in even more detail. A decision on whether to proceed with a deeper probe is expected soon. Last month, Nvidia asked the European Union\u2019s antitrust division to begin a review of the transaction, which also needs approvals from U.S. and Chinese regulators.\nSegars and Huang face geopolitical concerns as well as competition ones. The U.K. has launched a separate national security review of the bid for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear, though local opponents of the combination have claimed Nvidia is likely to shift people and knowhow to the U.S., harming the U.K.\u2019s innovation ecosystem.Arm's global headquarters in Cambridge, U.K.Hundven-Clements Photography\nThen there\u2019s China, where Arm has a significant joint venture that sells to local chipmakers. Over the past few years, the U.S. government has restricted Chinese companies\u2019 access to advanced semiconductor tech from U.S. and foreign suppliers, so the prospect of a British-based firm that provides key intellectual property for Chinese chips being acquired by a U.S. bidder is bound to attract scrutiny from Beijing. \u201cThe China angle is the biggest unknown,\u201d says Timothy Arcuri, a managing director at investment bank UBS. In 2018 Chinese regulators declined approval for Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors and the U.S. company ultimately walked away from the transaction, but in 2019 they cleared Nvidia\u2019s $6.9 bid for Israeli chip design firm Mellanox Technologies, which has significant operations in China.\nArm and Nvidia now face the task of convincing skeptical licensees, regulators and politicians that their competition and/or security concerns are misplaced\u2014a process that could run well into 2022, if it isn\u2019t derailed beforehand. Both companies argue that by combining their forces, they can produce more innovations, bring them to market faster and reach a greater combined audience of developers. Nvidia has also publicly committed to maintaining Arm\u2019s open-licensing model and to making significant investments in R&D in the U.K.\n\u201cWe think that the pure merits of this deal are really, really strong,\u201d says Segars. \u201cAnd we\u2019re spending a lot of time explaining to regulators where Arm sits in the industry and how this [combination] is going to create more dynamism in the market.\u201d Those explanations will help determine whether Arm\u2019s boss eventually gets to put a plaque commemorating the successful completion of Nvidia\u2019s bid alongside the DynaTAC sitting on his San Jose sideboard.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Nvidia just upgraded its GeForce Now subscription game streaming service with the RTX 3080 tier, which promises gamers the performance of a GeForce RTX 3080 in the cloud. Well, sort of. You see, it's actually an Nvidia A10G GPU in the cloud, which is both better and worse than an RTX 3080 from a performance and features standpoint \u2014 more on that below. The RTX 3080 is still our top pick for the best graphics cards, contingent upon actually finding one for close to the recommended price. Also, it's in the cloud, which inherently limits what you can do with the GPU. This can be good and bad.\n\nFor example, there's no cryptocurrency mining using GeForce Now. Yay! Users are also allocated a GPU solely for their use, while the CPU gets shared between two users. Unfortunately, you're limited to games that are supported on the GeForce Now platform, and while there are many Steam, Epic, GoG, and Ubisoft games that will run on GeForce Now, there are plenty of missing titles as well: Borderlands 3 (and all the rest of the series), Dirt 5, Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, and Red Dead Redemption 2 are just a few of the missing games. Also, anything that requires the Microsoft Store is out.\n\nBut it's not just about the games and hardware. One of the biggest barriers to PC gaming right now is the lack of graphics cards. Unless you want to pay eBay GPU prices, which still tend to be 50\u2013100 percent higher than the official MSRPs, it's virtually impossible to buy a graphics card. That goes double for the RTX 3080. During the past couple of weeks, the average price on RTX 3080 cards purchased on eBay still sits at nearly $1,700, more than double the nominal price.\n\nWhat if you could forget about the difficulty of buying a graphics card and simply rent the performance in the cloud? That's the theory behind the latest upgrades to GeForce Now. The RTX 3080 tier supports up to 2560x1440 resolution gaming, and even streams at 120 fps. Nvidia also claims improved latencies \u2014 supposedly better than playing locally on a latest generation Xbox Series X. The cost for this tier is $100 every six months.\n\nThat might seem steep, but considering an RTX 3080 might cost $1,500 or more, that's seven and a half years of GeForce Now streaming. Or, you know, however long it takes for GPU prices and availability to return to normal. Theoretically, you could pay for the service for six months, or even two years, and then when the current shortages and extreme retail pricing fades away, you can upgrade your home PC.\n\nIt's not the worst idea we've ever heard, but how does the new RTX 3080 tier of GeForce Now actually perform? And how does it compare to running games locally on an RTX 3080? We set out to do some testing to see for ourselves. Let's quickly start with the basics.GeForce Now Superpod Hardware(Image credit: Nvidia)The new GeForce Now Superpods come packed with a lot of hardware. Nvidia didn't want to get into all the specifics, unfortunately for us because we love that kind of detail, but we do know that each Superpod houses a bunch of rack mounted servers equipped with Threadripper 3955X CPUs and Nvidia A10G graphics cards.\n\nThe Nvidia A10G isn't the same as an RTX 3080, and we assume it's basically the same core hardware as the datacenter Nvidia A10. It comes equipped with 24GB of GDDR6 memory \u2014 the same amount you'd get with an RTX 3090! Except, the VRAM runs at 12.5Gbps (probably to save power), giving you 600GBps of bandwidth. However, it has 9,216 CUDA cores where an RTX 3080 has 8,704 CUDA cores, so in theory it should be comparable to an RTX 3080: more memory, more compute, less memory bandwidth.\n\nThe Threadripper 3955X is a Zen 2 processor with two 8-core compute chiplets. Nvidia allocates all of the cores and threads from one chiplet to a single user, which should improve overall performance since it keeps commonly accessed data local to the chiplet that way. Clock speeds are 3.9\u20134.3GHz on the 3955X, but because it's the older Zen 2 architecture it's probably a bit slower for gaming purposes than many of AMD's and Intel's latest chips. Still, it shouldn't be a serious bottleneck for gaming at 1440p, especially when doing so from the cloud.\n\nBesides the CPU and GPU, each RTX 3080 GeForce Now instance gets 28GB of DDR4-3200 memory and access to around 30TB of fast PCIe Gen4 SSD storage. When you put everything together, the total cost per GeForce Now instance has to run at least $2,000. But Nvidia doesn't expect people to use these instances 24/7, so even though users only pay $16.67 per month for unlimited streaming (limited to eight hour sessions at a time), Nvidia presumably allocates dozens of users per installed set of hardware.\n\nWe asked a bunch of other questions about the GeForce Now Superpods, but unfortunately Nvidia didn't want to provide answers or photos. These look similar to the A100 Superpods, but the individual servers are obviously quite different. Our back of the napkin math (based on Nvidia's statement that each Superpod houses 8,960 CPU cores and 11,477,760 CUDA cores, plus the above photo), is that there are 20 racks per Superpod, with each rack housing 28 servers. Each server would come equipped with a single Threadripper Pro 3955X and two Nvidia A10G GPUs.\n\nExcept, that works out to 10,321,920 CUDA cores, so the A10G may actually look more like an RTX 3080 Ti with double the VRAM. 10,240 CUDA cores per A10G would give us 11,468,800 CUDA cores spread out over 1,120 GPUs, and the 'missing' 8,960 CUDA cores could be located in Nvidia Bluefield network devices. Or perhaps there's some other explanation, but that's all we've got for now. We do know that Nvidia says each Superpod supports \"over 1,000 concurrent users,\" which jives with most of the other numbers.GeForce Now Bandwidth Requirements(Image credit: Nvidia)Before we get into the comparisons, let's get this out of the way: GeForce Now, like any game streaming service, requires a decent internet connection. It's not too onerous, though, with a 30Mbps download speed as the baseline, and 50Mbps as the maximum configurable stream quality. I did some testing and found that using the default Balanced connection settings (30Mbps), actual data usage was typically in the 20\u201330 Mbps range, averaging around 25Mbps. That works out to about 11GB of data per hour. Using the Custom option and selecting the maximum quality (50Mbps, 2560x1440, 120 fps, and no automatic network speed adjustments), data use wasn't actually that much higher: about 30Mbps, or 13.5 GB per hour.\n\nHow you feel about that amount of data usage will depend very much on your internet provider. I used to have Comcast Xfinity, which cost me around $110 per month for the X-Fi Complete package with unlimited data, or $100 a month with a 1.2TB data cap (technically 1228GB), and charged $10 for each additional 50GB up to a maximum of $100 per month. The data cap sucked, mostly because of multiple game downloads and updates every month that could easily consume hundreds of GB of data, and my household routinely came close to that limit. Paying an extra $10 for unlimited data was an easy fix, though you'd need to check whether your provider offers unlimited data and how much it charges.\n\nWith a data cap of 1TB, which unfortunately still seems relatively common these days, that's enough for about 75 hours of GeForce Now gaming each month \u2014 assuming no one does anything else with the internet. It's basically equivalent to the amount of data used by streaming 4K movies and television. But seriously, if you have a data cap and play games a lot, or stream TV and play games, forget about game streaming services or look into upgrading to an unlimited plan first. (For the record, I moved and now have faster Internet via TDS for about $97 a month, with no data cap. Hallelujah!)\n\nIf you think 30 or 50 Mbps seems like a lot, it's good to put things into perspective. The source data for 2560x1440 at 120 fps would require 14.16 Gbps without compression. Yeah, we're not getting that level of bandwidth into our homes any time soon. We're basically looking at about a 300:1 compression ratio, using lossy video compression algorithms because that's the only way to make this work.Wired or Wireless Networking?(Image credit: Shutterstock)The next thing you need to consider is whether you'll be using wired or wireless networking \u2014 or possibly both. Nvidia recommends wired connections, which makes sense. Wireless connections are far less predictable. Despite having a strong signal (>400Mbps down and 20Mbps up), when I tried GeForce Now on a laptop I ended up with a lot of intermittent lag. Playing off a wired connection fixed the problem.\n\nYour particular network setup and devices will play a role, however. Maybe my router isn't the best, or perhaps the wireless adapter in my laptop was to blame. Or maybe there was some other interference causing issues. If you can use a wired gigabit (or faster) Ethernet connection, that will undoubtedly work best. If not, try to stay close to your router and perhaps downgrade the resolution and framerate to 1080p at 60 fps.\n\nGeForce Now works on Android smartphones and tablets, Chromebooks, MacBooks, and of course Windows. Some people claim to have gotten it to work on Linux as well, but that's not officially supported \u2014 and neither are iOS devices. Some of these options often lack wired connections, in which case you'd again be better off with the $50 per six month tier of GeForce Now.GeForce Now RTX 3080 Availability\u00a0The GeForce Now RTX 3080 tier has officially rolled out, but it's not available at all GeForce Now installations. Specifically, you'll want to check this page to see if you have a reasonably close node that will work. I'm in Colorado (US Mountain region), but the US Midwest region provided a good result while the US West region basically failed the latency test. The GeForce Now client software does check for optimal region selection automatically, and you can start with the free tier of service to see what it selects.\n\nNvidia will continue upgrading its GeForce Now data centers with the new Superpods, but there's no indication of how quickly that will happen. Note also that, like the original GeForce Now Founders Edition, the RTX 3080 tier has a limited number of slots available. Presumably, more slots will be added over time, but Nvidia doesn't want too many people signing up for something when it doesn't have the infrastructure in place to support those users. Nvidia wouldn't tell us the ratio of users to hardware that it's using.\n\nBottom line: If you want the benefits of the RTX 3080 tier, you'll probably want to jump on it quickly and subscribe.GeForce Now Test Setup(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)For these tests, I've used a PC equipped with a Core i5-11400F CPU, 16GB of DDR4-3200 memory, with an RTX 3080 Founders Edition for the local GPU testing. It also has SSD storage for the games, and it's connected to an Acer Predator X27 monitor (for 144Hz support). I also tested on an Ice Lake i7-1065G7 laptop with a 4K display (set to 1440p) for wireless testing, but that wasn't a pleasant experience.\n\nMy main goal here was to compare actual performance using in-game benchmarks (you can't capture frametimes for games running on GeForce Now), and also to look at image quality. I also played some games running off the service, which you can read about in the experiential gaming section below.\n\nNote that GeForce Now RTX 3080 tier also supports 4K and 60 fps streaming, but only if you have a Shield TV. I didn't test this, and in general I'd prefer 1440p and 120 fps just because that should improve both latency and performance \u2014 4K gaming tends to be a bit too demanding in a lot of games, even with an RTX 3080 equivalent. Nvidia hasn't enabled 4K support on PCs due to the wide disparity in video decoding hardware, but don't be surprised if that shows up somewhere down the road (with a minimum requirement of a 6th Gen Intel CPU or better).\n\nDue to the limited selection of games available on GeForce now (as I noted above, Borderlands 3, Dirt 5, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Red Dead Redemption 2 are all unavailable on GeForce Now, which is sad as they all have useful built-in benchmarks), I've tested with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Far Cry 6, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Watch Dogs Legion. Three of those games come from Ubisoft and ran off Ubisoft Connect, while Shadow of the Tomb Raider used Steam.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion and Shadow of the Tomb Raider both support ray tracing effects as well, so we tested that. Unfortunately, while Far Cry 6 supports ray tracing, it uses DirectX 12 Ultimate, and that's not currently supported on Windows Server 2016. Nvidia says it's working on upgrading to Windows Server 2022, which will allow DX12 Ultimate games to work with ray tracing enabled. We manually configured GeForce Now for 2560x1440 and 120 fps, set Windows to 2560x1440 and 144Hz with G-Sync enabled, and proceeded to run some tests.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Assassin's Creed ValhallaImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now streaming(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now streamingIn terms of performance, Assassin's Creed Valhalla establishes a pattern we'll see repeated in the other games. Average performance at 1440p ultra was 66 fps, while running locally an RTX 3080 delivered performance of 91 fps \u2014 38% faster. That's actually the worst result, relative to the RTX 3080, that we'll see in the games we tested. We suspect it might be a CPU bottleneck, as Valhalla can be pretty demanding in that area, but it may also be due to VRAM bandwidth or some other factors.\n\nYou'll want to look at the full resolution images (click the expand icon in the bottom-right, then click \"View original\") for the image quality comparisons, as the resized images are highly compressed and lose quite a bit of detail. Ignoring the slightly different colors and different camera position, there's clearly a loss of crispness with the GeForce Now screen captures. The text and line chart also show the loss of detail, and it basically looks like a decent upscaling filter was used on a 1080p source.\n\nPerhaps a more apt comparison would be with something like FSR and DLSS. We recently did some in-depth comparisons of those two upscaling solutions, and at higher settings there's a lot of fuzziness that you start to notice when playing games. It's not terrible, and neither is GeForce Now, but don't expect to end up with sharp images like you'd get without compressing and streaming the frames over the internet.Far Cry 6Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now streaming(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now streamingNext up, Far Cry 6 just came out earlier this month, and we ran a bunch of Far Cry 6 benchmarks. The GeForce Now version doesn't allow the use of ray tracing or HD textures, for now, so we just used the ultra preset. Performance this time was quite a bit closer, with the RTX 3080 achieving 95 fps locally while the GeForce now ran at 78 fps. That's still 22% faster, and based on our GPU benchmarks hierarchy, we'd say the RTX 3080 tier in GeForce Now performs more like an RTX 3070 than a 3080 (or maybe RTX 3070 Ti in some cases). Except you have triple the VRAM amount.\n\nThe colors and saturation of the GeForce Now screenshot are again different from the locally captured frame, which is a bit interesting (see how to take screenshots in Windows). Most likely some of that comes from the video stream compression, though it could just be variations in the lighting for a particular benchmark run. We don't see these differences in the other two games, though.\n\nAs with Valhalla, the streamed version of Far Cry 6 looks a bit fuzzy around the edges. There's a loss of detail on the street, sidewalk, and walls, and you can really see the blurriness in the leaves on the trees as well as in the balcony railing (roughly in the center of the screenshot). This is all thanks to the heavy video stream compression that's required to send the data over the internet. The fact that all of this happens with relatively minimal latency (more on that below) is quite impressive, even if the image quality ultimately suffers.Shadow of the Tomb RaiderImage 1 of 8(Image credit: Square Enix)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Square Enix)GeForce Now streaming(Image credit: Square Enix)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Square Enix)GeForce Now streaming(Image credit: Square Enix)RTX 3080 ray tracing local(Image credit: Square Enix)GeForce Now ray tracing streaming(Image credit: Square Enix)RTX 3080 ray tracing local(Image credit: Square Enix)GeForce Now ray tracing streamingShadow of the Tomb Raider has been around for about three years now. We've included both normal and ray traced results in our testing, though you can see how little the ray traced shadows actually matter. Basically, the shadows get a bit fuzzier for objects that are further away from the light source. Is it better? Sure, probably. Is it worth a 30% hit to performance? Nope.\n\nPerformance of the local RTX 3080 was closer here than in the first two games, as the 3080 was only 16% faster than the GFN A10G. That's without ray tracing enabled, and turning on RT closes the performance gap to just 10%. We're also getting close to the 120 fps limit of GeForce Now, though we disabled vsync so it should be able to go higher than that.\n\nIn terms of image quality, the fuzziness is still present, but it's not quite as visible as before. We also don't see any color shifts this time. Also note that while these still images tend to emphasize any loss in visual fidelity, when you're running around in a game the fuzziness is far less noticeable. It's still there, and some people will inevitably get irritated by it, but it's no worse than FSR balanced mode I'd say.Watch Dogs LegionImage 1 of 10(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now streaming(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now streaming(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 ray tracing with DLSS Quality mode local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now ray tracing with DLSS Quality mode streaming(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 ray tracing with DLSS Quality mode local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now ray tracing with DLSS Quality mode streaming(Image credit: Ubisoft)RTX 3080 ray tracing without DLSS local(Image credit: Ubisoft)GeForce Now ray tracing without DLSS streamingOur final game comparison, Watch Dogs Legion tells a similar story to the above games. Performance of the local RTX 3080 was 12% faster without ray tracing, and 16% faster with ray tracing enabled (using DLSS Quality mode). We also tested at native resolution with ray tracing, without DLSS, and the RTX 3080 was only 8% faster (52 vs. 48 fps).\n\nThere's an interesting tangent here with DLSS. We tested with and without DLSS, as well as using both the quality and performance modes. With GeForce Now, changing DLSS from Quality to Performance didn't seem to affect performance at all, while on the RTX 3080 Performance mode tends to be about 15% faster. It's not clear if this is just a GeForce Now bug or if there's something else going on, but regardless, performance between the 3080 and the streaming service was pretty close.\n\nWe have two sets of image quality comparisons as well. The first (taken from the benchmark sequence) shows the same blurriness and loss of detail that we've noticed elsewhere. Perhaps that's because the game was in motion, meaning the video compression has to be more lossy to stay within its 50Mbps budget. The second set, by the lake, is taken while we're standing still, and since the video compression uses data from previous frames, it can achieve a better result in terms of details. The temporal aspect of video compression ends up being a bit like DLSS, allowing for better results when there's less stuff happening on screen.Gaming via GeForce Now, Including the Free Tier(Image credit: Nvidia)\u00a0So far, all of the testing has been focused on performance and image quality, but what's it like to actually play games on GeForce Now? You'd think with the need to send data over the internet, collect that and use it to update the game world, and then send it all back over the wire to your home that the increase in lag would be very noticeable. The reality is that I personally found it totally playable. Disclaimer: Yeah, I'm older and wouldn't call myself a competitive gamer, but I can hold my own in most multiplayer games.\n\nThe type of game does matter, of course. Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Watch Dogs Legion, Control, and Cyberpunk 2077 all tend to be less twitch-focused and I had no complaints with any of them. In shooters like Far Cry 6, the ~40ms increase in latency felt a bit more noticeable. We didn't perform extensive latency testing, but Nvidia's claims of 40ms seemed to be accurate for our location.\n\nFrankly, I was quite surprised at how good the experience of playing games via GeForce Now was. I've tried a few game streaming services in the past, including GeForce Now, and the latency was always far more noticeable before. Either I'm less tuned in to the latency, or things are simply better with the RTX 3080 tier \u2014 or probably a little of both. GeForce Now reported a ping latency of just 33ms on my connection, which is only two frames on a 60Hz display. That's totally fine for my needs, assuming I needed a game streaming service.(Image credit: Ubisoft)After testing the RTX 3080 GeForce Now service for the past few days, I figured I needed a second opinion on the matter, so I signed up for a free account. Wow. What a difference that made! The hardware was noticeably slower, framerates couldn't maintain a steady 60 fps, and even at 1080p, ultra quality in many games was no longer a viable option. Once I dropped to 1080p medium in Far Cry 6, though, it wasn't too bad and I found myself enjoying the game \u2014 right up until I got booted after the one hour time limit was reached.\n\nThe loss in image quality, specifically the overall fuzziness of the stream, was also much more noticeable. However, it wasn't something that I couldn't ignore, and particularly in the midst of fights \u2014 in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Control, Watch Dogs Legion, and Far Cry 6 \u2014 I stopped thinking about image fidelity and just got lost playing games. Playing with the RTX 3080 account was far better, but even that still had some fuzziness. But it was great to be able to basically max out the settings at 1440p in the games I tried, rather than trying to tune things to make the game work okay with the free tier.GeForce Now RTX 3080 Closing ThoughtsNvidia has been working on a game streaming service since the original Nvidia Shield handheld. I remember playing a few games via the Grid service back in the day, streamed to the device at 720p and 30 fps. That was eight years ago. Flash forward and the free Grid beta morphed into GeForce Now, with substantially upgraded streaming quality and support for a lot more platforms.\n\nOf course, Nvidia isn't doing all of this out of kindness to gamers. Look at what Netflix did for video streaming, and that's potentially the prize for the first real success story in game streaming. Netflix has over 200 million subscribers, paying $10 per month. The profits are staggering. The hardware side of things is just as telling.\n\nAssuming a 30-day month as the average, that's 720 hours in a month. Realistically, it's doubtful most people will stream games for more than a few hours a day, and a lot of people may only stream 5\u201310 hours per week. If Nvidia can average 20 hours per month of streaming time on its GeForce Now RTX 3080 hardware, that would potentially be 36 people sharing one A10G GPU. Nominally, that GPU costs Nvidia about $500 and could be sold for perhaps $1,500. Or Nvidia can charge 36 people $16.67 per month to access that GPU in the cloud. That's $600 per month, give or take, for the same GPU.\n\nAssuming game streaming takes off, the potential upside (for Nvidia) is massive. The data center and infrastructure would all cost a lot of money as well, but long-term there's a potential revenue stream of hundreds of millions of dollars per month \u2014 if everything works out. And if it doesn't, Nvidia can convert the GeForce Now Superpods into some other form of cloud servers and lease time on them to someone other than gamers.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks right now are the missing games and the price. I don't think $100 for six months is necessarily too much to ask, and certainly $50 for six months is viable (for RTX 2080 level hardware), but do you really want yet another subscription? If you're more of a casual gamer, you can try the free plan, but the 60 minute sessions can be a bit irritating if you time out in the middle of a critical moment. Also, if you're using the free version, you get to play on a Tesla RTX T10-8, basically an RTX 2060 equivalent, except I believe it can be shared between two people. Whatever the hardware, it's much slower than the other solutions, and struggled to maintain 60 fps in Far Cry 6 even when set to medium quality 1080p. Playing the game was still okay, but you definitely want to keep settings lower.\n\nAs for the games you can play, that's the blessing and curse of GeForce Now. You have to own all the games you want to use, and they have to work with GeForce Now. Many don't, but more are added every Thursday, and at least you can take the games with you if you ever use your own PC without streaming. There are \"thousands\" of games available on GeForce Now, which is certainly more than you'll find on Stadia, and Google doesn't have a great reputation when it comes to keeping products around (RIP Google+, among others). GeForce Now also does periodic free trials of games, and since the games are all on cloud servers, you don't have to spend time downloading and installing them.\n\nFundamentally, GeForce Now is a way for Nvidia to use data center hardware to power a game streaming service. The free version gets you in the door, but at least in my testing, the latency and experience of the RTX 3080 tier was far better than the free tier. That's understandable, but it also means people might try the free version and get frustrated with it rather than upgrading to a paid tier. Either way, if you're in need of a graphics card and can't seem to find one, Nvidia has apparently put tens of thousands of them into GeForce Now for people to use. That's got to be better than having them in the hands of miners, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nSteam\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGeForce\nCloud Computing\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (12)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

(Same as \"Founders Edition\" tier if you signed up for that back in the day.)\nRTX 3080 Tier: ~RTX 3080 (really 3070), 8-hour sessions, supports 1440p 120fps, or 4K 60fps on a Shield TV.

It's noticeably worse, both in image quality and settings you can run, but it's still viable. Think 1080p medium as the target, mostly. The one hour sessions can definitely feel too short. On the other hand, it does give you a hard time limit so maybe you won't waste as much time playing games instead of working?

Make no mistake that \"dumb luck\" is a thing, even in multi-billion dollar businesses.\n\nYou can think of whatever conspiracy theory behind the time after COVID and the whole chain of events that has made the market go bonkers, but what nVidia is doing is basically a basic thing in capitalism: make the best out of situations that favour you. AMD has been doing it and, to a lesser degree, Intel. Then every chip manufacturer has as well.\n\nFor short, what you think is the biggest juicy evil plot in GPU history, is just high paid execs making the best possible decisions in a bad situation. This being said, and my point with the previous comment, is this was something they've been doing for a while now; not just nVidia but other providers. I'm pretty sure Google, Netflix, Microsoft and Sony are also sourcing part of their cloud stuff from AMD and/or nVidia, so you can put AMD in the same bag as nVidia for this one?\n\nReference: https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/server-cloud-gaming\nRegards.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvinay2070\n\n\nhusker said:Obviously, the review can only take into account the current state of things, and it does look promising.

There are more people watching 4K TV than people wanting to game on these servers. I am hoping that if the internet pipes can handle these TV content, then should be able to cope with the gaming as well. I may be wrong though. Personally this is a good service, but there is a very slight noticeable lag when I tried to play (in Australia). I would prefer a GPU in my cabinet and an ultrawide monitor anyday over the streaming.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 12 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI to fast-track trial to December \u2014 suit aims to stop OpenAI's transition to a for-profit company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Atari parts store still open after 41 years, has spent $100K+ designing new parts \u2014 last original Atari hardware launched 32 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Huawei Kirin X90 chip revealed in state report \u2014 possible server and PC chip set to replace the aging Kunpeng 920 design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoolIT unleashes 4kW single-phase DLC Cold Plate \u2014 Seemingly timed for Nvidia Blackwell Ultra chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira ransomware can be cracked with sixteen RTX 4090 GPUs in around ten hours \u2014 new counterattack breaks encryption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Will the RX 6600 follow in the footsteps of its bigger sibling, the Radeon RX 6600 XT, and put up a solid fight versus its GeForce rival? Which is the best graphics card for your needs and budget? We\u2019ll look at performance, availability, and price to determine if it has what it takes!\nRTX 3060 vs RX 6600: Price\nBoth of these graphics cards sport an identical $329 price tag, at least ostensibly, and at that price the RTX 3060 would be the clear winner\u2014but you\u2019re very unlikely to find either GPU for sale at MSRP. Real-world pricing is considerably higher for both graphics cards as the brutal chip shortage continues. The Radeon RX 6600 seems to have a more realistic price tag. Many custom versions are hovering in the $400 to $500 range when you can find them on store shelves, with a chart-topping Asus model going for $499. But the GeForce RTX 3060 fares even worse, often going over $500. In the second-hand market, Nvidia\u2019s GPU often eclipses even $800. Talk about punching above your weight class!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$299.99 at  Newegg  | \n$469.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nHistoric levels of demand by both gamers and crypto-coin miners have led us down this arduous path. The RTX 3060 continues to be difficult to find in stock, regardless of pricing. How does the availability of the AMD RX 6600 do? Surprisingly, stock remained available even days after launch, but the big caveat here is that most custom board makers slapped a higher street price on their GPUs, giving many buyers cause for pause. And now that the launch is in the rear view mirror, you\u2019re more likely to pay from $480 to $550 on secondary markets like eBay or Craigslist.\nRTX 3060 vs RX 6600: Performance\nThe RTX 3060 and RX 6600 XT put up a tough fight, so how will the less powerful RX 6600 do? Spoiler: Not quite as well, but that\u2019s less egregious given the real-world pricing disparity of these graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the RX 6600 and RTX 3060 wield different amounts of VRAM: 8GB of VRAM for the AMD GPU, and 12GB of VRAM for the RTX 3060. Don\u2019t worry much about this discrepancy, however; these GPUs generally target 1080p gaming, where 8GB of memory holds up just fine. Each also has a suite of features intended to strengthen their performance. On the Nvidia side, the much-lauded DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is a big positive\u2014which, in combination with ray tracing, provides stellar visual and frame rate performance. AMD has a similar resolution scaling feature called FidelityFX Super Resolution, as well as a killer Smart Access Memory feature that improves performance when paired with a supported CPU. Our benchmarks below disable all those proprietary bells and whistles to focus on apples-to-apples raw performance.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nIn Watch Dogs Legion, the RX 6600 surprisingly runs toe-to-toe with the RTX 3060 in both 1080p and 1440p. It seems to be roughly 10% slower than the RX 6600 XT, however. DLSS and ray tracing are both disabled for this test, which levels the playing field for the AMD GPU to demonstrate its raw performance. In general, this performance difference can be expected across many games, with some Nvidia-leaning titles giving the RTX 3060 a bit more of a bump. The Radeon RX 6600 is slower overall than the RTX 3060, though it remains a great 1080p graphics card capable of high frame rates even with eye candy cranked to the max in most games. Well, except ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nSpeaking of, let\u2019s up the difficulty and head over to ray tracing round. Here, both DLSS and FSR are off in order to ensure a fair bout. In Shadow of the Tomb Raider, we can see how the pure hardware ray tracing is still better on the Nvidia RTX 3060. If DLSS and FSR were activated on a supported game, the Nvidia ray tracing lead would grow by a larger margin. If ray tracing is something you\u2019d like to experience, the RTX 3060 is a much better choice. Otherwise, in performance the RX 6600 puts up a valiant fight in \u201ctraditional\u201d rasterized gaming.\nPower and other things to know\nThe RTX 3060 comes with a TDP of 170W, but that is outclassed by 132W TDP of the RX 6600. This AMD GPU truly sips power and is impressive in its efficiency. This is part of the reason the RX 6600 XT has become popular with crypto miners, much to the chagrin of gamers \u2013 it\u2019s just so darn efficient! Lower power also leads to generally cooler and quieter performance, too.\n\n\nThe RX 6600 does not have any factory limitations imposed on it as it concerns crypto mining, it\u2019s just a lower clocked but efficient GPU. The RTX 3060 technically is limited in its hash rate, but there have been workarounds to that respect that unleash its mining prowess, so your mileage may vary.\nWinner winner, chicken dinner goes to..\nThis is a difficult match to referee since the real-world availability and pricing of these 1080p duelers is so unpredictable. This will mean your price-to-performance ratio will vary considerably depending on what and when you can get one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6600 Swft 210\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$304.65 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nHaving said that, the RX 6600 is much easier to find at this point than either the 6600 XT or the RTX 3060. If you really need ray tracing and DLSS in your life at 1080p, you may want to hold out for an RTX 3060, or even the step-up RTX 3060 Ti. And if you could actually buy these cards on a whim at MSRP prices, the RTX 3060 would easily be the superior options. But you can\u2019t, and that\u2019s key. On the streets, the RTX 3060 still carries much more of a premium than even the faster 6600 XT. You\u2019ll likely be able to find the RX 6600 more easily at retailers, even if it is with inflated pricing.\nIf you desire flat-out 1080p performance at a price that might not require taking out a second mortgage, the AMD Radeon RX 6600 is the winner of this battle. In non-ray tracing roles, it often runs close to the RTX 3060. The biggest caveat here would be in pricing; we\u2019ve seen models run the mill from the $329 MSRP to a staggering $499 for the RX 6600, and that\u2019s before the markup you\u2019ll find in secondary outlets like eBay. You\u2019ll want to be on the lower end of that scale, since even $329 is very expensive for a 1080p GPU in 2021, chip shortages or no.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

With its traditional clamshell design, the Swift X is essentially a high-end addition to the company's existing Swift range of ultraportable laptops. However, it manages to follow in the lightweight and slimline footsteps of earlier Swift models, while also offering considerably more power for creative users.\u00a0  Design & features Acer's engineers have done a good job at maintaining the slimline design of the Swift range. The 14-inch Swift X feels surprising light as soon it's removed from the box, and while Acer quotes an 'approximate weight' of 1.5kg, our own scales actually put it closer to 1.4kg -- the same weight as Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro. \u00a0 Acer also quotes a 'screen-to-body' ratio of 85.73%, which translates into an admirably slim 'sliced metal' casing that measures just 17.9mm thick by 322.8mm wide and 212.2mm thick. Acer's website also indicates that the Swift X is available in a variety of colours, although there doesn't seem to be an option to actually choose your preferred colour on its online store (clarity, as we come to discover, is not a defining characteristic of Acer's website).\u00a0    Acer's 14-inch Swift X is powered by an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 5700U or 5800U processor with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Graphics are handled by a discrete Nvidia GeForce GPU -- GTX 1650 or (currently in the US only) RTX 3050 Ti. The screen is an FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel with 300 nits brightness. Images: AcerThere's plenty of power inside that slimline design, though, with the Swift X standing out from its ultraportable siblings with an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 processor, and -- for our review unit -- a discrete\u00a0Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650\u00a0GPU. It's annoying, though, that Acer's website seems to imply that the Swift X actually provides a\u00a0GeForce RTX 3050 Ti\u00a0as a standard feature, when in fact, it's only available in one high-end configuration.\u00a0 Surprisingly, the 14-inch IPS display only offers FHD (1920 x 1080, 157.3dpi) resolution, which seems a little short-sighted for a laptop that's aimed at creative users (although the mixed messaging on Acer's website also suggests that teenage gamers are a target audience too). The 300 nits brightness isn't exactly top-of-the-range either, although in fairness the screen does seem bright and colourful to the naked eye. The colours are a little oversaturated on the red end of the spectrum, perhaps, but the viewing angles are good, easily matching Acer's quoted 170 degrees, so the Swift X will be a good option for presentations on the move. \u00a0 Acer also states that the display supports 100% of the sRGB colour standard, which will be suitable for web graphics and photo editing. However, it's a shame that Acer's limited customisation and upgrade options don't allow users to opt for higher resolution displays, or support for Adobe RGB or DCI-P3 for video editing.\u00a0 It's easy to connect an external monitor, though, with an HDMI port and a USB-C port with DisplayPort support. Connectivity isn't the Swift X's strong point though, with just that single USB-C port, two USB 3.1, and (another detail omitted by Acer's website) a 3.5mm headphone connector. There's no Ethernet port for wired networks, although the Swift X is up to date with both Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6 networking. We were a little concerned about the power connector, which juts out from the side of the laptop at right-angles and seems to be asking for trouble. Another minus point is the Swift X's mediocre 720p webcam.Top ZDNET Reviews \n        Raspberry Pi 4\n         Top ZDNET Reviews Raspberry Pi 4  9\n        Raspberry Pi 400\n         Top ZDNET Reviews Raspberry Pi 400  8.5\n        Samsung Galaxy Xcover Pro\n         Top ZDNET Reviews Samsung Galaxy Xcover Pro  8.4\n        reMarkable 2\n         Top ZDNET Reviews reMarkable 2  7.9   The Swift X features a backlit keyboard, a multi-touch gesture touchpad and a fingerprint reader.\u00a0 Image: Acer Pricing & options\u00a0 Acer's website is never very helpful at the best of times, but on this occasion it's downright misleading. The main web page for the Swift X states clearly that it includes an AMD Ryzen 5000 series processor \"and the supercharged Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card\". In fact, the RTX graphics option turns out to be the highest available specification -- and, for UK customers, it turns out to be a specification that isn't currently available at all.\u00a0 So, at the moment, pricing for the Swift X starts at \u00a3915.66 (ex. VAT; \u00a31099.99 inc. VAT) or $999.99 for the model reviewed here. That's competitive pricing though, given that it includes an 8-core\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 5700U\u00a0processor running at 1.8GHz (with Boost speed up to 4.3GHz), along with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB solid-state drive and GeForce GTX 1650 graphics with 4GB of dedicated video memory. Oddly, the model sold on Acer's UK website includes Windows 10 Pro, while the company's US website currently only offers Windows 10 Home, so US customers who require Window 10 Pro may have to search for that option from third-party retailers, or simply provide their own upgrade.\u00a0 SEE: Windows 11 upgrade: Five questions to ask firstCustomers in the US can, however, upgrade to the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti (with 4GB of VRAM) for just $100 extra, with that price also including a small speed bump up to a\u00a0Ryzen 7 5800U\u00a0running at 1.9GHz (with Boost speed up to 4.4GHz). That's a pretty good upgrade for $100, and while that upgrade isn't currently available in the UK, Acer has informed us that it \"will be available in retail shortly\" -- and hopefully for just \u00a3100 extra. \u00a0 However, Acer's website studiously avoids mention of any other upgrade options, such as increased RAM or storage. Those options seem to be left to third-party retailers, which isn't particularly helpful for business users or IT departments that prefer to specify the configuration of their PCs to suit their needs.\u00a0  Performance & battery life\u00a0 The Ryzen 7 5700U processor used by the Swift X has a relatively modest base clock speed -- just 1.8GHz -- and its single-core performance in the\u00a0Geekbench 5\u00a0test suite is also quite modest -- just 1,180 points. But with eight processor cores at its disposal, the Ryzen CPU leaps ahead when it comes to multi-core performance, hitting 7,430, which puts it well ahead of other powerful but lightweight laptops, such as HP's quad-core Intel-based\u00a0ZBook Firefly 14 G8\u00a0at 5,450.\u00a0 And, of course, our review unit also benefits from its discrete GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, which scored a somewhat average 80fps when running the\u00a0Cinebench R15\u00a0OpenGL benchmark, but then impressed with a very strong 38fps for the 3D graphics of\u00a0Unigine Valley\u00a0(and leaving us wondering how the RTX 3050 would perform). \u00a0 That sort of performance is particularly impressive given the competitive pricing of the Swift X. The internal fan does get a little noisy during the demanding Valley tests, but the area around the air vent located at the top of the keyboard never gets more than mildly warm.\u00a0 Battery life also proved to be a pleasant surprise. The 300 nits display was still bright enough that we were able to reduce the brightness level to 50% for our streaming video test. The Swift X also allowed us to switch to the Ryzen's integrated Radeon graphics to preserve battery power, with the laptop lasting for a healthy 8 hours and 50 minutes of online streaming. You should be able to stretch that close to 10 hours if you're not using Wi-Fi the whole time, and the integrated Radeon graphics can still manage 67fps for Cinebench and 12fps for Valley, so it's certainly capable of handling some graphics work if you need to preserve battery power when you're on the move.    Image: Acer Conclusions\u00a0 The Swift X isn't perfect, and its modest display and limited customisation and upgrade options could be a deal-breaker for some creative users. However, it does manage to combine a lightweight design, strong performance and good battery life at a very competitive price, making it a very attractive travelling laptop for creative users who primarily work online.\u00a0 RECENT AND RELATED CONTENTAcer announces handful of new Windows 11 laptops, including eco-friendly Aspire VeroAcer Swift 5: An antimicrobial laptop that needs a good cleanAcer Swift 3X review: Solid specs, including Intel's dGPU, but build quality disappointsBest Windows 10 laptop 2021: Top notebooks comparedBest laptop 2021: Mac, PC, and Chromebook comparedRead more reviewsReolink RLC-811A security camera review: Pan tilt, zoom and an extra loud sirenWindows 11 hands on: Microsoft's biggest minor upgrade ever is all about new hardwareILIFE Shinebot W450 review: Super clean floors -- but unnecessary appEZVIZ DB1C Wi-Fi video doorbell review: Affordable, no-subscription securityBose Videobar VB1 review: Premium audio and video for small meeting spaces LaptopsHardwareMobilityReviews Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines    Related   \n      Netgear Orbi Quad-Band Mesh WiFi 6E System (RBKE963): Fast but expensive wireless mesh networking\n      \n      NexDock 360 Touch review: Transform your Samsung smartphone into a capable laptop\n      \n      Dell XPS 17 9710 (2021) review: A highly configurable premium 17-inch laptop\n                ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

However, human interpretations of the same sherd often vary \u2014 driven by ambiguity, mere differences in opinion and a lack of familiarity with the millions of pottery typologies that exist. Downum and Pawlowicz use machine learning to help researchers and students more objectively classify these ancient pottery fragments.\nNeural networks, trained on massive image datasets of sherds that were classified in agreement with expert archaeologists, determine a sherd\u2019s typology. Results are displayed with \u201cheat maps\u201d which highlight sections of the sherd that the AI model found most crucial to its characterization.\n\n\nTweetables:\n\u201cThese machine learning methods basically teach themselves the critical design parameters that are associated with each [sherd] type.\u201d \u2014 Leszek Pawlowicz [5:22]\nMachine learning \u201cadds a lot of objectivity and reliability to the process of classifying complex artifacts.\u201d \u2014 Chris Downum [18:43]\nYou Might Also Like:\nWild Things: NVIDIA\u2019s Sifei Liu Talks 3D Reconstructions of Endangered Species\nEndangered species can be challenging to study, as they are elusive and the very act of observing them can disrupt their lives.

Wilson \u2022\nOct 25, 2021 at 12:29am EDT\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's flagship mining GPU, the CMP 170HX, which was revealed last month is now listed on sale by Dubai-based retailer, Vipera. The listing is showing the price of the CMP 170HX at $4435 US that puts it almost twice as much as the GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card.\nNVIDIA CMP 170HX Mining Graphics Card Goes On Sale At Over $4400 US\nNVIDIA's CMP170HX is only available overseas currently and is unknown whether any other markets will see the crypto mining processor since NVIDIA has yet to list it down officially within its CMP lineup. Dubai online retailer Vipera is selling them on their website for $4,500, and claiming to currently have 886 units (1,427 just a day ago) in stock.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA created the Cryptocurrency Mining Processor as an answer for crypto miners to have a dedicated processor for cryptocurrency instead of utilizing the company's Ampere line of Geforce GPUs. The technology that NVIDIA is utilizing is the GA100 silicon and finding a new use for the new card. GA100 silicon utilizes the exact same die that processes data for the highly expensive A100 data center graphics cards. This form of recycling old technology or devices to power and create new devices on the market allows manufacturers to use up any leftover stock sitting in factories for new uses.\n\nThe NVIDA CMP 170HX only allows for \"70 enabled SMs, amounting to 4,480 CUDA cores.\" The A100 by NVIDIA has 108 SMs available, equating to about 6,912 CUDA cores which operate at 1140 MHz base and 1410 MHz boost clocks. The CMP card offers performance levels of 164 MH/s when mining for Ethereum. A PCIe 4.0 x 4 connection is all that is required for performance for the CMP 170HX, as well as 8 GB of HBM2e memory. All this onboard for a 4,096-bit interface for memory. The TDP on the CMP card is 250W, utilizing a single 8-pin power connection from the PCIe.\nhttps://twitter.com/KOMACHI_ENSAKA/status/1451549568546471943\nThe cryptocurrency mining processor showcases an atypical dual-slot design as found on similar style cards, and allows for passive cooling. NVIDIA's choice for a silver metallic casing is very simple in design, which is not surprising due to the use of the card. The NVIDIA CMP 170HX does not offer any display outputs and \"a locked BIOS so overclocking or undervolting\" is not capable for this particular line.\nNVIDIA is shipping the CMP 170HX with a one-year manufacturer's warranty and is expected to be limited with how much cryptocurrency mining stresses a GPU initially. Graphics card manufacturer Gigabyte offers a similar card design, the CMP 30HX, and only allows for a limited three-month warranty for the same reason.\nSources: @KOMACHI_ENSAKA (on Twitter), Yahoo!

The Keplers are absent from the list of GPUs supported in the latest update. \nThe main stories in the latest Nvidia driver release are the optimization support for the newly released Back 4 Blood and the addition of DLSS to 10 more games. Buried within, however, are the details of the end of Kepler support as well as the end of support for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.\nThis means Kepler cards will no longer get driver improvements, performance improvements, new features, or bug fixes. Though, they will still get critical security updates through September 2024. Nvidia has a list of which GPUs this covers here, but it includes GTX 600 and GTX 700 series cards along with the early Titans, cards that originally came out in 2012 and 2013. This is the full list of affected cards:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN Z\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN Black\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 780\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 770\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ti\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 (192-bit)\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ti OEM\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 740\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 730\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 720\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 710\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 690\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 680\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 670\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 Ti\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 660\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 650\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 645\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 640\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 635\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 630\n\nThe bottom of the download page for the latest driver does mentions exceptions for certain notebooks.\n\nIt should be noted that three 700 series GPUs are still getting support because they aren't Kepler but rather part of the following architecture, Maxwell. They are the GTX 750 Ti, GeForce GTX 750, and GeForce GTX 745 (OEM). TechSpot also has a download page for the latest drivers, with detailed information on the changes and which games they affect. The latest drivers only support 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11.\nNvidia first announced it was planning to soon end Kepler support this past summer. In the latest Steam survey, the 750Ti still ranks in the middle of the list of most popular graphics cards, above all of AMD's recent RDNA2 cards and almost all of Nvidia's own Ampere cards which released late last year. Kepler cards like the GTX 660 and 760 are much further down, with less than one percent share of overall GPU usage. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Huawei to drop Windows, shifting to HarmonyOS and Linux for future PCs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 37 comments\n \n439 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nSteam survey sees a shake-up as a new top graphics card is revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's RDNA 4 GPUs bring major encoding and ray tracing upgrades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Tested by Mining channel, Dizzy Mining, the RTX A2000 delivers some impressive efficiency figures when mining Ethereum.\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 Is The Most Efficient Mining GPU Ever! Produces Up To 41 MH/s at Just 66W\nThe NVIDIA RTX A2000 features the Ampere GPU architecture. In terms of specifications, the RTX A2000 rocks the GA106 GPU which is equipped with 3328 CUDA cores, 104 Tensor cores, and 26 RT cores, all of which offer a nice performance bump over the previous generation offerings. In terms of memory, the card is equipped with 6 GB GDDR6 capacity that runs across a 192-bit bus interface and the DRAM features ECC support for error-free computing.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\nThe RTX A2000 itself comes in a small form factor design, featuring a half-height and half-length board. The card even has a small blower type-fan on the shroud. Since this is a 70W TDP card, there are no power connectors. It's a simple plug-and-use card that offers great efficiency in a compact design. There are four Mini DisplayPorts (1.4) near the rear panel IO shroud which also comes with a small vent to exhaust hot air out.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A2000 Workstation Ampere graphics card showcases impressive mining efficiency in Ethereum. (Image Credits: Dizzy Mining)\nAs for mining performance, the NVIDIA RTX A2000 delivers up to 41 MH/s at just 66W when tuned. The core clock was increased by +100 MHz while the memory clock was adjusted to +1500 MHz. In terms of power limit, the slider was moved to 95% while the fan speed is pushed to 100%. The card peaks at 51C at full load in mining. Interestingly, enabling ECC while mining hammered the mining performance a lot so it's better to keep it disabled if you plan on mining on the workstation card. In terms of mining efficiency, the RTX A2000 now takes the lead over the RX 6600:\n\nAMD RX 6600 XT (Tuned) -\u00a0~33 MH/s @ 55W (0.59 PPW)\nAMD RX 6600 Non-XT (Tuned) -\u00a0~30 MH/s @ 50W (0.61 PPW)\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 (Tuned) - ~41 MH/s @ 66W (0.62 PPW)\n\nAvailability and pricing is another thing though. The NVIDIA RTX A2000 is priced at $649.99 US and will be hitting retail outlets in December. Since the video went live, many miners have started pre-ordering the graphics card and are expecting delivery by the mid of November.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The situation has gotten so dire that prices for some GPUs now cost 83 percent over MSRP. \nAccording to updated data collected by 3DCenter, prices for Nvidia graphics cards are now 72 percent more expensive than MSRP. AMD GPUs are even pricier; they're 83 percent above the manufacturer's suggested retail price. That's a notable increase from the 74 percent figure in September, while Nvidia cards were at 70 percent.\nSKUs for AMD GPUs affected were part of its Radeon RX 6000 series; in particular, the 6700 XT, 6800, 6800 XT, and 6900 XT. Nvidia SKUs included several from its GeForce RTX 30 series: the 3060, 3060Ti, 3070, 3080, and 3090.\n\nAvailability levels for the two firm's GPUs were somewhat improved in October thus far, putting an end to a three-month period where stock levels continued to weaken. Information pertaining to the pricing hikes was obtained from German retailers. However, it's a similar state of affairs elsewhere as well.\nPrices in the crypto space have recently experienced a surge, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum approaching previous price peaks. This has consequently led to miners scrambling to secure graphics cards to capitalize on the price rises for cryptocurrency. There's even new software that evades Nvidia's LHR limiter by allowing users to mine two coins simultaneously. AMD, meanwhile, denies claims that it's prioritizing selling cards to crypto miners over gamers.\nRelated reading: GPU Availability and Pricing Update September 2021 \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n OpenAI rolls out GPT-4.5 to Pro users only, faces shortage of GPU horsepower \n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\nDue to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, other factors could contribute to prices in the industry continuing an upward trend. Copper foil, for one, continues to be in short supply, inevitably leading to higher costs for suppliers \u2013 it's not unrealistic to expect motherboard and GPU prices to be affected as a result. Demand in general for CPUs and GPUs has skyrocketed, causing chipmakers to raise prices.\nAmong the countless patiently awaiting their graphics card orders to arrive was an individual in Poland, who took the matter into his own hands and sent a cake to the retailer he ordered from. It worked: the order was expedited, albeit a year later, and he finally received his RTX 3080.\n\n\n\n\n 36 comments\n \n5K likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nChip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan is Intel's new CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Digital exits SSD market, shifts focus to hard drives as SanDisk takes over NAND operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Now you can play on one with GeForce Now \n\t\t\t\tRTX 3080 subscribers can bask in 1440p, 120Hz and 4K HDR streams, too.\t\t\t\n\n \n\n By Brad Chacos  \n\n Executive Editor, PCWorld   Oct 21, 2021 6:00 am PDT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s monstrous GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card launched over a year ago, but it\u2019s still damned near impossible to get your hands on one if you don\u2019t feel like paying a just-as-monstrous markup on Ebay. But soon, you\u2019ll be able to tap the GPU\u2019s fearsome firepower for roughly the cost of a Netflix subscription, as Nvidia is bringing the GeForce RTX 3080 to its GeForce Now cloud streaming service, along with a juicy 1440p, 120Hz gaming option.\nIt\u2019s a huge level-up for GeForce Now, cementing it as one of the best options for PC gaming during the never-ending GPU shortage. If you\u2019re looking to get into desktop gaming for the first time, or if your current graphics card dies and you don\u2019t want to spend $1,500 to $2,000 on an RTX 3080 of your own on the street, GeForce Now can keep you playing at a high level until the madness ends (at least assuming your internet is up to snuff). And yes, that includes cutting-edge, real-time ray tracing and Nvidia DLSS capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nNvidia needed to upgrade its servers to make such a ferocious option possible. The company\u2019s new GeForce Now \u201cSuperpods\u201d double up on available CPU cores and memory bandwidth in addition to wielding the crucial GPUs themselves\u2014which aren\u2019t truly RTX 3080 GPUs, but a similarly configured die based on the same underlying GA102 \u201cAmpere\u201d GPU. One key difference? The Superpod 3080s come with 24GB of VRAM, compared to the 10GB of GDDR6X found in the proper graphics cards.\nEach virtual RTX 3080 PC comes equipped with an 8-core, 16-thread AMD Threadripper CPU, 28GB of DDR4-3200 memory, and a blazing-fast PCIe 4.0 SSD. So yeah, it\u2019ll be able to handle any game you throw at it without breaking a sweat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nNvidia is rolling out new display support options that put the heavier firepower to good use. Standard GeForce Now streams are limited to 60 frames per second at 1080p resolution, but if you pony up for an RTX 3080 subscription, you\u2019ll be able to stream at up to 1440p resolution and 120Hz. If you have a phone with a 120Hz screen, that\u2019s supported at the full refresh rate as well, though mobile access defaults to 720p resolution to avoid text elements being rendered unreadable on such tiny screens. (You can also manually enable 1080p resolution on a phone.) And if you\u2019re an Nvidia Shield TV owner, you\u2019ll be able to play HDR games at 4K/60, with support for additional devices expected in the future.\nPushing that many pixels requires steeper bandwidth demands, however. While Nvidia recommends a 25Mbps internet connection for standard GeForce Now users, it recommends a 35Mbps connection for streaming games at 1440p/120, or 40Mbps for the Shield TV\u2019s 4K HDR streams.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nPlaying at such high framerates should hopefully alleviate some of the latency issues that sometimes pop up with cloud gaming services, as highlighted by when my colleague Ben Patterson dropped GFN for a dusty PlayStation 4 to play Destiny 2. In fact, the Nvidia graphic above deals with that very issue in that very game, and how latency should be much improved when it\u2019s running at 120 frames per second from a remote RTX 3080.\nNvidia is also swiping a page from its G-Sync experience to offer an adaptive sync display option to all GFN users to increase gameplay smoothness, regardless of what type of monitor you\u2019re using. It doesn\u2019t work quite the same as G-Sync though; while G-Sync and other adaptive sync monitors smooth things out by matching your display speed to your GPU\u2019s output, GeForce Now\u2019s new adaptive sync technology matches the output of the server frame captures with your client\u2019s frame displays at either 60Hz or 120Hz. Cloud adaptive sync sounds exciting on paper, but the proof will be in the pudding when GeForce Now\u2019s RTX 3080s fire up.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nSubscribing to the RTX 3080 tier unlocks more benefits, too. While the free and standard tiers of GeForce Now handle overcapacity by dropping players into a queue system, Nvidia cloud VP Phil Eisler says \u201cno wait is the goal\u201d for RTX 3080 subscribers. While he acknowledged that customers might see the occasional short weight\u2014for example, when a hot new online game launches\u2014the company will actively manage the number of RTX 3080 subscriptions and virtual PCs available. \nUnlike the other tiers, you won\u2019t bump down to a lower-spec\u2019d virtual PC if you\u2019re playing a lesser-powered game. If you\u2019re paying for an RTX 3080 in the cloud, you\u2019ll always be playing on an RTX 3080 in the cloud. You\u2019ll also unlock longer eight-hour-straight gaming sessions, as well as the ability to save your graphics settings across sessions, rather than defaulting to an Nvidia-recommended configuration. Eisler said that latter benefit is a common request from users. It\u2019s good to see Nvidia listen, though it\u2019s a bummer that the capability is locked to the priciest subscription tier alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nNow for the pricing. While the free tier remains intact with unlimited one hour session durations, complete with full access to your compatible PC library and over 70 free-to-play games, pricing for the premium tiers have crept upwards since GeForce Now launched a few years back. Earlier this year, pricing for Priority access doubled to $10 per month or $100 per year. That\u2019s staying the same under Nvidia\u2019s new plans, although the company is only offering six-month plans for $50 now. (Month-to-month pricing was not disclosed.) Paying for that juicy RTX 3080 subscription costs significantly more, at $100 for six months. \nThat breaks down to $16.66 per month\u2014roughly splitting the difference between a standard and premium Netflix plan. A figure like that may seem high on the surface, but it feels like a fair price for unlimited access to a high-powered RTX 3080 rig during a time when finding graphics cards is all but impossible and actual 3080s are going for north of $1,500 on the streets. That $16 per month could help you keep on gaming until the GPU shortage subsides, and with some kick-ass firepower at your fingertips too.\n\n\nPreorders for GeForce Now\u2019s new RTX 3080 plans start today in North America, with availability for other regions opening in a week. You\u2019ll be able to start playing on a cloud 3080 sometime in November.

The card is going to be the new flagship aimed at enthusiasts.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti To Feature An Entirely New Board Design With Single-Sided Memory, New Power Connectors & PCIe 5.0 Interface, Alleges Rumor\nIt looks like NVIDIA isn't going to give its flagship GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card the SUPER series branding but rather, release a new variant with the 'Ti' series branding. Most of the specs that have leaked out in rumors remain the same except the board design which is likely getting some major upgrades.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 'Alleged' Specifications\nFirst up, we have the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti and this is expected to be a Titan-class card once again. Kopite7kimi had previously stated that NVIDIA is unlikely to use use the 3090 SUPER naming convention & go with something else considering that this is one of their top-tier product so the 'Ti' branding makes sense.\n\nAs for the specs, 3090 SUPER is expected to rock the full GA102 GPU core with 10752 cores and 24 GB GDDR6X memory. The memory will be faster-clocked thanks to improved dies from Micron, pushing speeds past 20 Gbps. The pricing may be kept the same at $1499 US (MSRP) but overall, we are looking at a minor 5% improvement. A previous rumor also stated that the GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER\u00a0 graphics card will feature a TGP of over 400W. That's 50W more than the existing 3090 which means that we could be looking at faster clocks on GPU and VRAM.\nNow, this is all that we have known for a while now so what's changed you ask? Well first up, we got a rumor of a brand new power connector that will come in the MicroFit form factor but it isn't going to look anything like the existing connector. The new 16-pin connector will be PCIe Gen 5.0 ready & will offer some current stability for the next-gen protocol which is expected to be introduced on the flagship card.\n\nA major change for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti would be the addition of 2GB GDDR6X memory modules. Running at 21 Gbps will require more power and more power translates to higher temps. We have already seen how the VRAM temperatures on GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card gets and especially the modules featured on the back-side. Having denser capacities modules will mean that NVIDIA could feature all the modules on the front side of the PCB (12 modules in total) which will yield slightly lower PCB and memory temperatures. The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti won't be the only card getting these higher density modules as the rumor also mentions the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti to get a similar 2GB module treatment.\nAs for the launch, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is expected to launch in January along with the RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB and RTX 2060 12 GB.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card Specifications\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GBNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6 GB\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA102-350?Ampere GA102-300Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-220Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104Ampere GA104-200\nAmpere GA103-200Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA106Ampere GA106-150Ampere GA107-325\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2 (GA104)276mm2276mm2276mm2 (GA106)200mm2 (GA107)\n\n\nTransistors28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion (GA104)13.2 Billion13.2 Billion13.2 Billion (GA106)8.7 Billion (GA107)\n\n\nCUDA Cores1075210496102408960870461445888486448643584358425602048\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs336 / 112328 / 112320 / 112280 / 104272 / 96184 / 96184 / 96152 / 80152 / 80112 / 64112 / 6480 / 32TBD\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores336 / 84328 / 82320 / 80280 / 70272 / 68184 / 46184 / 46152 / 38152 / 38112 / 28112 / 2880 / 20TBD\n\n\nBase Clock1560 MHz1400 MHz1365 MHzTBA1440 MHz1575 MHz1500 MHz1410 MHz1410 MHz1320 MHz1320 MHz1552 MHzTBD\n\n\nBoost Clock1860 MHz1700 MHz1665 MHzTBA1710 MHz1770 MHz1730 MHz1665 MHz1665 MHz1780 MHz1780 MHz1777 MHz1470 MHz\n\n\nFP32 Compute40 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs34 TFLOPsTBA30 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs16 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs13 TFLOPs9.1 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nRT TFLOPs74 RFLOPs69 TFLOPs67 TFLOPsTBA58 TFLOPs44 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs32 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs25 TFLOPs18.2 TFLOPsTBD\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBA285 TOPs273 TOPsTBA238 TOPs183 TOPs163 TOPs192 TOPs192 TOPs101 TOPs101 TOPs72.8 TOPsTBD\n\n\nMemory Capacity24 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X8 GB GDDR612 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR66 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit320-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit96-bit\n\n\nMemory Speed21 Gbps19.5 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidth1008 GB/s936 GB/s912 Gbps912 Gbps760 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s608 GB/s448 GB/s384 GB/s240 GB/s224 GB/s168 GB/s\n\n\nTGP450W350W350W350W320W290W220W175W175W170W150W130W (GA106)\n115W (GA107)70W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)TBD$1499 US$1199$999 US?$699 US$599 US$499 US$399 US$399 US$329 USTBD$249 USTBD\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)29th March 2022?24th September 20203rd June 202111th January 202217th September 202010th June, 202129th October 2020October 20222nd December 202025th February 2021October 202227th January 20222024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs;

After years of waiting and NVIDIA wanting to pursue an alternative API instead after years of pushing EGLStreams, NVIDIA's proprietary driver has finally adopted the Generic Buffer Manager (GBM) API. This greatly enhances the Wayland support for NVIDIA's proprietary driver stack and makes it compatible with a lot more Wayland software. For example, the likes of Sway should now run fine with this new driver.\r\n\nNVIDIA supporting GBM isn't entirely a surprise as we've been covering their indications of working on it now for a number of months. It's great to see this materialize. This NVIDIA GBM support works with the GBM loader support found in Mesa 21.2 and newer.\r\n\nThis NVIDIA 495 beta for Linux also adds an indicator for Resizable BAR (ReBAR) support, fixes a possible X.Org Server crash, and now requires at least Linux 3.10 -- Linux 2.6.32 era support through 3.9 finally removed.\r\n\nDownloads and more details on this exciting NVIDIA 495 Linux beta driver via NVIDIA.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n182 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

While most people are familiar with the RTX 3080 as being a powerful (and often sold out) GPU used to play PC games, Nvidia is now using one of its most powerful consumer GPUs to provide the company\u2019s game streaming servers with abundant performance for GeForce Now users. In fact, Nvidia actually created an entirely new class of server to support GeForce Now\u2019s upgraded capabilities. It\u2019s called the SuperPod, and it crams huge stacks of RTX 3080 graphics cards  into a single unit. This configuration allows each GeForce Now customer with an RTX 3080 membership to get access to a dedicated 3080 GPU in the cloud, which provides a significant performance boost over existing GeForce Now subscription tiers.\n\n\n A render of Nvidia\u2019s new SuperPod gaming supercomputer. Image: Nvidia Compared to a single RTX 3080 GPU, which features 8704 CUDA cores, Nvidia says each SuperPod boasts a whopping 11,477,760 CUDA cores, which when combined delivers so much power Nvidia says its SuperPod is \u201cthe most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built.\u201d Previously, GeForce Now\u2019s top-tier Priority subscription offered performance that tops out at 1080p at 60fps. But now, Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 membership allows for game streaming at up to 1440p at 120 fps on Macs and PCs, or 4K HDR at 60 fps with 7.1 sound on Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV devices. You can also stream games via GeForce Now at 120fps on mobile devices, assuming your phone or tablet has a high refresh rate display.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia says the added performance from its SuperPods is able to bring the total latency of GeForce Now game streaming down to just 60ms, which Nvidia claims is similar to the kind of latency you\u2019d get from a typical home console. And when compared to a home PCs, Nvidia says its RTX 3080 membership offers seven times better performance than the most popular desktop configuration listed on Steam\u2019s hardware survey, and 13 times better performance than an M1 MacBook Air. Here\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s new pricing  for GeForce Now following the introduction of the RTX 3080 membership. Image: Nvidia Nvidia says its RTX 3080 membership for GeForce Now also supports adaptive sync technology, so GeForce Now can better match the frame rate of your gameplay with the refresh rate of your display, to provide smoother and more fluid gameplay and visuals.\n\n\n\nAnd to support improved game streaming around the world, Nvidia and some of its partners are opening up new data centers in Russia, South America, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership will cost $100 for a six-month subscription, which includes support for gameplay at up to 1440p at 120fps and a dedicated 3080 GPU powering your games in the cloud.

Specifically, these are HP\u2019s compact workstations. If one thinks of a workstation as a large bulky machine, these are clearly on the other end of the spectrum. While they are larger than the typical TMM node, we have gotten so many requests we finally purchased a HP Z2 Mini G4 and will put it through a Project TinyMiniMicro-style article.\nProject TinyMiniMicro Background\nIn\u00a0Project TinyMiniMicro we are purchasing a large number of these devices from different sources. While a standard STH review is of a new product, these TMM nodes occasionally have specs that differ from what one would expect. In all of these pieces, we are going to talk about what makes the nodes unique. We are now well over 35 different nodes to increase diversity we have also branched out to the 0.35L market and a few NUCs as well. We are testing these on a more circular economy/ extended lifecycle basis to see how they can be deployed after their initial use as corporate desktops. As always, we have a video version of this article.\n\nWe recommend opening this video in a YouTube tab/ app for a better viewing experience.\nFor our $606 (before tax), we received a node with an Intel Core i5-8500, 16GB of memory, WiFi, and a 256GB NVMe SSD. We even got an embedded Windows 10 Pro license which would have cost us around $140 alone.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Rear Ports 1\nThis is part of our new series where we are branching out to some slightly larger and smaller options in the market. With our series, we understand that there is always going to be tension. TinyMiniMicro is the 1L category and this is certainly bigger. Still, we wanted to take a look just due to requests.\nIn terms of pricing, this was about 2/3 the cost of the\u00a0HP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini 65W TMM node, and we lost two CPU generations along with the newer WiFi 6. What we gained however is a GPU, specifically a NVIDIA Quadro P1000 GPU.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Internal Overview Angle\nAs a quick note here, this unit actually looked fairly good on the inside, but it certainly saw a lot of wear on the exterior. Part of the project is that we are showing what we got, so this is something we felt compelled to show.\nWe are going to go into a quick hardware overview, then into the key specs. We are then going to talk a bit about performance and power consumption before getting to our lessons learned from these units and our final words.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Hardware Overview\nWe have looked at a number of 1L PCs with GPUs, but this is a bit larger. It is 21.6 x 21.6 x 5.8 cm. Here is a quick look next to the 65W HP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini:\nHP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini In Front Of A HP Z2 Mini G4\nSince we have tested so many 1L corporate desktops from HP, Lenovo, and Dell, (hence getting requests for this) we wanted to just show that this is clearly bigger.\nHP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini Above HP Z2 Mini G4\nThe front of the Unit has the HP logo and a power button, but the big features start at this side. Here we have two USB 3 Type-A ports, a 10Gbps Gen 2 Type-C port, and a headset jack.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Side Ports 1\nOne will note, this system saw a lot of wear on its exterior prior to making it to the lab.\nOn the other side, we can see a lot of functionality. Ther is the power input, two display ports, a USB 3 Type-C Gen 2 10Gbps port. We then get two optional slot blanks, one has a Thunderbolt port. This is a commonly requested feature on the TinyMiniMicro series, so it is fun that this has a Thunderbolt port here. On the right-hand side, we get two USB 3 Type-A ports and a 1GbE NIC (Intel i219-LM.)\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Rear Ports 2\nJust as a point of clarification here, since this unit has a GPU, it is a \u201cPerformance\u201d unit, not an entry unit. That is something to be aware of when purchasing these systems that there is a difference.\nInside the system, we have a layout that looks like a larger version of what we see in Project TinyMiniMicro HP units. The CPU and memory are on top while the GPU, NVMe SSD, and WiFi card are on the bottom here.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Internal Overview No HDD Bracket\nOne feature that was not populated in ours, but we wanted to call out is that there is a 2.5\u2033 drive tray along with the power and data connector. Our unit did not have a 2.5\u2033 drive populated, but it does add an option for a second drive if one wants.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Internal View With 2.5in HDD Bracket\nUnder the fan cooling the NIVIDA Quadro P1000 4GB MXM GPU, one can see we get a 256GB M.2 2280 (80mm) SSD along with an Intel 9560 (2\u00d72) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 Combo card. This generation was still on 802.11ac so it is not a WiFi 6/ 6E device like a modern system.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 NVMe And Wifi 1\nAs with its smaller units, HP has another swivel-up fan here that goes over the memory and cools the CPU.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 SODIMM Memory\nOur unit had 16GB of memory installed in two 8GB SODIMMs. Given that we have the Intel Core i5-8500, 16GB is a solid figure, but one can use up to 2x 32GB SODIMMs for 64GB of memory in this system.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 M.2 SSD Wifi And SODIMM Memory\nThe big takeaway, and something we wanted to test, is that the cooling for the CPU involves a much larger fan and heatsink than in the 1L EliteDesk Minis. Also, the NVIDIA Quadro P1000 is a 47W TDP GPU, so it is designed for low-power as well. There are other dGPU options including the NVIDIA Quadro P600 and AMD Radeon Pro WX 4150. Although NVIDIA Quadro branding is phased out for new products these are Pascal generation GPUs so they are still called Quadros. We will quickly note that these are MXM GPUs, not standard PCIe slot GPUs making them more akin to notebook GPUs. Some of the 1L PCs use risers with PCIe slots to accept GPUs.\nHP Z2 Mini G4 Internal Overview Angle\nA few other options are worth mentioning here. First, the system can take many other CPUs. For example, one can have 9th Gen Intel Core CPUs in this system. One can also have Xeons. Specifically, one can use the Intel Xeon E-2100/ E-2200 Series CPus in these systems as well. If you want to learn more about those series, we have our Intel Xeon E-2100 and Xeon E-2200 Coverage Guide. We just started testing the E-2300 series with our\u00a0Supermicro SYS-510T-MR review 1U Intel Xeon E-2300 server and also the new\u00a0Intel 12th Gen Core Alder Lake details are out as we are writing this so the new generations are here. This was the last PCIe Gen3 generation and we rapidly went through PCIe Gen4 to now PCIe Gen5.\nNext, let us get to the performance, power consumption, and our final thoughts.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 \n\n TAGShpIntelNVIDIAQuadroTinyMiniMicro \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleTrueNAS Scale RC1 Launched A Big MilestoneNext articleIcy Dock flexiDock MB021VP-B Review U.2 Tray-less NVMe Dock Patrick Kennedyhttps://www.servethehome.comPatrick has been running STH since 2009 and covers a wide variety of SME, SMB, and SOHO IT topics.

Each instance of GeForce Now SuperPOD has 35 teraflops of performance for a six-month membership going for 99.99 EUR.    Andrew Fear, senior product manager for Nvidia GeForce NOW, said the cloud gaming service has more than 12 million members supported with more than 30 data centers around the world. Fear outlined how Nvidia sped up the service with Mellanox technology as well as its Ampere processors. \"Gamers deserve a supercomputer too,\" said Fear.How game streaming services are luring the next wave of subscribersAmong the key details:The GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership enables games to run at up to 1440p on PC and Mac devices, 4K HDR on Nvidia Shield and up to 120 frames per second with PC, Mac and Android apps. GeForceNow RTX 3080 members will have access to RTX 3080 gaming rigs and the longest session lengths.   GeForce Now is reducing system latency via Nvidia's Adaptive Sync technology. High frame rate synchronization boosts cloud game play.GeForce Now members have access to more than 1,100 games.GeForce Now RTX 3080 is available for preorder today with availability in North America in November and Europe in December. \u00a0   More:Nvidia and VMware team up to help enterprises scale up AI developmentNvidia brings AI to more mainstream servers with Nvidia AI Enterprise in GAMicrosoft and Nvidia create 105-layer, 530 billion parameter language model that needs 280 A100 GPUs, but it's still biasedNvidia expands Omniverse with a new GPU, new collaborationsNvidia eyes ARM roadmap for AI, 5G integration from server to card to chip Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      The best tablets you can buy: Expert tested\n      \n      The best gaming PCs you can buy: Expert tested\n      \n      The best Windows tablets you can buy: Microsoft, Lenovo, and more\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Although there seems to be a revolving door of competitors in the cloud gaming market as of late, few \u2013 if any \u2013 have the kind of experience and knowledge in the hardcore gaming, graphics, networking, and high-performance computing spaces necessary to offer a quality user experience, across a myriad of client computing platforms and game genres.\n\n\nNVIDIA does, however, and although it is already a clear leader in cloud gaming, the company continues to improve the experience, add new features, and bolster its GeForce NOW ecosystem to reach even more gamers around the globe.\nSecond-Gen GeForce NOW SuperPOD.NVIDIA\n\nPowerful GeForce NOW SuperPODs Enable More Immersive Cloud Gaming\nNVIDIA announced an array of updates to its GeForce NOW service today, starting with a new, more-powerful GeForce NOW SuperPOD. These powerful second-gen GeForce NOW SuperPOD servers leverage the company\u2019s latest GPU technology and more CPU, RAM, and storage resources than before.\nNVIDIA's Currently Got 30 Data Centers, In 80 Countries.NVIDIA\n\nEach GeForce NOW SuperPOD features 8,960 AMD Threadripper Pro CPU cores and more than 1,000 GPUs (with a total of 11,477,760 CUDA Cores), offering more than 39 petaflops of total graphics horsepower. Each instance on these new SuperPODs offers up to 35 teraflops (TFLOPs) of performance, which NVIDIA points out is nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X game console.\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s 30 data centers, which house the GeForce NOW SuperPODs, now exist in 80 countries and service millions of gamers worldwide.NVIDIA Adaptive Sync TechnologyNVIDIA\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nAdaptive Sync Technology Delivers Smoother Gaming\nGeForce NOW is also being upgraded with support for NVIDIA Adaptive Sync technology. Somewhat like G-Sync on desktop systems, NVIDIA Adaptive Sync technology for GeForce NOW synchronizes the frame pipeline between the server and client, to eliminate dropped or repeated frames, more efficiently utilize network bandwidth, and ultimately provide lower latency to the end user.GeForce NOW Latency Data.NVIDIA\nNVIDIA notes that most users will experience a noticeable reduction in latency when Adaptive Sync is enabled, which rivals mainstream desktop PCs, but GeForce NOW members in the Priority tier (which offers up to 1080p @ 60 FPS) or the upcoming, just-announced RTX 3080 tier (which offers up to 1440p gaming @ 120 FPS) will benefit most \u00a0through high frame rate synchronization. In the lowest latency mode, NVIDIA claims members will experience total end-to-end latency as low as 60ms, which is comparable to the latest game consoles.\nRTX 3080 Gaming From The Cloud\nAlong with the second-gen SuperPOD and Adaptive Sync technology announcements, NVIDIA also unveiled a new GeForce NOW membership tier, dubbed RTX 3080. As its name suggests, the aforementioned GeForce NOW RTX 3080 tier effectively offers high-end gaming PC-class performance to RTX 3080 members, but from the cloud. The new GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership kicks things up a few notches over the Priority tier and enables games to run at resolutions up to 1440p on PC and Mac clients or 4K HDR on the NVIDIA SHIELD, and up to 120 FPS with the PC, Mac and Android apps.GeForce NOW Membership Tiers.NVIDIA\nMembers that opt for the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 tier will also gain exclusive access to RTX 3080 cloud gaming rigs, longer gaming session lengths (up to 8 hours) and additional controls over persistent in-game settings. The virtualized RTX 3080 cloud gaming rigs being offered up by NVIDIA will feature GPUs capable of up to 35 TFLOPS of performance, with 8-core / 16-thread CPUs, 28GB of DDR4-3200 memory, and PCIe Gen 4 solid state storage; specs that will effectively compete with many high-end gaming PCs available today.\nCurrent GeForce NOW Founders and Priority members will get early access to preorder GeForce NOW RTX 3080 starting today. Six-month memberships are priced at $99.99, with initial availability in North America starting next month (it will start in December in Europe). Preorders will be opened up for all gamers in late October, pending availability, because with the amount of gaming horsepower on offer, quantities will be limited.\nThis latest wave of updates to GeForce NOW clearly demonstrates NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to cloud gaming and further solidifies the company as a technology leader in the space.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

But with prices of CMPs being like this, perhaps these miners would be better off with RTX 3090s.\n\n\nGetty Images \n\nThe flagship NVIDIA CMP card, which is the CMP 170HX, has been spotted on sale for an insane $4400 in Dubai. WCCFTech that a Dubai-based retailer called Vipera is carrying the card.With that price, the NVIDIA CMP 170HX costs so much more than even the most price-gouged RTX 3090 on the market today. Current eBay prices for 3090s as of this writing are almost all under $3000, with the most expensive tipping the scales at $2900 at most.A Twitter user who goes by the handle @KOMACHI_ENSAKA spotted the sale price for the card, which seems to be available overseas for now:According to Vipera, they have a total of 886 units (from a high of 1,427 a few days ago) in stock. But as of this article's publishing, the stocks have likely gone down further.Crypto mining with a graphics card hasn't hogged headlines recently, but it's still there--and making people a lot of money in the process.One can see this in the low stocks and still-inflated prices of NVIDIA and AMD's current-generation GPUs, whose recent price drops have noticeably slowed down.Read alsoWhat Kind Of Hardware Is In The NVIDIA CMP 170HX?For those who are wondering what kind of crypto mining power the NVIDIA CMP 170HX has, the short answer is a lot. And it's got something to do with the hardware.According to Tom's Hardware, the graphics card is featuring the GA100 chip. This silicon is not found in mainstream RTX cards, but only in the super-expensive A100 GPU, which is used for building data centers.\n\n\nGetty Images \n\nThe GA100 packs a total of 4,480 CUDA Cores, which is a bit less than the original ones on the A100 (which has 6,912). But the mining performance, despite the lower CUDA core count, is still off the charts.As per WCCFTech, the CMP 170HX can mine at insane speeds of 164 MH/s. This is far beyond the performance of the erstwhile top-end card, the 90HX, which can only manage 86 MH/s.Should Crypto Miners Buy This Card?Judging by how the Vipera website claims that stocks are going away fast, it seems like miners are indeed buying it.That's because for the mining performance (and the insane price), the NVIDIA CMP 170HX has something extremely attractive to miners: a low power draw. Its rated TDP is only 250W, and it's only using one 8-pin power connector.Compare that to mining with scores of RTX 3090s, and you'll see the massive difference. A single 3090 can consume around 360 watts of power, and produce less than half the MH/s of the 170HX.\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\nIt would be far easier to balance power bills and profits with the NVIDIA CMP 170HX with that kind of power draw. That is, if you're fine with paying almost $4500 for a card.Related :\nNVIDIA Mining Cards are Making MAJOR MONEY for Team GreenThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by RJ Pierce  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

GeForce Now includes access to more than 1,000 PC games, and Nvidia has finally started supporting the Edge browser that now ships on Xbox in a beta update to GeForce Now today.It brings the dream of playing PC games on an Xbox a step closer to reality, as the result is easy access to stream PC games to an Xbox. As the base GeForce Now service is free, you can stream popular PC games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, DOTA 2, and League of Legends at 1080p for an hourlong session.I\u2019ve been able to do this in the past using Parsec, which is essentially a remote desktop app that lets you stream what\u2019s on your PC to a browser. GeForce Now is a far better solution as it doesn\u2019t rely on you having to own a PC that\u2019s capable of running these games, and you just connect to the service through the browser and launch games.What makes this all the more interesting is that the Edge browser on Xbox also supports mouse and keyboard input, so you can play certain games that don\u2019t even have gamepad support. It\u2019s not the most ideal experience on the Xbox right now because the virtual keyboard appears when you click and latency isn\u2019t great for multiplayer games.Microsoft\u2019s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has recently committed to bringing full PC games to the Xbox through the company\u2019s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service. We still don\u2019t know when those will eventually arrive, but GeForce Now in the browser is the best alternative until they do.With Nvidia expanding GeForce Now to Edge and even adding an RTX 3080 tier, it would be great to see an official Xbox client for the service, and a way to play these PC games on PlayStation, too.See More: EntertainmentGamingMicrosoftNewsNvidiaTechXboxMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

GeForce NOW is the cloud-based gaming service from Nividia, which has acknowledged the leaked list of games. Nvidia claims the list does not indicate future releases, but rather is used internally for tracking and testing. \nThe games listed as part of this leak caused such a major stir because they included enormously popular franchises like God of War, Grand Theft Auto, and Final Fantasy. Further evidence of the list's validity is that Sony announced that it would be preparing more games for PC in July last year. Regardless of the validity of the list, or whether these games will ever be released, the massive leak is an apparent indictment of Nvidia's cyber security and general protocol. While Nvidia has announced that no personal information was accessed, this data breach does come after a leak of personnel data in December 2014 and major bugs and data leaks in October 2020.\nRELATED: Leak Suggests Upcoming Intel 'Alchemist' GPU Could Rival RTX 3070 Ti \n                        Nvidia and Data Leaks\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As mentioned, this is not Nvidia's first data leak, and it reveals an ongoing complacency for data leaks more broadly. While the leak has mostly evoked excitement amongst gaming fans, the news comes amidst ongoing chip shortages that persist despite a resurge in supply this summer. Gaming fans then may consider it beneficial that the games leaked, though the chip shortages that Nvidia is also involved in are causing a level of distress; as such, Nvidia's reliability in terms of data management and protection is in doubt.\nNvidia was also careful to mention that in addition to no personal information being leaked, nor were any game builds. Aside from Nvidia's relationship with consumers, the leak will likely have an impact on Nvidia's business relationships. In particular, this leak concerns Sony, who was likely keeping this information under wraps if the list is true to their upcoming projects. However, Sony has suffered its own data breaches in the past, which again further emphasizes a larger trend of data breaches becoming commonplace. It appears as though there is a real failure of cyber security in keeping up with data leaks, which has much more serious ramifications in relation to private data. There has also been a noticeable uptick in theories of data leaks being calculated moves by certain companies to create more buzz. \n                        Implications of the Leaked List of Games\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While Nvidia disavows the list as an indication of upcoming projects, Ubisoft has since issued a takedown notice. This means that at least some of the Ubisoft titles included in the list are genuine upcoming projects from the developer. While many of the games are listed using codenames, these codenames have already been decoded and had their validity assessed. However, as Nvidia emphasized this list was using for testing, which may mean that some of these titles have been since canceled or never actually make it to development. The list gives no real-time insight into any projects in development, and as such any of the information is tenuous. While this indicates a more minor data breach for Nvidia, Ubisoft's takedown is damning evidence.\nUltimately, only time will tell the validity of the list. However, there are plenty of educated guesses about which titles might be actual upcoming projects, and which are unlikely. As such, gaming fans can adjust their expectations accordingly. The list also has some old titles, and publically announced titles, so there's plenty of reason to take it with a grain of salt. Still, the reactions to some titles mentioned in the Nvidia leak could potentially influence developers' future decisions.\nMORE: Half-Life 2 Remastered Mentioned in Nvidia GeForce Now Leak \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGR Originals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGears of War 6 Potentially Leaked by Nvidia GeForce Now\n\t\t\n\n\nNvidia\n\nAfter a recent massive leak from the Nvidia servers, it seems that Gears of War 6 could potentially release sooner than fans think.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy\u00a0\nPreston Fusci\n\n\nSep 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t'I Hope That's Not A ...

And unfortunately, it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Speaking to shareholders to announce Intel\u2019s third-quarter financial earnings, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said that he doesn\u2019t expect the shortage to end until 2023 \u2014 at the earliest.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the worst of it now, every quarter next year we\u2019ll get incrementally better, but they\u2019re not going to have supply-demand balance until 2023,\u201d Gelsinger told CNBC.\u00a0Intel recently said that the chip shortages are dragging down laptop sales, and warned that it might be hard to find juicy PC deals this holiday season.\n\n\nThe other titans of the chip trade agree, to one degree or another. In a similar earnings call in August, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors that he expects supply chain issues to continue for \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of 2022. Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards have been in shockingly short supply for almost two years now, sending secondary market prices skyrocketing as scalpers, cryptocurrency miners, and the occasional PC gamer fight to get what few GPUs are available on the retail market.\u00a0\nIntel and Nvidia\u2019s primary competition in the PC world concurs, though they\u2019re slightly more optimistic. Speaking at the Code Conference in September, AMD CEO Lisa Su predicted that the chip shortage will become \u201cless severe\u201d in the second half of 2022, after being \u201ctight\u201d in the first half.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Leaders at Qualcomm, ARM, Samsung, and Apple all agree that the chip shortage will continue well into 2022, with different levels of pessimism for longer predictions. Industrial powers are trying to boost supply with expanded manufacturing while legislators attempt to help them out, with varying degrees of success. But the consensus seems to be that next year will continue to see high prices and limited stock for almost everything that has a chip inside of it.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Michael Crider, Staff Writer, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

New latency reductions techniques are also promised, with Nvidia making bold claims about input lag up against competing cloud technologies - and even local devices.\nAll of this is made possible via brand new class of server blade Nvidia is bringing online, dubbed the 'SuperPod'. While you're not getting to an actual RTX 3080 as such, you are getting equivalent enterprise-class hardware based on the same GA-102 silicon, backed up by an eight-core, 16 thread AMD Threadripper processor working in combination with ultra-fast PCIe Gen 4.0 solid-state storage and an impressive 28GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory. This gives the SuperPod top-class graphics performance (only an RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3090 are faster in the Nvidia stack), though CPU performance would fall a little short of the latest Ryzen 5000 and Intel CPUs.\n \n \nNvidia dubs its new generation of high-end cloud servers as 'SuperPods'.\nThe cost of this new premium tier is \u00a389.99 for six months (UPDATE: 99.99 Euro and $99.99 US) - an interesting proposition for the kind of hardware that Nvidia reckons would cost you circa $2000 to buy, and that's without adjusting for the manic price inflation in the current market. Obviously though, you are renting access to Nvidia servers, so there's no hardware for to resell when it comes to upgrading, while the quality of the experience will come to down to the perennial cloud favourites - image quality and latency. In terms of the kind of connection you'll need to push this service to its limits, 35Mbps is cited for 1440p gaming a 120fps, while 40Mbps is required for 4K60 HDR cloud streaming. \nIt's Nvidia claims for latency that are intriguing. A new technology known as Adaptive Sync aims to cut down lag by more closely synchronising the cloud server with the refresh of your display, by rooting out dropped and duplicated frames. This works best for 120Hz panels, where claims for total end-to-end latency of less than 60ms have been mooted - in the same ballpark as the kind of latency observed on 60fps console games. Interestingly, Nvidia reckons playing Destiny 2 on GeForce Now even at 60fps (on a 120Hz screen? this isn' clear) offers a 12ms latency advantage over the same game played natively on Xbox Series X (81ms vs 93ms). Up against xCloud, Nvidia claims a phenomenal 94ms advantage for its 60fps stream compared to Microsoft's - a situation that obviously demands testing across a range of titles. \n \n \nBig claims are made for low latency gaming with the new GeForce Now.\nAdaptive sync is not limited to the premium tier and should roll out to all GeForce Now users. There's a basic free tier with one hour session lengths on what is described as a 'basic rig', while an RTX option with six-hour session lengths targeting 1080p60 costs \u00a344.99 for six months. The new RTX 3080 'Super Pod' \u00a389.99 service ups that to eight-hour sessions without having to share those servers with any other tier, while also offering higher resolution and refresh rate support. It's worth remembering that GeForce Now is essentially a way to stream the PC games you already own via storefronts like Steam and the Epic Games Store - though actual availability depends on whether they are available on the Nvidia's service or not. \nThis announcement is intriguing. Offering cloud-based access to state-of-the-art PC hardware is a good thing, though the current limitation of only offering 4K60 streaming via Shield Android TV is a little off-putting. Regardless, if Nvidia's claims hold up, we should be looking at a system with significantly more horsepower than current-gen consoles and competing cloud platforms, along with lower latency too. Pre-orders are available now, but we'll be taking a look at whether the service holds up as soon as we can.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            Xbox Game Pass late March titles announced\n          \n\n\n\n            One of gaming's most memorable tunes is now available on Nintendo Music\n          \n\n\n\n            God of War TV show getting second season, though first still being written\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRichard Leadbetter: Rich has been a games journalist since the days of 16-bit and specialises in technical analysis.

Less than a year later, it\u2019s already starting to compete with the best GPUs from AMD and Nvidia as well. The new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max offer a first glimpse at how well Apple\u2019s M1 chips can scale to provide raw performance that rivals the discrete graphics cards we typically find inside Windows-powered laptops.Nvidia has been trying to woo many of Apple\u2019s professional and creative customers with its Studio laptops, but Apple has not only managed to fix the mistakes it made with its MacBook port selection and keyboard, but it\u2019s also scaled up its M1 chips to meet the performance expectations of 14- and 16-inch laptops, too. The result has creative professionals excited, and it\u2019s easy to see why.While Windows laptops had looked increasingly tempting to the Mac crowd over the past five years, Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips shift the balance, particularly in the GPU realm. They look like early warning shots at the AMD- and Nvidia-powered competition. Apple seems confident it can deliver the same performance as a top discrete graphics card while consuming a lot less power. This is all part of Apple\u2019s ambitious plan to transition its Mac lineup fully to Apple Silicon by the end of 2022 and just a glimpse at what the company must have coming to its most powerful Mac, the towering Mac Pro.Apple has compared its M1 Max to two RTX 3080 laptops. Image: AppleApple proudly compared its new M1 Max chip to two high-end Windows laptops last week, claiming the M1 Max is able to use 100W less power and offer the same relative performance at close to or above Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 mobile chip. While the M1 Max might be Apple\u2019s largest chip it has ever made, it\u2019s still integrating the graphics into a system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture, compared to the dedicated and separate RTX 3080 cards.While there are caveats, it wasn\u2019t just talk: early reviews seem to back up some of Apple\u2019s claims. Anandtech found that both the M1 Pro and M1 Max perform well on productivity-focused loads, with a GFXBench test even putting it close to beating an RTX 3080 laptop equipped with Intel\u2019s Core i9-11980HK flagship notebook processor. These are the types of loads you\u2019d expect the M1 Max to perform well in, especially given Apple\u2019s work on improving its chips for productivity tasks.YouTuber Dave2D found the M1 Max was slightly slower than a comparable RTX 3080 system for Adobe Premiere Pro tasks and that M1 Max performance depends on the work involved. While an Adobe Premiere Pro render took 10 minutes and 17 seconds in Dave2D\u2019s testing, an identical render took just 4 minutes and 16 seconds using Apple\u2019s Final Cut Pro software.Where the M1 Max and M1 Pro really fall down is in gaming. The M1 Max performs similarly to an RTX 3060 system in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. While midrange gaming might be impressive for an SoC, it\u2019s disappointing compared to Apple\u2019s claims because an RTX 3060 is a notable step down from an RTX 3070, let alone an RTX 3080. Anandtech\u2019s tests also show the flagship M1 Max offering less than half the performance of an RTX 3080 laptop in Borderlands 3. We\u2019re still reviewing Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Pros, but we\u2019ve also found the M1 Max is mostly comparable to an RTX 3060 notebook for gaming.Apple\u2019s new MacBook Pros include some impressive GPU performance. Photo by Amelia Holowaty KralesGiven most macOS cross-platform games are still x86 and the fact macOS has never really been a platform for gaming, it\u2019s no surprise to see the M1 Max struggling here. So another way to think about it is that Apple\u2019s already matching the RTX 3060 without the benefit of game developers optimizing for its M1 chips. That\u2019s an impressive start for Apple, even if there\u2019s no indication yet that the Mac will attract optimized games in the future.It\u2019s also impressive when you consider the power draw and thermal headroom involved. We\u2019ve already seen the difference a fan can make on the MacBook Pro 13-inch model compared to the fanless MacBook Air. Now, we\u2019re seeing what it can do with a 140W power adapter and a larger 14- or 16-inch chassis to dissipate the heat. What could Apple do in an iMac or Mac Pro, with plenty of time and plenty of room to build an even bigger and better GPU with fewer thermal and power constraints?\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Apple\u2019s ongoing experience with GPUs has paid off with the development of their A-series chips, and now their M1 family of SoCs,\u201d writes Anandtech\u2019s Andrei Frumusanu. \u201cPut succinctly, the new M1 SoCs prove that Apple can build the kind of big and powerful GPUs that they need for their high-end machines. AMD and NVIDIA need not apply.\u201dBloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says those bigger chips are already coming, with Apple designing two variations for the next desktop Mac Pro that offer \u201c2x and 4x the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max.\u201d That will result in up to 40 CPU cores and up to 128 GPU cores on the very high-end Mac Pro models, and it will be the real test of Apple\u2019s ability to scale its M1 advantage.AMD currently supplies Radeon Pro GPUs inside Apple\u2019s existing Mac Pro models, and if Apple\u2019s core count and performance can scale well on the GPU side, then it\u2019s easy to see how Apple\u2019s own GPUs could blow past AMD\u2019s Radeon PRO W6000X cards. Apple is already close to mobile RTX 3080s in some tasks with the M1 Max \u2014 we\u2019re looking forward to seeing what it will do when Apple\u2019s chip designers can focus less on mobility and more on cooling its hardware for maximum performance.If more software and even games become optimized to take advantage of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and Apple\u2019s desktop chips deliver the performance improvements we\u2019ve seen so far with M1, Apple could be on course to redefine the performance expectations of desktop PCs, just like it redefined the expectations around laptop chips late last year.Related:See More: AppleNvidiaReportTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

One way to improve the quality and time-to-deployment of DRL policies is to use massive parallelism.In the paper Learning to Walk in Minutes Using Massively Parallel Deep Reinforcement Learning, a research team from ETH Zurich and NVIDIA proposes a training framework that enables fast policy generation for real-world robotic tasks using massive parallelism on a single workstation GPU. Compared to previous methods, the approach can reduce training time by multiple orders of magnitude.Current on-policy reinforcement learning approaches comprise both data collection and policy updates. The policy updates correspond to back-propagation for neural networks, which is relatively easy to perform in parallel on a single GPU. Parallelizing data collection however involves policy inference, simulation, rewards, and observation calculations; and remains a challenging research area for several reasons. Firstly, GPUs are unsuitable for policy inference due to communication bottlenecks; secondly, data transfer over a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) can be 50 times slower than the GPU processing time alone; thirdly, sending large amounts of data to the GPU for each policy update tends to slow down the entire process.To overcome these issues, the researchers explore the potential of massive parallelism with end-to-end data collection and policy updates on the GPU, aiming to improve the efficiency of DRL training.The proposed DRL algorithm is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and is designed to perform every operation and store all data on a GPU to enable efficient learning from thousands of robots in parallel.The study found that it is important to train the ambulatory policy on less challenging terrain before progressively increasing complexity, and so the researchers have introduced a game-inspired automatic curriculum learning scheme that trains robots at a level of difficulty tailored to their performance without requiring any external tuning.This curriculum learning is also well suited for the massively parallel regime, as it enables thousands of robots to directly use their current progress in the curriculum as the distribution of the policy\u2019s performance. It also does not require tuning, and thus be implemented in a parallel manner with near-zero processing cost.The team conducted a number of evaluation experiments, training robots with proposed DRL algorithms in the Isaac Gym physics simulation environment on a single workstation GPU.The experiments yielded two interesting observations: 1) When the number of robots is too high, the performance drops sharply; 2) With larger batch sizes, the overall reward is higher and the time horizon effect is shifted.The researchers also conducted simulation and deployment experiments, where they observed a nearly 100 percent success rate for climbing and descending steps up to 0.2 m (the hardest stair difficulty).Overall, the study shows that using an end-to-end GPU pipeline with thousands of robots simulated in parallel, combined with the proposed curriculum structure, can reduce the training time required to teach robots to walk by multiple orders of magnitude compared to current baselines. The team says they hope their study can change researchers\u2019 perspectives on the required training time for real-world robotics applications, and that other tasks may also benefit from the massively parallel regime.The paper Learning to Walk in Minutes Using Massively Parallel Deep Reinforcement Learning is on arXiv.Author: Hecate He |\u00a0Editor: Michael SarazenWe know you don\u2019t want to miss any news or research breakthroughs.\u00a0Subscribe to our popular newsletter\u00a0Synced Global AI Weekly\u00a0to get weekly AI updates. \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading... \n\nTagsAI \u2022 Artificial Intelligence \u2022 Deep Reinforcement Learning \u2022 Machine Learning \u2022 ML \u2022 parallel computing \u2022 Research \u2022 robotics \u2022 technology\n\n\n \n\nAbout\n Synced \n\nMachine Intelligence | Technology & Industry | Information & Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    1 comment on \u201cETH Zurich and NVIDIA\u2019s Massively Parallel Deep RL Enables Robots to Learn to Walk in Minutes\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nkamir bouchareb st \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2021-10-05\n\n\n\n\ngoooooooooooooooood\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Our investigation aims to ensure that companies active in Europe continue having effective access to the technology that is necessary to produce state-of-the-art semiconductor products at competitive prices.\u201dArm acts as a vendor-neutral licensor, selling its chip designs and architectures to a number of companies, Nvidia included. \"The merged entity would also have the economic incentive to engage in such foreclosure strategies which could reduce competition in the market for the supply of processor products across different fields of application,\" the EC said.The Commission will also examine whether licensees will be reluctant to continue sharing commercially sensitive information with a company controlled by Nvidia.Another area of concern is whether Arm's R&D spending will be refocused on products that are more profitable to Nvidia.The Commission now has 90 working days, until 15 March 2022 to take a decision.In August, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority said that it \"found significant competition concerns associated with the merged business\u2019 ability and incentive to harm the competitiveness of Nvidia's rivals,\" potentially by restricting access to Arm IP and \"impairing interoperability between related products, so as to benefit Nvidia's downstream activities and increase its profits.\"Chinese regulators also risk holding up the acquisition, while the US FTC has opened an investigation into the acquisition after Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm complained it would limit competition.\n\n\n\n Subscribe to our daily newsletters\n\n\n Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Electronics cuts global workforce again amid sliding market dominance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe drivers of chip design: AI, efficiency and geopolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nMargrethe Vestager\n\n\nArm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The SL seamlessly combines performance and luxury with the latest MBUX intelligent cockpit, powered by NVIDIA.\nMBUX runs on the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA GPUs for instantaneous AI processing and sharp graphics. In the Mercedes-AMG SL, these industry-leading capabilities are tuned for its sporty character, adding items such as \u201cAMG Performance\u201d or \u201cAMG Track Pace\u201d to driver controls.\nThe expansion of the latest generation MBUX from ultra luxury, such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, and everyday comfort, as in the C-Class, to the highest levels of performance driving show the versatility and vast potential of in-vehicle AI.\nAn Intelligent Icon\nThe MBUX system in the SL takes the best convenience and luxury features of the S-Class and amps up the volume on driving controls.\nAI cockpits orchestrate various in-cabin features on a single, centralized compute platform, constantly learning to continuously deliver joy to the customer. Similarly, the MBUX system serves as the central nervous system of the vehicle, intelligently networking all its functions, leveraging the high performance of NVIDIA GPUs for brilliant graphics.\nIn contrast to its more passenger-focused cousins, the SL cockpit is geared toward the driver, right down to the adjustable central display with crystal-clear graphics. It sports a fully digital 12.3-inch high-resolution instrument cluster, which is integrated into a three-dimensional visor. And with MBUX, drivers have the freedom to customize the display style and driving modes.\nDrivers can operate MBUX using the \u201cHey Mercedes\u201d intelligent voice assistant, which can understand up to 28 languages.\nWhile the SL was made for those who love the open road, it incorporates intelligent driving features for moments that don\u2019t feel as recreational. Using camera and radar sensors around the vehicle, driver assistance systems observe the surrounding environment and, if necessary, can quickly intervene.\nThe driver can see how this system operates using a display in the instrument cluster. The driver assistance system shows a real-time 3D view of the car, lanes, lane markings and other road users such as cars, trucks and two-wheelers. The display also visualizes the status and operation of these features. Dynamic, high-quality graphics make the driver assistance system transparent and easy to understand.\nThis intelligent design blends effortlessly into the roadster\u2019s iconic analog controls for a look that\u2019s both timeless and embraces the future.\n\n\u201cThe SL was a great opportunity and challenge for design because every designer wants to create icons,\u201d said Gorden Wagener, chief design officer at Daimler Group. \u201cThe result is a revolutionary interior experience caught between digital and analog luxury. We created the most iconic SL ever.\u201d\nForm Meets Function\nThe SL carries on its decades-long heritage of performance with new features that add comfort and convenience.\nThe roadster calls back to its predecessors with a soft top, while suited for everyday use as a 2+2-seater. This SL is also the first ever to feature all-wheel drive for dynamic driving in any conditions.\nThe body of the SL is entirely unique \u2014 no other Mercedes-AMG model nor previous roadsters share the same shell components. The chassis consists of a lightweight composite aluminium structure with a self-supporting aluminium space frame. This innovative design is architected for precise driving dynamics, high comfort and a sporty exterior.\nThe first two SL variants to launch will feature the AMG 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine, with a performance hybrid to follow. The eight-cylinder engine delivers exceptional power and acceleration with maximum efficiency.\nWith the latest generation SL, the cutting edge in performance driving meets the latest in AI innovation for an experience that is truly thrilling and intelligent.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The card is being produced to counter AMD's entry-level lineup as their GeForce RTX 3050 series is a little underpowered to tackle AMD's Navi 23.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB To Be Priced Around $300 US To Counter Entry-Level AMD RDNA 2 Graphics Cards\nThere are multiple rumors suggesting that NVIDIA is preparing a 12 GB variant of its GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card. It is not known if the card is simply receiving a memory capacity boost or also offers updated specs.\nRelated Story AMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 CoresAccording to Moore's Law is Dead, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB will be the answer to low-end AMD RDNA 2 GPUs. The GPU will still be produced at TSMC which means NVIDIA can source its GPU supply from both TSMC and Samsung. But the main question arises, how is the RTX 2060 12 GB going to be a competitive option in 2022?\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2060 was released back in 2019 and the 12 GB variant will be launching two years later. Again, we don't know if its just the memory capacity that has changed or the underlying specs too. The card did receive a SUPER variant and a few other variants specific to certain markets but it looks like the 12 GB variant is going to be available globally. The reason cited once again is that the RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 look to be pretty underwhelming against the AMD RDNA 2 GPU lineup & even so compared to the RTX 2060. It could be a similar story to where the GTX 1050 was too under powered and had to wait till the Ti variant to fix the competitive positioning.\nBut in terms of pricing, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB graphics cards are said to end up at around $300 US. This isn't MSRP but the actual retail price. The AMD Radeon RX 6600 Non-XT is said to feature an MSRP of $329 US but will end up somewhere close to $400-$450 US. The RTX 3060 12 GB has an MSRP of $ 329 US but also ends up over $500 US. So for $150-$200 US lower, the GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB might make sense, especially if it ends up offering performance in between the RX 5600 XT and RX 5700.\nA possibility is that the new GeForce RTX 2060 will be positioned against what is likely to be an even more entry-level RDNA 2 lineup from AMD, mainly their Navi 24 GPUs but that's all speculation for now.\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Website Exposes AMD Radeon RX 9050 GPU; An Entry-Level RDNA 4 GPU?\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT & RX 9070 GPUs Launched \u2013 Now Available In Huge Range of Custom Models\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Buy Lists Various AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT & RX 9070 GPUs, Starting At $599 All The Way To $849\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n239\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n109\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n106\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang Gets Spotted At Denny\u2019s Mobile Station, Flipping Burgers Ahead of The GTC 2025 Keynote\n\n\n\n68\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1151\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Santa Monica Studio are bringing God of War to your home computer on January 14th, 2022.\u00a0Game Rating: Rating Pending.\nFeaturing enhanced graphics, exclusive PC features, and full support for 4K HDR gaming, God of War on PC is an incredible experience you won\u2019t want to miss. And if you play on a GeForce RTX GPU, desktop or laptop, you can enhance God of War with our AI-powered performance accelerating NVIDIA DLSS technology, and the latency-optimizing NVIDIA Reflex, which makes gameplay even more responsive.\nCheck out the debut God of War PC trailer below, and keep reading to learn more and to see the first 4K PC screenshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod of War On PC, Featuring NVIDIA DLSS\nNVIDIA DLSS is our groundbreaking AI-powered tech that accelerates performance on GeForce RTX GPUs. Using dedicated GPU Tensor Cores, DLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images in your favorite games.\nTo date, NVIDIA DLSS has accelerated performance in over 100 games, enabling GeForce RTX players to play with maxed out graphics and high resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Makes God of War On PC More Responsive\nGod of War is a fast action game with spectacular combos that are key to overcoming the game\u2019s most difficult challenges. If your PC\u2019s system latency is high, gameplay feels laggy, and controls unresponsive. Combos are harder to chain, tricky jumps are mistimed, and the experience feels slow.\nUsing NVIDIA Reflex, developers can quickly and easily reduce system latency for several generations of NVIDIA GeForce RTX and GTX GPUs, making gameplay snappy and responsive. To ensure God of War is enjoyed at its best on PC, Santa Monica Studio are also incorporating NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod of War On PC Boasts Enhanced Graphics and Extra Features\nGod of War on PC boasts numerous graphical and experiential enhancements to make full use of the PC\u2019s capabilities.\nGraphically, there are higher-resolution shadows, improved screen space reflections, enhanced Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO) and Screen Space Directional Occlusion (SSDO) effects, higher detail assets, and higher rendering resolutions, making the God of War world look even more spectacular. Plus, the frame rate is fully uncapped, for a smoother, faster presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can play in HDR on G-SYNC and G-SYNC ULTIMATE gaming monitors, TVs and displays, and in 21:9 panoramic ultra-widescreen, for the most immersive experience possible.\nGod of War on PC includes robust controller support and keyboard mapping customization. But if you would prefer playing on a controller, Santa Monica Studio has included support for the PlayStation DUALSHOCK\u00ae4 and DUALSENSE\u00ae wireless controllers, in addition to a wide range of other gamepads. And there\u2019ll be the full range of UI, system options, and other expected settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod of War Launches On PC January 14, 2022\nWe can\u2019t wait for gamers to try God of War on PC, and we\u2019re excited to collaborate with Sony Interactive Entertainment and Santa Monica Studio to bring GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience, enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can pre-purchase God of War for PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

It also includes support for NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology, so more users can tap into the power of AI to create stunning, photorealistic graphics from anywhere.\nPowerful Performance for Remote Environments\nThe recent Windows 11 release provides a new level of sophistication to desktop experiences \u2014 as well as a greater demand for graphics acceleration. It requires much more compute power than Windows 10, including a graphics card compatible with DirectX 12 or later with a WDDM 2.0 driver, and a high-definition display of 9 inches or greater with 8 bits per color channel.\nProfessionals can address these challenges with the NVIDIA vGPU Fall 2021 release. With GPU-accelerated virtual machines on Windows 11, users can get the power and performance to run intensive compute and graphics workflows while working remotely from anywhere, on any device.\nSupport for NVIDIA DLSS, a groundbreaking AI rendering technology, increases graphics performance using NVIDIA RTX GPUs with dedicated Tensor Core AI processors.\nDLSS uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and help professionals generate beautiful, sharp rendered images. The increased frame rate and image clarity of DLSS are exceedingly beneficial to virtual reality developers, given the steep requirements of immersive experiences.\n\nEnterprise users can stream those VR experiences to their favorite XR devices by using NVIDIA CloudXR running on NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstations (vWS).\nTo simplify the deployment of accelerated virtual desktop infrastructure and help customers implement the highest quality end-user computing solution possible, NVIDIA now offers customized pre-sales and post-sales services for NVIDIA vGPU deployments. This includes:\n\nVDI Assessments to help customers along their desktop transformation journey, and\nVDI Implementations to more quickly architect and deploy an accelerated VDI environment.\n\nWith this release of vGPU software, customers using NVIDIA RTX vWS or NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server (vCS) software editions are supported with Ubuntu KVM (versions 20.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS) and SuSE Linux hypervisors.\nThe NVIDIA vGPU Fall 2021 release is available for download now, here.\n\n\nCategories: Graphics Virtualization | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | CloudXR | NVIDIA RTX | Remote Work | Rendering | Virtual Reality | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Making technology comprehensible and relevant.for\u00a0Tirias ResearchFollow AuthorOct 25, 2021, 06:50pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Nvidia GeForce Now SuperPODNvidia\nThe most advanced cloud gaming service, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now (GFN), announced a new performance tier designed for 1440P, high-refresh rate 120Hz displays. This announcement is part of the company\u2019s measured roll out of cloud gaming services designed to bring PC Gaming to more devices and with better performance. While it\u2019s not as flexible as having your own dedicated game PC, there\u2019s a lot to be said for getting access to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU running on an AMD Threadripper Pro CPU for only US$99.99 for 6 months. That is really appealing if you want a higher refresh rate for competitive game performance and don\u2019t have the space or budget for an expensive game PC.\n\n\nWe previously covered changes to the GFN pricing tiers earlier this year and explained the appeal of cloud gaming.\nForbesNvidia GeForce Now Game Streaming Service Updates TiersBy Kevin Krewell\nThe GFN service offers games from many PC online stores, including Steam, Epic, GOG, and Ubisoft. The available titles on GFN include many of the popular free-to-play games like Fortnite, Dota 2, Apex Legends, Destiny 2 and more. With both Priority and RTX 3080 memberships there\u2019s support for ray tracing titles like New World, Marvel\u2019s Guardian of the Galaxy, Dying Light 2 and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT. EA has some limited titles on the GFN service such as Apex Legends, Battlefield 1 Revolution, Mirrors Edge Catalyst, Unravel and Dragon Age. Nvidia adds new games every Thursday.\n\nThe GeForce Now Product Pricing and Feature MatrixNvidia\nNvidia is building out the new GFN service using a new more capable cloud gaming servers it calls GeForce NOW SuperPODs, using technology it developed for the high-performance computing market.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThe GFN SuperPOD is bigger than the previous GFN cloud servers by about double. Each GFN SuperPOD supports over 1000 users with more than 1000 GPUs. The Nvidia Ampere-based GeForce RTX supports ray tracing graphics on titles that support Nvidia\u2019s RTX technology. In aggregate, Nvidia specifies the GFN SuperPOD delivers more than 39 petaflops in those 1000 GPUs and has 8,960 AMD Threadripper Pro CPU cores.\n\nWith the SuperPOD each gamer has access to cloud hardware comprised of an 8-core/16-thread CPU, a dedicated GeForce RTX 3080, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM, and a PCIe Gen4 SSD. In a dig against consoles, Nvidia adds that for gamers the GFN SuperPOD allocates an instance and \u201cEach instance is 35 teraflops of performance, nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X.\u201d\n\n Play GeForce Now on many platformsNvidia\nWith this level of performance Nvidia is targeting gamers running up to 1440p displays running at 120Hz. Nvidia\u2019s client software delivers a smooth frame rate to the client at either 60Hz or 120Hz. Nvidia can also support 60Hz refresh rates at 4K HDR resolution on Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV. For high-resolution, high-refresh configurations, Nvidia recommends that gamers have 35Mbps of network download bandwidth.\nAs of October 21, GeForce Now Founders and Priority members have early access and can preorder GeForce NOW RTX 3080. Six-month memberships cost $99.99, and will be available in North America starting in November. In Europe, they\u2019ll be available in December. Preorders will also be open to all gamers later in October, pending availability. Quantities are limited. In addition, the company is expanding its GFN reach with game servers in Canada (Montreal), Russia (Siberia), South America, Singapore, and Australia.\nWith the ongoing GPU shortage, GFN offers a good alternative to spending thousands on a new computer. You never know, new GPUs may just be around the corner in 2022.\nTirias Research tracks and consults for companies throughout the electronics ecosystem from semiconductors to systems and sensors to the cloud.

The companies will team up to integrate more of their products with another and expand joint sales activities.\nDomino Data Lab competes in the so-called MLOps product category, which encompasses software tools that make it easier for enterprises to deploy and maintain AI models. The startup offers a Kubernetes-based platform that, it says, provides a single pane of glass for managing machine learning projects. Data science teams can use the platform to provision infrastructure, install AI development tools and make the neural networks they create available to colleagues via application programming interfaces.\nCentralizing the AI development process in one platform, Domino Data Lab promises, will solve many of the challenges that commonly emerge in enterprise machine learning initiatives.\nOne task the startup promises to ease is provisioning infrastructure for AI projects. Often, data science teams require help from the information technology department to set up AI infrastructure, which creates more work for IT personnel. In other cases, data science teams spin up hardware on their own, which has the potential to create challenges as well. Infrastructure provisioned without the supervision of IT personnel can lead to cost overruns and cybersecurity issues.\nDomino Data Lab says its platform allows IT teams to allocate hardware resources to data science teams through a centralized interface with point-and-click controls. The result, according to the startup, is a reduction in the amount of manual work required to manage AI infrastructure.\nWhen it comes to software, data science uses a variety of development tools to build neural networks. In addition, they often draw on algorithms and other AI building blocks from the open-source ecosystem. Each software component has the potential to contain cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which is why enterprises often test new technologies adopted by their data science teams before deployment.\nDomino Data Lab says its platform allows companies to manage centrally what software data science teams use. In the interest of further improving cybersecurity, the startup encrypts the data that customers use as part of their projects. Files are scrambled both when they\u2019re sent across the network and while they\u2019re kept in storage.\nAccording to Domino Data Lab, its platform is used by more than 20% of the Fortune 100. The startup says the hardware provisioning features and other productivity capabilities in its platform have saved thousands of hours of engineering time for some customers, allowing AI projects to be completed faster.\u00a0\nA second, perhaps just as significant task that MLOps offerings promise to ease for enterprises is recruiting. A poll commissioned by Data Domino Lab found that many firms find it difficult to hire enough AI professionals. According to the startup, simplifying the operational tasks involved in building AI software can enable a company\u2019s existing data science teams to take on machine learning projects that were previously too complicated. The result is that enterprises have to hire fewer AI specialists.\u00a0\nDomino Data Lab\u2019s plans for the new $100 million in funding it has raised include expanding its partnership with Nvidia. The companies will work to make the startup\u2019s platform easier to deploy on AI systems featuring the chipmaker\u2019s graphics cards. As part of the effort, Domino Data Lab will have its platform certified to run on Nvidia AI Enterprise, a software suite that makes it possible to run AI software on many kinds of infrastructure.\n\u201cAI and data science are new workloads that demand a full-stack solution \u2014 one with tools that simplify development and deployment for customers,\u201d said Manuvir Das, head of enterprise computing at Nvidia. \u201cWith Nvidia AI Enterprise integration into the Domino platform, customers will be able to easily integrate advanced AI tools into their traditional data center infrastructure.\u201d\nIn a blog post today, Domino Data Lab co-founder and Chief Executive Nick Elprin said the startup will be \u201cestablishing a team dedicated to supporting our customers as they build competitive advantage with Nvidia accelerated computing solutions.\u201d The startup also plans to step up hiring in other areas.\u00a0\nThe funding round represents a particularly valuable boost for Domino Data Lab given that the MLOps segment in which it operates has become more competitive recently. In July, $6.3 billion AI development startup DataRobot Inc.\u00a0acquired MLOps provider Algorithmia Inc. to expand its market share.\nDomino Data Lab has raised $228 million in funding to date.\nImage: Domino Data Lab\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

With recent MSRP and street pricing raging out of control, are they still attractive choices? Which is the\u00a0best graphics card\u00a0for you? Let\u2019s look at their pricing, performance, and more to answer those questions. If you can find one, that is.\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs AMD RX 6800: Price and availability\nForget that the RTX 3070 should be $499, or the Radeon RX 6800 $579. These mythical numbers exist only to tempt us. The GPU shortage debacle has taken its toll on pricing, you can expect to pay at least double for the RTX 3070 on the second-hand market. If you think that\u2019s rough, in May it reached a peak of almost $1500 for some models due to the crypto mining boom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$520 at  Newegg \n\n\n\n\nThe AMD RX 6800 doesn\u2019t fair better here either; you\u2019ll fork over nearly double its original MSRP to pick one up, too. Regardless of price, the RTX 3070 has been one of the most popular GPUs in units sold, far eclipsing the AMD offerings in units if we\u2019re to believe things such as the Steam gaming survey.\nWith its high popularity and despite its greater availability, the RTX 3070 is typically tough to find in stock. Gamers are still Nvidia-centric in their preference, thanks to better ray tracing and DLSS performance, Nvenc encoders, and brand recognition. AMD has produced a truly competitive GPU in the RX 6800, but its sales have suffered due to higher third-party AIB model pricing and lower availability compared to the RTX 3070.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMD Radeon RX 6800 next to an EK waterblock plate.Thiago Trevisan/IDG\nNvidia RTX 3070 vs. AMD RX 6800: Performance\nNvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 came with lofty performance promises of beating the previous flagship RTX 2080 Ti for considerably cheaper. The AMD RX 6800 brought Radeon GPUs back into the high-end competitive arena. The more expensive RX 6800 is better, sometimes. To decode this, let\u2019s look at some brand specific technologies and how they impact performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadeon RX 6800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$580 at  Best Buy \n\n\n\n\nFirst, Nvidia has a lead in areas such as DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and ray tracing. AMD has introduced its own counterpart variants but they need time to mature. DLSS can be a game changer in certain titles, improving performance considerably. Coupled with ray tracing, DLSS is extremely effective with its AI upscaling. AMD also has its own perks; such as Smart Access Memory. This allows your Ryzen 5000 CPU to unlock more performance from a Radeon RX 5000- or 6000-series GPU, giving you higher frame rates in many games.\n\nThe RX 6800 also packs 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, compared to a skimpy 8GB on the RTX 3070. For 1080p and 1440p gaming, this is not significant. For 4K and above, however, 8GB of VRAM may have future limitations in some titles; but we wouldn\u2019t worry for most use cases.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nIn Wolfenstein Youngblood the RX 6800 is faster than the RTX 3070, even though it is an Nvidia-leaning title. You can expect around 11 percent better in 4K, and 13 percent in 1440p. More surprising is that the RX 6800 can often get near an RTX 3080 in performance! Talk about a generational leap from the AMD 5700 XT to the RX 6800. Impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nIn Metro Exodus, with ray tracing on, we see Nvidia at an advantage here. Performance suffers more on the RX 6800 versus the RTX 3070 when this is switched on. Furthermore, with DLSS activated, the RTX 3070 pulls out even farther ahead versus the RX 6800 with ray tracing-centric titles that support both.\nWhich is better? For most games, the RX 6800 will give you the better performance. If you want to indulge in ray tracing titles, however, the RTX 3070 is likely a better bet coupled with DLSS. Considering this technology is still maturing, the performance nod does go the to RX 6800 for most use cases especially at lower resolutions.\n\nIf you want to play at 4K with all the eye candy, the RTX 3070 typically does better here with DLSS; while the RX 6800 will be superb in 1080p and 1440p.\n Nvidia RTX 3070 vs. AMD RX 6800: Power draw and other things to know\nThe 220W TDP of the Nvidia RTX 3070 is impressive for its performance, as is the 250W AMD RX 6800. Both come in a variety of air cooler designs that typically keep them thermally in check. They\u2019re far from heat monsters like the RTX 3080 and 3090 with their GDDR6x VRAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI GeForce RTX 3070 Suprim\nThiago Trevisan/IDG\nEven If you\u2019re solely a gamer, it\u2019s good to know what is going on in the crypto-mining space as it highly affects GPUs as well. The RTX 3070 has been a popular choice for miners, with its nearly 60 megahashes per second and fairly efficient power draw. LHR (Lite Hash Rate) versions have dampened some of that interest, but they\u2019re still selling like hotcakes. The RX 6800 has similar mining performance, but less efficiency, and typically at a slightly higher price than the RTX 3070. (A much higher average price if you count the third-party AIB RX 6800 cards, which have sky-high MSRPs.)\nWhich one should you buy?\nIf you\u2019re a 1080p or 1440p gamer, you\u2019re likely to be better off with the RX 6800 if you find one closer to MSRP. If you must have ray tracing with Nvidia\u2019s glorious DLSS technology at 1440p or 4k, the RTX 3070 is a solid choice.\n\nAMD Radeon drivers are much improved over the previous generation RX 5000 GPUs, but Nvidia still has a lead in general driver implementation.\nWe wish the answer were simple, however. With record shortages and skyrocketing prices, we\u2019d recommend you grab one that is most reasonably priced if you can find it. You\u2019ll have a blast with either GPU; the mid-range has come a long way. We just hope the price and availability catch up, too.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

It was said that the M1 Pro's 16-core GPU is seven-times faster than the integrated graphics on a modern \"8-core PC laptop chip,\" and delivers more performance than a discrete notebook GPU while using 70% less power. \rThe M1 Max was said to have even more performance, with it apparently comparable to a high-end GPU in a compact pro PC laptop, while being similarly power efficient. \rIn estimates by NotebookCheck following Apple's release of details about its configurations, it is claimed the new chips may well be able to outpace modern notebook GPUs, and even some non-notebook devices. \rThe reference for the publication is the known quantity, namely the M1, which has an eight-core GPU that manages 2.6 teraflops of single-precision floating-point performance, also known as FP32 or float32. \rApple Silicon processorM1M1 ProM1 ProM1 MaxM1 MaxGPU core count814162432Teraflops2.64.55.27.810.4AMD equivalent GPURadeon RX 560 (2.6TF)Radeon RX 5500M (4.6TF)Radeon RX 5500 (5.2TF)Radeon RX 5700M (7.9TF)Radeon RX Vega 56 (10.5TF)Nvidia equivalent GPUGeForce GTX 1650(2.9TF)GeForce GTX 1650 Super (4.4TF)GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (5.4TF)GeForce RTX 2070(7.4TF)GeForce RTX 2080 (10TF)In the case of the M1 Pro, the 14-core variant is thought to run at up to 4.5 teraflops, while the advertised 16-core is believed to manage 5.2 teraflops. For the M1 Max, the 24-core version is expected to hit 7.8 teraflops, and the top 32-core variant could manage 10.4 teraflops. \rIf the estimates turn out to be accurate, it does put the new M1 chips in some esteemed company. \rThe 16-core GPU in the M1 Pro is thought to be 5.2 teraflops, which puts it in the same ballpark as the Radeon RX 5500 in terms of performance. The Nvidia equivalent would be the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, which is slightly faster at peak performance with 5.4 teraflops. \rAt the high end, the M1 Max's 32-core GPU is at a par with the AMD Radeon RX Vega 56, a GPU that Apple used in the iMac Pro. Its Nvidia equivalent would be something like the GeForce RTX 2060. \rAgainst game consoles, the 32-core GPU puts it at a par with the PlayStation 5's 10.28 teraflops of performance, while the Xbox Series X is capable of up to 12 teraflops. \rFor the moment, these are estimates based on what Apple said during its special event and in the following press releases and product pages, and therefore can't really be considered perfectly accurate, aside from the M1's performance. \rTflops are not the ultimate comparison of GPU performance. Real-world performance varies depending on if a task is CPU-bound, or if the GPU has a constant flow of data at the theoretical maximum data transfer rate. The performance estimates by the report also assume that the chips are running at the same clock speed as the M1.\rNo one outside of Apple will truly know the performance of the new chips until the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro ship to consumers. At that time, benchmarks will reveal how powerful the new M1 chips truly are. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalcolm Owen\nProduct Comparison Expert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased in South Wales, Malcolm Owen has written about tech since 2012, and previously wrote for Electronista and MacNN.

Not only are the CPUs among the best in computer the market, the GPUs are the best in the laptop market for most tasks of professional users. A minor concern is that the Apple Silicon GPUs currently lack hardware ray tracing which is at least five times faster than software ray tracing on a GPU. Apple is likely working on hardware ray tracing as evidenced by the design of the SDK they released this year which closely matches that of NVIDIA's. Hopefully it will appear in the M2. The one area where the M1 Pro and Max are way ahead of anything else is in the fact that they are integrated GPUs with discrete GPU performance and also their power demand and heat generation are far lower. Not only does this mean that the best laptop you can buy today at any price is now a MacBook Pro it also means that there is considerable performance head room for the Mac Pro to use with a full powered M2 Pro Max GPU. That one could very well be the most disruptive processor to hit the market. It will be interesting to see how NVIDIA and AMD rise to the challenge.Also note the 64 GB of vRam is unheard of in the GPU industry for pro consumer products.

The GeForce RTX 3060 versus the RTX 3060 Ti. First, we\u2019ll cover the pricing and availability of these popular options with current market conditions. More importantly, we will clear up the confusion as to which of the two GPUs is the best graphics card for you. Is it the 12GB of VRAM RTX 3060? Or perhaps the 3060 Ti will edge out a win, even with its 8GB of VRAM? We\u2019ll crown the victor after the dust settles!\nGeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 3060 Ti: Price and availability\nLet\u2019s get the fabled MSRP pricing out of the way; you\u2019ll be unlikely to pay either the $329 asking price for the RTX 3060, nor will you have any luck with the $399 RTX 3060 Ti. The reason for this is continued GPU shortages coupled with insane demand from gamers and crypto miners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,098 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nHow much should you expect to pay on the secondhand market, such as on eBay? You\u2019ll likely be in the low $700s range for the 3060. The 3060 Ti will up your spend to nearly the mid $800s. Certainly not ideal, and very far from reasonable in today\u2019s current market. If you can wait for better prices, that\u2019s the ace move. Keep in mind, these prices can change drastically from week-to-week.\n\n\n\n\nA custom EVGA GeForce RTX 3060Thiago Trevisan/IDG\nHow has crypto mining affected availability? Nvidia has placed hash-rate limitations on both GPUs (read more on LHR) in order to make them less useful to miners and free up inventory for gamers. This has only been slightly effective; crypto miners quickly find workarounds, or mine with less efficiency during recent peak profitability. Coupled with their lower entry price for gamers, you\u2019ll be more likely to find an RTX 3090 in stock before you find either of these. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$299.99 at  Newegg  | \n$469.99 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\nRTX 3060 vs. RTX 3060 Ti: Performance\nLet\u2019s clear up some confusion: What\u2019s up with the cheaper RTX 3060 having 12GB of VRAM versus the paltry 8GB on the RTX 3060 Ti? It\u2019s likely a potential Nvidia marketing move to better compete with AMD\u2019s higher VRAM offerings. In terms of brute gaming performance, the 3060 Ti is generally the superior GPU even with less VRAM.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nThe use cases where the 12GB of VRAM on the RTX 3060 would be better are rare. The RTX 3060 Ti\u2019s 8GB of VRAM is sufficient for the target audience\u20141440p gamers. Ironically, 4K and above is where 12GB of VRAM would be useful, but not with the hardware that\u2019s in the RTX 3060. (You better step up to a RTX 3080 for better 4K performance)\n\nRead Brad Chaco\u2019s excellent review of the RTX 3060 to get a more in depth analysis of the performance of these two GPUs. In a game such as Horizon Zero Dawn, you\u2019ll find the RTX 3060 Ti is often closer to the RTX 3070 in performance, rather than the RTX 3060. This puts it in a higher class of GPU, regardless of VRAM size. Remember, the RTX 3070 only has 8GB of VRAM too, and it does just fine in most gaming scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nIn Metro Exodus, with effects such ray tracing and hairworks on, the RTX 3060 Ti maintains a lead in performance versus its little brother, the RTX 3060.\n\n\nRTX 3060 vs. RTX 3060 Ti: Power and other things to know\nThe 200W TDP RTX 3060 Ti will typically draw more power versus the 170W TDP RTX 3060, as its higher performance would indicate. You can generally expect around 15 percent in many cases on average, but thermals are often similar.\nThe RTX 3060 was also Nvidia\u2019s first attempt to limit the hash rate on the RTX 3000 GPUs, but there quickly were workarounds that unlocked it. The 3060 Ti will be among the LHR, or Lite Hash Rate, GPUs that are harder to fully unlock. (The Founders Edition RTX 3060 Ti is unaffected by LHR, however.)\n\nAnd the champion is\u2026\n\n\n\n\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3060 Ti is the winner and superior GPU. The VRAM advantage of the RTX 3060 is inconsequential at the resolution these GPUs are aimed at, 1080p and 1440p. It\u2019s obvious that the more potent hardware on the RTX 3060 Ti makes it superior in gaming, and much closer to the RTX 3070.\nShould you buy them at inflated prices? That\u2019s complicated and will depend on your needs right now. They continue to be among the most popular GPUs due to their performance and lower barrier of entry, and that isn\u2019t going to change any time soon. If you can find one at MSRP, they\u2019re a great value; especially the RTX 3060 Ti. We would advise not paying the outrageous prices these can often go for, however. If prices eventually come down in the future, you\u2019ll be able to get a higher-class GPU for similar coin.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tAuthor: Thiago Trevisan, Contributor, PCWorld\t\t\n\n\nThiago Trevisan is a Mac and PC enthusiast for over 20 years, and has written for PCWorld and Macworld since 2021.

But, thanks to researchers at the University of Copenhagen, spotting hyperbole may one day get more manageable.\nIn a new paper, Dustin Wright and Isabelle Augenstein explain how they used NVIDIA GPUs to train an \u201cexaggeration detection system\u201d to identify overenthusiastic claims in health science reporting.\nThe paper comes amid a pandemic that has fueled demand for understandable, accurate information. And social media has made health misinformation more widespread.\nResearch like Wright and Augenstein\u2019s could speed more precise health sciences news to more people.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Exaggeration Detector Could Lead to More Accurate Health Science Journalism \u2013 Ep. 163\nA \u2018Sobering Realization\u2019\n\u201cPart of the reason why things in popular journalism tend to get sensationalized is some of the journalists don\u2019t read the papers they\u2019re writing about,\u201d Wright says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a sobering realization.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to blame them. Many journalists need to summarize a lot of information fast and often don\u2019t have the time to dig deeper.\nUniversity of Copenhagen researcher Dustin Wright.\nThat task falls on the press offices of universities and research institutions. They employ writers to produce press releases \u2014 short, news-style summaries \u2014 relied on by news outlets.\nShot On\nThat makes the problem of detecting exaggeration in health sciences press releases a good \u201cfew-shot learning\u201d use case.\nFew-shot learning techniques can train AI in areas where data isn\u2019t plentiful \u2014 there are only a few items to learn from.\nIt\u2019s not the first time researchers have put natural language techniques to work detecting hype. Wright points to the earlier work of colleagues in scientific exaggeration detection and misinformation.\nWright and Augenstein\u2019s contribution is to reframe the problem and apply a novel, multitask-capable version of a technique called Pattern Exploiting Training, which they dubbed MT-PET.\nThe co-authors started by curating a collection that included both the releases and the papers they were summarizing.\nEach pair, or \u201ctuple,\u201d has annotations from experts comparing claims made in the papers with those in corresponding press releases.\nThese 563 tuples gave them a strong base of training data.\nThey then broke the problem of detecting exaggeration into two related issues.\nFirst, seeing the strength of claims made in press releases and the scientific papers they summarized. Then, identifying the level of exaggeration.\nRead the full paper\u00a0here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13493.pdf.\nTeacher\u2019s PET\nThey then ran this data through a novel kind of PET model, which learns much the way some second-grade students learn reading comprehension.\nThe training procedure relies on cloze-style phrases \u2014 phrases that mask a keyword an AI needs to fill \u2014 to ensure it understands a task.\nFor example, a teacher might ask a student to fill in the blanks in a sentence such as \u201cI ride a big ____ bus to school.\u201d\nResearchers Dustin Wright and Isabel Augenstein created complementary pattern-verbalizer pairs for a main task and an auxiliary task. These pairs are then used to train a machine learning model on data from both tasks (source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13493.pdf).\nIf they answer \u201cyellow,\u201d the teacher knows they understand what they see. If not, the teacher knows the student needs more help.\nWright and Augenstein expanded on the idea to train a PET model to both detect the strength of claims made in press releases and to assess whether a press release overstates a papers\u2019 claims.\nThe researchers trained their models on a shared computing cluster, using four Intel Xeon CPUs and a single NVIDIA TITAN X GPU.\nAs a result, Wright and Augenstein were able to show how MT-PET outperforms PET and supervised learning.\nSuch technology could allow researchers to spot exaggeration in fields with a limited amount of expertise to classify training data.\nAI-enabled grammar checkers can already help writers polish the quality of their prose.\nOne day, similar tools could help journalists summarize new findings more accurately, Wright says.\nNot Easy\nTo be sure, putting this research to work would need investment in production, marketing and usability, Wright says.\nWright\u2019s also realistic about the human factors that can lead to exaggeration.\nPress releases convey information. But they also need to be bold enough to generate interest from reporters. Not always easy.\n\u201cWhenever I tweet about stuff, I think, \u2018how can I get this tweet out without exaggeration,\u2019\u201d Wright says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d\nYou can catch Dustin Wright and Isabella Augenstein on Twitter at @dustin_wright37 and @IAugenstein.

It is the result of a research collaboration between Microsoft and NVIDIA to further parallelize and optimize the training of very large AI models.\nAs the successor to Turing NLG 17B (opens in new tab) and Megatron-LM (opens in new tab), MT-NLG has 3x the number of parameters compared to the existing largest model of this type and demonstrates unmatched accuracy in a broad set of natural language tasks such as:\nCompletion predictionReading comprehensionCommonsense reasoningNatural language inferencesWord sense disambiguation\nThe 105-layer, transformer-based MT-NLG improved upon the prior state-of-the-art models in zero-, one-, and few-shot settings and set the new standard for large-scale language models in both model scale and quality.\nLarge-scale language models\n\n\nMicrosoft research podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeas: AI and democracy with Madeleine Daepp and Robert Osazuwa Ness\nAs the \u201cbiggest election year in history\u201d comes to an end, researchers Madeleine Daepp and Robert Osazuwa Ness and Democracy Forward GM Ginny Badanes discuss AI\u2019s impact on democracy, including the tech\u2019s use in Taiwan and India.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tListen now\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new tab \nTransformer-based language models in natural language processing (NLP) have driven rapid progress in recent years fueled by computation at scale, large datasets, and advanced algorithms and software to train these models.\nLanguage models with large numbers of parameters, more data, and more training time acquire a richer, more nuanced understanding of language. As a result, they generalize well as effective zero\u2013 or few-shot learners, with high accuracy on many NLP tasks and datasets. Exciting downstream applications include summarization, automatic dialogue generation, translation, semantic search, and code autocompletion. It\u2019s no surprise that the number of parameters in state-of-the-art NLP models have grown at an exponential rate (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Trend of sizes of state-of-the-art NLP models over time\nTraining such models, however, is challenging for two main reasons:\nIt is no longer possible to fit the parameters of these models in the memory of even the largest GPU.The large number of compute operations required can result in unrealistically long training times if special attention is not paid to optimizing the algorithms, software, and hardware stack all together.\nTraining MT-NLG was made feasible by numerous innovations and breakthroughs along all AI axes. For example, working closely together, NVIDIA and Microsoft achieved an unprecedented training efficiency by converging a state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated training infrastructure with a cutting-edge distributed learning software stack. We built high-quality, natural language training corpora with hundreds of billions of tokens, and co-developed training recipes to improve optimization efficiency and stability.\nIn this post, we elaborate on each aspect of the training and describe our methods as well as results.\nLarge-scale training infrastructure\nPowered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and HDR InfiniBand networking, state-of-the-art supercomputing clusters such as the NVIDIA Selene (opens in new tab) and Microsoft Azure NDv4 (opens in new tab) have enough compute power to train models with trillions of parameters within a reasonable timeframe. However, achieving the full potential of these supercomputers requires parallelism across thousands of GPUs, efficient and scalable on both memory and compute.\u00a0\nIn isolation, existing parallelism strategies such as data, pipeline, or tensor-slicing have trade-offs in memory and compute efficiency and cannot be used to train models at this scale.\nData parallelism achieves good compute efficiency, but it replicates model states and cannot leverage aggregate distributed memory.Tensor-slicing requires significant communication between GPUs that limits compute efficiency beyond a single node where high-bandwidth NVLink is not available.Pipeline parallelism can scale efficiently across nodes. However, to be compute-efficient, it requires large batch sizes, coarse grain parallelism, and perfect load balancing, which is not possible at scale.\nSoftware design\nThrough a collaboration between NVIDIA Megatron-LM (opens in new tab) and Microsoft DeepSpeed (opens in new tab), we created an efficient and scalable 3D parallel system capable of combining data, pipeline, and tensor-slicing based parallelism together to address these challenges.\nBy combining tensor-slicing and pipeline parallelism, we can operate them within the regime where they are most effective. More specifically, the system uses tensor-slicing from Megatron-LM to scale the model within a node and uses pipeline parallelism from DeepSpeed to scale the model across nodes.\nFor example, for the 530 billion model, each model replica spans 280 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with 8-way tensor-slicing within a node and 35-way pipeline parallelism across nodes. We then use data parallelism from DeepSpeed to scale out further to thousands of GPUs.\nHardware system\nModel training is done with mixed precision on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD-based Selene (opens in new tab) supercomputer powered by 560 DGX A100 servers networked with HDR InfiniBand in a full fat tree configuration. Each DGX A100 has eight NVIDIA A100 80GB Tensor Core GPUs, fully connected to each other by NVLink and NVSwitch (opens in new tab). A similar reference architecture is used by Microsoft for Azure NDv4 cloud supercomputers.\nSystem throughput\nWe considered the end-to-end throughput of our system for the 530 billion parameters model with batch size 1920 on 280, 350, and 420 DGX A100 servers on Selene. We observed iteration time of 60.1, 50.2, and 44.4 seconds, respectively. These correspond to 126, 121, and 113 teraFLOP/s per GPU, respectively.\nTraining dataset and model configuration\nWe used the architecture of the transformer decoder, which is a left-to-right generative transformer-based language model consisting of 530 billion parameters. The number of layers, hidden dimensions, and attention heads are 105, 20480, and 128, respectively.\nWe used an 8-way tensor and 35-way pipeline parallelism. The sequence length is 2048 and the global batch size is 1920. Over the first 12 billion training tokens, we gradually increased the batch size by 32, starting at 32, until we reach the final batch size of 1920. We used one billion tokens for the learning rate warmup in our training.\nWe largely built our training dataset based on prior work, The Pile (opens in new tab). First, we selected the subset of datasets (the top 11 rows in Figure 2, below) from The Pile that we found to be of the highest relative quality. Then, following a similar approach as that used to generate Pile-CC (opens in new tab), we downloaded and filtered two recent Common Crawl (CC) snapshots (opens in new tab).\nThe steps we took for the CC data included text extraction from raw HTML files, scoring extracted documents using a classifier trained on high-quality data, and filtering documents according to their scores. To diversify the training, we also collected the RealNews (opens in new tab) and CC-Stories (opens in new tab) datasets.\nDocument deduplication is necessary in building training datasets because the same content can be present in multiple documents of different datasets. We used a fuzzy deduplication process at the document level using min-hash LSH to compute a sparse document graph and the connected components in it to identify duplicate documents.\nWe then used a priority order based on the quality of the datasets when selecting a representative document from the duplicate documents in each connected component. Finally, we used n-gram based filtering to remove downstream task data from the training datasets to avoid contamination.\nWe ended with a set of 15 datasets consisting of a total of 339 billion tokens. During training, we opted to blend the datasets into heterogeneous batches according to variable sampling weights given in Figure 2, with an emphasis on higher-quality datasets. We trained the model on 270 billion tokens.\nDatasetDataset sourceTokens (billions)Weight (%)EpochsBooks3Pile dataset25.714.31.5OpenWebText2 Pile dataset 14.819.33.6Stack Exchange Pile dataset 11.65.71.4PubMed Abstracts Pile dataset 4.42.91.8Wikipedia Pile dataset 4.24.83.2Gutenberg (PG-19) Pile dataset 2.70.90.9BookCorpus2 Pile dataset 1.51.01.8NIH ExPorter Pile dataset 0.30.21.8Pile-CC Pile dataset 49.89.40.5ArXiv Pile dataset 20.81.40.2GitHub Pile dataset 24.31.60.2CC-2020-50Common Crawl (CC) snapshot68.713.00.5CC-2021-04Common Crawl (CC) snapshot82.615.70.5RealNewsRealNews21.99.01.1CC-StoriesCommon Crawl (CC) stories5.30.90.5Figure 2. Datasets used to train the MT-NLG model. \nResults and achievements\nRecent work in language models (LM) has demonstrated that a strong pretrained model can often perform competitively in a wide range of NLP tasks without finetuning.\nTo understand how scaling up LMs strengthens their zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities, we evaluated MT-NLG and demonstrate that it establishes new top results across several categories of NLP tasks. To ensure the evaluation was comprehensive, we selected eight tasks spanning five different areas:\nIn the text prediction task LAMBADA, the model predicts the last word of a given paragraph.In the reading comprehension tasks RACE-h and BoolQ, the model generates answers to questions based on a given paragraph.In the commonsense reasoning tasks PiQA, HellaSwag, and Winogrande, each required some level of commonsense knowledge beyond statistical patterns of language to solve.For natural language inference, two hard benchmarks, ANLI-R2 and HANS target the typical failure cases of past models.The word sense disambiguation task WiC evaluates polysemy understanding from context.\nTo encourage reproducibility, we based our evaluation setting on the open-source project lm-evaluation-harness (opens in new tab) and made task-specific changes as appropriate to align our setting more closely with prior work. We evaluated MT-NLG in zero-, one-, and few-shot settings without performing search for the optimal number of shots.\nFigure 3 shows the results for the accuracy metric. We ran the evaluation on the test set if it was publicly available; otherwise, we reported numbers on the dev set. This led to reporting LAMBADA, RACE-h, and ANLI-R2 on test sets and other tasks on dev sets.\nCategoryTasksZero-shotOne-shotFew-shotCompletion predictionLambada0.766*0.731*0.872*Reading comprehensionBoolQ0.7820.8250.848 Reading comprehension RACE-h0.4790.4840.479Commonsense reasoningPiQA0.820*0.810*0.832* Commonsense reasoningHellaSwag0.8020.8020.824 Commonsense reasoningWinoGrande0.7300.7370.789Natural language inferenceANLI-R20.3660.3970.396Natural language inferenceHANS0.6070.6490.702Word sense disambiguationWiC0.4860.5130.585Figure 3. Accuracy results for zero-, one-, and few-shot evaluations using MT-NLG. MT-NLG established the top results on the PiQA dev set and LAMBADA test set in all three settings (denoted by *) and top results among similar monolithic models in other categories.\nTake few-shot performance as an example. We observed encouraging improvements particularly in tasks involving comparison or finding relations between two sentences (for example, WiC and ANLI), a task category that is challenging for prior models. We observed similar improvements for most tasks in zero-shot and one-shot evaluation as well. We should also note that this model is trained on fewer tokens than previous models, showing the ability of larger models to learn even faster.\nFor the HANS dataset, we did not find any baseline that reports dataset-wide metrics. According to the analysis by the HANS paper (opens in new tab), BERT baselines trained on MNLI (opens in new tab) performs near-perfect on half of its subcategories while near-zero on the other half. That indicates that they are strongly dependent on the spurious syntactic heuristics identified by the paper.\nWhile our model still struggles, it predicts more than half the cases correct in zero-shot and improves even further when we present as few as one- and four-shots. Finally, in zero-, one-, and few-shot settings, our model established top results on the PiQA dev set and LAMBADA test set.\nIn addition to reporting aggregate metrics on benchmark tasks, we also qualitatively analyzed model outputs and have intriguing findings (Figure 4). We observed that the model can infer basic mathematical operations from context (sample 1), even when the symbols are badly obfuscated (sample 2). While far from claiming numeracy, the model seems to go beyond only memorization for arithmetic.\nWe also show samples (the last row in Figure 4) from the HANS task where we posed the task containing simple syntactic structures as a question and prompted the model for an answer. Despite the structures being simple, existing natural language inference (NLI) models often have a hard time with such inputs. Fine-tuned models (opens in new tab) often pick up spurious associations between certain syntactic structures and entailment relations from systemic biases in NLI datasets. MT-NLG performs competitively in such cases without finetuning. \u00a0\nTasksSample 1Sample 2Inferring mathematical operationsPrompt:Q: 11 # 2 = ?A: 5.5Q: 18 # 9 = ?A: 2Q: 35 # 4 = ?A: 8.75Q: 27 # 9 = ?A: 3Q: 75 # 6 = ?A:MT-NLG:12.5Q: 45 # 5 = ?A: 9Q: 18 # 6 = ?A: 3Prompt:Q: 11 $^% 2 = ?A: 22\u00a0Q: 3 $^% 9 = ?A: 27\u00a0Q: 12 $^% 4 = ?A: 48\u00a0Q: 7 $^% 7 = ?A: 49\u00a0Q: 8 $^% 5 = ?A:MT-NLG:40Q: 9 $^% 6 = ?A: 54Q: 10 $^% 5 = ?A: 50Natural language inference on different syntactic structuresPrompt:The banker forgot that the judge advised the professors.Question: The judge advised the professors.

True or False?Answer:MT-NLG:True. The secretary was supported by famous professors.Figure 4. Samples from MT-NLG on inferring mathematical operations and natural language inference under different syntactic structures.\nBias in language models\nWhile giant language models are advancing the state of the art on language generation, they also suffer from issues such as bias and toxicity. Understanding and removing these problems in language models is under active research by the AI community, including at Microsoft and NVIDIA.\nOur observations with MT-NLG are that the model picks up stereotypes and biases from the data on which it is trained. Microsoft and NVIDIA are committed to working on addressing this problem. We encourage continued research to help in quantifying the bias of the model.\nIn addition, any use of MT-NLG in production scenarios must ensure that proper measures are put in place to mitigate and minimize potential harm to users. All work should follow such principles as those found in the Microsoft Responsible AI Principles. Those principles emphasize that fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability are considered to be the key cornerstones of a responsible and trustworthy approach to development and use of AI.\nConclusion\nWe live in a time where AI advancements are far outpacing Moore\u2019s law. We continue to see more computation power being made available with newer generations of GPUs, interconnected at lightning speeds. At the same time, we continue to see hyperscaling of AI models leading to better performance, with seemingly no end in sight.\nMarrying these two trends together are software innovations that push the boundaries of optimization and efficiency. MT-NLG is an example of what is possible when supercomputers like NVIDIA Selene or Microsoft Azure NDv4 are used with software breakthroughs of Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed to train large language AI models.\nThe quality and results that we have obtained today are a big step forward in the journey towards unlocking the full promise of AI in natural language. The innovations of DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM will benefit existing and future AI model development and make large AI models cheaper and faster to train. We look forward to how MT-NLG will shape tomorrow\u2019s products and motivate the community to push the boundaries of NLP even further. The journey is long and far from complete, but we are excited by what is possible and what lies ahead.\nContributors\nThis project was made possible by the contributions of the following people:\nNVIDIA: Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Patrick LeGresley, Shrimai Prabhumoye, Jared Casper, Vijay Korthikanti, Vartika Singh, Julie Bernauer, Michael Houston, Bryan Catanzaro\nMicrosoft: Shaden Smith, Brandon Norick, Samyam Rajbhandari, Zhun Liu, George Zerveas, Elton Zheng, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Xia Song, Yuxiong He, Jeffrey Zhu, Jennifer Cruzan, Umesh Madan, Luis Vargas, Saurabh Tiwary\nOpens in a new tab \n\n\n\nMeet the authors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAli Alvi\nGroup Program Manager (Microsoft Turing)\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nParesh Kharya\nSenior Director of Product Management, Accelerated Computing, NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tContinue reading\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\n\nMagma: A foundation model for multimodal AI agents across digital and physical worlds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\n\nSteering at the Frontier: Extending the Power of Prompting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\n\nPhi-2: The surprising power of small language models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\n\nDeepSpeed ZeRO++: A leap in speed for LLM and chat model training with 4X less communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSee all blog posts\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tResearch Areas\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtificial intelligence\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelated projects\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProject Turing\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeepSpeed\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAI at Scale\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow us:\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nFollow on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our RSS feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare this page:\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's new\n\n\nSurface Pro\n\n\nSurface Laptop\n\n\nSurface Laptop Studio 2\n\n\nSurface Laptop Go 3\n\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\n\nAI in Windows\n\n\nExplore Microsoft products\n\n\nWindows 11 apps\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Store\n\n\nAccount profile\n\n\nDownload Center\n\n\nMicrosoft Store support\n\n\nReturns\n\n\nOrder tracking\n\n\nCertified Refurbished\n\n\nMicrosoft Store Promise\n\n\nFlexible Payments\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nMicrosoft in education\n\n\nDevices for education\n\n\nMicrosoft Teams for Education\n\n\nMicrosoft 365 Education\n\n\nHow to buy for your school\n\n\nEducator training and development\n\n\nDeals for students and parents\n\n\nAzure for students\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\nMicrosoft Cloud\n\n\nMicrosoft Security\n\n\nDynamics 365\n\n\nMicrosoft 365\n\n\nMicrosoft Power Platform\n\n\nMicrosoft Teams\n\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\n\n\nSmall Business\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper & IT\n\n\nAzure\n\n\nMicrosoft Developer\n\n\nMicrosoft Learn\n\n\nExplore ISV Success\n\n\nMicrosoft Tech Community\n\n\nAzure Marketplace\n\n\nAppSource\n\n\nVisual Studio\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout Microsoft\n\n\nCompany news\n\n\nPrivacy at Microsoft\n\n\nInvestors\n\n\nDiversity and inclusion\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices Opt-Out Icon\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices Opt-Out Icon\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\nConsumer Health Privacy\n\n\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nContact Microsoft\n\n\nPrivacy \n\n\nManage cookies\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\nTrademarks\n\n\nSafety & eco\n\n\nRecycling\n\n\nAbout our ads\n\n\u00a9 Microsoft 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I help firms understand AI, mobile and cloud to improve their businessFollow AuthorOct 25, 2021, 10:25pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA's GTC Showcases A Diverse Range of AI ExpertsNVIDIA\nDiversity and inclusion strategies remain a hot topic in board rooms across the globe. Over the past several years, technology companies have been heavily criticized for the low representation of women and minorities in technical and leadership roles. Many of these companies have since created hiring metrics and programs to recruit new talent. However, this isn\u2019t a problem that can be fixed overnight. While women comprise nearly half the workforce, they hold only\u00a028%\u00a0of the jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM),\u00a0according to the National Girls Collaborative Project.\n\n\n\n\nTo change these figures, women must want to work in STEM and they need the educational background to perform the work.\u00a0New foundations and programs such as\u00a0Girls Who Code,\u00a0Women in STEM\u00a0and\u00a0Latinas in STEM\u00a0create an environment where young girls and women are encouraged to enter STEM fields. These organizations provide a vital sense of community, mentorship and advocacy.\u00a0Signing on for a college program is one way to move into the AI field, but there are numerous educational paths to gain practical skills, from online courses to in-person events.\u00a0Technology conferences play a crucial role in attracting and educating a diverse population about opportunities in emerging careers such as artificial intelligence.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile AI is considered a largely male-dominated field, NVIDIA\u2019s continues to drive its push for supporting women in STEM in its conferences and networking events. \u00a0NVIDIA's GTC\u00a0highlights role models across gender, ethnicity and geographies. For example,\u00a0GTC will feature sessions focused on business and technical topics in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Speakers from organizations and universities, such as the Kenya AI Center of Excellence, Ethiopian Motion Design and Visual Effects Community, Python Ghana, Nairobi Women in Machine Learning & Data Science, and Chile Inria Research Center, will describe how emerging market developers are using AI to address challenges.\n\n\nOther speakers include\u00a0Anima Anandkumar, the director of machine learning research at NVIDIA; Fei-Fei\u00a0Li, professor of computer science at Stanford University; and\u00a0Cristina Vasconcelos,\u00a0a\u00a0Research Software Engineer at Google.\u00a0It's good to see NVIDIA showcasing a wide range of talent from across the globe.\n\nWhy does it matter? It's essential for women, people of color, and various ages to have role models that highlight the opportunities available to anyone willing to learn new skills. Many technology vendors offer free or low-cost access to technology and online courses. To create a balanced ethical culture, diversity and inclusion efforts must be executed in a way that promotes meritocracy and opportunities for learning and advancement.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\n\n\nHowever, like any other area, a successful diversity and inclusion practice requires effort.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to hiring diverse talent, organizations should evaluate how to cultivate talent from within the firm by leveraging the latest online educational tools. Also, supporting a hybrid and flexible work policy will enable companies to attract and retain talent.\u00a0\u00a0One other tip, organizations should encourage employees to attend conferences like GTC to learn new skills and network with role models. Meanwhile, human resource departments should add AI courses as an option within a company\u2019s educational curriculum. It's time to prepare for a more technology-driven future of work.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Raymond Brown, sees it as a way to bring students in the program up to speed fast.\nThe program at HCC, launched in August 2020, aims to get skilled workers into Houston\u2019s booming job market. HCC reaches more than 110,000 students per year, making it one of the largest and most diverse two-year public colleges in the United States.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found GTC to be a marvelous resource,\u201d said Brown, who first sent students to the conference in April. \u201cBeing virtual has made an enormous difference for us.\u201d\nBringing More Skills to More Workers\nGTC is one of the premier events in AI, accelerated computing, autonomous vehicles and robotics.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference brought together innovators from various industries at events in Silicon Valley and around the world.\nBut GTC went virtual in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.\nWhen that happened, Brown and USAi Labs, a Houston nonprofit developer network specializing in mentoring, education and intelligence-based R&D, sprang into action.\nWith the bulk of the conference free, and no need to worry about a travel budget, GTC\u2019s lineup of speakers, training sessions and keynotes could become an invaluable resource.\nThat\u2019s what Brown \u2014 who holds a Ph.D. in physics from Duke University and is known as \u201cDoc Brown\u201d \u2014 was looking to add to HCC\u2019s AI program.\nThe cost of tuition at four-year colleges in the United States has never been higher, leaving many students with enormous debts.\nAt the same time, worldwide demand for AI skills is surging.\nAnd there are a vast number of opportunities in Houston, America\u2019s most diverse city, with its medical, aerospace, oil and gas, and technology industries, Brown said.\nBrown, who has worked in private industry and as a physics professor at four-year colleges, knows this territory well.\nTwo years ago, he saw an opportunity for an affordable two-year college program at HCC that could make a difference by engaging a broad population of students.\nThe goal: prepare them for jobs as AI support specialists who can help enterprise teams put the latest AI technologies to work.\nAs a result, Brown\u2019s students are already busy.\nHe said that many already have part-time jobs and side gigs, even before his nascent program has graduated a single student.\nOne student, Denzel Wilson (left), spent the summer at Rice University, helping graduate students and faculty in bio-genomics put AI techniques to work to advance their research.\nAnother student recently gave a presentation on the latest AI techniques at the Pumps and Pipes meetup. It brings Houston\u2019s world-class oil and gas engineers together with members of the region\u2019s medical community to exchange ideas.\nBrown says such opportunities can be the first rung on the career ladder for his students, many of whom are from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nAnd many employers are eager to pay for more training and education for new hires, letting students accumulate in-demand skills rather than debt.\nOthers, such as Neethi Anand Gangidi (right), who already holds master\u2019s degrees in chemical engineering and subsea engineering, see HCC\u2019s AI program as a way to swiftly add practical AI to their skill sets.\nDigging In\nIn the spring, Brown added GTC to three of the program\u2019s courses \u2014 History, Theory and Platforms 1370, Machine Learning in AI 1371, and Computer Vision in AI 1378 \u2014 in two course modules with assignments, discussions and presentations.\nSome courses in the program even make use of teaching kits from NVIDIA\u2019s Deep Learning Institute.\nBrown reports students dug right in, starting with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote. Some students, like Gangidi, sat in on dozens of sessions across a wide variety of industries.\n\u201cHaving the opportunity to learn what\u2019s going on in the AI industry is really awesome,\u201d Gangidi said.\nFrom there, students chose sessions that piqued their interest. Brown reports that many were overwhelmed in the first few days, but they soon got their bearings.\nThey began to pick up on who was influential in the world of AI. They started to understand trends in the field better. And they got a broader perspective on the growing number of industries it\u2019s reshaping, Brown reports.\n\u201cThere are just so many things to take in,\u201d said Wilson, who is taking courses at HCC while he works as a laboratory assistant.\nOne of the most valuable lessons students learned from seasoned pros working in AI is that it\u2019s a process rather than a product.\n\u201cMost of the kids were surprised,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMost students believe everything should work out of the box. They don\u2019t realize that good AI is a matter of gradually getting to the right answers, not an instant answer.\u201d\nBrown\u2019s eager to send students back for more. For next month\u2019s GTC, he\u2019s expanding the amount of coursework built around GTC.\n\u201cWe want our students to see themselves as the professionals they are becoming,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat starts with inclusion in events like GTC.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep LearningTags: Education | GTC 2021 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That's the full product name, and it's probably not what some of you think it is. This isn't a member of the rumored next-gen GeForce RTX 4000 series, but rather an Ampere-based GPU designed for workstation PCs.\nYou might be wondering, why then are we looking at it given our focus is on gaming hardware? Recently we got some inquiries about this graphics card along the lines of \"would you consider buying an RTX A4000 over the RTX 3070 for gaming, and if so how much extra would you spend on the A4000?\"\n\nInteresting point, since you can actually buy the RTX A4000 on retail. As of writing, you can buy an RTX 3070 over at Newegg and a few other places for around $1,000, while the RTX 3070 Ti version starts at $1,200. Meanwhile, the RTX A4000 can be had for around $1,300, or about 30% more than the vanilla RTX 3070.\nNow before we get to testing. What is the RTX A4000?\nClearly, this isn't a GeForce product, that much we can tell by looking at the branding. Earlier this year Nvidia dropped the \"Quadro\" moniker for their workstation products, simply going with RTX A2000, A4000, A5000 and A6000, for the various Ampere-based workstation GPUs.\n\n\nIn short, the RTX A4000 uses the same GA104 silicon as the RTX 3070 Ti, meaning it has 6144 CUDA cores, 192 TAUs and 96 ROPs. However, there are a number of key differences between how the A4000 and RTX 3070 Ti are configured.\nFirst, the cores. Where the RTX 3070 Ti cores operate at a base frequency of 1575 MHz with a boost of 1770 MHz, the A4000 cores clock as low as 735 MHz with a boost of just 1560 MHz.\nThat means under load the RTX 3070 Ti should clock at least 13% higher than the A4000. Not a huge difference, but there's another specification that could have a more serious influence on performance, and that is the GDDR memory.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\nNvidia RTX A4000\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n\n\n\nPrice MSRP ($US)\n$1,200\n$1,000\n$600\n$500\n\n\nRelease Date\nJune 3, 2021\nApril 12, 2021\nJune 10, 2021\nOctober 29, 2020\n\n\nProcess\nSamsung 8N\nSamsung 8N\nSamsung 8N\nSamsung 8N\n\n\nTransistors (billion)\n28.3\n\u00a0\n17.4\n\u00a0\n\n\nDie Size (mm2)\n628.4\n\u00a0\n392.5\n\u00a0\n\n\nCore Config\n10240 / 320 / 112\n6144 / 192 / 96\n6144 / 192 / 96\n5888 / 184 / 96\n\n\nGPU Boost Clock\n1695 MHz\n1560 MHz\n1770 MHz\n1725 MHz\n\n\nMemory Capacity\n12GB\n16GB (ECC)\n8GB\n8GB\n\n\nMemory Speed\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n19 Gbps\n14 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Type\nGDDR6X\nGDDR6\nGDDR6X\nGDDR6\n\n\nBus Type / Bandwith\n384-bit / 912 GB/s\n256-bit / 448 GB/s\n256-bit / 608 GB/s\n256-bit / 448 GB/s\n\n\nTotal Board Power\n350 watts\n140 watts\n290 watts\n220 watts\n\n\n\nThe 3070 Ti utilizes GDDR6X memory with a throughput of 19 Gbps and when paired with a 256-bit wide memory bus that provides a bandwidth of 608 Gb/s.\nThe A4000, on the other hand, uses more traditional GDDR6 memory, offering a throughput of 14 Gbps and when using the same 256-bit wide memory bus that means memory bandwidth has been reduced by 26% to 448 GB/s.\n\nThe RTX A4000 does have one advantage though, and that's memory capacity. Packing 16GB of ECC memory opposed to just 8GB for the RTX 3070 Ti. We suspect this is why many of you are interested in the A4000.\n\nIn theory, you should be able to overclock the A4000 to achieve RTX 3070-like performance, but that'll all depend on how far you can push the cores and memory, and of course, this is something we're going to explore.\n\nOn that note, we should mention that this review is focused exclusively on gaming performance. We don't care about the benefits the A4000 might bring for video editing, 3D rendering, or CAD work. This might be something we explore in a separate piece, but for this one we have a heap of gaming data to go over, and of course, the entire point of buying the A4000 was to answer the question: is it worth purchasing over the RTX 3070 for gaming?\n\nRight out of the gate, the first red flag for the A4000 was the tiny single-slot cooler. Because this is a professional grade product, Nvidia doesn't allow partners to design their custom PCBs and coolers. Because of the lower core clocks and the more power efficient GDDR6 memory, the A4000 only packs a total board power rating of 140 watts, almost 40% lower than the RTX 3070 and just over 50% less than the 3070 Ti.\nGiven the RTX 3060 has a TDP of 170 watts, if the A4000 can get anywhere near the RTX 3070 out of the box that would be quite amazing. But even so, given the tiny single slot blower fan style cooler, it's unlikely to be very quiet and worse still, overclocking for maximum performance could be an issue. Hopefully at some point in the future I can acquire a water-block for the A4000, but for now we'll have to rely on the reference cooler.\n\nStock the RTX A4000 operated at 1425 MHz when gaming and the blower fan spun at 2800 RPM which was loud, but it wasn't crazy and really a lot better than I was expecting at 47 dBA. Overclocked it sustained a clock speed of 1570 MHz when gaming, a mere 10% frequency boost. That said, the GDDR6 memory overclocked from 14 Gbps to 16 Gbps, which is a substantial 14% bump. This overclock was 100% stable, surviving multiple different gaming loads over a 48 hour period.\nUnfortunately, despite the A4000 overclock, a stock RTX 3070 Ti clocks around 18% higher for both the core and memory, meaning it's going to be very difficult for the A4000 to match even the RTX 3070, let alone the Ti model. At this point, we should probably just dive into the benchmarks using our Ryzen 9 5950X test system. Let's get into it...\nBenchmarks\nStarting with F1 2020 at 1440p, you might be a bit disappointed to learn that out of the box the A4000 is only able to match the RTX 3060 Ti and with our max overclock applied was just 7% faster, allowing it to match the 6700 XT.\nUnfortunately, that meant it was 12% slower than the RTX 3070 and 15% slower than the 3070 Ti, not a massive margin, though we are approaching a completely different performance tier with those GeForce models.\n\n\nThe margins are similar at 4K and although the A4000 does a great job of delivering highly playable performance here, it was also a smidgen slower than the RTX 3060 Ti. Overclocked the frame rate was boosted by 12% this time, but again that only saw it match the 6700 XT, meaning it fell well short of the 3070 and 3070 Ti.\n\nMoving on to Cyberpunk 2077 and here I'd say the A4000 is even more disappointing, matching only the RTX 2070 Super out of the box with 52 fps on average at 1440p. The overclock was good for an additional 10%, allowing for 57 fps on average, but that meant the RTX 3070 was still 12% faster while the 3070 Ti was 18% faster or almost 30% faster than the stock A4000.\n\nThe A4000 was more competitive at 4K, matching the 6700 XT when stock. Overclocked it was able to match the RTX 3060 Ti, though we're only talking about 28 fps on average here which isn't playable and certainly not acceptable given the price.\n\nLike most modern graphics cards the A4000 is blistering fast in Death Stranding at 1440p using the maximum in-game quality settings, delivering 123 fps on average or 133 fps when overclocked. That meant stock, it matched the RTX 3060 Ti and wasn't a great deal slower than the RTX 3070, so a good result here.\n\nIt did fall away a little at 4K and now it was 16% slower than the RTX 3070 without any overclocking and 22% slower than the 3070 Ti. So while able to deliver highly playable performance in Death Stranding at 4K, it's quite a bit slower than the GeForce equivalents.\n\nThe Horizon Zero Dawn 1440p results look a little more positive, but that's mostly due to the fact that the faster GeForce GPUs appear to be artificially limited with the 3060 Ti trailing the 3070 by a very small margin and that put the A4000 very close to the RTX 3070, especially when overclocked.\n\nThe margins remained very similar at 4K, stock the A4000 was slightly slower than the RTX 3060 Ti and overclocked it was slightly slower than the RTX 3070, and that meant the 3070 Ti was 14% faster than the overclocked A4000. So not a massive margin, but also less than ideal given the A4000 does cost more and really needs to be overclocked.\n\nRainbow Six Siege margins are rough for the A4000 despite the performance overall being quite extreme with 222 fps out of the box. However, with our maximum overclock applied it was only able to match the RTX 3060 Ti, making the stock RTX 3070 18% faster and the 3070 Ti 25% faster.\n\nThe 4K results were more of the same. Comparing the stock configurations the RTX 3070 was 30% faster than the A4000 while the 3070 Ti was almost 40% faster and the A4000 only saw a 12% boost from our overclock.\n\nThe last game we're going to look at is Watch Dogs Legion and here we're seeing more of the same, though the overclocked A4000 does do quite well relative to the RTX 3070, trailing it by just a 4% margin at 1440p.\n\nIt's a similar story at 4K so I'd say overclock this is one of the better results for the A4000 despite the fact that stock it still only matches the RTX 3060 Ti.\n\nPower Consumption\nWhere the A4000 really shines is power consumption and this is what allows Nvidia to get away with the tiny single-slot cooler. Total system consumption with the A4000 was just 312 watts or 320 watts when overclocked. The overclock actually improved efficiency, but of course, there is no guarantee all models will hit the same frequency as ours using the voltage the A4000 is set to.\n\nOn that note, the A4000 was fed just 770 millivolts under load whereas the RTX 3070 Ti was fed 1040 millivolts, so that's a substantial difference in voltage there, and it's what enables the 3070 Ti to run at much higher frequencies, but it also blows out power consumption, as does the use of GDDR6X memory. Unfortunately, Nvidia doesn't allow you to tinker with the voltage of the A4000, or at least I haven't worked out how to yet.\nOverclocking aside, it's quite remarkable just how efficient the A4000 is, using slightly less power than the Radeon RX 6600 XT in Doom at 1440p while delivering 20% greater performance. Or when compared to the RTX 3060 we're looking at a 13% reduction in total system usage for the same level of performance.\nPerformance Summary\nAt this point we've looked at benchmarks for 6 of the 12 games we tested, but we think at this point you have a good idea of where the RTX A4000 stands, so let's just take a look at the 12 game average data.\nStarting with the 1440p results we see that on average the A4000 is slightly slower than the RTX 3060 Ti, so not great given the price. The best I could achieve with the fixed voltage was an 11% performance increase and that allowed the A4000 to just beat the RTX 3060 Ti, albit a stock 3060 Ti. That means at best a stock RTX 3070 is going to be 6% faster and a stock 3070 Ti 14% faster.\n\nThat's actually not bad given how much more efficient the A4000 is and obviously Radeon 6700 XT levels of performance is very good, but again it does come back to the price. But with pricing and availability being awful for all parts right now, I can see how the A4000 might make sense for some of you.\n\nThe margins relative to the faster RTX 3070 and 3070 Ti remain much the same at 4K, so the bigger memory buffer of the A4000 isn't being utilized here just yet, but that's not surprising, it will probably be a few years yet before it provides the A4000 with a performance advantage.\n\nWhat We Learned\nSo there you have it, in short the Nvidia RTX A4000 performs much like a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which depending on pricing and availability in your region might make it a viable option. In Australia though, the A4000 doesn't make any sense for gamers with a price tag of $2,000 AUD for in-stock listings. That's because RTX 3060 Ti's can easily be had for $1,250 AUD while you'll pay around $2,000 AUD for an in-stock RTX 3070 Ti.\nFor gamers the only possible advantage of the A4000 is the much larger memory buffer, but for now it's going to do very little for you, whereas the much faster memory of the 3070 Ti will net you more performance across the board, as will the higher operating frequency of the cores.\n\nThe other advantage of the A4000 is its efficiency, but that advantage for games goes out the window due to the single slot cooler which ends up making the A4000 a louder and hotter product. Gamers also don't typically care too much about efficiency and if you do, you can still undervolt a GeForce graphics card.\nThe limited overclocking headroom of the A4000 was disappointing, but without a way to unlock voltage control your hands are tied on that one. Currently I don't believe there is a water-block available for the A4000, but if there were and someone finds a way to remove the voltage lock, that would make for a really interesting test. Though it's worth noting that the VRM was designed for a 140w configuration, so it might not enjoy pushing significantly more power to achieve 3070-like performance. Anyway, for now it looks like you can only squeeze about 10% more out of the A4000.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, all GeForce RTX features such as DLSS, Reflex, ray tracing, DSR, Shadowplay and Nvenc are all supported and work with the A4000, just as they do with a GeForce GPU. Nvidia has a few different driver branches. We installed the Production Branch/Studio driver and it worked fine in the games tested for this article and performance went unchanged, and the same was true for the new Feature Branch driver. For access to the GeForce features you can manually install GeForce Experience and everything will work fine with those drivers.\nSo would we consider buying an RTX A4000 over the RTX 3070 for gaming? And if so, how much extra would you spend on the A4000? We'd certainly consider buying it, but we wouldn't do so at a premium. So the A4000 would need to cost probably somewhere between the 3060 Ti and 3070 Ti, and probably much closer to the 3060 Ti.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6600 on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6600 XT on Amazon\nRadeon RX 6700 XT on Amazon\nRyzen 5 5600X on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5950X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 20\n\n\n Got something to say?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorOct 13, 2021, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.AMD's Radeon RX 6600Antony Leather \nToday AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) launches the new Radeon RX 6600 graphics card - the sixth installment of its RDNA 2-based Radeon 6000-series products - and we can see just how fast it is in the latest games compared to the Nvidia's RTX 3060 and also AMD's recently released RX 6600 XT too.\n\nForbesAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT Vs Nvidia RTX 3060 And 3060 Ti: Which Should You Buy?By Antony Leather\nThe RX 6600 is primarily focussed on 1080p gaming so that's where I'll be aiming my benchmarks. As usual, pricing will vary hugely depending on where you live, with the microchip shortage continuing to play havoc with global supplies of graphics cards. Again, as usual, you'll need to get the best card you can afford in your area and use these results to pick between them.\n\n\nAbove we can see the RX 6600 is quite cut back from the RX 6600 XT, with four fewer compute units, a hefty climb down in game frequency and also stream processors. However, both feature 8GB GDDR6 memory, a 16Gbps memory speed and 128-bit memory interface, which should land the RX 6600 into solid 1080p gaming performance territory, albeit some way down the graphs from its sibling.\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 6600Antony Leather\n\nA small extra test I've carried out today is AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution. Akin to Nvidia's DLSS, this upscaling, performance-boosting technology only works in a handful of games and today I'll be trying it in the new Far Cry 6 to see how much of a boost you'll see if you enable it. Of course, you'll have to make up your own mind as to how the image quality compares as there are some polarising opinions out there.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, where possible, I've also enabled Nvidia's DLSS and ray tracing too via DirectX Raytracing (DXR).\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesBy Amy Danise, EditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansBy Amy Danise, Editor\nTest system and benchmarksMy test systemAntony Leather\nMy hardware includes a water-cooled\u00a0BarrowCH Rhopilema\u00a0water-cooled test bench,\u00a016GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3,466MHz memory,\u00a0Intel Core i9-11900K, an Intel 760p M.2 SSD, Corsair RM850i PSU and\u00a0MSI MEG Z590 Ace motherboard. I've carried out all tests with resizable BAR/Smart Access Memory (SAM) support enabled where possible.\nFirst up is Far Cry 6 and without DXR enabled, the RX 6600 sat directly behind the RTX 3060 with just a few frames separating the two. However, with DLSS not available in this game, AMD has the same advantage Nvidia has enjoyed, with FidelityFX Super Resolution seeing a massive boost to frame rates and the RX 6600 XT matching the RX 6700 XT.\nWith DXR enabled, FidelityFX gives it an even better advantage, bettering both the RX 6700 XT and RTX 3060, which jumped up the graph once ray tracing was enabled. Clearly where it's an option and if you're otherwise happy to enable it, FidelityFX is definitely worse using. Without it, the RX 6600 sits where you'd expect it to - just behind the RX 6600 XT.\nFor some reason the RX 6600 struggled in Flight Simulator, falling 10fps on the 99th percentile behind the RX 6600 XT. AMD is usually quite strong here, with the RX 6700 XT matching or battering everything Nvidia has below the RTX 3070, but if you need those landings and takeoffs to be as smooth as possible, it could well be worth opting for the RTX 3060 or RX 6600 XT instead.\nThe new enhanced edition of Metro Exodus generally sees higher average frame rates on Nvidia cards and the same was true with the RX 6600 XT. It managed a 30fps 99th percentile compared to the RTX 3060's 33fps, but was well down on the average at 44fps to 55fps, and also noticeably slower than the RX 6600 XT.\nAnother AMD-favoring game, Dirt 5 gave the RX 6600 a much easier ride, matching the RTX 3060, but sitting a good drop below the RX 6600 XT.\nAbove is Watch Dogs: Legion with DXR enabled and once again, we saw driver bugs with both the RX 6600 XT and RX 6600 seeing pitiful frame rates. Strangely, this didn't happen with the RX 6700 XT even with the same driver so it's clearly an issue that rears its head with those combinations and not all AMD cards.\nDisabling DXR sees frame rates return to normal and here the RX 6600 cam close to matching the RTX 3060 and was 10 percent slower on the minimum 99th percentile than the RX 6600 XT. FidelityFX isn't supported here but DLSS is, given Nvidia a big advantage if you're able and willing to use it.\nFinally we have Wolfenstein and even at Uber settings, 1080p was no problem for the RX 6600, although it was a long way from matching the RTX 3060 and again quite well below the RX 6600 XT.\nAs expected the RX 6600 was the most power-frugal card on test, undercutting the RX 6600 XT and allowing most manufacturers of the card to use comparatively tiny coolers. AMD's 450W power supply recommendation is also 100W lower than Nvidia's for the RTX 3060, although you'll still need a PSU with an 8-pin power connector for all RX 6600's.AMD's RX 6600Antony Leather\nConclusions\nThere are a few situations where both the Nvidia RTX 3060 and AMD RX 6600 XT are noticeably faster than the RX 6600. Enabling DirectX Raytracing (DXR) in Far Cry 6, for example, gives the RTX 3060 a significant lead, while the RX 6600 XT was much faster in Microsoft Flight Simulator and Wolfenstein: Youngblood, perhaps more than the price difference would suggest. Watch Dogs: Legion still seems to exhibit drastic slow downs when DXR is enabled too, just like the RX 6600 XT, while testing with the same driver with the RX 6700 XT saw normal frame rates.\nHowever, there are plenty of places it keeps pace with both the RTX 3060 and RX 6600 XT. For example, in Far Cry 6 without DXR, the RX 6600 was just a few frames behind the RTX 3060 and level-pegging with it in Dirt 5 with ray tracing enabled. It was also pretty close to matching the Nvidia card in Watch Dogs: Legion.AMD's Radeon RX 6600AMD's Radeon RX 6600\nThe stand-out results, though, are with AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution. This is the first review I've done using this new feature and finally, AMD has something to stand up to Nvidia's DLSS and in terms of boosting frame rates through upscaling and even at 1080p I saw some massive increases, even in balanced mode. The RX 6600 leapfrogged the RTX 3060 in Far Cry 6 with DXR enabled and closely matched the RX 6700 XT when DXR was disabled.\nOf course, the real issue is that AMD is a couple of years behind Nvidia in rolling this out and the green team has just ticked over with 120 DLSS-enabled titles, with AMD only offering FidelityFX Super Resolution support in a fraction of that number. The other issue here, though, is availability and pricing. The RX 6600 XT is currently retailing for around $700 - that's double its launch price, so it's clear that things are far from normal still and it's almost impossible to recommend one card over another as you simply can't buy anything anywhere near its launch price right now.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Once the connectors were up and running, the students spent about a day integrating their game engines with Omniverse.\nOver the next couple months, they added custom tools to their engines, loaded and saved their video game scenes onto the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and collaborated on them in real time.\n\u201cThe live synchronization feature on Omniverse is magical,\u201d said Cerda. \u201cIt has a lot of potential to connect both people and tools for many kinds of programs, which will greatly increase productivity.\u201d\nFor Charreton, the assignment spurred a desire to further develop his work with Omniverse. He completed an Omniverse-based 3D game engine for his thesis project. And he\u2019s developing a 2D engine to use for educational purposes in the game development classes he\u2019s teaching.\n\nDiaz, who called Omniverse an \u201cexcellent tool for group work,\u201d said this connector project taught him how to create computer science tools and methods that he can apply to any application in the future, not just game engines.\nIn addition to game design and development, UAD \u2014 founded a decade ago \u2014 houses digital arts departments such as animation, app development and audiovisual production.\nWatch the UAD students\u2019 community spotlight livestream to learn more about their workflow:\n\nReady to Create With RTX\nNVIDIA Omniverse relies on NVIDIA RTX technology to speed up production for creators like those from UAD. NVIDIA RTX enables 3D designs, photorealistic simulations and stunning visual effects \u2014 faster than ever.\nCharreton\u2019s favorite part of his final project, in fact, was working with RTX technology.\n\u201cI love everything related to rendering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very impressive to see how easily you can develop something from scratch and get a great demo using NVIDIA RTX in real time.\u201d\nDiaz recalls getting his first NVIDIA RTX card in his first year at UAD. \u201cBefore that, I could only play a few games and mostly programmed in HTML or Windows formats,\u201d he said. \u201cWith NVIDIA RTX GPUs, I can create better graphics very fast.\u201d\nUAD representatives will speak at the Omniverse User Group session at GTC.

And the models are generalizable for application to new geographies.\nThe findings, published in a recent paper, will be discussed in a presentation at the NVIDIA GTC 2021 conference next month.\nThe pioneering effort landed second place at the Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI) 2021 competition on flood detection. It came in just a hair behind, the first-place effort on what\u2019s known as the intersection over union score, or IOU, which measures overlap in image segmentation.\nFor Siddha Ganju, one of the paper\u2019s authors, floods aren\u2019t just something you read about or see in viral videos. When she was six years old, her father was driving in northern India, and his car was overturned in a flash flood. He escaped the car and was fortunate to make it to land alive, swimming past snakes, but he couldn\u2019t contact his family for nearly a day.\n\u201cThis was before mobile phones, and we were waiting for him for a long time,\u201d said Ganju, a senior data scientist at NVIDIA. \u201cFlooding isn\u2019t like a swimming pool, it\u2019s not something you can swim through. The current is very fast and filled with dangerous debris like fast-moving fallen trees.\u201d\nIndia\u2019s monsoon season can hammer rainfall of 3 feet or more during a day, suddenly bursting rivers with a tsunami-like force of water. Earthquakes can prompt sudden flooding as well.\nFloods cause more than $40 billion in damages worldwide a year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nFlood Segmentation in Seconds\nThe ETCI competition asked contestants to use 66,000 SAR Sentinel-1 labeled images with pixels that show before and after a flood. Participants were challenged to develop semantic segmentation models using the data so that they could be applied to new unlabeled images to perform inference on potential flood zones.\nSatellite imagery of Florence, North Carolina, depicting water coverage.\nThe images \u2014 provided by NASA\u2019s Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team \u2014 included Bangladesh; Nebraska; North Alabama; Red River, North Dakota;\u00a0 Florence, North Carolina; and other regions.\nGanju teamed up for the ETCI competition with Sayak Paul, a machine learning engineer at e-commerce startup Carted. The results showed that their models, running on NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs, can create a segmentation for flood zones spanning roughly 24,000 square miles in just 3 seconds.\nTraining Model Ensembles\nGanju and Paul developed an ensemble of models with UNet and UNet++, a pair of convolutional neural network architectures used for image segmentation. They can analyze pixels for borders between things like land and water.\nThe duo\u2019s best performing model was trained in multiple iterations, with the output of each stage feeding into the next stage.\nNVIDIA V100 GPUs in the cloud powered the training for the ensemble of models, and all the inference was done on them as well.\nDeveloping for Social Impact\nTheir generalizable method can be easily applied.

He is also director of the university\u2019s Robot Learning Lab and co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab. With all of that going on, the soft-spoken Belgian engineer also hosts The Robot Brains Podcast.\nWhile juggling his roles, Abbeel also spent nearly two years at OpenAI, the nonprofit formed in 2015 by tech luminaries including Ilya Sutskever \u2014 who is speaking at GTC 2021 \u2014 to develop and release artificial general intelligence aimed at benefiting humanity.\nHe left OpenAI in 2017 to start Covariant, a developer of AI for robotic automation of warehouses and factories that has attracted $147 million in funding. Before that he co-founded AI-assisted grading startup Gradescope, which was acquired in 2018.\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang spoke with Abbeel after the robotics talk, calling him \u201cone of the brightest minds on the planet.\u201d\nTalking Big Robot Brains\nAbbeel\u2019s talk laid out what he called a \u201cnice starting point\u201d for what could be done to create more capable robots, ones with big brains that could learn new tasks on their own. The talk mentioned the work of many AI researchers, such as Geoffrey Hinton, as stepping stones to get there.\nCrediting deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun, he said the idea of training a large neural network for robots with internet videos to do prediction was promising. It would require robots to learn things about the world, offering a big piece in the robot AI puzzle.\n\u00a0\n\nRobots might learn entire behavioral representations from videos \u2014 a sequence of things to do \u2014 versus the limitations of using images alone. \u201cVideo prediction is possibly the biggest missing piece to have a good pretrained neural network that can be quickly used for other things for real-world robotic tasks,\u201d he said\nTraining on text could be important as well for robots. They might learn an entire story to perform a sequence of events, like delivering a car to an auto mechanic on command from an owner, handling the entire process, including driving and talking to the mechanic for a pickup time, he suggested.\nTrain \u2018Mostly in Simulation\u2019\u00a0\nMost robot training should be done in simulation \u2014 it\u2019s impractical to slowly train robots in the real world, bumping into things to learn by trial and error, said Abbeel.\nOnly a little bit of training in the real world will be required to make sure robots can also do things in the real world. \u201cMillions of scenes become very hard to collect in the real world,\u201d he said.\nThousands \u2014 even millions \u2014 of simulations can be used for training to get results on neural networks in a shorter period of time, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more affordable, and you can scale it up and parallelize many simulation runs,\u201d he said.\nBridging Research to Commercial\nIn a post-presentation talk with Huang, Abbeel discussed bridging university research to commercial applications.\n\u201cYou both do groundbreaking research in the university, and you are also practicing that art and the industry of robotics \u2014 you\u2019re putting it to work in a real company (Covariant),\u201d Huang said. \u201cSolving the 99 percent problem is essential.\u201d\nAbbeel agreed that it\u2019s important to know with confidence that your customer will be happy with your network performance and what you\u2019re selling to them. He said it\u2019s largely a matter of knowing the network you\u2019ve developed, running a lot of tests and getting the statistics.\nAt Covariant, he said, the current applications are pick-and-place use cases in warehouses \u2014 for the Covariant Brain \u2014 and that hitting the end-to-end performance is what matters.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t make your customers happy, what\u2019s the point in selling to them?\u201d said Abbeel.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Four Scenes From the Marriage of Computer Vision and Edge Computing\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHear companies in a GTC panel talk about pioneering paths to improve operational efficiency with intelligent video analytics.\t\t\t\n\n\nOctober 20, 2021 by Adam Scraba \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Whether you\u2019re managing stadiums, cities or global corporations, edge AI is critical to improve\u00a0 operational efficiency.\nThat\u2019s the message from people drawn from each of these fields who will share their experiences and aspirations in a panel at GTC.\nThey\u2019re using a type of AI called intelligent video analytics (IVA), powered by edge computing. IVA combines computer vision and deep learning to turn mountains of data into actionable insights.\nTaking Edge AI on the Road\n\u201cTransportation is so ripe for this \u2014 the possibilities are endless,\u201d said James Alberque, a tech manager for the City of Raleigh, North Carolina, and one of the panelists.\nFor example, Raleigh, like many cities, hires consultants to stand at a few intersections every so often and note the amount and direction of traffic. With IVA, it can gather traffic data on dozens of intersections 24/7.\nAI models can use that data to improve everything from plans for new roads to timing for traffic lights during bad weather or a special event. Citizens could potentially get real-time feeds so they can plan trips, know when the next bus is due or find out if there\u2019s a free bike or scooter at a nearby public corral.\nSmarts Where You Need Them\nEdge AI makes such insights possible because it collects and processes events where they happen. This approach also minimizes the cost and delay of sending data to the cloud.\nRoyal Dutch Shell has been applying edge AI to autonomously inspect integrity issues in Shell assets, detect and prevent safety incidents and check with robots the operational status of equipment.\n\u201cWe start with a proof of concept to assess technical feasibility. Once it\u2019s successful, we create a minimal viable product in operations, using historical and real-life data. We then hand it over to the IT department to scale it up,\u201d said Xin Wang, a GTC panelist and machine vision manager.\nCurating an AI Library\nToday the company has a library of pre-trained models it can quickly optimize with transfer learning for new use cases as they emerge, said Siva Chamarti, a principal machine learning engineer who started Shell\u2019s AI engineering team and is also on the GTC panel.\nThe NVIDIA DeepStream SDK helped simplify an early project in edge AI for Shell. The project used five AI models with data from 10 closed-circuit video cameras serving five use cases.\n\u201cBefore DeepStream, it was difficult to share video from ten cameras with the models in an efficient way. We needed a lot of memory to copy and buffer it,\u201d said Siva. \u201cBut with DeepStream, we could unpack the videos faster, giving each model the same frame references \u2014 making it easier to run our use cases on small edge devices.\u201d\nAI Assists on Game Day\nGillette Stadium, the home of the New England Patriots, plans to use edge AI to manage thousands of video streams for as many as 10 use cases.\nFor example, the system will send staff alerts when it detects security concerns, said panelist Michael Israel, chief information officer for the Kraft Group, a conglomerate that operates the 65,000-seat stadium.\nThe group also runs a recycling business where edge AI analyzes bundles of cardboard the size of small cars. Smart cameras identify seven different grades of cardboard so forklift operators can load the proper mix of bales to the conveyor.\n\u201cThe more we follow these methods the better we perform as a manufacturer,\u201d said Israel.\nThe wide variety of use cases for edge AI is one reason we created NVIDIA Metropolis. It\u2019s an applications framework that acts as software scaffolding for IVA in industries including healthcare, retail, manufacturing and more.\nRegister for free to watch the panel (session A31422) during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online Nov. 8-11.

Bolt a big robotic fist to your body, and in classic fashion find and buy upgrades that enable access to new areas and potent combat abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the PC release, TiGames has gone all-out to deliver the highest-fidelity experience possible, with ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS-accelerated performance, and latency-optimized NVIDIA Reflex gameplay, courtesy of a technical partnership with NVIDIA. For full details, read on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch Real-Time Ray Tracing\nAlong with higher rendering resolutions and higher levels of detail, TiGames has leveraged the power of the PC to bring immersive real-time ray-traced effects to F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch.\nSet in a neon-filled Dieselpunk city, TiGames has enabled Unreal Engine 4\u2019s ray-traced global illumination feature to realistically illuminate characters and the environment with light from signs, street lamps, and other light sources. With global illumination enabled, surfaces are naturally bathed in colored light, enclosed areas are more naturally illuminated, and city backdrops are more vibrant and visually arresting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther enhancing the appearance of virtually every scene, is the addition of real-time ray-traced reflections. These of course add realistic, high-fidelity reflections to puddles and other mirror-like surfaces, but beyond that, improve the appearance of pipes, grates and metallic objects that fill the Dieselpunk environs. And in cutscenes, you can appreciate the added reflective detail on Rayton\u2019s combat armor and titular fist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbilities acquired on your journey enable Rayton to explore underwater areas. To take their appearance to the next level, TiGames has employed ray-traced caustics, adding realistic detail as light is reflected and refracted through water, and as Rayton disturbs it with his movements and attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, the three ray-traced effects greatly enhance your exploration of Torch City, and make combat encounters more exciting with added reflections and illumination. Get a look at all this tech in action in our video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerate F.I.S.T. Performance By 3X With NVIDIA DLSS\nMaxing out F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch\u2019s graphics and ray-traced effects at 4K requires significant processing power, which is why TiGames have incorporated NVIDIA DLSS.

And they\u2019re often employing the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform and NVIDIA Metropolis intelligent video analytics application framework to do so.\nThe agri-food industry employs 1 billion people worldwide, more than any other economic sector. However, labor shortages are an increasing problem in many areas. Moreover, the way we produce, consume and waste food exacts a heavy toll on the planet, putting pressure on natural resources and the climate.\nThe good news is that many innovators and emerging companies are tackling these challenges, including more than 300 startups that are members of NVIDIA Inception. The program, which has more than 8,500 members, is designed to nurture startups in AI, HPC and data science with tools, training and technology expertise that help them to get to market faster.\nHere\u2019s a look at a handful of startups that are using NVIDIA technology and AI to change the future of agriculture.\nGiving Bees a Break\nAI-powered robots are as busy as bees, literally and figuratively. Arugga, an Israel-based startup, has built robots that pollinate tomato plants, a job usually occupied by bumblebees.\nMost of the bees that currently buzz about tomato farms are mass-produced and shipped to customers. Otherwise, intense manual human labor is required.\nArugga\u2019s robots give both bees and farm workers a break, using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module to streamline the pollination process. At one customer site, they\u2019ve already increased harvest yields by 20 percent.\nThe company uses the NVIDIA Metropolis intelligent video analytics platform to develop and deploy its computer vision systems that detect flowers ready for pollination and then blast air pulses at them to initiate pollination. While its robots are pollinating tomato fields, they also collect annotated data, which is used to retrain and benchmark the robots\u2019 AI models.\n\nWeeding Out Weeds\nSome weeds can resist the herbicides used in row-crop agriculture, but they can\u2019t resist AI \u2014 at least the type that Greeneye, an NVIDIA Inception member based in Tel Aviv, has developed.\nThe startup\u2019s AI-driven smart sprayers, powered by NVIDIA Jetson, detect and target individual weeds \u2014 and precisely deliver a measured but lethal dose of chemicals \u2014 in a matter of milliseconds.\n\nSimilarly, Bilberry, a startup based in Paris, has used NVIDIA Jetson to develop technology that recognizes weeds and precisely applies herbicides in corn and wheat farms.\nFarms that have employed technologies developed by Greeneye and Bilberry have seen over 90 percent reductions in chemical and herbicide usage, as well as decreased costs from water and soil contamination.\nMoreover, Greeneye uses its technology to collect large-scale, high-resolution agricultural data and insights from the field that are then delivered to farmers and other stakeholders.\nPerfect (Computer) Vision in the Field\nComputer vision startups are also envisioning new heights and standards for agricultural processes.\nPlainsight, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, is working with a global food company to reduce inaccuracies in livestock counts. Within the cattle industry, livestock such as cows reside in tight quarters and move quickly, making it difficult for farmers to report accurate numbers, which can lead to hefty financial losses.\nThe startup has developed AI-powered video analytics applications for cameras to detect, track and precisely count livestock. Its technology stack is built on the NVIDIA EGX platform and processes multiple streams per GPU in real time to monitor and count livestock.\nResults from one deployment have shown a 99.5 percent accuracy rate \u2014 a two percentage point increase from traditional manual counting processes. This can add up to huge cost savings across herds thousands of head strong.\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Plainsight_VisionAI_Cattle-Counting-1.mp4\n\u00a0\nLikewise, University of Florida researchers are tapping into computer vision to build smart sprayers of agrochemicals to fight citrus disease, which is threatening orchards, killing fruit and drastically lowering crop yields across the world.\nTheir image recognition models, which run on the Jetson edge AI platform, detect plant sizes to optimize the amount of crop protection products and fertilizers sprayed. This cuts down on overspray and reduces the amount of wasted material that is washed into the groundwater.\nMany NVIDIA Inception members will present their innovations at GTC, from Nov. 8-12. For example, this GTC session, titled: \u201cFrom Fish Facial Recognition to Self-Driving Seeders: Discover How Edge Computing Is Modernizing Agriculture,\u201d will discuss how AI is revolutionizing the way we produce food and helping us cope with the dramatic changes our world faces.\u00a0\nRegister for free for GTC.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Computer Vision | GPU | Inception | Jetson | Metropolis | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These silicon blocks act like a committee of experts that make decisions on how to process and route packets of data as they flow through the data center.\nHow Does a SmartNIC Work?\nMost of these blocks are highly specialized hardware units called accelerators that run communications jobs more efficiently than CPUs. Some are flexible units that users can program to handle their changing needs and keep up with network protocols as they evolve.\nThis combination of accelerators and programmable cores help SmartNICs deliver both performance and flexibility with outstanding price performance.\nMany Schools for SmartNICs\nEvery vendor has its own list of SmartNIC features. They can be long, filled with acronyms and hard to compare.\nA simple test of which SmartNIC is best for you is to see which one has the list that contains the features your data center needs.\nEvery vendor also has its own ideas for how to make its SmartNICs smart.\nSome are using FPGAs which promise flexibility. However, FPGAs are difficult to program, expensive and don\u2019t deliver the same performance as integrated accelerators.\nOthers are using dedicated ASICs, which typically offer the best price performance and some flexibility. This is the approach the NVIDIA ConnectX family takes.\nOthers use system-on-chip designs that blend dedicated hardware accelerators with programmable processors. These SmartNICs tend to have the highest performance and maximum flexibility, so they cost more.\nTo help sort through the options, we wrote an article on finding the best SmartNIC for your situation.\nPutting the NIC in SmartNIC\nIn 1973, Robert Metcalfe and colleagues at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) prototyped one of the first NICs for technology he dubbed Ethernet.\nMetcalfe\u2019s first Ethernet NIC.\nThe name stuck. It became an industry standard in 1985, and for many people it\u2019s now a synonym for computer networking.\nConnecting multiple personal computers in a local-area network was considered state of the art at the time.\nIn 1979, Metcalfe co-founded 3Com to build commercial NICs for the early PC market of the day. Since then, dozens of companies have made NICs in many flavors, speeds and sizes.\nToday we call these Foundational NICs. They enable a basic network connection between two or more computers, but they lack the smarts to support more than a few value-added features.\nTo get an insider\u2019s view of the early history of NICs, listen to a recording of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang interviewing Metcalfe in 2020, the 40th anniversary of Ethernet.\nData Center Networks Go Global\nToday\u2019s computers are both smaller and vastly larger than those that used the first NICs. Smartphones are more widely used than PCs and cloud-service providers have scaled data centers to global networks of warehouse-sized systems.\n\u201cThe data center is the new unit of computing,\u201d said Huang in a keynote at GTC in April.\nBut fueled by techniques such as virtualization and microservices, the growing stack of tasks data center CPUs are expected to handle has become unmanageable.\n\u201cA third of the roughly 30 million servers shipped each year are consumed by running the data center\u2019s software-defined networking stack,\u201d said Huang in the keynote.\n\u201cThis workload is increasing much faster than Moore\u2019s law, so unless we offload and accelerate this workload the data center will have fewer and fewer CPUs to run applications,\u201d he added.\nPutting the Smarts in SmartNICs\nSeeing this trend, companies like Mellanox, now part of NVIDIA, had been packing more smarts in their NICs to offload work from overburdened CPUs in the data center.\nNVIDIA\u2019s latest ConnectX-7 SmartNICs handle a laundry list of networking, security and storage jobs. For example, they can:\n\naccelerate popular and custom software-defined networking stacks\nprovide security with in-line encryption/decryption\nenable firewalls and a hardware root-of-trust for a secure boot\nrun popular security protocols such as Transport Layer Security, IP Security, and MAC Security\nhandle storage and data-access protocols such as RoCE, GPUDirect Storage, NVM Express and Transmission Control Protocol\nsupport virtualized data centers with Single-Root I/O Virtualization and virtual switching and routing\n\nThey do all this with low latency while providing anywhere from 25 to 400 Gbits/s of data throughput. As a result, data centers are more responsive and efficient.\nUnlike Foundational NICs, SmartNICs have the spare muscle and flexibility to handle new tasks as they emerge, too. Network protocols are constantly changing, and new concepts for moving data, called network overlays, seem to come along on a regular cadence.\nUsers can configure SmartNICs to grab the latest software libraries that implement these changes.\nHome in the Smart Mainstream\nThat\u2019s why SmartNICs aren\u2019t just for the world\u2019s largest cloud service providers.\nSmartNICs are used by telecommunications providers and media companies. They run in storage servers, database clusters and data warehouses.\nFinancial analysts use low latency SmartNICs for high frequency trading. Machine learning specialists use them to speed big data analysis.\nIn short, SmartNICs are going mainstream. NICs with no or low smarts are finding their way to the remainder bin.\nNew Horizons in Networking\nSmartNICs are the Goldilocks of networking. They have more capability than foundational NICs, but they are not the big bear of wired communications.\nThe top spot today is reserved for data processing units (DPUs). These premium processors are fully programmable in user friendly languages like C, typically on banks of power-efficient Arm cores.\nIf your data center is among the largest or most demanding, you probably need DPUs to run their communications. But that\u2019s another story.\nTo find out more on NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, watch Jensen Huang\u2019s April 2021 keynote below.\n\nLearn more about SmartNICs on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | Networking \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Faintsnow added the details of the GPU and confirmed that it\u2019ll be the \u2018GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Laptop GPU\u2019 when questioned on what Nvidia\u2019s name for this graphics solution would be.No other details are provided here, so the info imparted is admittedly thin on the ground.Analysis: Some kind of high-end laptop GPU inbound for early 2022?Obviously, we need to keep a healthy sense of skepticism about the veracity of this, as that original source is a murky one, really.That said, this is a rumor which has been kicking around for a while, and it does seem a likely move for Nvidia to release a laptop GPU with more oomph in the near-ish future \u2013 previously the grapevine has held that this mobile graphics card (or cards) could be unveiled early in 2022. Meaning we might be looking at a CES launch in January 2022, and if that is the case, we\u2019d expect to be hearing a lot more from the rumor mill on this GPU in short order.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.There has been some controversy in the past about whether the supposed RTX 3080 Ti or Super might step up from the GA104 employed in the notebook RTX 3080 card to use the GA103 as indicated here, because as you may recall regular rumor peddler Kopite7kimi \u2013 who first spilled the goods on the GA103 laptop chip \u2013 said at one point that it was quite likely canceled.Kopite7kimi chimed in with this latest leak, as well, speculating that maybe this new discovery could even be an RTX 3090 mobile, not a 3080 Ti. On the naming front, it should be noted that Nvidia has never used the Ti suffix for a mobile GPU, so there\u2019s that to bear in mind too when it comes to the name guessing game.Whatever it ends up being called, the possibility that Nvidia still has a more powerful high-end laptop GPU in the wings, waiting to step up and become the new flagship for Ampere in gaming notebooks, is definitely still alive.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $99.99 $79.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for you\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nDarren AllanSocial Links NavigationDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

This could be because if you are using a DisplayPort on your monitor these GPUs will only turn on the display once Windows loads. \n\n\n\nSome people using those NVIDIA GPUs affected by the DisplayPort issue have probably been a bit upset if they were attempting to upgrade to Windows 11. For many Windows users, they had to turn on TPM 2.0 before being able to upgrade. In some cases, you also must enable Secure Boot as well. Both can only be changed within the system's BIOS, which in turn can pose a problem for the user.\nWell, today NVIDIA released a firmware update to address that issue. NVIDIA says the root cause of the problem is when a DisplayPort is being used in conjunction with a monitor using DisplayID. They also state that the issue is only affecting the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3060 cards. There are no specific details given as to why the issue is occurring. \n\n\nThere are a few other workarounds if you are not keen on downloading the firmware update, and simply want to make the changes necessary to upgrade to Windows 11. You can use a different port, such as HDMI or DVI, to bypass the bug. Another option is if you have another monitor you can try using it to see if it passes muster. You could also try using a different graphics source too, provided you have a secondary GPU or integrated graphics to save the day.\nNot everyone will be able to do one of the other options that are available. Those users will more than likely need to download the firmware update if they want to gain access to their BIOS. If you own one of the GPUs and need (or just want) to update the firmware you can do so by visiting NVIDIA\u2019s download tool.\nDo you own an RTX 3080 Ti or 3060 and experienced the DisplayID issue? Were you able to find a work around not mentioned to get access your BIOS?

The latest was held this morning, beating bots by getting graphics cards straight into the hands of gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSuccess!

Staff give out tickets for the line, and once all are assigned the line is closed. Local guidance for safe social distancing is followed, and when the shops open in the morning, cards are sold in an orderly fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n@ChitoGaminYT Here we Go First in Line \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb #rtx3090 #bestbuy pic.twitter.com/6YgZYTwEMY\u2014 ahmed almeghalawy (@kenish123) \n August 26, 2021\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThanks #BestBuy pic.twitter.com/7QUDyy5ptI\u2014 Procircuitscrub (@procircuitscrub) \n August 26, 2021\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWoke up at 5am and drove an hour to the best buy in Toledo but it was WORTH IT! pic.twitter.com/ePVIf0JYUB\u2014 Signal the Wolf (@signal_the_wolf) \n August 26, 2021\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-time gamer, it\u2019s a situation reminiscent of midnight launches and new-platform launches, back before online sales became standard.

They try to outdo each other in the number of games they can stream and the number of devices they can stream to. NVIDIA's GeForce NOW had the advantage of being in beta even before the likes of Google Stadia got started and has been able to expand to more devices than any of its rivals have so far. Its latest trick is to support Microsoft Edge, which, coincidentally, opens the doors to its unofficial arrival on the Xbox.\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing able to play games anywhere has always been a dream for gamers, but almost all solutions available today come with their own compromises. Direct mobile gaming naturally excludes many PC and console titles, while game streaming services tend to favor one gaming platform over another. While GeForce NOW is squarely tied to PC games, its availability on almost any computing device makes up for that.\nNVIDIA's cloud-based gaming service has been available on browsers, including Apple's Safari, and it has recently added Microsoft Edge to that list. More than just catering to Windows users who do prefer that browser, it also means that GeForce NOW also indirectly adds Xbox consoles to its supported list of devices.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Verge's Tom Warren shows how it was relatively trivial to get GeForce NOW running on Microsoft's console, which practically means getting access to Steam PC games on an Xbox. If that idea didn't already blow your mind, the tech journalist notes that you can even use a keyboard and a mouse to play those games because Edge on the Xbox supports those input methods too.\n\nYou can now play Steam PC games on an Xbox with Nvidia's GeForce Now. Here's a quick look at how it all works. Details here: https://t.co/EMGX0HRxcT pic.twitter.com/G6YcloBubM\n\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) October 25, 2021\n\n\n\nOf course, there are ways to run PC games from the Xbox, but those often require you to have a PC on the same network to stream from. This expansion to GeForce NOW removes the need for console gamers to worry about PC specs just to accomplish that, though they will have to keep in mind their Internet speed in exchange. The feature is still in beta, though, and requires the latest version of Microsoft Edge for Xbox.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot on the heels of Nvidia's new RTX 3080 Cloud Gaming announcement, AMD has revealed that its Ryzen Threadripper Pro processors will be powering Nvidia's new RTX 3080 Superpods. Threadripper Pro will give Nvidia the CPU horsepower and PCIe bandwidth it needs to help drive the 39,200 TFLOPS of gaming performance each Superpod server will provide.\n\nAMD did not specify which Threadripper Pro CPUs would be used in Nvidia's Superpods, however, we assume the servers will be equipped with AMD's latest Threadripper Pro products based on the Zen 2 architecture. AMD's Zen 3 based Threadripper CPUs are still in development.\u201cThe Ryzen Threadripper Pro lineup was designed to offer users incredible performance and unrivaled bandwidth and sets the industry standard for extreme computing performance across a range of use cases, including the rapidly-growing cloud gaming space,\u201d said Chris Kilburn, corporate vice president and general manager of the client component business at AMD said in a statement. \u201cWorking with Nvidia, it is clear that the expansive feature set of Ryzen Threadripper Pro is the perfect platform to power their next-generation cloud gaming experience.\u201dDespite being an architecture behind, the current Zen 2 Threadripper products are no slouch, and still one of the best CPUs for heavy multi-core workloads. The top tier 3995WX comes with 64 cores, 128 threads, and a clock speed of up to 4.2GHz, along with 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4 bandwidth and 8 memory channels. The 128 lanes and 8 memory channels, in particular, is a trait found in all Zen 2 Threadripper processors.The vast amount of memory and PCIe bandwidth will arguably be the more important features for Nvidia's Superpods. With all that bandwidth, Nvidia can power multiple RTX 3080 virtual machines off of one Threadripper CPU without sacrificing memory or PCIe bandwidth.With further optimizations from Nvidia, we expect the Threadripper Pro CPUs to perform even better to ensure each cloud gaming server meets the 120 fps target consistently.Nvidia's new RTX 3080 cloud gaming plan will start at $99.99 once released and give you the best cloud gaming experience Nvidia can provide right now. Each gaming instance will come with RTX 3080 graphics and run at a very low latency of 56 ms at 120 fps. Plus, there are more benefits like built-in G-Sync support (tusable on static refresh rate displays) and 1440P support.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nzen 3\nRyzen Threadripper\nCloud Computing\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAaron KlotzSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about cloud gaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost GeForce Now tiers are currently sold out \u2014 Nvidia blames high demand for unavailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia squeezes GeForce Now users for more cash with 100-hour monthly playtime limit \u2014 Nvidia will charge $5.99 for 15 extra hours for the Ultimate tier and $2.99 for the Performance tier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo comments yet\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

To find out, Jason Lewis puts current Nvidia RTX and AMD Radeon Pro cards through a battery of real-world benchmarks, from 3D modelling to rendering.\n\nIn CG Channel\u2019s 2021 group test of professional GPUs, I will be benchmarking two new workstation cards, Nvidia\u2019s RTX A6000 and AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W6800, comparing them to the GPUs that I looked at last year: Nvidia\u2019s Quadro RTX 8000, 6000, 5000 and 4000 and AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W5700, W5500 and WX 8200. \nAlthough now previous-generation models, all of the older cards are still available commercially, and are still widely used. As ever, I will be putting each GPU through a series of custom benchmarks designed to replicate real-world production tasks, from asset creation to rendering and simulation.\n\nJump to another part of this review\nSpecifications and prices\nTechnology focus: ray tracing hardware and APIs\nTesting procedure\nBenchmark results\nOther considerations\nVerdict\n\nThat\u2019s great. But how do I get hold of any of these cards?\nBefore I get into the meat of this review, I want to address the massive elephant in the room: the current GPU shortage. (Or, at a higher level, The Great Semiconductor Shortage of 2020-2021). I understand that reading GPU reviews is a bit of a bummer at the minute, as it is nearly impossible to get hold of new cards at anything remotely close to their MSRPs. Either you have to get lucky and be one of the first people to click the Add To Cart button when an online retailer gets a shipment, or you have to buy an entire new system \u2013 and even then, the GPUs are usually marked up by a small percentage.\nSo when will the situation change? It\u2019s hard to say. Some people predict that supply levels and prices could return to normal by early winter, as it would be crazy for companies to not cash in during the lucrative holiday season. I think that, while possible, this is very unlikely. We saw unprecedented demand for consumer electronics in 2020, and still GPU manufacturers were unable to keep up. With TSMC and Samsung already running their fabs at or near maximum capacity, and additional complications like Taiwan\u2019s recent drought and the current ABF substrate shortage, we will probably see continued chip shortages well into 2022.\nAlthough a lot of money is going into building new chip foundries, both here in the US and abroad, they will take years to complete. Current facilities are working to expand their capacity, and that is probably what will ease the shortage in the short term, but it will still take many months for those chips to make it onto graphics cards, and the cards to make their way into stores. There are also reports that companies like Intel are prioritising higher-margin products like server and data center chips over consumer products, so we may see Nvidia and AMD follow suit, to the detriment of consumer and perhaps even workstation GPUs.\nMy own best guess \u2013 and despite what other journalists like to claim, all predictions are really just informed guesses \u2013 is that we may see an increase in the supply chain, and thus a significant reduction in prices, by the early summer of 2022, with a full return to normal supply and pricing by the end of 2022.\n\nSpecifications and prices\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s look at the two new GPUs on test: Nvidia\u2019s RTX A6000 and AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W6800. Both are currently their respective manufacturer\u2019s top-of-the-line cards.\n\n\n\nThe RTX A6000 is Nvidia\u2019s first professional card based on its new Ampere GPU architecture, and the first not to use the firm\u2019s longstanding Quadro branding: despite its shortened name, it\u2019s the successor to the previous-generation Quadro RTX 6000 and 8000.\nIt uses the Ampere GA102 GPU, the same one that powers Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080, 3080 Ti and 3090 consumer cards. The difference is that the GA102 in the A6000 is a fully unlocked GPU, having full access to the 10,752 CUDA cores, 84 RT cores and 336 Tensor cores on the GPU die, running at a base clock speed of 1.4GHz and a boost clock speed of 1.8GHz.\nThe RTX A6000 comes equipped with 48GB of GDDR6 ECC memory on a 384-bit bus for a memory bandwidth of 768GB/s. It\u2019s a significant bump up from the 24GB Quadro RTX 6000, and a direct successor to the 48GB Quadro RTX 8000.\nSo why doesn\u2019t it also use the higher-bandwidth GDDR6X memory available in the high-end GeForce cards? According to Nvidia, at the time the A6000 was designed, GDDR6X memory simply didn\u2019t come in modules large enough to build a 48GB board. However, software engineers tell me that the extra memory bandwidth provided by GDDR6X has little impact on most DCC and GPU rendering applications: something borne out by my own tests. The one exception is real-time applications like Unreal Engine and Unity.\nUsing GDDR6 instead of GDDR6X also has the advantage of decreasing power consumption. Even though the A6000 uses a fully unlocked GA102 GPU, and has double the RAM of a GeForce RTX 3090, its TDP is 50W lower. This is significant since, like the previous-generation Turing-based Quadro cards, the RTX A6000 ditches the axial fan of the GeForce GPUs in favour of a traditional blower fan design \u2013 albeit an unusual one, with air intakes on both sides of the card. (This is a welcome change when connecting two GPUs with a NVLink bridge, since one card then obstructs the front air intake of the other.)\nAlthough blower fans don\u2019t cool the GPU as effectively as axial fans, they are still the preferred form factor for workstation cards, which are often used in heat-accumulating multi-GPU set-ups, since they vent hot air out of the back of the card, and thus out of the workstation itself, rather than recirculating it inside the chassis and relying on the case fans to do the work.\n\n\n\nThe other new card is AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W6800, the successor to the previous-gen Radeon Pro W5700. It uses a Navi 21 GPU based on AMD\u2019s new RDNA 2 architecture: in this case, a partially cut-down Navi 21 GPU sporting 3,840 Stream processors grouped into 60 compute units, and 60 ray accelerators.: about which, more later. It has a base clock speed of 1.8GHz and an estimated boost clock speed of 2.3GHz.\nThe card comes equipped with 32GB of GDDR6 ECC memory on a 256-bit bus for a memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. This is a massive step up from the 8GB Radeon Pro W5700, and a nice change from AMD\u2019s other recent professional GPUs, which have been stuck on 8GB or 16GB for some time now.\nThe Radeon Pro W6800 is rated at 250W and, like the Nvidia RTX A6000, uses a traditional blower fan: in this case, an even more traditional design, with only one air intake on the front of the card.\n\nTechnology focus: ray tracing hardware and APIs\nOne significant feature of the Radeon Pro W6800\u2019s RDNA 2 architecture is that it features ray accelerators: dedicated hardware cores to speed up ray traced renders.\nHere, AMD is playing catch-up with Nvidia, which has featured dedicated ray tracing hardware \u2013 in Nvidia\u2019s terminology, RT cores \u2013 since its previous-generation Turing GPUs. (New Ampere cards like the RTX A6000 use the second generation of the RT core technology.)\nTo take advantage of those hardware cores, software packages have to access them through a graphics API. At present, two are widely used in DCC applications: DXR (DirectX Raytracing), which is supported by both AMD and Nvidia GPUs, or Nvidia\u2019s own proprietary OptiX API.  DXR is used in game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, and some real-time renderers, but OptiX is more widely used in offline GPU renderers.\nI covered GPU core types and graphics APIs in detail in my 2020 group test, so if you want a fuller discussion of the subject, you can read it here.\n\n\n\nPrices are street prices from September 2021, and may have changed by the time you read this.\n\n\nTesting procedure\nFor this review, my test system was a Xidax X-10 workstation powered by an AMD Threadripper 3990X CPU. You can find more details in my review of the Threadripper 3990X.\nCPU: AMD Threadripper 3990X\nMotherboard: MSI Creator TRX40\nRAM: 64GB of 3,600MHz Corsair Dominator DDR4\nStorage: 2TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe SSD / 1TB WD Black NVMe SSD / 4TB HGST 7200rpm HD\nPSU: 1300W Seasonic Platinum\nCPU cooler: Alphacool 360mm AIO liquid cooler\nOS: Windows 10 Pro for Workstations\nFor testing, I used the following applications:\nViewport and editing performance\n3ds Max 2021, Blender 2.93, Chaos Vantage 1.4.2, Fusion 360, Maya 2020, Modo 14.0v1, Solidworks 2021, Substance Painter 2021.1.1, Unreal Engine 4.26, Unreal Engine 5 Early Access 2\nGPU rendering\nBlender 2.93 (using Cycles), Cinema 4D R22 (using Radeon ProRender), IndigoRenderer 4.0.64 (using Indigo Bench), KeyShot 9, Maverick Studio 2021.1, OctaneRenderer 2020.1.5 (using OctaneBench), Radeon ProRender for Maya 3.2, Radeon ProRender for 3ds Max 2.7.6, Redshift 3.0.33, Solidworks 2021 Visualize, V-Ray 5 for 3ds Max (using V-Ray GPU)\nOther benchmarks\nHoudini 18.5 (using the Axiom GPU solver plugin), Metashape 1.7.4, Premiere Pro 2021\nSynthetic benchmarks\n3DMark\nIn the viewport and editing benchmarks, the frame rate scores represent the figures attained when manipulating the 3D assets shown, averaged over five testing sessions to eliminate inconsistencies. In all of the rendering benchmarks, the CPU was disabled, so only the GPU was used for computing. Testing was performed on a single 32\u201d 4K display, running its native resolution of 3,840 x 2,160px at 60Hz.\n\nBenchmark results\nViewport and editing performance\nThe viewport benchmarks include many of the key DCC applications \u2013 both general-purpose 3D software like 3ds Max, Blender and Maya, and more specialist tools like Substance Painter \u2013 plus CAD package SolidWorks and game engine and real-time renderer Unreal Engine. Real-time renderer Chaos Vantage uses Nvidia\u2019s OptiX API, so it only ran on the Nvidia cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 takes first place in all of the viewport benchmarks, with one exception: the Unreal Engine 5 Valley of the Ancients demo scene, where the Radeon Pro W6800 takes a small lead.\nIn the other benchmarks, the W6800 follows a similar pattern to the older Radeon Pro cards. 3ds Max, Fusion 360, SolidWorks and Unreal Engine are more AMD-friendly, and here the W6800 comes much closer to the performance of the RTX A6000; the other apps are more Nvidia-friendly, with the A6000 taking a commanding lead.\nGPU rendering\nThe next group of benchmarks features a range of GPU rendering applications. Since most offline GPU renderers currently only support Nvidia\u2019s CUDA and OptiX APIs, many of these tests could only be run on the Nvidia cards. The exceptions are applications that support the OpenCL open standard, which could be run on both AMD and Nvidia cards, and Radeon ProRender, AMD\u2019s own GPU renderer, which I tested only on AMD cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results can be broken down into three categories. First, the Nvidia-only renderers: KeyShot, Maverick Studio, OctaneRender, Redshift and V-Ray. Here, the RTX A6000 takes the top spot by a huge margin. Its fully unlocked GA102 GPU and 48GB of RAM give it a massive lead over the previous-gen Turing GPUs.\nNext, we have the all-inclusive render group where the Nvidia GPUs using CUDA/OptiX square off with the AMD GPUs using OpenCL. This group comprises Blender (using the Cycles renderer), Cinema 4D (using Radeon ProRender), Indigo Renderer (using Indigo Bench) and SolidWorks Visualize. In this category, the Nvidia RTX A6000 takes the top spot among all of the tested GPUs, but the relative performance of the Radeon Pro W6800 varies. In Blender and Cinema 4D, it falls far behind the RTX A6000, but it comes much closer in SolidWorks Visualize and Indigo Bench.\nLastly, in the AMD-only category, the Radeon Pro W6800 takes a massive lead over the previous-gen AMD GPUs in the Radeon ProRender benchmark.\nOther benchmarks\nThe next set of benchmarks are designed to test the use of the GPU for more specialist tasks. First off, we have a pyrotechnic simulation in Houdini 18.5 using the GPU-based third-party solver Axiom. Next, we have photogrammetry application Metashape, which uses the GPU for image processing, and lastly, Premiere Pro, which uses the GPU for video encoding.\n(A note on Premiere Pro: in my previous reviews, I had hardware encoding enabled in Premiere, but some of the preferences were not set up properly, so GPU acceleration was not being used to its full extent. That has now been corrected, so this and future reviews should reflect the contribution of the GPU more accurately.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe additional benchmarks present a mixed bag of results. With Axiom, the RTX A6000 takes the top spot, with the Radeon Pro W6800 falling  a fair way back, coming in behind some of the previous -generation Nvidia Turing GPUs. In Metashape, the  RTX A6000 takes the top spot again, but the Radeon Pro W6800 runs it close. In Premiere Pro, things flip, and the Radeon Pro W6800 takes the lead over the RTX A6000.\nSynthetic benchmarks\nFinally, we have the synthetic benchmark 3DMark. Synthetic benchmarks don\u2019t accurately predict how a GPU will perform in production, but they do provide a way to compare the cards on test with older models, since scores for a wide range of GPUs are available online\n\n\n\nThe results here are as expected: the RTX A6000 takes the top spot, followed by the Radeon Pro W6800, and then all the previous-generation Quadro and Radeon Pro GPUs.\n\nOther considerations\nGPU memory\nAlthough I have talked about the importance of available GPU memory for DCC tasks in previous reviews, I think it\u2019s worth going over again in detail here.\nThere are several features that differentiate consumer GPUs \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s GeForce and AMD\u2019s Radeon RX product ranges \u2013 from their professional counterparts, but the biggest by far is memory capacity. This is especially true of the two new GPUs in this test. The RTX A6000 has a massive 48GB of on-board VRAM: double that of the nearest consumer card, the GeForce RTX 3090, and four or more time higher than mainstream GeForce GPUs. The same is true of the Radeon Pro W6800: its 32GB of VRAM is double that of the nearest Radeon RX consumer card.\nMany DCC tasks, particularly GPU rendering, use more of a GPU\u2019s VRAM than gaming, with the possible exception of 8K gaming, which is barely in its infancy. Although many GPU renderers can work \u2018out of core\u2019 by paging data out to system RAM once the VRAM fills up, in most cases, this incurs a pretty significant performance penalty. Some software simply crashes if a task requires more VRAM than is available.\nSo how much GPU memory do you need for common tasks? Let\u2019s look at a few examples, beginning with offline rendering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both these scenes, the memory used exceeds the capacity of most consumer GPUs. When I ran the V-Ray 5 tank scene on a 24GB GeForce RTX 3090, the need to page out to system RAM only incurred a small speed penalty, but it did seriously affect stability. If I made any edits to the scene, then attempted to render it during the same session, the render would crash every time. The only way to complete it reliably was to close 3ds Max, reload the scene, then render it without making any changes.\nAnother task where having a lot of memory can be very important is real-time rendering. With game development getting more and more complex, and with many other industries turning to tools like Unreal Engine and Unity, larger projects can quickly exceed the memory capacity of consumer GPUs. Here are a couple of examples of geometry- and texture-heavy scenes in UE4.\n\n\n\nIn both cases, loading the entire level in the editor requires more VRAM than is available on any current GeForce GPU, aside from the top-of-the-range GeForce RTX 3090. Of AMD\u2019s gaming cards, the Radeon RX 6800, 6800 XT and 6900 would all be able to handle the Dark Forces scene, but the medieval open world scene would be beyond them. However, both projects fit easily within available VRAM on both the Nvidia RTX A6000 and AMD Radeon Pro W6800.\nLastly, I want to examine memory usage with another popular DCC application, Substance Painter. Painter is primarily used for games and real-time development, so many users don\u2019t think of it as a particularly memory-hungry application, when in reality, it can be very memory-intensive, particularly if you work with multiple texture sets on a model, and use complex layers and smart materials.\n\n\n\nAgain, this test scene exceeds the memory capacity of any 8GB or 16GB GPU, which includes all of the consumer cards currently available, aside from the GeForce RTX 3090. It is also worth noting that Painter suffers from extreme slow-down once GPU memory is full.\nDrivers and other software\nIn addition to their higher memory capacity, professional GPUs come with a suite of software tools meant to aid productivity. I wouldn\u2019t classify them as a major selling point for workstation cards, since there are third-party applications that do the same things, but they\u2019re a nice addition, and since they are written by AMD and Nvidia themselves, they work well with the hardware they are designed for.\nThe toolset is quite similar for both Nvidia and AMD, with both offering driver profiles, a quick-launch menu for most off-the-shelf DCC applications, and desktop video capture at 4K resolution. I tested the video capture utilities briefly, and they work quite well. Video quality and file sizes are similar for both, and the in-app overlay features are neat. I could see them being useful if you do a lot of remote collaboration, as the broadcast and sharing features are a little better integrated into the desktop than in third-party applications like Microsoft Teams, Google Meet or Slack.\nAMD also goes a little further by providing built-in performance and temperature monitoring, fan speed controls, and a feature called Image Boost. This essentially renders your desktop larger than the native resolution for your display, assuming that it runs at less than 4K, then scales the image down to that native resolution. This is neat in theory, but personally, I don\u2019t see much use for it: most DCC professionals today work on at least 1440p displays, which is a high enough resolution for most tasks, and using Image Boost negates the performance benefits of having a display resolution lower than 4K.\nOne last software feature of the Radeon Pro W6800 is AMD\u2019s Viewport Boost. This dynamically reduces the resolution of the viewport when objects within it are moving quickly, helping to increase frame rates. It is currently supported in 3ds Max, Revit, Twinmotion and Unreal Engine 4. (According to AMD, it only works with packaged Unreal Engine projects, but in my tests I found that it did seem to have an impact when working inside the Unreal Editor itself.)\nIn my 3ds Max and Unreal Engine tests, I had Viewport Boost set to Always On, since there was no perceivable decrease in visual quality while using it, and in those benchmarks, the viewport performance of the Radeon Pro W6800 came much closer to that of the RTX A6000. With Unreal Engine, Viewport Boost was vastly superior to Unreal Engine 4\u2019s native resolution scaling, and on a par with Unreal Engine 5\u2019s Temporal Super Resolution. So it seems to work well, at least on the two applications I tested it with. Hopefully, we will see the list of supported software grow in the near future.\nPower consumption and cooling\nI talked about cooling briefly at the beginning of this review, but I want to dive into the subject a little deeper. As I mentioned before, both the Nvidia RTX A6000 and AMD Radeon Pro W6800 ditch the multi-axial fan design of their consumer counterparts in favour of a single blower fan. Although this may work better in multi-GPU set-ups, in single-GPU systems, axial designs seem to do a much better job.\nMy best comparison is between Nvidia\u2019s professional RTX A6000 card and its consumer GeForce RTX 3090. Both have almost identical GA102 GPUs, and while the A6000 has twice the memory capacity, the 3090 has more power-hungry GDDR6X memory, so in theory, they should generate similar amounts of heat.\nHowever, under heavy load, at stock fan speeds, the A6000 can hit temperatures of 84-85\u00b0C, whereas the 3090 tops out at around 71\u00b0C. At 65% fan speed, the 3090 falls to 63-65\u00b0C, and the A6000 to 74\u00b0C, but the A6000 is quite a bit louder.\nThe situation is similar for AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro W6800, where running the fan at stock speeds seems to be barely adequate, with temperatures reaching 82\u00b0C under heavy load. Turning the fan up to 2.5x stock speed reduces temperatures to around 65\u00b0C, but like the RTX A6000, fan noise becomes an issue. You can have your professional GPUs cool, or you can have them quiet, but unfortunately not both at once.\n\n\n\nPrices correct as of September 2021.\nPrice\nLastly, let\u2019s talk about price. I try not to place too much stress on this when it comes to professional GPUs: artists who are used to consumer hardware tend to fall out of their chairs when they see the prices of workstation cards, but in production, the benefits of professional cards do often justify the cost.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 has a MSRP of $4,649: a pretty good figure, considering that the previous-generation Quadro RTX 6000 and RTX 8000 had launch prices of $6,299 and $9,999. (A year later, Nvidia dropped the prices to $4,000 and $5,500.) However, when I was writing this review, I was unable to find any for sale at the MSRP, as the chart above illustrates. At least the percentage mark-up isn\u2019t as high as it is with gaming cards, and the RTX A6000 did actually seem to be in stock with several retailers.\nThe AMD Radeon Pro W6800 has a MSRP of $2,249: a big jump over the previous-generation W5700, which had a launch price of $799, albeit only a quarter of the memory. If you\u2019re looking to buy a W6800, you\u2019re in a slightly better position than with the RTX A6000 (and a much better position than anyone hoping to buy a gaming GPU). At the time of writing, it is available at multiple retailers: at some for slightly less than the MSRP.\n\nVerdict\nWith all of the data presented, it\u2019s time to sum up. First, let\u2019s talk about the Nvidia RTX A6000. \nAs with the GeForce RTX 3090 that I reviewed earlier this year, the RTX A6000\u2019s Ampere GA102 chip provides a huge performance improvement over Nvidia\u2019s previous-generation Turing GPUs. It excelled in all of the tests I put it through, including viewport performance and general GPU compute tasks, and its 48GB of memory makes it especially well suited to GPU rendering and simulation.\nI really only have two complaints. First, that the RTX A6000 uses GDDR6 memory instead of the higher-bandwidth GDDR6X. As I mentioned earlier, this doesn\u2019t seem to have been an intentional decision on Nvidia\u2019s part \u2013 large enough GDDR6X modules simply weren\u2019t available when the card was designed \u2013 and in my tests, it doesn\u2019t seem to make much difference for most DCC tasks.\nSo why even mention it? Remember that I said \u2018most\u2019 tasks. When comparing the RTX A6000 informally to the similarly specced GeForce RTX 3090, which does have GDDR6X memory, the lower memory bandwidth seemed to make a noticeable difference to performance in real-time applications like Unreal Engine 4 and 5, Unity, Lumberyard and Open 3D Engine.\nMy second complaint is that the RTX A6000, like other professional cards, still clings to the old single blower fan design, which is becoming less and less adequate as GPUs increase in speed. Professional GPUs need to evolve as gaming cards have, and instead rely on better case/rack designs to vent hot air.\nHowever, despite these pretty minor gripes, the RTX A6000 is a monster of a GPU, providing a massive upgrade in performance over previous-generation cards, while maintaining a similar price point.\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the AMD Radeon Pro W6800. Like the RTX A6000, it is a significant upgrade over the highest-performing card from the previous generation, the Radeon Pro W5700. Although its frame buffer is not quite as large as the RTX A6000, at 32GB, it\u2019s still pretty massive. It offers solid performance in all of my viewport tests, and with compute tasks that support OpenCL. It also comes with quite a robust software package, with a few more useful features than the Nvidia equivalent.\nBut what about GPU rendering? This leads me to my complaints about the Radeon Pro W6800. Nvidia dominates the offline GPU rendering market with its robust CUDA and OptiX APIs, while AMD continues to rely on OpenCL. Most popular GPU renderers don\u2019t support OpenCL, and those that do also support CUDA or OptiX, so Nvidia cards tend to massively outperform their AMD counterparts. \nWhile the new OpenCL 3.0 spec has now been finalised, I\u2019m not aware of any major DCC applications that have adopted it. What AMD really needs to do is to develop a GPU compute API that is as powerful as CUDA and OptiX, then push hard to get software developers to adopt it. Dare to dream.\nMy next gripe isn\u2019t really a problem with the W6800: more a \u2018what could have been\u2019. The Radeon Pro W6800 is AMD\u2019s current top-of-the-line professional GPU. Yet despite this, it uses the same RDNA 2 Navi 21 chip as the consumer Radeon RX 6800, when AMD has two variants \u2013 used in the Radeon RX 6800 XT and 6900 XT \u2013 with more cores, including more ray tracing cores. \nI think this is a serious missed opportunity on AMD\u2019s part. Using a higher-specced chip would have pushed the performance of the Radeon Pro W6800 much closer to that of the Nvidia RTX A6000. A card with the Navi 21 GPU from the Radeon RX 6900 XT, 32GB of RAM and AMD\u2019s Viewport Boost technology would have been quite a proposition.\nThe take-home message\nSo which one should you buy? It comes down to your workload, your project complexity and your budget. The Nvidia RTX A6000 is a monster of a GPU, but for a lot of workloads, it\u2019s overkill. The 48GB frame buffer is simply unnecessary for all but the most complex modelling, texturing and scene assembly tasks. For example, a 60-million-polygon 3ds Max scene with a lot of 8K textures only requires 9GB of VRAM, while a 54-million-polygon Maya scene with 4K textures uses a little over 8GB, although there are situations \u2013 particularly in visual effects and feature animation \u2013 where more memory will be required.\nRendering is where the RTX A6000 really shines. It has a massively powerful GA102 GPU, with dedicated ray tracing cores, and its 48GB of VRAM enables it to process extremely complex scenes without having to page data out to system RAM. Although most movies and broadcast series still make use of huge farms of CPU-based render machines for final output, GPU rendering can be extremely beneficial for iterative previews, so TDs, lighters and shader artists could all benefit greatly from the power of the RTX A6000. In addition, more and more architectural and product visualisation projects are now being rendered on the GPU.\nThe Radeon Pro W6800, while powerful, is in an odd position. It\u2019s a good GPU from a hardware perspective, but the lack of a good API for GPU rendering makes it hard to recommend as a general-purpose card, although there are specific tasks, and specific applications, with which it excels.\nIf you need solid performance with 3ds Max, are doing a lot of photogrammetry processing with Metashape, or are using your GPU primarily for video editing and encoding in Premiere Pro, the Radeon Pro W6800 may be a good fit. I have also heard that AMD GPUs provide good viewport performance in many CAD applications, and while that isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve tested extensively, the W6800 did well in the  SolidWorks test. But if you\u2019re looking for a general-purpose GPU that performs well across all DCC tasks, I would have to recommend the Nvidia RTX A-series cards, with the A6000 being top of the food chain.\nThere is one final caveat, and it applies equally to Nvidia and AMD. I don\u2019t normally talk much about consumer GPUs in reviews of professional cards, but this time, I feel I must. The one area of DCC work where I would not recommend either of the new professional GPUs is real-time development.\nMost of my recent professional work involves Unreal Engine, and here I would recommend the current top-of-the-range gaming cards \u2013 the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 \u2013 over their professional counterparts. The 6900 XT has a more powerful GPU than the W6800, and the RTX 3090 has faster memory than the RTX A6000, giving both cards higher frame rates in Unreal Engine 4 and 5, while their memory capacity (16GB for the 6900 XT, 24GB for the W6800) is adequate for all but the most demanding real-time projects. However, I would recommend the professional GPUs over any gaming GPU with less than 12GB of RAM, since that can become a bottleneck on larger scenes.\nLastly, I just wanted to say thanks for sharing your time with us. My goal is to try to address hardware questions as they pertain specifically to digital art and content creation, and I hope that this review has been helpful and informative.\n\nLinks\nRead more about the Radeon Pro W6000 Series GPUs on AMD\u2019s website\nRead more about the RTX A Series and Quadro RTX GPUs on Nvidia\u2019s website\n\nAbout the reviewer\nJason Lewis is Senior Environment Artist at Survios and CG Channel\u2019s regular reviewer.

Goel reports to Raja Koduri, an AMD veteran who leads the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group.\n[Related: AMD Hires Intel Data Center Vet To Grow EPYC\u2019s Cloud Business]\n\n\nid\nunit-1659132512259\n\n\ntype\nSponsored post\n\n\nAn Intel spokesperson said Goel will lead a team of architects and design engineers in \u201carchitecting, designing and verifying Intel\u2019s Xe IP road map,\u201d which includes elements for graphics, media and display that will be used in the company\u2019s GPU products.\nGoel was previously corporate vice president of GPU architecture at AMD, where he managed the company\u2019s GPU IP architecture team. \u201cHis team delivered from concepts to solid architecture specifications across all GPU product lines,\u201d ranging in power envelopes of 1.1 watts to 700 watts. according to Intel. This included products in segments like mobile, console gaming, PC gaming and high-performance computing. His team also worked on GPU IP for AMD\u2019s APUs.\nPrior to AMD, Goel was director of GPU architecture at Qualcomm, where he led architecture development on the company\u2019s Adreno GPUs.\nGoel has a doctorate in computer science from the University of Central Florida as well as a Master\u2019s of Engineering in system science and automation from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and an MBA from Rollins College in Florida. He is the author of 57 granted patents, with an additional nine pending, and he has published 15 journal and conference papers on topics in computer graphics.\nThe new hire comes as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger vows to challenge Nvidia, the market leader in GPUs, with a \u201cmore ecosystem-friendly\u201d approach. The chipmaker plans to introduce discrete GPUs for the PC gaming market next year, and those will be followed by the company\u2019s much anticipated Ponte Vecchio GPU for high-performance computing and AI.\n\u201cThe architectural disruption that I\u2019m more concerned about in the data center is the AI one, not the Arm one, and in that sense, hey, [Intel\u2019s] products are starting to come forward to put pressure on, I\u2019ll say, an uncontested Nvidia,\u201d Gelsinger told CRN in an exclusive interview. \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to get contested going forward because we\u2019re bringing leadership products into that segment.\u201d\nEliot Eshelman, vice president of strategic accounts and HPC initiatives at Microway, a Plymouth, Mass.-based Intel HPC partner, told CRN that Intel\u2019s Ponte Vecchio GPU will likely have feature parity with Nvidia and AMD\u2019s GPUs for the HPC space based on the disclosures he\u2019s seen.\nBut the big question for him is whether Intel will be able to overcome the challenges it previously had in the accelerator space with the now-discontinued Xeon Phi, and that will require the chipmaker to succeed in software and user enablement\u2014an area Gelsinger and other executives have said is a major priority as part of the Intel CEO\u2019s \u201csoftware-first\u201d approach, as detailed in CRN\u2019s October cover story.\n\u201cGetting the hardware into customers\u2019 hands and then seeing if it works for them the way that they\u2018re hoping, we\u2019re all waiting for that because there have been false starts where Intel tried something and it didn\u2019t quite land the way that [Intel] hoped that it had,\u201d Eshelman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That's in-store only, and as far as we know there's no stock headed to the retailer's online store.\u00a0Before you head to your closest store, though, you'll want to check this official webpage to see if they will have any available stock. If they do, you'll want to go grab a place in line by 7:30am local time, which is when staff will allocate tickets to those waiting. These tickets are transferrable for one graphics card when the store opens at 8am local time.There's a limit of one graphics card per customer, and once the tickets are allocated out that's all the available stock accounted for.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nWhere to buy the Nvidia RTX 5080: the high-end GPU just launched and stocks are already running low, so here's every RTX 5080 retailer listing I've found so far\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's Verified Priority Access draw system returns to offer the chance to pay full price for RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards\n\n\n\nOriginal story: If looking for an Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics card, and live in the US, Best Buy could be your best bet for a GPU restock this week. Rumours suggest the retail giant will release more Founders Edition GPUs before the weekend, but you'll likely have to travel by car, plane, or rail to get to your closest store in order to pick one up.Best Buy has not confirmed the stock drop yet, but rumours are swirling about the potential drop. Largely these come from Twitter account @GPURestock, who accurately foretold of the last major Best Buy GPU restock.Best Buy In-Store Leaks Recap- People close to store managers saying the tickets will be given out on Friday- Using the Best Buy App you can check if the locations near you have already received their stockSearch for RTX > Tap on Show In Stock in the top left corner pic.twitter.com/8Innq9XsucSeptember 27, 2021They say people close to store managers are saying the next GPU restock will happen Friday, October 1. On that day, employees will hand out tickets, one per GPU in-store, to those waiting in line, as Best Buy has done for previous GPU drops.They also report that you can actually discover whether your local Best Buy will have stock available, and of what cards, by checking the Best Buy app.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021There's no way to know if this is a database error or something similar, but if you search for RTX and then tap on the slider that limits results to those in stock at your nearest store, you might find some RTX 30-series Founders Edition are listed. These cards aren't available for pick up and are reportedly 'sold out'\u2014good start, I know\u2014but in theory the fact they even show up could mean that store has received a delivery of these cards and is nearly ready to hand them out to lucky punters.It feels a little like the ancient art of divination, but there's perhaps some logic in the madness.In lieu of confirmation, though, be ready to get over to a Best Buy in time for the stock drop just in case it does occur. Best Buy has previously put up a stock checker and announcement page regarding any upcoming in-store drops, as it did last time, so in theory we'll receive confirmation about the drop ahead of time.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Cameron Gain \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVMware Tanzu sponsored this post. \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nVMware is providing more support for DevOps teams with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) ambitions, as vSphere with Tanzu has been upgraded for developers of AI applications, the company co-announced today with AI and GPU partner Nvidia on the first day of VMWorld.\nAfter previously announcing the availability of Nvidia AI Enterprise and vSphere with Tanzu for container access for AI developers, \u201cnow we\u2019re now announcing the ability to have the Kubernetes orchestrator \u2014 that\u2019s an important distinction,\u201d said Lee Caswell, VMware\u2019s vice president for product and technical marketing, during a press conference ahead of the event.\n\u201cThe ability to have Tanzu Kubernetes support for container-based developers is an important next step in how we\u2019re simplifying the deployment of AI,\u201d Caswell said.\n\n\n\nSource: EMA Research Quick Poll, October 2021.\n\n\nAn important distinction to make is the difference between using vSphere or Tanzu with Nvidia AI Enterprise. As indicated above, the ability to use Nvidia AI Enterprise with Tanzu largely reflects VMware\u2019s Kubernetes push overall.\nSupport to Help Fill a Skills Gap\nLending AI support for Kubernetes is increasingly deemed essential for those DevOps teams that are required to deploy and/or manage AI and ML applications but lack the resources to do so. In a recent poll by Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) of 275 developers and DevOps engineers, for example, 49% of developers reporting lacking the skill set to effectively use machine learning models.\n\u201cWhile Kubernetes provides the crucial scale-out capabilities needed to include AI-driven predictions into the development and DevOps lifecycle, software developers and DevOps engineers are struggling to benefit from this big advantage of container-based development,\u201d Torsten Volk, an analyst at EMA, told The New Stack.\n\u201cThis new level of integration between Nvidia AI Enterprise and VMware vSphere with Tanzu provides a set of APIs to simplify both: the development and operations of AI-driven application capabilities on Kubernetes. This could be a big step toward mainstreaming the use of AI across the entire enterprise.\u201d\nAutomating Containerized Workload Delivery\nThe improved integration of Tanzu and Nvidia AI Enterprise is important for developers and DevOps teams that need a simpler way to add AI capabilities to their development and release pipelines, VMware said.\nIn March, VMware and Nvidia announced what VMware then touted as an \u201cend-to-end\u201d AI-ready enterprise platform that it said was easier for operations teams to deploy and operate. This joint platform included the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite that was certified, optimized and supported for VMware vSphere.\nTuesday, VMware is also announcing that Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service, included in VMware vSphere with Tanzu, is integrated with Nvidia AI Enterprise, enabling customers to automate the delivery of containerized workloads, and proactively manage apps in production.\n\u201cNvidia AI Enterprise including Tanzu Kubernetes Grid for simplified MLOps is a significant announcement as DevOps and operations teams alike have been waiting for an enterprise-grade platform to develop, run and operate their AI projects on,\u201d Volk said. \u201cThis could be that platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nVMware Tanzu, now an AI-ready enterprise platform.\n\n\nSeeking One Unified Application Platform\nAn important distinction to make is the difference between using vSphere or Tanzu separately with Nvidia AI Enterprise. As indicated previously, the ability to use Nvidia AI Enterprise with Tanzu reflects VMware\u2019s overall Kubernetes initiative.\n\u201cWhat you get with Tanzu is the ability to have Kubernetes orchestration, and for those watching that development space, Kubernetes has quickly evolved into the de facto standard for how to orchestrate the use of containers,\u201d Caswell said.\n\u201cNow, containers are actually pretty interesting \u2014 containers are spun up more often, they\u2019re deleted more frequently and so they\u2019re actually quite volatile. So, the ability to now go and manage containers and orchestrate them with Kubernetes [with Tanzu] gives you an added level of security and management that we didn\u2019t have in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\nRecent decades delivered great advances in infrastructure; now it\u2019s time to build apps that make the most of those new tools.

The lineup will include the updated RTX 3090 Ti, RTX 3080, RTX 3070 Ti, RTX 2060, RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050. We have already covered the rumored specifications of the 3090, 3070 Ti, and 2060 here so let's focus on the new details posted by Videocardz and Kopite7kimi.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPSNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 'SUPER?' With GA102-220 GPU & 12 GB VRAM\nAccording to Videocardz sources, NVIDIA is preparing a brand new version of the GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card which will feature the GA102-220 GPU. The source states don't mention the card as a SUPER or Ti variant. The RTX 3080 Ti already exists and features the GA102-250 GPU so it does not make sense to call the updated part a 'Ti' variant too. It may get the 'SUPER' branding though that is not confirmed.\nIn terms of specifications, the Ampere GA102-220 will definitely rock a specs upgrade over the RTX 3080's GA102-200 / GA102-202 GPU cores. Some specifications include 12 GB of GDDR6X memory running at faster pin speeds and a 384-bit bus interface. The card could offer a 5-10% performance increase over the existing NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card which falls in line with a SUPER-esque upgrade. The card is stated to be launched in January 2022 alongside the rest of the Ampere SKUs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti To Feature GA106, Non-Ti Features GA107 GPU Cores?\nThe second rumored specifications come from Kopite7kimi according to whom, the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti is going to rock the NVIDIA Ampere GA106-150-A1 GPU core. The GPU will offer 3072 FP32 cores and either a 6 or 12 GB GDDR6 memory capacity across a 192-bit bus interface. That's a big upgrade compared to the RTX 3050 Ti featured on laptops which houses a GA107 GPU with 2560 cores and just 4 GB memory across a 128-bit bus interface. The downside is that the card will also feature a higher TGP compared to the max 95W of the mobility variant. So we are likely to get 100 Watts+ for the Ti variant.\n\nWhere is my tweet about 3050 Ti? I want to update that.Maybe, RTX 3050 Ti, GA106-150-A1, 3072FP32, 6/12G GD6. A RUMOR.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) October 13, 2021\n\n\nUpdated, GA107-350-A1, more TGP.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) October 13, 2021\n\n\nAs for the Non-Ti GeForce RTX 3050, NVIDIA will be utilizing the GA107-350-A1 GPU core which is expected to rock 2304 FP32 cores, a 90W TGP, and most likely a 4 GB GDDR6 memory across the 128-bit bus interface. The memory capacity might change to 8 GB if the Ti is expected to go up to 12 GB. As for pricing, we can expect these cards to be priced in the sub-$300 US segment & will be a nice replacement over the GTX 1660 series cards for mainstream gamers. The added TGP and cores over the laptop variants will definitely sweeten up their performance potential against AMD entry-level RDNA 2 offerings.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 SUPER Graphics Card Specifications (Alleged):\n\n\n\nGraphics CardGPU NameSM / CoresMemory CapacityMemory BusTGPPrice (MSRP)\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti?GA102-350?84 / 1075224 GB GDDR6X384-bit~400W$1499 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090GA102-30082 / 1049624 GB GDDR6X384-bit350W$1499 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TIGA102-22580 / 1024012 GB GDDR6X384-bit350W$1199 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 SUPER?GA102-22070 / 896012 GB GDDR6X384-bit~320W$699 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080GA102-20068 / 870410 GB GDDR6X320-bit320W$699 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiGA104-40048 / 614416 GB GDDR6X256-bit~290W$599 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiGA104-40048 / 61448 GB GDDR6X256-bit290W$599 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070GA104-30046 / 58888 GB GDDR6256-bit220W$499 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 SUPERGA104?44 / 563212 GB GDDR6X192-bit~200W$399 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiGA104-20038 / 48648 GB GDDR6256-bit200W$399 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060GA106-30028 / 358412 GB GDDR6X192-bit170W$329 US\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiGA106-250/200?24 / 3072?8 GB GDDR6128-bit~120W$259 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050GA106-15020 / 2560?8 GB GDDR6128-bit~100W$209 US?\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050GA106-14018 / 2304?4 GB GDDR6128-bit~90W$179 US?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n159\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n60\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Says It Has Sold Over 200,000 Radeon RX 9070 Series GPUs In The First Batch, Promises Better Products In The Future\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nAnother load of Nvidia GPU rumours have just surfaced. We've had plenty of leaks about the RTX 3090 Ti (GA102-350) for a while now, so that's looking likely to happen in the new year\u2014although nothing is definite until Nvidia actually announces it. This has recently been joined by rumours of an RTX 3050 (GA107-350) and RTX 3050 Ti (GA106-150) as well as a 16GB spin of the RTX 3070 Ti (GA104-401) and a 12GB version of the RTX 3080 (GA102-220).That's a lot of new GPUs. Potentially. One explanation is that these are chips Nvidia has produced for its own validation but has no intention of actually manufacturing in volume.\u00a0 Or simply hearsay.We've seen some supporting evidence for the former, with the original rumours of the RTX 3080 Ti (GA102-250) prepared to take on the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT with 20GB of VRAM and essentially being a cutdown RTX 3090. What was finally released under that name was a very different beast\u2014the 12GB RTX 3080 Ti uses the GA102-225 GPU instead.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nSpecs for Nvidia's new RTX 5050, 5060, and 5060 Ti GPUs leak out and that 5060 might actually be half decent. If it's priced right\n\n\n\nSome of these 'rumours' are people simply filling in the gaps in Nvidia's 30-series lineup. The RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti are obvious candidates here, simply because Nvidia currently has nothing below the RTX 3060 in its 30-series stack on desktop. Surely such GPUs will appear at some point? If only so Nvidia uses up more of the chips it is producing.The fact the RTX 3050 exists in mobile form has made this a likely candidate for desktops for a while now. The usually reliable hardware leaker, Kopite, has stirred up renewed interest in such GPUs with a couple of recent tweets.Where is my tweet about 3050 Ti? I want to update that.Maybe, RTX 3050 Ti, GA106-150-A1, 3072FP32, 6/12G GD6. A RUMOR.October 13, 2021Updated, GA107-350-A1, more TGP.October 13, 2021One possible complication here is that there are rumours the RTX 2060 could make a return. This would potentially be battling at the same price point, or thereabouts, making it unlikely that both would exist at the same time. Of course, re-releasing a card like that raises just as many questions as it answers.\u00a0Then there are the rumours about different memory configurations of existing cards\u2014a 16GB RTX 3070 Ti and 12GB RTX 3080. Again these could be down to Nvidia exploring different memory configurations with no particular intention of producing them for the mass market. Having said that, new rumours over on Videocardz suggest that board partners have been told to prepare for such releases.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Tips and advice(Image credit: Future)How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021VRAM on graphics cards can be a contentious issue, just because it's often used by marketing teams to try and make cards look better than they actually are. For its latest RDNA 2 cards, AMD has offered more VRAM than Nvidia at similar price points, but until games actually make proper use of more memory, there's no real benefit to show for it.\u00a0What is potentially more beneficial is a bump in the memory bandwidth on offer. By upping the VRAM of the RTX 3080 to 12GB, Nvidia would have to use a 384-bit memory bus as opposed to the 320-bit bus found on the original version. That's more bandwidth and potentially better performance right there, although memory speed obviously plays a role here as well.All of these rumours point to a January 2022 release date, so we'll probably have to wait until then to see what Nvidia actually has planned. Right now, it appears to have as many as five new GPUs on the way\u2014ranging from the mighty RTX 3090 Ti down to the lowly RTX 3050, with room for a return of the RTX 2060 as well. Oh, and maybe some RTX 30-series Super cards? Oh boy.\n\n\nAlan DexterSocial Links NavigationAlan has been writing about PC tech since before 3D graphics cards existed, and still vividly recalls having to fight with MS-DOS just to get games to load. He fondly remembers the killer combo of a Matrox Millenium and 3dfx Voodoo, and seeing Lara Croft in 3D for the first time. He's very glad hardware has advanced as much as it has though, and is particularly happy when putting the latest M.2 NVMe SSDs, AMD processors, and laptops through their paces.
