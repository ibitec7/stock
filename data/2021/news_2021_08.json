Hopefully, I managed to finally master the art of clickbaiting. Since you're already here, why not read what follows!\nSo, here's the story. When we first started working on our standards for Web accessibility at McGill University, the first question we were asked was: \"Well... OK, thanks for the info bro. But dude, is there any way accessibility (a11y) can be easier?\" (paraphrasing)\nAnd the answer is, yes.\nI could have stopped there, but I figured that this answer, even though it is a pretty good one, was not clear enough. So here are some tools to help you improve your website's a11y score.\n[Cue inspiring quote and real content]\n\n\"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.\" Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web\n\n1. WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)\nWAVE is a free extension developed by the WebAIM group at Utah State University and it's available on Chrome and Firefox.\nTo run an audit, simply click on the WAVE icon at the right of your browser address bar or press Control + Shift + U (Command + Shift + U on Mac).\nUsing the \"Details\" tab, you can see where you have:\n\nEmpty heading\nLow contrast\nMissing alternative text\nEmpty links\netc.\n\nAnd what's cool about WAVE is that it can check any webpage. For that, I give a note of 15/16.\n\nWAVE Chrome Extension\nWAVE Firefox Extension\n\n2. VoiceOver\nVoiceOver is a screen reader technology developed by Apple. If you want to test your site diligently, this is a must-have tool. Be aware: steep learning curve ahead. 4.7/5.2\nUnfortunately, it's only available on Apple products (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod, iPod touch). NVDA is a good and free Windows alternative.Android Accessibility Suite is what you will need to install for an Android device.\n\nApple WWDC Videos\nApple YouTube Playlist\nNVDA screen reader\nAndroid Accessibility Suite\n\n3. Koa11y\nSue me, I love koalas. When I grow up, I am going to be a koala.\nThis desktop app allows you to automatically detect accessibility issues on a web page and generate a report. Both a simple and cute tool. Perfect score.\n(If you don't care about koalas and cuteness, note that this tool is based on Pa11y which offers a command line test runner)\n\nKoa11y website\nPa11y CI\n\n4. Web Developer Toolbar\nThe name pretty much describes it: The extension adds a toolbar to the browser with various web developer tools.\nUsing this extension, you can, in a few clicks, disable CSS styles, clear form fields, disable cookies, resize your window, view responsive layouts, and more. Score: 87.34%.\n\nWeb Developer Toolbar Chrome Extension\nWeb Developer Toolbar Firefox Extension\n\n5. a11y.css\nPronounced \"Alix\", this tool is probably more useful for web developers. It's a CSS file intended to warn developers about possible risks and mistakes that exist in HTML code. I think code geeks will love this one. 11/14.\n\na11y.css Chrome Extension\na11y.css Firefox Extension\na11y.css GitHub\n\n6. tota11y\nPronounced \"totally\", this JavaScript file was first created to improve the accessibility of Khan Academy. The script inserts a small button at the bottom of a page that, when clicked, annotates errors on a page. If you have access to the source code, you will love this one. 8/11.\n\ntota11y website\ntota11y GitHub\n\n7. Tanaguru Engine\nTanaguru Engine is an open-source website assessment tool. I have to say that this one is also meant for developers, but I recommend you try it if you feel comfortable managing command lines.\nMore details, Tanaguru Engine is a Java web app that will require you to run a MySQL/Tomcat server with Geckodriver and W3c validator. Plenty of fun lines of code to copy and paste. If you didn't understand a word of this, I recommend Koa11y instead.\nIn fewer details, this is the Rolls-Royce of open-source accessibility tools (except that it's free and it's not a car). The only problem with this tool is that it follows the RGAA3 (R\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 \ud83e\udd56\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7). It's not bad, but it's not exactly the same as the SGQRI 008 2.0 (\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf6) standard we need to follow. 7 out of 9 stars.\n\nTanaguru documentation\nTanaguru Engine GitHub\nStandard sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 des sites Web (SGQRI 008 2.0)\n\nIf you still don't know where to start\nIt's fine. Web accessibility is pretty complex. Follow the Easy Checks \u2013 A First Review of Web Accessibility or the A11Y Project Checklist to start evaluating your site and learn more about a11y.\nIf you need more tools because you love tools\nI recommend you read this Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List and this Accessibility resources list.\nIf you need more documentation\nI have plenty of that.\n\nDos and don'ts on designing for accessibility\nAccessibility Courses\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\nAccessibility resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment and University Information\n\n\nWeb Services\r\nSuite 1600\r\n680 Sherbrooke St. West\r\nMontreal, QC  H3A 2M7\n\nContact us\r\n\r\nMcGill University is on land which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst Indigenous peoples, including the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabeg nations.         \n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1Related resourcesGraphic Design and Multimedia\nIntegrated Communications\nIT Knowledge Base\nMcGill Visual Identity\nLinguistic Services\n\n\nColumn 2IT Service DeskReport an issue / Ask a question\nIT request & support forms\n\n\nColumn 3\nColumn 4\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcGill University\n\n          Copyright \u00a9 2025 McGill University        \n\nAccessibility\nCookie notice\nCookie settings\nLog in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The headline grabbing stat is that Nvidia's quarterly revenue broke a record, at $6.51 billion, up 68 per cent YoY, and 15 per cent better than the previous quarter. This figure is the result of record-breaking gaming revenue of $3.06 billion, up 85 per cent YoY, plus record-breaking Data Centre revenue of $2.37 billion, up 35 per cent YoY. Pro Visualisation revenue also grew fantastically, up 156 per cent YoY. Meanwhile, Automotive revenue was up 37 per cent.\n\nJensen Huang's results statement seemed to focus on AI, scientific computing, automotive\u2026 and everything except for gaming, as per usual. You can read his statement here, but let's move onto the gaming segment, which is still Nvidia's biggest revenue contributor. As per the intro and headline, gaming looks like it is doing great for Nvidia. In particular, in its Q2 FY22, the following highlights were noted:\n\n\nIntroduced GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, delivering up to 50 per cent more performance over the previous generation.\nAnnounced that Nvidia RTX is featured in 130+ games and applications, including Red Dead Redemption 2, F1 2021 and Minecraft RTX, in China, as well as Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro.\nAnnounced that Nvidia Reflex, which reduces gaming latency, is supported in 20 games, including top e-sports titles.\nAnnounced that GeForce RTX technologies are available for Arm platforms, with demos of Wolfenstein: Youngblood and The Bistro.\nAnnounced that GeForce NOW gives members access to more than 1,000 PC games, more than any other cloud-gaming service.\n\n\nThe above isn't all, of course, Nvidia and its partners continued to sell out as many graphics cards as they could produce, with the exceptional market and unprecedented demand we are observing.\nFrom the financials, we don't really know the actual numbers of GPUs supplied and sold compared to other quarters. The boosted revenue will be due to a mix of strong shipments and higher ASPs.\n\nThe CFO's commentary on the results (PDF) was most useful to find details about the makeup of graphics card sales. According to this document, 80 per cent of graphics cards sold in the last three months have been RTX 30 LHR versions. However, it is noted that Nvidia upped the supply of its Cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMP) to help gamers, but CMP didn't do as well as expected. Sales of $400 million worth of CMP cards were expected, but only $266 million realised. Dylan Patel, Chief Analyst at SemiAnalysis, reckons this is due to crypto slowdown. Moreover, he indicates that Nvidia and partners will have reallocated some CMP-targeted GPUs to gaming during the quarter.\n\nNvidia's shares are up 57 per cent in the last 12 months, and these results look like they will help reverse the 2.15 per cent dip we saw yesterday (NVDA is up 2.3 per cent in afterhours trading).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

Total Eth mining hashrate is very nearly back up to its peak.I think it is more likely that a crypto optimised card is just a stupid product. I'm frankly surprised they sold $266M worth of them. Eth mining is soon to go away, the return on investment isn't there even on standard GPUs so buying one that you can't re-sell when Eth 2.0 comes out is just dumb for miners.It also seems that there are now tweaks to run on mining software that gets the LHR standard GPUs to mine at 70% of their full rate on Ethereum.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n                    Posted by deleted - Thu 19 Aug 2021 12:03\n                \n\n\n\n\n            Nice if we could have a more detailed breakdown of the actual gaming cards numbers sold.

InvestorPlace contributor William White recently discussed some of the happenings at Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) AI Day. Included in that commentary were 11 things investors need to know about the billionaire\u2019s plans for AI across his various businesses.\u00a0\nOf all of White\u2019s points, I think the most critical is that Musk and company could have an AI prototype ready by 2022. And I do like the idea of sending my Tesla bot to the grocery store to go pick up some munchies. More importantly, though, the point also shines a light on other AI investments.\u00a0\nTen years ago, you could have counted the number of these advanced stocks on one or two hands. Now, however, it seems that many companies of various sizes are working with this kind of technology.\nSo, to make things interesting, this piece will cover five stocks and two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are winning with AI today. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll hopefully have a portfolio that runs all on its own \u2014 just like Tesla\u2019s bot.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nUpstart (NASDAQ:UPST)\nOmron (OTCMKTS:OMRNF)\nTeradata (NYSE:TDC)\nNemetschek (OTCMKTS:NEMTF)\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ)\niShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO)\n\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\nWired recently published an interesting article back in June on Nvidia, describing how the company became a dominant force in AI chips. So, how did they do it?\u00a0 YouTube and cats.\nRather than using hundreds or thousands of CPUs (central processing units) to get the job done, Nvidia used 12 GPUs (graphics processing units) to successfully distinguish between different beings in online videos. Basically, the \u201cneural network was shown ten million YouTube videos and learned how to pick out human faces, bodies and cats.\u201d\nAnd the rest is history.\nAs the Wired article points out, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs have been used almost exclusively by the top four cloud providers \u2014 Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Google (Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)), AWS (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) and Azure (Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) \u2014 to boost processing speeds. Further, some 70% of the world\u2019s supercomputers use the company\u2019s graphics units. Graphcore CEO Nigel Toon noted the following about the company:\n\u201cNVIDIA has done a fabulous job hiding the complexity of a GPU [\u2026] It works because of the software libraries they\u2019ve created, the frameworks and the optimisations that allow the complexity to be hidden. It\u2019s a really heavy lifting job that NVIDIA has undertaken there.\u201d\nHowever, as Wired notes, the next 10 years might not be as successful for Nvidia as the last 10. This is because more AI startups are gaining size and scale.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, Nvidia continues to generate tremendous free cash flow (FCF). That has given NVDA stock a big push higher, helping to land it on this list of stocks to buy. I don\u2019t expect that scenario to change anytime soon.\n\nUpstart (UPST)\nSource: PopTika/ShutterStock.com\nNext up on this list of stocks to buy is Upstart, a lending platform that uses a proprietary AI algorithm to more efficiently connect banks and individuals. When I started researching for this article, I knew very little about UPST. However, according to the company\u2019s home page, four in five Americans have \u201cnever defaulted on a credit product, yet less than half have access to prime credit.\u201d That means many people are paying more for their loans than they need to.\nSo, UPST is what you call a disruptor, using machine learning and AI to refine lending practices. This company has found that its model approves 26% more loans than the traditional model while lowering the average borrower\u2019s annual percentage rate (APR) by 10%. And finally, while Upstart currently focuses on the U.S. consumer lending market, its AI platform could be applied to all credit markets.\u00a0\nInvestors have certainly bought into this story. UPST stock went public in mid-December 2020 at $20 a share. It gained over 47% on its first day of trading and is now up 650% through Aug. 30.\nThe best part about Upstart, though, is that it reduces the level of defaults for its regional bank and credit union customers. Its win-win solution has led to fast growth. In 2017, the company had $51.2 million in revenue. That grew to $228.6 million in 2020, a 65% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\nI\u2019m almost embarrassed to say that I hadn\u2019t heard of Upstart before. But I know it now.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Omron (OMRNF)\nSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com\nI selected Omron for this list of stocks to buy in part because Morningstar describes the Japanese company as an industrial conglomerate. You might not know this about me, but I\u2019ve been obsessed with conglomerates of any kind since I was a kid.\nI know conglomerates are a failed business philosophy from the 1960s and 70s, but they can deliver the goods when done right. Long-time Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders certainly can\u2019t complain.\u00a0\nOmron\u2019s ADR has performed well over the past five years. It\u2019s got an annualized total return of 23.6% \u2014 more than double the Japanese equity markets as a whole and over 500 basis points better than the U.S. market as a whole.\u00a0\nInstitutional Investor recently named Omron the \u201cMost Honored Company\u201d in the Electronics-Industrial sector for the fifth year in a row. The honor was part of the magazine\u2019s annual ranking of Japanese executives.\u00a0\nFinally, while some might describe Omron as an industrial conglomerate, it\u2019s really about automation and AI. In May, it talked about robots and AI and their\u00a0part in the world\u2019s future.\u00a0Apparently, machines still have a lot to learn about human tasks. Felix von Drigalski, a researcher at Omron, noted the following about AI applications for everyday tasks:\n\u201c[L]aundry-folding robots have been studied worldwide but have yet to be realized. Just like the leather or cloth covers for car seats, it is extremely difficult to handle textiles with robots [\u2026]\u00a0Humans can\u2019t teach robots how to fold different kinds of clothes by showing them how to do it and describing the process in a program is practically impossible, so an AI module that learns these steps would be a promising application.\u201d\nAt the end of July, Omron reported healthy growth in sales and profits at all of its operating segments. No wonder OMRNF stock is up 27% year-t0-date (YTD).\n\nTeradata (TDC)\nSource: Shutterstock\nTDC stock is the next pick on list and also made my July gallery of 10 SMID-cap (small- and mid-cap) stocks to buy. I primarily chose this data analytics company because of its transformation from transaction-based business to recurring revenue \u2014 the Holy Grail of revenue streams.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2020, thanks largely to Teradata\u2019s move to recurring revenue, this company\u2019s FCF rebounded nicely after three consecutive years of falling. By 2019, FCF had fallen by 76% from 2016 levels, down to $94 million. In 2020, however, it jumped 137% to $223 million. As a result, the company expects free cash to exceed $400 million in 2021,\u00a0up from its previous guidance of $275 million.\u00a0\nBased on a current market capitalization of $5.9 billion, Teradata has an FCF yield of 6.8%, despite a 142% appreciation of its share price so far in 2021. I consider anything between 4% and 8% to be growth at a reasonable price.\u00a0\nTeradata\u2019s recurring revenue accounted for about 76% of sales in the second quarter, up from 71% a year earlier. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that its FCF increased by 187% in the first six months of fiscal 2021.\nAs I said in July, TDC stock is a \u201cdiamond in the rough.\u201d\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Nemetschek (NEMTF)\nSource: Shutterstock\nNext up, I selected this particular German company for this list of stocks to buy because it specializes in software solutions for the construction industry. My wife owns a small construction company with a partner, so I\u2019ve been spending some time getting to know the industry a little better.\nOf course, I thought about opting for a larger construction-related software company such as Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), but I like that NEMTF stock has a market cap that\u2019s a fraction of its size. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve found that mid-cap stocks often outperform their large-cap brethren without adding more risk.\nThis company has three revenue streams: recurring revenue \u2014 including software-as-a-service, subscriptions and more (60.1% in 2020) \u2014 software licenses (35.2%) and consulting & hardware (4.7%). As for geographic diversity, 24% of Nemetschek\u2019s revenue comes from Germany, while another 32% comes from the rest of Europe, 34% from the Americas and 10% from the Asia-Pacific region.\u00a0\nIn 2020, besides surviving the pandemic, one of the company\u2019s goals was to increase its recurring revenue. It was able to do so by using rental models, wherein customers pay for when and how they use its software.\u00a0\nAs a result, recurring revenue from service contracts and rental models increased by 21.1% over 2019. That also had a big part to play in the increase in overall recurring revenue as a percentage of sales in 2020. What\u2019s more, over the past five years, Nemetschek has increased sales and EBITDA by 77% and 96%, respectively (Page 6).\u00a0\nThis name ought to continue to benefit from the digitization of the building industry for years to come. I look forward to watching the company grow.\n\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ)\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\nBOTZ is an ETF from Global X, one of the more creative ETF providers. This firm seems to have a knack for spotting trends and jumping on them before others have a chance to.\u00a0\nThis ETF tracks the performance of the Indxx Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index. The ETF\u2019s home page states the following:\n\u201cRobotics & AI have wide-reaching application, extending far beyond industrial activity. BOTZ invests accordingly, with global exposure across multiple sectors and industries.\u201d\nGlobal X launched BOTZ back in September 2016. Today, it has more than $2.6 billion in total net assets. Of course, it isn\u2019t cheap at an expense ratio of 0.68%, but I think you get what you pay for here.\u00a0\nBOTZ currently has 36 stocks in its portfolio, with three of the previous names mentioned in this article in its top 10. Additionally, its top three sectors by weighting are industrials (40.7%), technology (35.3%) and health care (13.1%).\nAs for the size of the companies held by the ETF, the weighted average market cap is $47.3 billion. Its beta is 1.14 versus the S&P 500, making it slightly riskier than the index.\nTo be considered for selection in the index, a stock must have a market cap of at least $300 million, be listed in a developed market, have an average daily turnover of at least $2 million and meet other criteria as well. The stocks in the index are also reconstituted and rebalanced on an annual basis. Finally, the maximum weight for any stock is 8% while the minimum weight is 0.3%.\u00a0\u00a0\nI like the fact that this one has a concentrated portfolio. In my experience, this helps the returns\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO)\nSource: shutterstock.com/bangoland\nLast up on this list of stocks to buy is another ETF \u2014 the iShares version of an AI fund which tracks the performance of the NYSE FactSet Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Index. At 106 stocks, this ETF has three times as many holdings as BOTZ. Moreover, the top 10 holdings account for 12.74% of its $440 million in total net assets.\u00a0\nSo, you get a more diversified portfolio with IRBO at a management fee that\u2019s 21 basis points lower than BOTZ. Some investors will like that. I tend to like a smaller portfolio with thematic or sector-specific ETFs, but plenty of folks would opt for the lower fees.\u00a0\nAnother difference that might not matter to some investors is that the U.S. and Japan combined weighting for IRBO is 66.33%. By comparison, BOTZ has a combined weighting of 79.5% for these two countries, made considerably higher by its 37.1% weighting for Japan.\u00a0\nIRBO\u2019s top three sectors are technology (60.58%), communication (20.40%) and industrials (10.775). You\u2019ll notice that this ETF\u2019s tech component is also much larger than BOTZ\u2019s.\nDifferent strokes for different folks.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Adobe is collaborating with NVIDIA on a Substance 3D plugin that will bring Substance Material support to Omniverse, unlocking new material editing capabilities for Omniverse and Substance 3D users.\nNVIDIA Omniverse makes it possible for designers, artists and reviewers to work together in real time across leading software applications in a shared virtual world from anywhere. Professionals at over 500 companies, including SHoP Architects, South Park and Lockheed Martin, are evaluating the platform. Since the launch of its open beta in December, Omniverse has been downloaded by over 50,000 individual creators.\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse connects worlds by enabling the vision of the metaverse to become a reality,\u201d said Richard Kerris, vice president of the Omniverse development platform at NVIDIA. \u201cWith input from developers, partners and customers, we\u2019re advancing this revolutionary platform so that everyone from individuals to large enterprises can work with others to build amazing virtual worlds that look, feel and behave just as the physical world does.\u201d\nThe metaverse is an immersive and connected shared virtual world. In it, artists can create one-of-a-kind digital scenes, architects can create beautiful buildings and engineers can design new products for homes. These creations can then be taken into the physical world after they have been perfected in the digital world.\n\u201cLots of companies are, and have been, talking about the metaverse, but NVIDIA is one of the few that is actually delivering on its promise,\u201d said Jon Peddie, noted author, consultant and founder of Jon Peddie Research. \u201cNVIDIA brings a broader understanding of the needs of designers of all types and has many of the tools they can use \u2014 for free. The NVIDIA Omniverse platform has the potential to transform nearly every industry by making truly collaborative, creative innovation possible in a common virtual space for the first time.\u201d\nOmniverse Ecosystem Expands\r\nNVIDIA Omniverse has a swiftly growing ecosystem of supporting partners.\nKey to Omniverse\u2019s industry adoption is Pixar\u2019s open-source USD \u2014 the foundation of Omniverse\u2019s collaboration and simulation platform \u2014 enabling large teams to work simultaneously across multiple software applications on a shared 3D scene. This open standard foundation gives software partners multiple ways to extend and connect to Omniverse, whether through USD adoption and support, or building a plugin, or via an Omniverse Connector.\nApple, Pixar and NVIDIA have collaborated to bring advanced physics capabilities to USD, embracing open standards to provide 3D workflows to billions of devices. Blender and NVIDIA have collaborated to provide USD support to the upcoming release of Blender 3.0 and the millions of artists who use the software.\nNVIDIA is contributing USD and materials support in Blender 3.0 alpha USD, which will be available soon for creators.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s engineering efforts on integrating USD into Blender is exemplary for how the industry contributes to open source,\u201d said Ton Roosendaal, chairman of the Blender Foundation. \u201cThanks to USD, Blender artists can have high-quality access to studio pipelines and collaboration platforms such as Omniverse.\u201d\nNVIDIA and Adobe are collaborating on a Substance 3D plugin that will unlock new material editing abilities for Omniverse and Substance 3D users. Artists and creators will be able to work directly with Substance Materials either sourced from the Substance 3D Asset platform or created in Substance 3D applications, creating a more seamless 3D workflow.\n\u201cAdobe is dedicated to an open and connected community of 3D designers,\" said Sebastien Deguy, vice president of 3D and Immersive at Adobe. \"As an industry standard, Substance will strengthen the Omniverse ecosystem by empowering 3D creators with access to Substance 3D materials.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse ecosystem continues to grow, connecting industry-leading applications from software companies such as Adobe, Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Blender, Clo Virtual Fashion, Epic Games, Esri, Golaem, Graphisoft, Lightmap, Maxon, McNeel & Associates, Onshape\u00ae from PTC, Reallusion, Trimble, and wrnch Inc.\nGlobal Leaders Use Omniverse \r\nAmong the over 500 companies that have been evaluating Omniverse are:\nLockheed Martin is working with Omniverse for wildfire simulation, prediction and suppression. Its AI center of excellence has launched an initiative with NVIDIA called Cognitive Mission Management to develop a strategy for emergency response and fire suppression efforts.\n\u201cUsing NVIDIA Omniverse and AI to simulate wildfires will help us to predict how quickly and in which directions they spread and to explore the effects of environmental variables like wind, moisture and ground cover on their behavior, so firefighting teams can better respond and reduce their damaging impact,\u201d said Shashi Bhushan, principal AI software and systems architect at Lockheed Martin. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to develop models that coordinate sensor data and real-time analysis to inform an AI that guides varying levels of human intervention.\u201d\nSHoP Architects, based in New York, is using Omniverse for real-time collaboration and visualization. Omniverse lets the firm\u2019s team use the right software for the right task, and bring all the resulting data together in one place, where it can be extended and deployed using the platform.\n\u201cThe ability to make decisions quickly and accurately across our interdisciplinary teams is core to SHoP's process,\u201d said Geof Bell, associate, Digital Design and Delivery at SHoP Architects. \u201cOmniverse will enable us to bring data from multiple experts together in a single authoritative way, curating it to present the right information at the right time, paired with high-quality visuals for intelligent, evocative design.\u201d\nSouth Park, the long-running, Emmy Award-winning animated television series, is exploring Omniverse to enable several of its artists to collaborate on scenes and optimize their insanely limited production time.\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse will give multiple animators at our studio the ability to collaborate on a single scene, simultaneously,\u201d said J. J. Franzen, CIO at South Park. \u201cUsing our NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs and Omniverse will provide our creative geniuses more opportunities to cause ever greater trouble on the show.\u201d\nAvailability and Pricing\r\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise is currently in early access. The platform will be available later this year on a subscription basis from NVIDIA\u2019s partner network \u2014 including ASUS, BOXX Technologies, Dell Technologies, HP, Lenovo, PNY and Supermicro.\nInformation on pricing for Omniverse Enterprise is available here.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

At least part of it was actually led by a virtual replica of Huang, created by digitizing Huang with a truck full of DSLR cameras, and then animating him with the help of an AI, according to the company. Huang\u2019s kitchen, which has become Nvidia\u2019s venue for speaking to customers and investors since the beginning of the pandemic, was also entirely computer generated. It\u2019s not clear exactly which part of the keynote speech features CGI Huang (which is what makes the replica so impressive), but if you jump to this part of the presentation you can see Huang magically disappear and his kitchen explode into multiple different 3D models.\n\n\n\t\t\tVideos by VICE\t\t\n\n\u201cTo create a virtual Jensen, teams did a full face and body scan to create a 3D model, then trained an AI to mimic his gestures and expressions and applied some AI magic to make his clone realistic,\u201d Nvidia wrote in the blog post. \u201cDigital Jensen was then brought into a replica of his kitchen that was deconstructed to reveal the holodeck within Omniverse, surprising the audience and making them question how much of the keynote was real, or rendered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this article was published, Nvidia updated its blog post, clarifying that \u201conly 14 seconds of the hour and 48 minute presentation\u201d were animated. \n\n\nPlay video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company also published a video on Wednesday talking about how they made the GTC keynote, which included a section on the making of virtual Huang and his virtual kitchen.\n\n\nOmniverse is a platform that incorporates various tools for engineers to create animations, which the company calls a \u201cmetaverse\u201d for engineers.\u00a0\nThis story was updated with new information added by Nvidia to its blog post.\n\n\n\nTagged:computer animation, graphics, Metaverse, NVIDIA, omniverse\nShare:\nX\nFacebook\nShareCopied to clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\nOne email.

Snowflake\u2019s platform is the engine that powers and provides access to the Data Cloud, creating a solution for data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and data sharing. Why Would Anyone Pay 45X Sales?Investors are currently paying over 45 times sales for SNOW's projected topline next year of $1.8 billion. Yep, that's an $83 billion market cap.But that valuation is also based on 87% revenue growth this year and 62% next year.And that's the first consideration when computing the Rule of 40: the revenue growth rate.Then you simply take that absolute value (hopefully it's positive) and add some metric of profitability like EBITDA (positive or negative, as a percentage) or margins.According to the progenitor of the rule, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Brad Feld, if this math gets you over \"40,\" you have a worthy SaaS investment to consider. As I explain in the video, the Rule of 40 is not the final arbiter of software values, but merely a starting point and common-ground reference for many investors and analysts.Since Feld and his VC ilk specialize in risky money-raising rounds long before a software company goes public, they are pretty good a spotting ideas with potential. But even a veteran will tell you they often fall in love with ideas that never pan out. So using a quick growth screen like this can sometimes sort out the bad seeds, even for us non-VC who are investing in public softies.You might be surprised to learn that the original SaaS beast, salesforce.com CRM nearly nails the 40 mark. This is remarkable for such a mature company. But according to KeyBanc analysts, CRM scores over \"38\" for its forward revenue growth + FCF margin.Of course, CRM's valuation is attractive too at just 8 times forward sales. I really wish I had been paying better attention to CRM when it was on sale near 7X, bouncing off of $205 in March and May in a long consolidation since big new highs last August above $280.But I was focused on my favorite software player, Square SQ, which consistently trades at 5-6X sales.Why Does NVDA Trade at 20X Sales?In the video, I also shout out to the excellent Dan Ives, MD of Equity Research at Wedbush, who was on TD Ameritrade Network with @OJRenick Tuesday to preview CRM earnings tonight where he's expecting a \"mammoth\" quarter. He said...\"I think this is one where we look back, and this is the start of the rocket ship starting to regain fuel going into 2022.\"It makes sense when you look at CRM's fundamental growth numbers -- a 38 on the Rule of 40 says it all -- and its price chart which could be ready to jump out of a year-long \"cup\" that may just skip the \"handle\" and go to new highs.Although NVIDIA NVDA won't be mentioned by any software analysts in their Rule of 40 calculations, I happen to believe that what supports a 20X price/sales valuation for this unique GPU chip maker is its heavy reliance on hardware + software stacks to make \"massively parallel architectures\" accessible and useful for corporations and scientific research institutions doing heavy data mining, modeling, and automation/AI development.This is what institutional investors have finally recognized as NVDA has surged this summer and become a must-own in the FANGMAN suite.Bottom of the Rule of 40 BarrelTwo other names I look at which fall down hard in the Rule of 40, despite strong double-digit revenue growth, are C3.ai AI and Fastly. The reason they falter, even with 34% and 19% topline projections, is that their FCF margins are big negative numbers that virtually erase their sales growth contributions.You'll see what I mean in the video charts where I also review my 2019 thesis for why software valuations were headed to the stratosphere. Those trend markers have aged well and appear to be still in play...Software Valuations and the Rule of 40How is it that large investors are still piling into software stocks trading at over 20X sales?There are at least 4 major catalysts...1. Software is primarily immune to the current tariff battles2. Software is part of a secular \"technology super cycle\" as it vaults productivity while taming costs in nearly every industry3. Software is \"the brains\" of innovation, with nearly infinite capability to shrink, manipulate, and enhance time and space4. Software lives in its own \"valuation stratosphere\" based on the Rule of 40That year (2019) I began calling the industries that comprise SaaS, IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), and other Software applications and platforms that make use of cloud computing, The SOFTOSPHERE -- and not just to make a doubly cute \"cloud\" and \"valuation\" reference but to highlight what a dramatic agent of change the Software universe now represents in economics and society.When you think about investors who would never pay over 20X sales for a company, you can imagine how many could use a primer in the Rule of 40 that ignites and sustains such valuations. As more catch on, the multiples just expand.And after tonight's SNOW and CRM numbers, we'll know a lot more about what they will pay.Disclosure: I own shares of AI, SQ and NVDA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader portfolio and is the author of the influential Technology Super Cycle report that solved the high productivity + low inflation puzzles of disruptive innovation.

[+] logistics center on April 21, 2020 in Bretigny-sur-Orge, France. The French government has ordered the American e-commerce giant Amazon to take measures at four of its sites in France to better protect employees against Covid-19. This Tuesday, the Versailles Court of Appeal examined the appeal filed by Amazon against a decision requiring it to restrict its activity in France during this period of confinement. Amazon Logistique France has finally decided to close all of its warehouses pending the decision of the Versailles Court of Appeal, which will be made on Friday April 24. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to many countries across the world, claiming over 171,000 lives and infecting over 2.5 million people. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)Getty Images\nSix mega-cap tech companies dominate the market right now, and we all know them: Amazon\nAMZN\n (AMZN), Apple\nAAPL\n (AAPL), Facebook (FB\nFB\n), Google\nGOOG\n/Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft\nMSFT\n (MSFT), and Nvidia\nNVDA\n (NVDA), explains Adam Johnson, a growth stock expert, a contributor to MoneyShow.com and the editor of Bullseye Brief. \n\n\nTheir combined capitalization of $9.5 trillion represents nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 Index, which equates to a staggering 45% of US GDP\u2026 again, just six stocks.\n\nI am not currently long these stocks, though I certainly wish I were. They are up about 29% YTD, primarily because they provide consistent growth at scale. Whereas last year stocks rallied from Covid lows virtually across the board, this year is more about sure bets.\n\nMy small cap growth stocks hold great promise down the road (and I think we\u2019ll make multiples on our money), but The Big Six provide great results today.\n\nI am digging into each one of these mega-caps to better understand how their business might evolve, with the goal of identifying where I\u2019d buy them should markets correct 8-10% at some point. As great examples of American ingenuity, they could all become Bullseye picks, but only at the right price.\nMarket Cap, Cash Holdings, Returns YTDBullseye BriefThe Big SixBullseye Brief\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nAmazon\u00a0(AMZN)\nAnything, anytime, anywhere at the lowest price \u2026 plus AWS.\n\n2Q Results \u2014 Huge earnings beat, but a surprising revenue miss and lower guidance as consumers appear likely to return to brick and mortar stores. While Amazon has beaten estimates by 60-600% each quarter since the pandemic began, Q2\u2019s beat slipped to \u201cjust\u201d 23%.\n\n\nGuidance \u2014 Sees Q3 sales of $106-112B, about 8% below consensus estimates of $119B. That said, 20-30% topline growth is still quite strong. Only Wal-Mart (WMT) sells more merchandise.\nWhat to Watch \u2014 Rising wage pressures, and how new CEO Andy Jassy demonstrates leadership as Jeff Bezos departs, especially since he\u2019s the one who lowered guidance for the first time in several years. Separately, the company is exploring whether to integrate cryptocurrency into its payments options.\nCEO Quote \u2014 Thank you to all of our passionate, innovative, mission-driven employees around the world for continuing to stay focused on delivering for customers. I\u2019m very excited to work with you as we invent and build for the future.\nValuation \u2014 Cheapest P/Sales multiple of the group at 3.7x, though not surprising since retailing margins are typically very low. Amazon Web Services (AWS) would probably trade many multiples higher as a stand-alone business. AWS enables two-thirds of internet e-commerce and is growing 37%\u2026 but it\u2019s only 12% of total Amazon revenue.\nBuy Zone \u2014 $2,900-3,200\nApple (AAPL)\nBecause everything works out of the box and looks beautiful.\n2Q Results \u2014 Largest 2Q profit ever at $21.7B, led primarily by 5G iPhone upgrades. Apple topped analyst estimates by nearly 30%, which has only happened 12 times in 20 years. Curiously, the stock traded down 3% the next day based on conservative commentary around chip shortages.\nGuidance \u2014 Management again refrained from providing guidance, a practice begun by CEO Tim Cook in 2019 as he implored analysts to start thinking about Apple as a \u201cservices provider\u201d rather than as a \u201cgoods manufacturer.\u201d\nWhat to Watch\u00a0\u2014 The iCar will be an iconic game-changer and a direct challenge to Tesla\nTSLA\n\u2026 yes, I think it will happen. International growth of the core iPhone franchise could double earnings, though simmering US-China tensions are a potential threat sales and production.\nCEO Quote \u2014 We ask ourselves if we can do something better. We\u2019ll only enter a market where we have an ability to make a better product for the user.\nValuation \u2014 P/E is 26x for both 2021 and 2022, since earnings estimates are flat YoY, which seems crazy but probably reflects an assumption that lockdowns brought demand forward by several quarters.\nBuy Zone \u2014 $125-135\nFacebook (FB)\nBecause it\u2019s where 2.9 billion people connect all day long.\n2Q Results \u2014 Handily beats estimates on record Q2 revenue growth of 56% YoY\u2026 $29B in just three months. Notably, ad prices rose 47% YoY, though ad volume increased only 6%. Advertising represents 98% of revenue.\nGuidance \u2014 Cautious on 3Q because comps will get harder, as last March marked the bottom and growth was already on the upswing. Additionally, Apple\u2019s new iOS will allow users to activate an ad-blocking filter, which may disrupt revenues\u2026 this is why potential new profit sources are key (think merchandise sales and money transfer).\nWhat to Watch \u2014 Near term, monetization of Instagram is job #1\u2026 adding One-Click-to-Pay and taking a percentage of sales for example. Long term, Mark Zuckerberg talks of creating a virtual/augmented reality Metaverse, where people would interact with one another real-time in digital environments. The Libra cryptocurrency project has lost momentum, but money transfer could be big.\nCEO Quote \u2014 I\u2019m excited to see our major initiatives around creators, community, and commerce\u2026 and building the next computing platform that will bring our vision of the metaverse to life.\nValuation \u2014 Nearly every analyst on the Street raised estimates/targets following earnings, despite management caution about lower growth for the second half of the year. Shares trade at a P/E of 26x, consistent with the past several years. EPS may grow 40% this year, but retreat to the long-term trend of 15% by 2022.\nBuy Zone \u2014 $300-325\nGoogle/Alphabet (GOOG)\nBecause they own the internet. Period.\n2Q Results \u2014 Highest-ever quarterly revenue and profit, powered by record online ads sales. Ads related to Search rose 69% YoY to $36.6B, YouTube ad sales rose 84% to $7B and Cloud revenue rose 54% to $4.6B.\nGuidance \u2014 No specific guidance offered, but management says comps will be tougher for 3Q despite rising ad sales, since higher Capex and decreasing FX tailwinds will pressure operating margins.\nWhat to Watch \u2014 Global efforts to tax Google revenue. The company can certainly afford to pay proposed EU taxes, but the stock could be vulnerable to a headline-driven downdraft.\nCEO Quote \u2014 We\u2019re seeing a rising tide of online consumer and business activity in many parts of the world, and we\u2019re proud that our services help so many businesses and partners.\nValuation \u2014 P/E is 28x with 10-15% eps growth\u2026 expected in perpetuity.\nBuy Zone \u2014 $2,200-2,400 \nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nBecause every corporation in the world needs them.\n2Q Results \u2014 Tenth consecutive earnings beat driven by the highest-ever quarterly sales, which rose 21% to $46B. Notable new business wins highlight the mission-critical relevance of Azure Cloud Services and Windows 365 for enterprise users. Personal gaming and device revenues rose above $14B for the first time, and LinkedIn advertising surpassed expectations.\nGuidance \u2013 CFO Amy Hood sees \u201chealthy double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year ahead.\u201d\nWhat to Watch \u2013 Azure Cloud is a huge growth driver, but analysts are quick to highlight caution on the part of management\u2026 which may reflect C-suite concern that Wall Street had gotten ahead of itself.\nCEO Quote \u2013 We continue to grow new franchises for Microsoft in large and growing markets. In the past three years alone, gaming, security and now LinkedIn have all surpassed $10 billion in annual revenue.\nValuation \u2013 P/E is little pricey at 33x, given 10-12% growth, and P/Sales is historically high at 10x (vs. 10-yr avg of 6x).\nBuy Zone \u2013 $250-260\nNvidia (NVDA)\nBecause they make the fastest chips in the world 3T calculations/second.\n2Q Results \u2014 Will be announced 8/18. Analysts currently expect earnings per share of $1.02, which would be a 100% increase YoY, driven by a record 65% increase in revenue to $6.3B (also a record). The company has beaten estimates ten quarters in a row, but current expectations seem especially high.\nGuidance \u2014 Everything I\u2019ve read suggests to me that demand far exceeds supply, and that the company\u2019s ultrafast chips have no real competition\u2026 especially for fast-growing, high-intensity applications like A.I . and crypto mining.\nWhat to Watch \u2014 Can Nvidia beat elevated expectations yet again? Have unprecedented 26-week lead times contracted? What\u2019s the status of DoJ\u2019s review of the proposed $30B ARM acquisition?\nCEO Quote \u2014 We see great strength right now, and it\u2019s growing strength\u2026 setting us up for years of growth. Data Center, and A.I. specifically is the largest segment of computing. It\u2019s going to grow for some time to come (5/26).\nValuation \u2014 Very expensive\u2026 P/E is 49x and P/Sales is 19.5x\u2026 leaving no room for disappointment.\nBuy Zone \u2014 $140-160 Buy Zones for The Big SixBullseye Brief\nSubscribe to Bullseye Brief here\u2026\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorAug 02, 2021, 12:13pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Intel has joined the fray to create a new category of Smart Network Interfaces, but with a different strategy than NVIDIA. \nBack in 2020, when we were all still afraid to leave our homes, NVIDIA launched what it said was a new kind of processor that combined the networking capabilities from Mellanox with the acceleration capabilities of a GPU. Calling the device a Data Processing Unit, or DPU, NVIDIA foresees the emerging need for significant pre-and post-processing of data on the networking side of an accelerated server. Intel, sensing a new opportunity, recently announced it\u2019s \u201cIPU\u201d concept car, an FPGA-based NIC surely modeled after Microsoft Azure\u2019s pervasive NIC, but without any significant accelerators in its roadmap. What does NVIDIA foresee that Intel does not?\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a DPU, again?\nSpecifically, NVIDIA announced it\u2019s first DPU, the BlueField-2X, with a 60 TOPS GPU next to a Mellanox NIC, intending to jumpstart the development process in October, 2020. The NVIDIA DPU Roadmap shows a BlueField-3X in 2022 bumping up the Arm cores to 350 SPECINT, while BlueField-4 cranks it up in 2023, with 160 SPECINT and 1000 TOPS. That\u2019s a whole Ampere-class GPU sitting on a NIC! As an example of adoption, VMware announced support for the BlueField-2 as part of what they termed a \u201credefinition of Hybrid Cloud Architecture\u201d. This is heady stuff.\nNVIDIA's DPU RoadmapNVIDIA\n\nIntel\u2019s \u201cexotic\u201d response to NVIDIA: The IPU\nSensing an opportunity, Intel recently came out with its own Smart NIC strategy, and announced the IPU, for Infrastructure Processing Unit. The initial IPU is based on a Xeon CPU and an FPGA, which the company indicated could be replaced with a hardened ASIC in the future. The FPGA allows each data center designer to customize their clever infrastructure with reconfigurable hardware.\nIntel shows a vision for the future of the data center that is not noticeably different than that of ... [+] NVIDIA.Intel\n\nClearly the two largest semiconductor companies, measured by market cap, have very different visions here. Intel sees the future for hyper-scale data centers through the lens of their experience with Microsoft, which inspired the company to acquire Altera in 2015. Enabling fully customizable optimizations could be a boon to companies with the proper hardware programming skills.\n\n\nBut if NVIDIA is correct that massive acceleration will become required, we would have expected Intel to opt for a roadmap that should be obvious, adding a Habana accelerator to the IPU design. And of course they could still go down that road, but they would be following along NVIDIA\u2019s path and would be quite late. The current Intel IPU has a very modest Xeon D CPU and a Stratix 10 FPGA. It also supports up to 50Gb Ethernet, while the NVIDIA DPU BlueField 2X has supports 200Gb Ethernet, a 60 TOPS GPU and a 70 SPECINT Arm CPU. Clearly NVIDIA sees demand for much more performance, and an appetite to pay for it.\n\n Intel's DPU as implemented by Inventec. The FPGA Stratix-10 is the heart of the acceleration, and ... [+] the Xeon D provides control logic.Intel\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nThe NIC Continuum\nPatrick Kennedy at Serve The Home (STH) has published a \u201cNIC Continuum\u201d that explains the differences, pointing to the Intel IPU as a category they call \u201cExotic\u201d NICs using FPGAs. The NVIDIA DPU, is \u201cdesigned to be an infrastructure endpoint\u201d. So the question becomes, why did Intel skip the DPU category altogether? And what are the use cases for DPU that Intel will struggle to address with the IPU?Serve the Home (STH) has laid out a nice continuum of NICs, calling the Intel IPU an example of an ... [+] exotic network interfaces.Serve The Home\nTalking with NVIDIA\u2019s Kevin Deierling, the DPU is designed to offload, accelerate, and isolate individual compute servers in the data center. Mr. Deierling explained that customers are already deriving significant value from the current DPU (BlueField 2 and 2X), and shared a few examples, including SDN, DNS, firewall and load balancing. In one case, a customer was able to offload 8 CPU cores, and achieve a 53-fold speedup, while another customer offloaded network packet processing from 12 x86 cores, and increased throughput from 15 Gb/s to over 100 Gb/s on Bluefield 2.\nThe basic requirements here are two-fold: 1) data centers must isolate and protect each and every server; there is no trust in an environment wherein a user can just download some code off the internet and run it on a server. 2) The efficiency of each server can be greatly improved if you offload and accelerate data pre- and post-processing, as well as network packet processing and firewalls, from the relatively expensive CPU.\nBut couldn\u2019t Intel deliver similar results with an IPU? Results from Microsoft Azure would certainly support that conclusion, yes. The difference is that one needs to know how to program an FPGA, which typically means Verilog programming skills, not just Java, C++, and PHP. This is a difficult challenge and many if not most companies don\u2019t have adequate FPGA skills to go down this route. But if you do, then the customization available on an FPGA can help you create accelerations that are quite fast and specific to your environment.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nIf NVIDIA\u2019s vision comes to pass, a modern accelerated data center will have a network of Arm or X86 CPUs, equipped with ultra-fast GPUs, and a 400 GbE network which has 1000 TOPS and 160 SPECINT on each network controller, or DPU, attached to each server. That is more performance on the NIC than today\u2019s fastest servers. On the NIC! The combination of an accelerated three processor combo on each and every socket stretches the imagination of infrastructure designers to create an entirely new paradigm. And NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is just fine with that.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

About two weeks later, on August 25, the seller replied that they had sold the PoC without disclosing the terms of the deal.\nAnother member of the hacker forum indicated that GPU-based malware has been done before, pointing to JellyFish - a six-year PoC for a Linux-based GPU rootkit.\nIn a tweet on Sunday, researchers at VX-Underground threat repository said that the malicious code enables binary execution by the GPU in its memory space. They also added that they will demonstrate the technique in the near future.\n\nsource: vx-underground\nAcademic research\nThe same researchers behind the JellyFish rootkit also published PoCs for a GPU-based keylogger and a GPU-based remote access trojan for Windows. All three projects were published in May 2015 and have been publicly available.\nThe seller rejected the association with the JellyFish malware saying that their method is different and does not rely on code mapping back to userspace.\nThere are no details about the deal, who bought it and how much they paid. Only the seller\u2019s post that they sold the malware to an unknown party.\nWhile the reference to the JellyFish project suggests that GPU-based malware is a relatively new idea, the groundwork for this attack method has been set about eight years ago.\nIn 2013, researchers the at Institute of Computer Science - Foundation for Research and Technology (FORTH) in Greece and at Columbia University in New York showed that GPUs can host the operation of a keylogger and store the captured keystrokes in its memory space [PDF paper here].\nPreviously, the\u00a0researchers demonstrated\u00a0that malware authors can take advantage of the GPU\u2019s computational power to pack the code with very complex encryption schemes much faster than the CPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\u00a9 Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft: New RAT malware used for crypto theft, reconnaissanceNew Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUsMalicious Adobe, DocuSign OAuth apps target Microsoft 365 accountsClickFix attack delivers infostealers, RATs in fake Booking.com emailsChinese cyberspies backdoor Juniper routers for stealthy access\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper\nGPU\nGraphics\nMalware\nMemory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIonut Ilascu   \n              Ionut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.

While the data base is not indicative of actual market share, it does show that only 1 out of 14 gamers has AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards installed inside his PC while the rest are running NVIDIA's latest Ampere GeForce RTX GPUs.\nMore Gamers Are Running An NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Ampere Graphics Card Than AMD's Radeon RX 6000 Series According To Steam's Hardware Survey\nFor some time now, AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards weren't showing up within the Steam Hardware Survey but Redditor, Skipan, found a workaround that lists down AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards to see how well they stack up to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 numbers in the database. The workaround requires accessing the share for Vulkan Systems since the DirectX figures for AMD RX 6000 series GPUs were so low compared to NVIDIA Ampere GPUs that they weren't even showing up. With the new figures in, let's see how they compare.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\nThey are listed under vulkan systems here\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/\nIf you compare the shares for vulkan systems vs overall shares listed on\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey you'll see that all AMD and NVIDIA cards have twice the share under vulkan systems. So just divide by 2 to get the overall share.\n\n\n6900xt 0.08%\n\n\n6800xt 0.1%\n\n\n6800 0.05%\n\n\n6700xt 0.11%\n\n\ntotal 0.34%\nvia Skipan (r/Hardware)\nThe AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT flagship has a share of 0.08%, 6800 XT has a share of 0.1%, 6800 has a share of 0.05%, & the recently launched 6700 XT has the highest share of 0.11%. All combined, the entire AMD Radeon RX 6000 series lineup has a share of 0.34%. Now if we compare these numbers to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards, the RTX 3090 alone has a share of 0.37% (Linux) & that's a flagship $1500 US card. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 has a share of 0.85%, RTX 3070 sits at 1.53% with the highest market share, & the RTX 3060 series amounts for 1% share. The database hasn't yet included the RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3070 Ti.\n\nLooking at the overall share split between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, the Ampere GeForce RTX 30 series sits at roughly 93.4% while RDNA 2 Radeon RX 6000 series sits at 6.6%. This is a split of 14:1 which means that out of 14 gamers, only one is using an AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics card on Steam. Comparing the full Linux share, the Ampere family now amounts to 9.6% of the share & AMD's RDNA 2 family accounts for 0.68% (including mobile and desktop variants).\nAMD & NVIDIA GPU Share (Steam Hardware Survey Linux DB / July 2021)\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Graphics CardShareAMD Graphics CardShare\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30900.37%Radeon RX 6900 XT0.08%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 TiN/ARadeon RX 6800 XT0.10%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30800.85%Radeon RX 68000.05%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 TiN/ARadeon RX 6700 XT0.11%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30701.53%Radeon RX 6600 XTN/A\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti0.41%--\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30600.64%--\n\n\nTotal (Desktop GPUs)3.80%Total (Desktop GPUs)0.34%\n\n\n\nOnce again, these numbers aren't supposed to be digested as actual market share but they are rather an internal statistic put together by Steam to show what the majority of their userbase is using inside their PCs. Steam has an active user base of over 130 million and hit over 26 million concurrent users in May 2021. To be realistic, both NVIDIA and AMD have had their fair share of trouble to meet the demand but one thing is clear, NVIDIA did have a much bigger stock to offer to gamers than AMD did and even months after launch, you could find an NVIDIA RTX 30 series card while AMD RX 6000 series are harder to find.\n\nThe Crypto jump also pushed many gamers to buy NVIDIA RTX 30 series cards over AMD variants and had been mining off their GPUs through mining suites such as NiceHash in their free time. Though not as lucrative as a few months back, these GPUs offer top-notch gaming performance and if they can pay out some of their costs through mining, then why not let gamers have some fun.\nThe downside is that the same cards have been popular in the mining community and many gamers were deprived of them for months before NVIDIA launched their LHR series which kind of fixes the whole miner's gobbling-up gaming cards situation. Since then, we have seen prices of graphics cards falling further and availability getting better with analysts claiming a return to normal rates by Q4 2021 or early 2022. We saw in the previous GPU market share report that AMD and NVIDIA retained their actual GPU market share though those numbers comprise last-gen parts.\nIn the end, AMD and NVIDIA both have some really competitive products in their respective GPU lineup, offering amazing new features to gamers such as FSR, DLSS, and Ray-tracing support but it all boils down to availability and unfortunately, both manufacturers have been unable to keep up with the insane demand, especially AMD.\n\n\n\nWhich GPU are you using inside your current PC?\n\n\n NVIDIA GeForce\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n AMD Radeon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel Xe (or older)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n126\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n110\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The chip invented the category of the DPU last year, and it\u2019s already being embraced by cloud services, supercomputers and many OEMs and software partners.\nIdan Burstein, a principal architect leading our Israel-based BlueField design team, will describe the DPU\u2019s architecture at Hot Chips, an annual conference that draws many of the world\u2019s top microprocessor designers.\nThe talk will unveil a silicon engine for accelerating modern data centers. It\u2019s an array of hardware accelerators and general-purpose Arm cores that speed networking, security and storage jobs.\nThose jobs include virtualizing data center hardware while securing and smoothing the flow of network traffic. It\u2019s work that involves accelerating in hardware a growing alphabet soup of tasks fundamental to running a data center, such as:\n\nIPsec, TLS, AES-GCM, RegEx and Public Key Acceleration for security\nNVMe-oF, RAID and GPUDirect Storage for storage\nRDMA, RoCE, SR-IOV, VXLAN, VirtIO and GPUDirect RDMA for networking, and\nOffloads for video streaming and time-sensitive communications\n\nThese workloads are growing faster than Moore\u2019s law and already consume a third of server CPU cycles. DPUs pack purpose-built hardware to run these jobs more efficiently, making more CPU cores available for data center applications.\nDPUs deliver virtualization and advanced security without compromising bare-metal performance. Their uses span the gamut from cloud computing and media streaming to storage, edge processing and high performance computing.\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang describes DPUs as \u201cone of the three major pillars of computing going forward \u2026 The CPU is for general-purpose computing, the GPU is for accelerated computing and the DPU, which moves data around the data center, does data processing.\u201d\nA Full Plug-and-Play Stack\nThe good news for users is they don\u2019t have to master the silicon details that may fascinate processor architects at Hot Chips. They can simply plug their existing software into familiar high-level software interfaces to harness the DPU\u2019s power.\nThose APIs are bundled into the DPU\u2019s software stack called NVIDIA DOCA. It includes drivers, libraries, tools, documentation, example applications and a runtime environment for provisioning, deploying and orchestrating services on thousands of DPUs across the data center.\nWe\u2019ve already received requests for early access to DOCA from hundreds of organizations, including several of the world\u2019s industry leaders.\nDOCA provides a software platform for rapid development of networking, storage and security applications on the DPU.\nDPUs Deliver for Data Centers, Clouds\nThe architecture described at Hot Chips is moving into several of the world\u2019s largest clouds as well as a TOP500 supercomputer and integrated with next-generation firewalls. It will soon be available in systems from several top OEMs supported with software from more than a dozen other partners.\nToday, multiple cloud service providers around the world are using or preparing to deploy BlueField DPUs to provision compute instances securely.\nBlueField Powers Supercomputers, Firewalls\nThe University of Cambridge tapped into the DPU\u2019s efficiencies to debut in June the fastest academic system in the U.K., a supercomputer that hit No. 3 on the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient systems.\nIt\u2019s the world\u2019s first cloud-native supercomputer, letting researchers share virtual resources with privacy and security while not compromising performance.\nWith the VM-Series Next-Generation Firewall from Palo Alto Networks, every data center can now access the DPU\u2019s security capabilities. The VM-Series NGFW can be accelerated with BlueField-2 to inspect network flows that were previously impossible or impractical to track.\nThe DPU will soon be available in systems from ASUS, Atos, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, New H3C Information Technologies, Inspur Electronic Information, Quanta/QCT and Supermicro, several of which announced plans at Computex in May.\nMore than a dozen software partners will support the NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, including:\n\nVMware, with Project Monterey, which introduces DPUs to the more than 300,000 organizations that rely on VMware for its speed, resilience and security.\nRed Hat, with an upcoming developer\u2019s kit for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat OpenShift, used by 95 percent of the Fortune 500.\nCanonical, in Ubuntu Linux, the most popular operating system among public clouds.\nCheck Point Software Technologies, in products used by more than 100,000 organizations worldwide to prevent cyberattacks.\n\nOther partners include Cloudflare, DDN, Excelero, F5, Fortinet, Guardicore, Juniper Networks, NetApp, Vast Data and WekaIO.\nThe support is broad because the opportunity is big.\n\u201cEvery single networking chip in the world will be a smart networking chip \u2026 And that\u2019s what the DPU is. It\u2019s a data center on a chip,\u201d said Collette Kress, NVIDIA\u2019s CFO, in a May earnings call, predicting every server will someday sport a DPU.\nDPU-Powered Networks on the Horizon\nMarket watchers at Dell\u2019Oro Group forecast the number of smart networking ports shipped will nearly double from 4.4 million in 2020 to 7.4 million by 2025.\nGearing up for that growth, NVIDIA announced at GTC its roadmap for the next two generations of DPUs.\nThe BlueField-3, sampling next year, will drive networks up to 400 Gbit/second and pack the muscle of 300 x86 cores. The BlueField-4 will deliver an order of magnitude more performance with the addition of NVIDIA AI computing technologies.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the market momentum and this week\u2019s Hot Chips talk is just as it has in AI, NVIDIA is now setting the pace in accelerated networking.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | NetworkingTags: Customer Stories | Events | High-Performance Computing | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And if you head into battle on a GeForce RTX GPU, you can activate NVIDIA DLSS.\nEarly Access to the Open Beta kicks off today and is available until August 9th, returns on August 12th for everyone, and features a rich slice of content from the full game. You and your team of three \u2018Cleaner\u2019 friends are at the center of a war against the \u2018Ridden\u2019. These once-human hosts of a deadly parasite have turned into terrifying creatures bent on devouring what remains of civilization. With humanity's extinction on the line, it's up to you and your friends to take the fight to the enemy, eradicate the Ridden, and reclaim the world in a series of co-op campaign levels featuring randomized elements, a unique loadout system, and 8 different characters with their own perks and stats.\nIn the Open Beta, you can sample two of the campaign maps with 5 of the playable\u00a0 \u2018Cleaner\u2019 characters, and blast foes with the complete range of weapons and gear. And if you fancy an extra challenge, you can switch to Swarm mode, where you and your team will take on another four \u2018Ridden\u2019 players in PvP on two maps. Complete your objectives, survive as long as possible, and defeat the playable \u2018Ridden\u2019 characters before they can unleash their devastating attacks. Then, switch sides and try to finish off the enemy in less time to claim victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is available in over 60 games, boasts industry-wide support thanks to plugins and SDKs for Unreal Engine 4 and 5, and Unity, and is supported by over a dozen leading first party engines. In each game and engine, DLSS greatly accelerates performance while generating beautiful, sharp images. Only DLSS offers big performance gains while keeping image quality comparable to native across all resolutions, even at 1080p.\u00a0\u00a0\nSimply download our latest Game Ready Driver and activate DLSS in any supported game to immediately benefit from its critically acclaimed technology.\nTo learn about all the other games adding NVIDIA DLSS in the near future, stay tuned to GeForce.com.

Following NVIDIA\u2019s transitional top-to-bottom product rollouts, the latest member of NVIDIA\u2019s pro GPU lineup is the smallest and cheapest card yet, thanks in large part to its use of NVIDIA\u2019s GA106 GPU. Paired with 6GB of VRAM and aimed in part at small form factor workstations, NVIDIA expects the card to go on sale in October.\nThough a relative lightweight compared to the far more powerful RTX A6000, the A2000 is an interesting (and in some ways much delayed) development in NVIDIA\u2019s professional visualization product stack. Despite the fact that NVIDIA has been shipping ray tracing-capable hardware for almost 3 years now, the company has never previously released a mid-range ProViz card with that kind functionality\u00a0\u2013 the previous-generation Quadro RTX stack stopped at the RTX 4000, and below that, everything has remained RT-free. And though this is ultimately based on the fact that NVIDIA only put RT hardware in their higher-end Turing GPUs, the end result is the same: this is NVIDIA's first RT-capable mid-range pro card.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Professional Visualization Card\n\t\t\tSpecification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA6000\nA5000\nA4000\nA2000\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n10752\n8192\n6144\n3328\n\n\nTensor Cores\n336\n256\n192\n104\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1800MHz\n1695MHz\n1560MHz\n1200MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n16Gbps GDDR6\n16Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n12Gbps\n\t\t\tGDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n384-bit\n384-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n48GB\n24GB\n16GB\n6GB\n\n\nECC\nPartial\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\nPartial\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\nPartial\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\nPartial\n\t\t\t(DRAM)\n\n\nSingle Precision\n38.7 TFLOPS\n27.8 TFLOPS\n19.2 TFLOPS\n8 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Performance\n309.7 TFLOPS\n222.2 TFLOPS\n153.4 TFLOPS\n63.9 TFLOPS\n\n\nTDP\n300W\n230W\n140W\n70W\n\n\nCooling\nActive\nActive\nActive\nActive\n\n\nNVLink\n1x NVLink3\n\t\t\t112.5GB/sec\n1x NVLink3\n\t\t\t112.5GB/sec\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nGPU\nGA102\nGA102\nGA104\nGA106\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\nSamsung 8nm\n\n\nLaunch Price\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n$450\n\n\nLaunch Date\n12/2020\n04/2021\n04/2021\n10/2021\n\n\n\nFittingly, it\u2019s also the first RTX card released by NVIDIA that\u2019s available in a low-profile design. Thanks to NVIDIA significantly turning down the GA106 GPU\u2019s clockspeeds, the RTX A2000 has a TDP of just 70 watts. This keeps the heat generated by the card low enough that it can be cooled by a dual-slot low-profile cooler \u2013 making it suitable for use in true small form factor workstations \u2013 albeit at the cost of capping the card\u2019s overall performance.\nDigging down into the specifications, what we find is a GA106-based video card with a few SMs disabled and a relatively low boost clockspeed of just 1200MHz. On paper, this gives the card roughly 8 TFLOPS of single precision (FP32) graphics and compute performance. Or, tapping into the card\u2019s 104 tensor cores, it can wring out almost 64 TFLOPS of performance with tensor operations.\nThis is backed by 6GB of GDDR6 memory, sitting on top of a 192-bit memory bus. Like the GPU clockspeed, NVIDIA is keeping the memory clockspeed on the low side as well (presumably again for power reasons), resulting in a memory clockspeed of 12Gbps. Thankfully, the wider memory bus offsets this somewhat, putting the final memory bandwidth at a respectable 288GB/second. Meanwhile, as this is a ProViz card, like the rest of the RTX A series the A2000 offers optional ECC memory support in the form of soft ECC.\n\nPast that, the diminutive video card\u2019s claim to fame is its small size. As previously mentioned, this is NVIDIA\u2019s first low-profile ProViz card in a while, and is aimed in part at small form factor workstations. With a 70W TDP, the card still requires a decent bit of cooling, so NVIDIA has essentially split the difference and gone with a double-wide card design in the form of a low-profile blower. So RTX A2000 is neither silent nor quite small enough to go into truly tiny machines, but SFF boxes that can provide the necessary slots should have little trouble accommodating the card. Meanwhile, though not shown off in any of the pictures NVIDIA has provided, the RTX A2000 is designed to go into standard (full height) PCs as well, so there will also be a full profile bracket available for the card.\nFinally, owing to the small size of the card, NVIDIA has switched to Mini DisplayPort 1.4a connectors for this card. MiniDP gives the card the same display capabilities as the other A-series cards \u2013 driving up to 4 5K displays \u2013 just without the convenience of using the same full-size DP connector as the rest of the family.\nWrapping things up, NVIDIA expects the RTX A2000 to be available through the company\u2019s usual retail and OEM partners in October. The card will be priced at around $450.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n33 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nFrumious1 - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nThank goodness for this important news about a GPU launching in October, for a market that we enthusiasts don't even care about. You're doing God's work, Ryan! Never mind the Radeon RX 6600 XT that launches tomorrow and had reviews go up from your competitor sites today. Never mind Every. Single. GPU. Launched. In. The. Past. Year. Huzzah for the Nvidia RTX A2000!Seriously, do you just not do reviews anymore? Don't use lack of availability as an excuse. We'd still read your insights on things. I guess the concerns that after the Purch buyout, the site would focus more on phones and less on PC has proved true.\n\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nI care about it, and appreciate the article.\n\n\n\nomf - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nNext time, how about just skipping articles you're not interested in?\n\n\n\nFrumious1_is_mean - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nJeeeze my guy chill\n\n\n\nUnashamed_unoriginal_username_x86 - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nYo I learned this cool word, \"nosism.\" It means using a plural pronoun when you're really just talking about yourself.Besides, this is an IT news site, not an \"enthusiast\" news site. Of course they're covering a hardware release.Also the \"focus more on phones\" is just Andrei pulling a lot of weight as mobile editor, unrelated to editorial direction.I think Ryan's mentioned something or other about not being sampled for GPU's for that matter.\n\n\n\ncatavalon21 - Friday, August 13, 2021 - link\nAccording to Ryan, they are sampled GPUs - some, at least.https://twitter.com/RyanSmithAT/status/14260377923...They just ... aren't.\n\n\n\ncoburn_c - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nIt's dead Jim, give up. \n\n\n\ncoburn_c - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nAlso it's a pipeline story not an article\n\n\n\ncatavalon21 - Thursday, August 12, 2021 - link\nSure.  It would be nice to HAVE a review article.\n\n\n\ndw47 - Tuesday, August 10, 2021 - link\nLets go through the recent topics on this site: Open Compute, Gigabyte Dual EPYC MB, Xeon W Workstation CPUs, Supermicro Ice Lake Xeon MB, Threadripper Pro. What makes you think this is an \"enthusiasts\" site? And even if they cover the RX6600 XT people will just moan about \"unavailability\" and \"$399\" like every other review on Youtube channels right now. This article told me something I didn't know, and I appreciated it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Here's what you need to know.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n By Thiago Trevisan  \n\nMar 1, 2022 7:30 am PST \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Thiago Trevisan/IDG \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a tough time to be a PC gamer. A crippling GPU shortage has made buying the best graphics cards next to impossible, and when you can find a GPU, it\u2019s usually at an exorbitant markup. Making matters worse, crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have been absolutely booming throughout 2021 and 2022, driving hordes of GPU miners to gobble up what graphics cards they can find to mine cryptocoins and turn a nice profit, sometimes in \u201cfarms\u201d composed of rows of toiling GPUs.\nTo help combat the dire GPU availability situation faced by gamers, Nvidia introduced Lite Hash Rate (LHR) technology that put strict limits on the mining performance of select GPUs, ostensibly to get more graphics cards into the hands of gamers. Here\u2019s a rundown of what LHR does, which graphics cards include the technology, if gaming performance is impacted (spoiler: nope), and everything else you need to know.\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia Lite Hash Rate technology?\nFirst things first\u2014what is LHR? Nvidia LHR graphics cards detect when they\u2019re being used for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency mining and automatically halve the \u201chash rate.\u201d Without diving too deeply into the weeds, this makes LHR GPUs less profitable for potential mining purchases due to their higher power draw relative to the now lower hash rate. The idea is that if LHR GPUs aren\u2019t profitable for miners, they will be purchased by gamers instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nLHR tech was first introduced in the GeForce RTX 3060, but quickly broken, then reintroduced again.\n\nThe initial attempt at introducing the Lite Hash Rate limiter in the GeForce RTX 3060 didn\u2019t go as planned. An accidental beta driver release unlocked the GPU\u2019s full mining performance the same week it launched. Undaunted, Nvidia returned with a second go at LHR technology across most of its lineup two months later. The newer LHR GPUs (such as the RTX 3080 Ti) supposedly feature much tighter integrations between firmware and software.\n\n\n\n\nWill the limiter\u2019s effectiveness hold long term? Nobody knows. Recent news indicates that up to 70 percent of a LHR GPU\u2019s mining performance has now been unlocked with NBMiner, up from the 50 percent that LHR restricts them to out of the box. Crypto is big business these days, and ambitious miners will strive to crack Nvidia\u2019s protections to eke out more profits. Be careful with what you download, however; one high-profile purported LHR unlock tool installed a Trojan on users\u2019 PCs instead.\nWhat GeForce GPUs have LHR?\nHere are the GeForce graphics cards that include LHR technology.\n\nNvidia RTX 3050Nvidia RTX 3060Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti (Founders Edition unaffected)Nvidia RTX 3070 (Founders Edition unaffected)Nvidia RTX 3070 TiNvidia RTX 3080 (Founders Edition unaffected)Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti\nNvidia applied LHR to most of its RTX 30-series lineup in the middle of May 2021. If you already own an RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, or RTX 3080 created before the manufacturing change, their mining performance will not be limited in any way. (That\u2019s why Nvidia\u2019s own limited-run Founders Edition models don\u2019t support LHR\u2014they were all made long before Nvidia introduced its limiter.) All GeForce GPUs made after the switchover include LHR technology by default. Well, almost all\u2014the work-hard-play-hard GeForce RTX 3090 never got LHR and all models offer full hash rate performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe monstrous RTX 3090 straddles the line between pro and play, and is the only current GeForce RTX 30-series GPU without LHR.\n\nHow do I know if I have a LHR GeForce graphics card?\nRegardless of which model RTX 30-series card you buy, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019re purchasing an LHR GPU because the box will identify it as \u201cLHR\u201d or \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d in some way. AMD\u2019s rival Radeon graphics cards currently do not have any similar restrictions on hash rate.\n\n\nDoes LHR affect gaming performance?\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, don\u2019t worry about Nvidia\u2019s Lite Hash Rate technology. It does not affect gaming performance whatsoever as far as we know. This is strictly a hash rate limiter.\nWhat does LHR mean for resale value?\nResale value on LHR graphics cards may go either way. Some people may value these models more because LHR indicates a graphics card probably wasn\u2019t for mining. Miners will value them less, on the other hand, due to their decreased performance relative to the price.\n\nIf you\u2019re a miner, you probably want to avoid LHR GPUs unless their restrictions become further unlocked. That said, if crypto mining profitability increases, these may still be viable for miners even with decreased performance.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article originally published on August 24, 2021, but was updated to include the RTX 3050 and mention the LHR Unlocker tool that installed malware instead.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Available from nearly 20 global computer makers, these servers have been validated for running a diverse range of accelerated workloads with optimum performance, reliability and scale.\nNow NVIDIA-Certified Systems are expanding to the desktop with workstations that undergo the same testing to validate their ability to run GPU-accelerated applications well.\nCertification ensures that these systems, available as desktop or laptop models, have a well-balanced design and the correct configurations to maximize performance. GPUs eligible for certification in the workstations include the newest NVIDIA RTX A6000, A5000 and A4000, as well as the RTX 8000 and 6000.\nNVIDIA-Certified workstations will join a lineup of over 90 already available systems that range from the highest performance AI servers with the NVIDIA HGX A100 8-GPU, to enterprise-class servers with the NVIDIA A30 Tensor Core GPU for mainstream accelerated data centers as well as edge locations, to the most powerful graphics servers with NVIDIA A40.\nCertified Systems to Accelerate Data Science on CDP\nCloudera Data Platform (CDP) v7.1.6, which went into general availability last week, now takes advantage of NVIDIA-Certified Systems. This latest version adds RAPIDS to accelerate data analytics, ETL and popular data science tools like Apache Spark with NVIDIA GPUs to churn through massive data operations.\nTesting has shown that this version of CDP runs up to 10x faster on servers with NVIDIA GPUs vs. non-accelerated servers. To make it easy to get started, NVIDIA and Cloudera recommend two NVIDIA-Certified server configurations that customers can purchase from several vendors:\n\nCDP-Ready: For running Apache Spark, a CDP-Ready configuration of NVIDIA-Certified servers with two NVIDIA A30 GPUs per server offers over 5x the performance at less than 50 percent incremental cost relative to modern CPU-only alternatives.\nAI ready: For customers additionally running machine learning or other AI-related applications, the NVIDIA A100 GPU provides even more performance \u2014 as well as acceleration on machine learning and AI training.\n\nData scientists often develop and refine machine learning and deep learning models on workstations to augment data center resources or help minimize cloud-based compute costs. By using an NVIDIA-Certified workstation, they can transition their work to NVIDIA-Certified servers when it\u2019s time for larger scale prototyping and eventually production, without having to port to a different tool or framework.\nNew White Paper Describes Value of Certification\nWhen it comes to installing GPUs and SmartNICs in a system, choosing the right server or workstation model and correctly configuring the components and firmware are critical to getting the most out of the investment.\nWith NVIDIA-Certified Systems, NVIDIA and its partners have already done the work of validating that a particular system is capable of running accelerated workloads well, and they\u2019ve figured out the most optimal hardware configuration.\nMisconfiguration can lead to poor performance and even inability to function properly or complete tasks. The certification process ensures that issues such as these are surfaced and resolved for each tested system. We\u2019ve described this and more in a new white paper, Accelerate Compute-Intensive Workloads with NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\nOur system partners run a suite of more than 25 tests designed by NVIDIA based on our vast experience with compute, graphics and network acceleration. Each of the tests is chosen to exercise the hardware of the system in a unique and thorough manner, so as many potential configuration issues as possible can be exposed. Some of the tests focus on a single aspect of the hardware, while others stress multiple components, both simultaneously as well as in a multi-step workflow.\n\nWith NVIDIA-Certified Systems, enterprises can confidently choose performance-optimized hardware to power their accelerated computing workloads \u2014 from the desktop to the data center to the edge.\nLearn more about NVIDIA-Certified Systems:\n\nAug. 12 webinar: The Expanding Universe of NVIDIA-Certified Systems\nFind an NVIDIA-Certified System\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems Configuration Guide\n\n\n\nCategories: Mobile | WorkstationTags: Data Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Please enable Javascript in order to access all the functionality of this web site. Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex is a must-have in multiplayer titles, reducing system latency so your actions occur quicker, making you more competitive. It\u2019s available in 20 of the most popular multiplayer and esports games, it\u2019s free, it\u2019s available for all GeForce graphics cards dating back to the 900 Series, and it takes only a single click to enable.\nNVIDIA Reflex Gets Even Better\nRecently, NVIDIA Reflex support came to Rust and Escape From Tarkov, two extremely popular multiplayer titles built in the Unity engine. In both, system latency was reduced by up to 38%, but now that number is even higher with the release of the Reflex SDK 1.5 update.\nIn Escape From Tarkov, a high-intensity first-person shooter, where death can be one bullet away, NVIDIA Reflex now reduces system latency by up to 58%!\n  \nIn Rust, where players are in a brutal fight for survival in an always-online server, dying can mean the loss of a week\u2019s work, so getting the competitive advantage is critical. Now, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency by up to 51%, greatly improving responsiveness for all GeForce gamers.\n  \nTo up your game, simply download the latest updates for each title, and ensure NVIDIA Reflex is enabled in the game\u2019s options menu. It\u2019s that easy.\nNVIDIA Reflex Boost Mode Enhancements\nReflex Boost mode is for gamers whose highest priority is reducing latency. In Reflex Boost mode, Reflex is configured for maximum latency savings - reducing latency in CPU bound scenarios by further pacing the CPU and increasing GPU clocks. In some cases, these optimizations can mean higher power usage or a slight reduction in FPS. This is especially beneficial in CPU-bound titles such as Fortnite and Valorant, where competitive players are running at hundreds of frames per second.\nThanks to further engineering enhancements, Reflex Boost mode has now been improved in GPU bound scenarios, giving players an extra couple milliseconds of responsiveness.\n  \nSimply download the latest Game Ready Driver and switch on Boost mode under the Reflex option.\nEight New NVIDIA Reflex Compatible Mice\nFor competitive players and professionals, we created the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer, enabling easy, accurate measurement of click-to-photon latency for the very first time. Using GeForce Experience and compatible tech built into Reflex mice and monitors, latency can be measured, players can tweak their setup, then test again to confirm latency is further reduced. When the game is on the line, eliminating any impedance to success is critical.\nPlugging a NVIDIA Reflex-compatible mouse into a G-SYNC monitor with NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer technology yields click-to-display system latency measurement. This is the be all and end all of system latency testing, revealing how long it takes for your mouse click to be transmitted through hardware and software before appearing on-screen in the game.\nUsing any mouse, the Reflex Latency Analyzer can capture PC Latency and Display Latency. But for the most accurate, real-time measurement of mouse latency, we have teamed up with mouse vendors like ROG, AOC, Corsair, MSI, and Razer to dynamically measure per click latency on the fly with the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer.\nToday, eight new mice join the party, giving competitive players and esports professionals 29 esports-ready NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible mice to choose from:\n  \nPick your compatible mouse and monitor, boot up GeForce Experience, load one of the twenty NVIDIA Reflex games, and follow our guide to start testing your latency with the Latency Analyzer. And to help you further reduce system latency, we\u2019ve got another guide that\u2019s well worth checking out.\nFor more NVIDIA Reflex announcements, stay tuned to GeForce.com. There are plenty coming down the pipe.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It's hilariously petit for a workstation graphics card, although one look under the hood and you'll realise it's because this compact card is fairly closely related to the GeForce RTX 3060.I appreciate it doesn't look that small without a point of reference for scale. That's why you really need to watch Richard Kerris, VP of Omniverse development at Nvidia, show it off in this SIGGRAPH announcement.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nIt's so small and cute, and I absolutely love it.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 5090 Founders Edition might be svelte but the Asus ROG Astral cards are absolute chonkers\n\n\n\n\nI reckon the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition is the best looking graphics card I've seen in... well, ever, actually\n\n\n\nYet while it may look like a children's toy, this graphics card is actually only a touch behind an RTX 3060 in its specifications, which isn't a slouch in GPU terms. Here's what's going on inside:CUDA Cores: 3,328Tensor Cores: 104RT Cores: 26Memory: 6 GB GDDR6Memory interface: 192-bitMemory bandwidth: 288 GB/sInterface: PCIe 4.0 x16Total Board Power (TBP): 70WThat's only a touch off the core count of the RTX 3060, although I'd suspect the A2000 to run at significantly slower clock speeds to hit its impressively minute 70W power envelope.The clear distinction between the two is in VRAM. The A2000 comes with just 6GB of GDDR6, which also has ECC, or error-correcting code, due to it being a workstation Quadro card. While the RTX 3060 comes with 12GB of GDDR6, sans ECC.Screen queens(Image credit: Future)Best gaming monitor: pixel-perfect panels for your PC\nBest high refresh rate monitor: screaming quick screens\nBest 4K monitor for gaming: when only high-res will do\nBest 4K TV for gaming: big-screen 4K PC gamingA workstation card with less memory than its gaming counterpart? That feels off, but I'm sure Nvidia has its reasons. Those which definitely go deeper than 'we wanted the RTX 3060 to one up AMD's RX 6600 XT and RX 6700 XT'.

I doubt gamers are quite so thirsty for a low-power graphics card with a compact chassis, but there's a part of me that would love to see a tiny GeForce card ready for a supremely small Mini-ITX build.\u00a0There have been a few compact, or even passive GTX 16-series and 10-series cards over the years, but nothing I'm aware of when it comes to the Ampere generation. Is it about time that changed?The A2000 will be available in October if you are in the market for a new thimble-sized workstation. There's no pricing information available, but I expect it will set you back a fair bit more than the $329 RTX 3060.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is the most powerful graphics card on the market right now, especially in workloads that involve ray tracing, but we've just seen a rumor that an RTX 3090 Super may be on the way.\u00a0According to Wccftech, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Super will reportedly be a graphics card with a whopping 400W TGP (total graphics power), and 10,752 CUDA cores \u2013 compared to the standard card's 10,496 CUDA cores and 350W TGP. The leak comes from Twitter leaker @Greymon55, and we've never seen their leaks, so take this with a giant grain of salt.\u00a03090 Super10752 FP32August 25, 2021We'll show you how to build a gaming PCHere are the best gaming PCsThat's not to mention that the specs seem a little funky. With 10,752 CUDA cores, you're looking at just 2 more Compute Units at 84 than the RTX 3090's 82. That isn't entirely unrealistic, as that's the same exact difference as the RTX 2080 Super had over the original RTX 2080. But when Nvidia launched the RTX 2080 Super, it only increased the power budget by 25W over the Founder's Edition GeForce RTX 2080.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nA possible Nvidia RTX 5090 prototype shows what might have been \u2013 an absolute monster with nearly 25K CUDA cores and an 800W TDP\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 FE rumor claims high-end GPU gets loud - but other reports tell a very different story\n\n\n\nIt's possible that, assuming this graphics card is even real, Nvidia will simply round up the power requirement to 400W, rather than releasing a GPU with a 375W TGP, but we don't know why that would be necessary. Then again, this is still early days, so it's possible that's just what the GPU is requiring now. Who knows.\u00a0Do we really need this?The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is in weird spot right now. When the graphics card came out it was already not really worth the increased price over the RTX 3080, just in terms of a raw performance increase. But, now that we have the RTX 3080 Ti, that performance lead has only shrunk. For the most part, the RTX 3080 Ti will get you nearly the same level of performance in games than the RTX 3090, with maybe a 1-2% difference in frame rate.\u00a0Combine that with the lower retail price \u2013 even though you won't find either graphics card at their retail price \u2013 and the RTX 3090 simply doesn't make sense unless you really need that 24GB of VRAM.\u00a0I still don't know if the RTX 3090 Super is going to be real, but if it is, it's possible that Nvidia would release it to just give the top-end more room to breathe. And, if Nvidia's release schedule with Ampere is anything like what it was with Turing (and it hasn't been so far), the RTX 3090 Super wouldn't be alone.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.When Nvidia launched the RTX 2080 Super, it launched the RTX 2070 Super and the RTX 2060 Super at the same time. If Nvidia does that again, with an RTX 3080 Super and an RTX 3070 Super, the RTX 3090 is going to need something to make it stand out at its exorbitant price point.\u00a0Then again, there's a pretty decent chance that this graphics card will never see the light of day \u2013 Nvidia hasn't even launched a budget Ampere card yet, after all.

These systems are powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier for high-performance, energy-efficient and centralized AI compute.\nThe agreement follows Plus\u2019 announcement of going public via SPAC, or special acquisition company.\nAmazon \u2014 which leads the U.S. e-tail market, counting $386 billion in net revenue in 2020 \u2014 has been investing heavily in autonomous and electric vehicle technology. Last year, it acquired robotaxi company and NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem member Zoox for $1.3 billion.\nThese deals signal the transition to autonomous systems in both personal and commercial transportation at a massive scale.\nAn A-Plus Platform\nThe current generation PlusDrive autonomous trucking platform was developed for level 4 autonomous driving with a human driver still at the wheel, using NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier system-on-a-chip at its core.\nXavier is the first-ever production, automotive-grade SoC for autonomous capabilities. It incorporates six different types of processors, including a CPU, GPU, deep learning accelerator, programmable vision accelerator, image signal processor and stereo/optical flow accelerator.\n\nArchitected for safety, Xavier incorporates the redundancy and diversity necessary for safe autonomous operation.\nThis high-performance compute enables the PlusDrive system to perform surround perception with an array of radar, lidar and camera sensors, running a variety of deep neural networks simultaneously and in real time.\nTrucking Ahead\nPlus\u2019s deal with Amazon is just the beginning of the march toward widespread autonomous delivery.\nThe self-driving company has already announced plans to transition to the next generation of AI compute, NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, beginning in 2022. Plus has received more than 7,000 orders and pre-orders for this upcoming system.\nAdditionally, Amazon has been granted a warrant to buy a 20 percent stake in Plus after they spend more than $150 million, opening up the possibility for even deeper integration of the company\u2019s technology with the e-retailer\u2019s delivery fleet.\nAnd with NVIDIA DRIVE at their core, these autonomous systems will be able to handle the AI processing necessary to deliver safe, efficient and continuously improving trucks at scale.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They founded Greeneye, based in Tel Aviv, in 2017 and now offer AI-driven smart sprayers for farms.\nGreeneye has landed $12 million in funding to date from JVP, Syngenta Group and other investors, including Eyal Waldman, the former CEO of Mellanox Technologies, acquired by NVIDIA in 2020.\nDriven by the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform, Greeneye\u2019s system can detect and precisely squirt weeds in milliseconds, reducing the use of herbicides by as much as 90 percent and helping reduce water and soil contamination along with costs.\n\u201cWe also collect an enormous amount of high-resolution data from the field to provide insights to farmers and other stakeholders,\u201d said Bocher, the company\u2019s CEO.\nThe startup is now working with corn and soybean farmers in the midwest U.S., aiming for wider commercial launch of its services next year.\nGreeneye is a member of NVIDIA Inception, an accelerator program that helps startups in AI and data science with tools, training and technology expertise to get to market faster.\n\nReducing Chemicals Usage\nFarmers typically either spray more or switch to other, often more expensive, herbicides. And the industry practice for decades has been to blanket spray crops. None of this is good for the land, and herbicide costs for farmers have climbed, said Bocher.\nTo address this problem, Greeneye and others are developing AI for precision spraying of herbicides. This new crop of agtech upstarts uses AI to benefit farmers and the environment, and includes companies such as Bilberry, FarmWise, SeeTree, Smart Ag and John Deere-owned Blue River.\nGreeneye\u2019s proprietary dual-sprayer technology enables farmers to precisely target herbicides on individual weeds as well as apply residual herbicides more broadly as needed.\n\u201cGreeneye\u2019s selective spraying system allows us to deliver more herbicide to just the weed, while lowering total herbicides used,\u201d said Janzen.\nGPU-Driven Farming\nTractors outfitted with Greeneye\u2019s AI can detect weeds for treatment at a rate of 40 frames per second while traveling at 13 miles per hour, thanks to the NVIDIA Jetson AI platform.\nThis type of millisecond-speed inference for weed recognition and treatment was achieved by tapping into TensorRT optimization from the NVIDIA JetPack SDK.\n\u201cWeed infestation in a field can be as little as 10 percent, yet we go and spray the entire field,\u201d said Bocher. \u201cSo, fundamentally that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to change as a company.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Inception | Jetson | Metropolis | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s an opportunity for companies to lead.\nAI startup Heartdub seams together fashion and technology to let designers and creators display physical fabrics and garments virtually \u2014 and help clothing companies achieve zero-waste manufacturing.\nThe company\u2019s software digitizes textiles and then simulates how clothes look on the human body. This virtual design verification lessens the amount of physical samples needed, reducing waste from excess fabric, and helps minimize unsold inventory.\nBased in Beijing, Heartdub is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program designed to nurture startups revolutionizing industries with advancements in AI and data sciences. NVIDIA Inception helps startups during critical stages of product development, prototyping and deployment by providing free benefits such as go-to-market support and access to technology expertise.\n\u201cAs a member of NVIDIA Inception, Heartdub hopes to leverage the resources, support and platform provided by NVIDIA to accelerate the implementation and extension of design verification and virtual showrooms,\u201d said Li Ruohao, chief technology officer at Heartdub.\nZipping Up a Solution to Fabric Waste\nSampling fabrics and other materials is a costly, involved process for brand owners. It can slow the distribution of fashion information throughout the supply chain. And finished products may not look or perform the way consumers want, or may arrive too late to meet the latest trends.\nHeartdub offers its customers Heartdub Materials, a physics engine comprising a large set of laboratory-grade textiles data which replicates the physical properties of materials. Inside the application, digitized material behaves as it would in the real world by accounting for texture, weight and movement.\nThe engine can reduce R&D costs by half, marketing costs by 70 percent and lead times by 90 percent for fabric manufacturers and brand owners, according to Li.\nBy verifying designs at near zero cost, Heartdub Materials can produce digital, ready-to-wear garments based on clothing patterns.

This flexible approach, combined with the high performance of NVIDIA DRIVE, leads to an easily scalable solution for safer, more efficient delivery and logistics.\nThe EUI is purpose-built to run Embark Driver autonomous driving software for a comprehensive self-driving trucking system.\nMost trucking carriers don\u2019t just use one model of vehicle in their fleets. This variety can even extend to vehicles from different manufacturers to haul a wide range of cargo around the world.\nThe Embark platform will be capable of integrating into trucks from any of the four major truck manufacturers in the U.S. \u2014 PACCAR, Volvo, International and Freightliner. By developing a platform that can be retrofitted to such a wide range of vehicles, Embark is helping the trucking industry realize the benefits of AI-powered driving without having to wait for purpose-built vehicles.\nAnd with NVIDIA DRIVE at its core, the platform leverages the best in high-performance AI compute for robust self-driving capabilities.\nScaling Safety\nAutonomous vehicles are always learning, taking in vast amounts of data to navigate the unpredictability of the real world, from highways to crowded ports. This rapid processing requires centralized, high-performance AI compute.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE platform is the first scalable AI hardware and software platform to enable the production of automated and self-driving vehicles. It combines deep learning, sensor fusion and surround vision for a safe driving experience.\nThis end-to-end open platform allows for one development investment across an entire fleet, from level 2+ systems all the way to level 5 fully autonomous vehicles. In addition to high-performance, scalable compute, the EUI will have all the necessary functional safety certification to operate without a driver on public roads.\n\u201cWe need an enormous amount of compute horsepower in our trucks,\u201d said Ajith Dasari, head of Hardware Platform at Embark. \u201cNVIDIA DRIVE meets this need head-on, and allows us to outfit our partners and customers with the best self-driving hardware and software currently on the market.\u201d\nA Growing Ecosystem\nEmbark is already working with leading trucking companies and plans to continue to extend its software and hardware technology.\nIn April, the company unveiled partnerships with Werner Enterprises, Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport. It\u2019s also working with shippers including Anheuser Busch InBev and HP, Inc.\nEmbark plans to list on the public market, announcing a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, agreement in June, as well as a partnership with Knight-Swift Transportation. The autonomous trucking company will join the ranks of NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem members who have collectively raised more than $8 billion via public listings.\nAnd just like the trucks running on its Embark Universal Interface, the company is tapping the power of NVIDIA DRIVE to keep traveling further and more intelligently.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Over the last five years, photogrammetry \u2014 the use of photographs to create fully textured 3D models \u2014 has become increasingly popular in archaeology. Dabal has been expanding her skills in this area to create and render high-quality models of artifacts and sites.\nWith the help of her partner, Simon Kotowicz, Dabal is taking photogrammetry scans to the next level with a pair of NVIDIA graphics technologies.\nUsing NVIDIA RTX GPUs, Dabal can accelerate workflows to create and interact with 3D models, from recreating missing elements to adding animations or dropping them into VR. And with the NVIDIA Omniverse real-time collaboration and simulation platform, she can build stunning scenes around her projects using the platform\u2019s library of existing assets.\nAll for the (Photo)Gram\nDabal quickly learned that good photogrammetry requires a good dataset. It\u2019s important to take photos in the right pattern, so that every area of the site, monument or artifact is covered.\nOnce she has all the images she needs, Dabal builds the 3D models using Agisoft Metashape, a tool for photogrammetry pipelines. Dabal loads all her photos into the application, and the software turns that data into a point cloud, which is a rough collection of dots that represent the 3D model.\nRecently, Dabal and Kotowicz were approached by The Flow State XR, a company that delivers immersive experiences and applications. They were tasked with a new photogrammetry project that rocked their world: creating a 3D model of The Crobar, an iconic, heavy-metal bar located in the heart of Soho in London.\nThe Flow State XR sent images of The Crobar to the duo, who used the photos to model the bar from scratch, then created texture maps using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Substance Painter. Dabal and Kotowicz are currently finishing the 3D model, but once the project is complete, The Flow State XR plans to use it as an interactive mobile app and a VR hangout for music fans.\nThe Crobar VR scene. Image courtesy of Dabal.\nRTX Shapes 3D Modeling Workflows\nDabal uses an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 GPU to significantly speed up her 3D modeling and rendering workflows. Processing a sparse cloud model with her older generation GPU would take two days, she said. With the upgraded RTX card, a similar point cloud takes only 10 hours.\nWith NVIDIA RTX, the millions of points on a model can be rotated and zoomed much more easily. The team can also use their 4K monitor to view the models, which they couldn\u2019t do previously because it was difficult to navigate around the point clouds.\nDabal and Kotowicz have also experienced faster performance in creative apps like Autodesk\u00a0 3ds Max. They can iterate quicker and see textures in graphics without needing to render as often.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA RTX card has helped us achieve the model we need much faster,\u201d said Dabal. \u201cWe\u2019re spending less time in front of the workstation, and we\u2019re getting to the rendering stage a lot quicker now.\u201d\nTextured 3D model of the Neath Abbey Ironworks. Image courtesy of Dabal.\nOmniverse Makes Space for Sharing Assets, Building Scenes\u00a0\nDabal got the chance to use the advanced features of NVIDIA Omniverse when she entered the first \u201cCreate With Marbles\u201d design competition. After exploring the platform, Dabal sees great potential in how it will transform traditional workflows and images in archaeology.\nDabal\u2019s submission for the NVIDIA Omniverse \u201cCreate With Marbles\u201d design competition.\nCurrently, there isn\u2019t a tool that enables archaeologists to quickly upload assets in one place, and share or collaborate with others on the same projects.\nWith an open platform like Omniverse, archaeologists have a virtual space where they can easily upload photogrammetry artifacts and share assets with one another, no matter what location they\u2019re working from. Or they could place models in Omniverse and create a stunning scene by adding extra elements, like trees or farm fields.\n\u201cRight now, most archaeological 3D models look fake, floating in their black backgrounds. It would take too much time to add the extras, but it would be so easy in Omniverse,\u201d said Dabal. \u201cWhen I was in Omniverse, I really enjoyed taking premade objects and moving them around to create a scene. It was super easy.\u201d\nDabal says that if archeologists had access to a library of extra assets, as well as all their own photogrammetry scans, \u201cit would be game-changing.\u201d\nWith Omniverse, archaeologists can share their projects with others around the world as well as simulate fire or weather conditions to bring their 3D models and sites to life.\nExplore more of Dabal\u2019s work, and learn more about NVIDIA RTX and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nAnd join NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH, where we\u2019ll showcase the technologies driving the future of graphics. We\u2019ll announce the winners of the latest \u201cCreate With Marbles: Marvelous Machines\u201d contest winner, and premiere a documentary highlighting how Omniverse was used to create the NVIDIA GTC 2021 keynote.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Meet the Omnivore | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Researchers and students working in fields from basic science to liberal arts can\u2019t wait to log on.\n\u201cThey would like to use it right now,\u201d said James Wilgenbusch, director of research computing at the University of Minnesota, speaking of Agate, an accelerated supercomputer Hewlett Packard Enterprise is building.\nIt\u2019s one of at least eight new academic systems lighting up around the world \u2014 four in America\u2019s heartland and two in the U.K.\nBefore the semester\u2019s end, Agate will deliver seven petaflops of umph. It will crunch through \u201cresearch from socio-economic trends to celestial objects \u2014 it really will serve the full gamut,\u201d he said of the system to be housed at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) that will link 265 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on an NVIDIA HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand network.\nAgate will serve about 4,500 users, working under a thousand principal investigators who since January have already run a whopping 138,612 GPU-accelerated jobs on MSI\u2019s existing systems.\nGetting fired up: The Agate supercomputer in Chippewa Falls undergoes burn-in testing. (Picture courtesy HPE)\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing annual user growth, the greatest amount of it in life sciences and liberal arts \u2014 fields like geology, history, poli-sci, marketing \u2014 anywhere people have vast quantities of unstructured data and they\u2019re attempting to make sense of it,\u201d he said.\nAI Supercomputer Helps Fight COVID\nDemonstrating the power of accelerated computing, the Minnesota Department of Health reserved a portion of MSI\u2019s system in its fight against COVID-19. It\u2019s sequencing genomes for contract tracing and to track variants of the coronavirus.\n\u201cCollaborations like this make the role of universities in innovation and life saving more obvious to the public,\u201d said Wilgenbusch, pointing to articles in a Minneapolis newspaper.\nVirtual GPUs Power Indiana Classrooms\nSome 600 miles southeast, Indiana University (IU) is standing up two AI supercomputers packing a total of 616 A100 GPUs.\nBig Red 200, built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, will serve the nine IU campuses. Jetstream-2, built by Dell Technologies, will power work at several partner institutions from Cornell to the University of Hawaii.\nTapping the A100\u2019s ability to offer fractions of a processor, Jetstream-2 will host classes with hundreds of students, each using a slice of a GPU\u2019s performance to learn popular AI skills like image classification. One IU researcher presented a paper last November benchmarking the virtual GPU capability.\n\u201cNow whole classrooms can be trained in one go, so more people get access,\u201d said Winona Snapp-Childs, chief operating officer of IU\u2019s Pervasive Technology Institute and leader of an AI-for-everyone initiative.\nA Vision of Ubiquitous AI\nMore than 2,500 students use IU\u2019s current GPU-accelerated systems. They ran more than 40 percent of the work for the university\u2019s record $1 billion of research contracts and grants spread across 178 departments last year.\n\u201cFunding agencies realize the importance of machine learning in academic fields across the spectrum,\u201d said Snapp-Childs.\n\u201cAI and accelerated computing help push the boundaries of science, and I can imagine they will come to handle half of our research over the next 5 to 10 years as these techniques become ubiquitous and imperative for research,\u201d she added.\nThe work spans a spectrum that can set your head spinning. Researchers are tapping AI for everything from tracking down COVID misinformation on social networks to studying the genome of rice to improve harvests.\nDelta Pioneers Accessible Supercomputing\nNext door, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is expanding use of accelerated computing with Delta, an AI supercomputer packing more than 800 A100 GPUs.\n\u201cWe will help emerging research areas such as computational archaeology and digital agriculture take advantage of new computing methods and hardware while making advanced systems more usable and accessible to a broad community of researchers,\u201d said William Gropp, a principal investigator and NCSA director who oversees Delta.\nThe system is one way the National Science Foundation is spreading GPU-based computing as a common tool for accelerating research. The work includes an initiative to make Delta and future systems more accessible to people with disabilities.\nFlorida Spreads the AI Sunshine\nA thousand miles south, the University of Florida\u2019s HiPerGator AI system provides another shining example of accelerated computing.\nIn a recent article in the Gainesville Sun, provost Joe Glover said the system will spread AI skills much like Henry Ford\u2019s first assembly line made cars affordable for Americans. The university aims to add 100 AI-focused faculty to make machine learning ubiquitous across its curriculum with a stated goal of creating 30,000 AI-enabled graduates by 2030.\nHiPerGator AI linked a whopping 1,120 A100 GPUs on a HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand network to take the No. 22 spot in the latest TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers. It was built in just a few weeks thanks to its use of the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD reference architecture, a recipe for stacking NVIDIA DGX systems in Lego-like style.\nStudying Abroad: AI Supercomputing\u2019s Far Reach\nThese five AI supercomputers represent just a few peaks in a rising range that crisscrosses the U.S. and Europe.\n\nOn the UC Berkeley campus, researchers just turned on Perlmutter, the world\u2019s fifth fastest system, packing 6,144 A100 GPUs.\nThe University of Cambridge debuted CSD3, a cloud-native supercomputer built on Dell EMC PowerEdge, which is now the fastest academic system in the U.K. and hit No. 3 on the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient systems.\nThe University of Edinburgh is building a system with 448 A100 GPUs, the latest in the four-system network run by the DiRAC research group in the U.K.\nAnd Link\u00f6ping University is now home to Sweden\u2019s largest supercomputer, BerzeLiUs, which will serve a national AI initiative and be shared with researchers at Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technical University.\n\nThey are among high-performance systems sprinkled around the world, advancing science with machine learning and accelerated computing.\nPhoto at top: From left, Winona Snapp-Childs and Sheri Sanders, Director of the National Center for Genome Analysis Support, give students Christine Campbell and Lyric Cooper a tour of the Jetstream data center at Indiana University.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Networking | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Customer Stories | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Stories about the groundbreaking technology used in industries ranging from healthcare to agriculture, as well as the people making that technology possible. Throw in punny headlines, blogs filled with wordplay and a host of company-sponsored social activities, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to intern on the corporate communications team here.\nNVIDIA welcomed 1,200+ interns this year, from 20 countries and more than 300 colleges and universities, working in teams ranging from autonomous vehicles to marketing. Despite remote work, I\u2019ve had the chance to connect with fellow interns, as well as other NVIDIANs, sharing their stories internally and externally.\nDespite us all being remote, there was plenty of work and plenty of fun \u2014 through paint parties, volunteer events, a book club and more activities, interns have been able to break up their work days by connecting with one another. They also have fun NVIDIA swag to show for their time here; standouts include a snazzy backpack and an NVIDIA SHIELD TV.\nAs the summer comes to a close, here are a few interns who spent their time at NVIDIA:\nJolly Jots Down Data\nShailza Jolly is finishing up her Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Kaiserslautern, in Germany.\nShe\u2019s on NVIDIA\u2019s learning and perception research team, where she works on customer-oriented projects, extracting information from financial documents.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a very first-hand experience in being part of an industrial collaboration where we work with real customers and have a chance to hear their expectations and work with them,\u201d she said.\nCai Calls for Enterprise Influencers\nBesides making gaming videos on \u201cCoolMark\u201d or sharing weekly recaps on \u201cThis Week in Esports/Gaming,\u201d Mark Cai works with enterprise influencers on NVIDIA\u2019s Public Relations team.\nHe\u2019s entering his last year at Arizona State University, where he studies marketing and computer information systems.\nCai works on discovering new influencers for enterprise vertical markets, such as retail and telecoms, to collaborate with them and integrate NVIDIA launches and announcements into their content.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to work with influencers to get our news out to a wider audience. Being their point of contact and helping them every step of the way is very rewarding,\u201d he said.\nAs if his summer wasn\u2019t great enough, Cai managed to fulfill a prophecy he made before joining the company \u2014 snagging a GeForce RTX 3090.\nYulin Talks the Talk (and Walks the Walk)\nYulin Li is starting her third year at the University of California, Berkeley, studying computer science and cognitive science.\nAs a\u00a0 software engineering intern, she is working on natural language processing and using contextual understanding to validate user input and extend conversations with chatbots.\nWorking out of the NVIDIA campus in Shanghai, Yulin is one of the few interns this summer going into the office and getting to meet her coworkers in person.\n\u201cMy team and I get lunch together every day, and then we take a walk around the campus to talk and get to know each other a bit more. They have been so patient and welcoming over these past two months, and I\u2019m so grateful for this experience,\u201d she said.\nKokin Can Support Our Tech Needs\nAnastasia Kokin is a fourth-year software support engineering student at ORT Braude College, in Karmiel, Israel.\nShe works on NVIDIA\u2019s technical support team, helping customers with networking products and new releases like the Omniverse platform and Fleet Command.\nWhat Kokin likes the most about interning at the company is how there\u2019s always something new to learn.\n\u201cI learn new things on a daily basis. Every month, we have new technologies that we need to know the ins and outs of. There\u2019s always something new coming up that we need to learn,\u201d Kokin said.\nAgarwal Analyzes New Features\n\nManish Agarwal is in his final year of undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, studying electronics and communication engineering.\nAgarwal is an ASIC intern on the GPU context switch team. He focuses on testing new features, ensuring all test points are covered, then compiling that data to help improve future projects.\nHis advice for future interns is to get to know as many people on your team as possible, including your mentors and other interns.\n\u201cContact your mentors as frequently as you can, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. They are more than happy to give you advice, even on basic tasks,\u201d he said.\nWant to join in on the fun? Learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s internship program.

But despite its early success, certain controversies surrounding how the streaming service conducted business with developers is still holding it back from maybe realising its full potential.Since the PC beta launch in 2018, several game developers have decided to retract support for GeForce Now, with Capcom, Bethesda, Hinterland and Activision Blizzard among those that pulled (at least some games) out. These U-turns followed what were referred to by Nvidia at the time as \"misunderstandings.\" So, I submitted some questions to Nvidia about GeForce Now, with a mind to clear up what exactly that meant.\u00a0When I asked about the situation, and why game developers had backed out, senior product manager of GeForce Now, Andrew Fear, had this to say:\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia announces dedicated GeForce Now app for Steam Decks and more, streamlining cloud gaming for mixed-reality headset wearers too\n\n\n\n\nI tried out GeForce Now's expanded mod support for Baldur's Gate 3, and it's nothing but a good thing for the future of the game\n\n\n\n\"There were a few publishers who wanted to try GeForce Now during our free beta period, and then wanted more time to figure out their cloud strategy once we started charging. Many have rejoined GeForce Now already, and we expect more to rejoin in the coming months and years based on feedback from their users.\"Race on(Image credit: Future)Best PC racing wheels : perfect for any circuit.\nBest VR headset: which set is right for trackdays?What this highlights is Nvidia's confidence that business will pick up in the near future. In fact, Fear made it very clear that Nvidia's good relationship with developers and publishers had \"not at all\" been harmed by previous incidents.\u00a0\"We have continued discussions with them about Geforce Now,\" he says, \"and for most it is a question of when, not if, they will join GeForce Now.\"The user count for GeForce Now recently passed 10 million, with new users being added \"every month, at a fairly consistent rate,\" Fear tells me. So it would seem a bright future is ahead for the game streaming service. But it's still unclear as to whether these users will stick with the service if their favourite game is notably missing.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Here's hoping these publishers make an about turn and come on board, because there's no way I'm paying over a grand for a fancy new GPU just to play the next big AAA release.\n\n\nKatie WickensSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterScrew sports, Katie would rather watch Intel, AMD and Nvidia go at it.

In other words, lots of tomatoes.\nGrowing them requires more than soil, water and sunlight. The plants are self-pollinating, but they need a little help getting the pollen to drop onto the female organ of the flower and trigger the process.\nTypically, this is the job of bumblebees, which knock the pollen loose with the vibrations created by their beating flight muscles.\nThat, however, could change thanks to Israel-based startup Arugga. The company builds AI-powered robots that use computer vision to determine which flowers are ready for pollination and then blast air pulses at them to mimic the action of bumblebees and initiate pollination.\nArugga\u2019s new commercial robot will ship later this year.\nThe performance of the bots is on par with the bumblebees and in some cases better by up to 5 percent, with the potential to perform other tasks and to collect and analyze data along the way.\nCompeting With Manufactured Bumblebees\nLest it sound like Arugga might throw off nature\u2019s delicate balance, company execs stress that its bots don\u2019t supplant the wild bumblebees buzzing about our gardens.\n\u201cThe bees we\u2019re replacing are actually manufactured,\u201d said Eytan Heller, co-founder and vice president of business development at Arugga. \u201cThey\u2019re grown in labs, packed in hives and shipped with 100 individuals inside. Growers spread the hives around their greenhouses and let the bees do their work.\u201d\nIn other words, rather than muscling in on a species, Arugga says it is reducing the need for unnatural bumblebee production. Instead of hives of mass-produced bees, Arugga envisions growers purchasing fleets of dependable robots.\nArugga also seeks to work in countries where importing of bumblebees isn\u2019t allowed. In Australia, for example, the pollination process is handled by manual labor. In that case, Heller said Arugga\u2019s robots have demonstrated yield improvements of up to 20 percent, without sacrificing quality.\nRiding on tracks between rows of plants, the robots capture images of every flower, and then run Arugga\u2019s AI algorithms to instantly determine each flower\u2019s readiness to be pollinated. Heller said Arugga currently can ensure pollination of one hectare (about 2.5 acres) with 3.5 robots. Next year, it expects an improved algorithm to reduce that to 2.5, and he believes 1 robot per hectare isn\u2019t far off.\nBeyond making pollination more efficient, Heller said Arugga\u2019s robots can help growers avoid many issues that arise with bumblebee pollination. For instance, bees can\u2019t work in extreme heat, they can transmit viruses between flowers and they can\u2019t be monitored for precise measurement of their success.\n\u201cWith our solution, you can monitor and see improvement over time,\u201d said Heller. \u201cThe idea is to increase yield within the same space. It\u2019s a big benefit for growers.\u201d\nTo get that benefit, growers lease Arugga\u2019s robots, paying a monthly fee for each hectare of coverage.\nArugga prototype on trial in U.S. greenhouse.\nArugga only recently launched its tomato pollination robot commercially, working with Australian vegetable grower Costa Group to pollinate the first 10 hectares of its tomato operation. It has also wrapped up a successful trial with a large U.S. grower, with more trials in the pipeline.\nNVIDIA Tech for Smarter Applications\nArugga uses the NVIDIA Metropolis platform to develop and deploy its computer vision system. Arugga trains on its own custom dataset, using NVIDIA\u2019s pretrained model YoloV4 with NVIDIA TAO toolkit. It processes raw video from greenhouses with the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, outsources annotation, and then prepares the training dataset from the annotated imagery.\nEach month, the company adds new batches of annotated data to its dataset, and then retrains the model and benchmarks it against previous models. This results in gradual pruning of the model, which is then exported to the robots using TensorRT.\nBuilt upon off-the-shelf carts, Arugga\u2019s robots use NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX modules, which enable algorithms to run at the edge, allowing the AI magic to occur within the robots themselves.\n\u201cI find it very hard to imagine how we could have achieved the same performance without using NVIDIA technologies,\u201d said Ori Shalev, software manager at Arugga. \u201cIt\u2019s about being part of the NVIDIA Metropolis partner program and getting early access to NVIDIA SDKs to further enhance and accelerate our AI development efforts. This relationship is super important.\u201d\nNext on the Menu: A Fuller Plate\nGoing forward, Heller envisions adding more AI modules to its robots, empowering them to take on additional tasks. For instance, Heller sees no reason Arugga\u2019s robots can\u2019t detect pests and diseases, treat plants that are showing signs of distress, or apply beneficial solutions to spur plant health.\n\u201cWe see our solution as a platform to eventually multitask for the grower, a bit like having a Swiss army knife,\u201d said Heller.\nHe also said Arugga could treat other plants that require similar types of pollination, such as blueberries. Beyond that, there\u2019ll be opportunities he can\u2019t predict.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be working in this field,\u201d said Heller. \u201cAgriculture in general kind of lags behind other industries in terms of robotics and the ability to do things in a more efficient way.\u201d\nThat said, the company\u2019s braintrust is being careful not to get ahead of itself, keeping Arugga\u2019s focus squarely on the rollout of its first product.\nSaid Heller: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty on our plate with tomatoes.\u201d\n\nImage credits: Arugga AI Farming Ltd.

Nvidia   Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stood in his kitchen and delivered a press conference for the company's latest technology. But although one particular part of the keynote looked identical to the rest, it was very different: The kitchen,\u00a0the CEO and even his leather jacket were entirely computer generated.Like many companies, Nvidia has switched to online \"virtual\" press conferences during the coronavirus pandemic. Huang has broadcast several announcements from his kitchen, which meant no one saw anything different in April's GTC keynote presentation discussing the Nvidia Omniverse system. Nvidia explained how the CG segment was created in a blog post Wednesday as the company also presented to computer graphics conference Siggraph 2021.\u00a0But Nvidia was showing, not telling. Known for its graphics cards, the company used the keynote event to show off its Omniverse tools for creating 3D virtual worlds. Engineers did a full face and body scan of the CEO to create a 3D model of Huang, then programmed it to mimic his gestures and expressions. This CG clone delivered part of the keynote speech, seamlessly transitioning from the real thing.Here's the video explaining how it was done -- see if you can tell the difference:Correction, 12:06 p.m. PT: An earlier version of this story reported that the entire keynote was presented by a digital double. Nvidia has updated its blog post to clarify that the CG version was only on screen for 14 seconds: \"Jensen Huang NVIDIA's CEO spoke, live, to slides and cinematics that were fully rendered in Omniverse. Jensen Huang was only virtual when he revealed DGX, and, briefly, during the transition to that moment; in all from 1:02:29 to 1:02:56 in the video.\"\n    New Movies Coming in 2023 From Marvel, Netflix, DC and More\n         \n        +44 More\n       See all photos      \n    Gaming Guides\n   \n      Virtual Reality Gaming\n     \n  \n          Best VR Headsets\n        \n          Best Meta Quest 2 Games and Experiences\n        \n          Best VR Games\n        \n          Best Playstation VR 2 Deals\n        \n          Meta Quest 2 Review\n        \n      PlayStation\n     \n  \n          PS5 Restock Tracker\n        \n          Playstation Plus Review\n        \n          Best PS5 Games\n        \n      Xbox\n     \n  \n          Best Xbox Series X S Controller\n        \n          Xbox GamePass Ultimate Review\n        \n      Other Gaming\n     \n  \n          Best Nintendo Switch Controller\n        \n          Best Cloud Gaming Services\n        \n          Best Gaming Chair\n        \n          Nintendo Switch OLED Review\n        \n          Best Gaming Keyboard\n        \n      Video Games\n     \n  \n          Best Online Games to Play with Friends\n        \n          Video Game Deals\n        \n          Best VR Games\n        \n          Best Xbox Series X Games\n        \n          Best PS5 Games\n                          Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

NVIDIA hopes for that to change soon but given the current pricing and supply situation, that does not seem likely.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostIn addition, we expect sequential growth in each of our three other market platforms. Gaming demand is continuing to exceed supply as we expect channel inventories to remain below target levels as we exit Q3.\nRTX's demand is quite incredible, and as you know, [Indiscernible] architecture called GTX is based on programmable shelters than the adventuresome years ago. And now we reset the entire installed house and Ampere is off to just the incredible starting the best-selling GPU architecture in the history of our company. And yet, we've only upgraded some 20% -- less than 20% of our total installed base.\nMeanwhile, we have and are securing pretty significant long-term supply commitments as we expand into all these different markets initiatives that we\u2019ve set ourselves up for. And so I think \u2014 I would expect that we will see a supply contained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment.\nNVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang via Seeking Alpha\nThe main issue Jensen states are that they are obviously facing a severe GPU supply constraint despite Ampere being NVIDIA's fastest architecture ramp. In the recent earnings report, NVIDIA stated that 80% of its GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards shipments went to gamers in Q2 '21 which means that their LHR lineup did indeed work out for them. We also saw the crypto bubble pop up which led to several retailers readjusting their prices and bringing Ampere and the rest of the GPU lineup close to their MSRP though recently, Crypto has made a rebound and an update on NBMiner has prompted miners to get slightly better hash rate even on their LHR series graphics cards.\n\nThis means that miners could still see LHR as an attractive investment opportunity if they can't find any other graphics cards for mining usage. And while availability gets better, we can't take out the huge demand for these GPUs for gamers despite the higher prices. Gamers are currently gobbling up whatever GPU they can find at whatever price they are getting them at. A lot of users refrained to get an RTX 20 series card due to smaller gen-over-gen performance improvements whereas the Ampere RTX 30 series brings a bigger upgrade over GTX 10 series and making more users want to upgrade their older GPUs and PCs.\nIf Jensen's predictions come true, then we might as well see a similar situation with the next-gen graphics cards from NVIDIA too. Do remember that Jensen was first to state the shortages to last till the end of 2021 but it could get worse if the CEO believes that graphics card availability & GPU shortages will persist throughout next year.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n114\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n95\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n30\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1480\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1157\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorAug 09, 2021, 08:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Close-up of sign with logo at Silicon Valley headquarters of technology company Synopsys, Mountain ... [+] View, California, May 3, 2019. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)Getty Images\nSynopsys created a buzz in 2020, and now Google, NVIDIA, and Cadence Design have joined the party. What lies ahead?\n\nIntroduction\n\nDesigning modern semiconductors can take years and scores of engineers armed with state-of-the-art EDA design tools. But the semiconductor landscape and the world around us is being revolutionized by hundreds of new chips, primarily driven by AI. Some entrepreneurial thought leaders believe that the expensive and lengthy chip design process could shrink from 2-3 years to 2-3 months if hardware development was to become more agile, more autonomous. And chief among a new breed of agile design tools is AI itself.\n\nThe Semiconductor Design Landscape\nThis discussion began in earnest when the EDA leader Synopsys announced DSO.ai, Design Space Optimization AI, an software product that could more autonomously identify optimal ways to arrange silicon components (layouts) on a chip to reduce the area and reduce power consumption, even while increasing performance. Using reinforcement learning, DSO.ai could evaluate billions of alternatives against design goals, and produce a design that was significantly better than that produced by talented engineers. The size of the problem/solution space DSO.ai addresses is staggering: there are something like 1090,000 possible ways to place components on a chip.\u00a0That compares to 10360 possible moves in the game of Go which was mastered by Google AI in 2016. Since reinforcement learning can play Go better than the world champion, one could conceivably design a better chip if one is willing to spend the compute time to do it. Results are quite impressive, realizing 18% faster operating frequency at 21% lower power, while reducing engineering time from six months to as little as one.\n\n\nRecently Google published results of doing something similar, as has NVIDIA. And Cadence Design Systems just announced an AI-based optimization platform similar to Synopsys DSO.ai. Before we take a look at these efforts, lets back up a little and look at the entire semiconductor design space. A good place to start is the Gajski-Kuhn Chart that outlines all the steps of chip design along three axes: the Behavioral level where architects defines what the chip is supposed to do, the Structural level where they determine how the chip is organized, and the Geometry level where engineers define how the chip is laid out.\nAll semiconductor design teams work along three axes of specification: what do you want the chip to ... [+] do, how will it do it, and how will you build it. Each step feeds the next step in a spiral.Synopsys\n\nBased on this model, each step towards the center (which is when the team \u201ctapes out\u201d the chip to the fabrication partner) feeds the work in the next phase in a clockwise direction. To date, all the application of AI has been in the geometry space, or physical design, to address the waning of Moore\u2019s Law.\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nSynopsys DSO.ai\nAs I covered at launch, Synopsys DSO.ai was the first entrant to apply AI to the physical design process, producing floor plans that consumed lower power, ran at higher frequencies, and occupied less space than the best an experienced design could produce. What really attracted my attention was the profound effect of AI on productivity; DSO.ai users were able to achieve in a few days what it used to take teams of experts, many weeks.\n\n\nGoogle Research and NVIDIA Research\nBoth companies have produced research papers that describe the use of reinforcement learning to assist in the physical design of the floor plan. In Google\u2019s case, AI is being used to lay out the floor plan of the next generation TPU Chip and the company is investigating additional uses of AI such as in architectural optimization.\nNVIDIA similarly has focused on that same low-hanging fruit: floorplanning, and with all the compute capacity they have in-house, I\u2019d expect NVDIA to continue to eat their own dogfood and use AI to design better AI chips.\nSimilarly, NVIDIA has used the company's GPUs to optimize floor planning for a future GPU chip.NVIDIA\nCadence Design Systems Enters the Market\nCadence has recently launched their \u201cintelligent chip explorer\u201d called Cerebrus to optimize the physical design process with reinforcement learning. Not to be confused with the Wafer Scale Engine AI maker \u201cCerebras\u201d, the newly announced platform looks similar in capability to the DSO.ai that Synopsys launched in March 2020, focusing on physical design. While Google and NVIDIA may have sufficient resources and skills to develop their own AI for design optimization, the majority of semiconductor companies and projects will select a tool from an EDA vendor. Cadence\u2019s entrance seems to solidify the reinforcement learning technique as the next big shift in design methodology. We believe AI will become pervasive as designers become more comfortable with letting the machine determine the layout, and competitive pressures mount.\nConclusions and Outlook\nThe excellent research being conducted at NVIDIA and Google will reinforce the message to designers that they should rapidly consider AI-led optimization to improve performance, cost, and energy consumption. NVIDIA and Google are undoubtably focusing this effort to produce better GPU\u2019s and Cloud TPU platforms to enhance their competitive position.\u00a0We think rumors to the effect that these companies might enter the EDA tools market are off base: \u00a0the AI optimization is a tool they use to help improve their own products and services.\nCadence Design System\u2019s entry has validated the approach as well, and the industry momentum will now accelerate. However, Cadence is just beginning the journey, while Synopsys enjoys the pole position, with at least a full year head start.\nNow the question becomes, what about \u201cThe Rest of the Story\u201d? Using AI in physical design is great, but in our view, it is only the beginning, representing perhaps only 10% of the opportunity. There are rich fields to harvest along the Behavior and Structure axes, which will create a spiral of optimization across the design workflow. We look forward to hearing what Synopsys co-CEO Aart de Geus has to say on this topic when he presents the Keynote speech at the upcoming HotChips conference on August 23.\u00a0\nStay tuned!\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Fortunately, no one was injured.\nDuos Technologies, based in Jacksonville, Fla., says its NVIDIA GPU-accelerated AI railcar inspection system can significantly reduce the likelihood of such derailments due to mechanical railcar defects as well as improve safety and reduce dwell time, all while speeding up inspections by orders of magnitude.\nDerailments like the one in Gibbons are a reminder of the importance and financial value of routine and timely inspections of railcars, during which defects can be spotted and repaired. According to the U.S. Federal Rail Administration, more than 5,000 railway workers are injured annually, and accidents cost the industry more than $2 billion a year.\nFor longer trains with human inspectors, this process can take hours. However, as quickly as it takes a human to inspect a single car, Duos Technologies\u2019 AI-powered inspection portals can accurately inspect and assess trains moving at full speed with as many as 120 cars or more. Better yet, railcars don\u2019t have to be offline when Duos\u2019 portals inspect them \u2013 it happens as they\u2019re in transit on regular routes.\nThe Duos Railcar Inspection Portal, which looks like a small hangar built over the tracks, includes a miniature data center packed with servers that store and process image data, complete with an AI processing farm. As many as 10 servers, each loaded with 48 NVIDIA T4 GPUs, run Duos\u2019 AI algorithms, which are designed to detect everything from low-hanging air hoses to open doors and dragging equipment. The system, called rip, can even detect illegal riders.\nDepending upon rail traffic at a particular site, those servers process approximately 1.3TB of data every day from cameras that capture imagery from all angles. Duos is already upgrading some of its 10 operational portals with up to 25 additional perspectives at each location, including eight positioned under the train tracks and one 4K camera mounted 37 feet above the passing trains.\nThe company has even invented its own LED lighting system, which generates 4x the illumination of the sun, to provide sufficient lighting in all situations.\nPushing Technology at the Edge\nTo compensate for a lack of high-speed trackside connectivity, all of the computing in Duos\u2019 portals occurs at the edge while the company tries to squeeze every capability out of its hardware. Plus, its deployments have to operate in all sorts of conditions, from Canadian locales where temperatures can average as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit for months, to the heat, sand and dirt of the Mexican desert.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to push the edge of technologies that exist today,\u201d said Scott Carns, chief commercial officer at Duos.\nDuos adopted the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework to meet its desire for the latest AI-powered video analytics capabilities at the edge.\n\u201cTo use AI to analyze a fleet of railcars that can be 40 to 50 years old in some cases, where every car you see is slightly different, and have it accurately detect that defect on that old tank car \u2015 to me, that\u2019s highly challenging,\u201d said Carns. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the team stays plugged into events at NVIDIA and leverages that partnership.\u201d\n\nFrom Video Analytics to AI\nDuos first established itself in the early 2000s, after 9/11, by applying early-generation video analytics to secure railyards and critical infrastructure assets in various railroads. In the mid-2000s, it developed its first portals, predominantly for security and contraband inspections, which then proved popular with train operators seeking to supplement their inspection efforts.\nWith over 140,000 miles of rail lines in the U.S. alone, Duos was suddenly eyeing a larger opportunity and shifted its emphasis to building mechanical inspection portals.\nOver the past several years, the analytics have steadily evolved from digital conversion of analog camera output into a full AI undertaking. Duos uses NVIDIA GPUs to build algorithms and train railcar inspection use case datasets.\nShaping the Market\nDuos works with many of the Class I freight railroads and several of the transit agencies that operate rail infrastructure in North America. These customers purchase the portals, and Duos charges an annual licensing fee for each AI module or \u201cuse case\u201d that handles a specific task. For instance, a customer can license an algorithm that\u2019s built to spot missing bolts on a coupler plate.\nAnother key point is the additional safety this brings to railcar inspection. No longer do personnel have to crawl underneath and around railcars to inspect with flashlights and chalk. Additionally, by conducting automated, AI-based inspections, a much safer railcar is running along the tracks.\nThe impact of Duos\u2019 technology is measured by its customers\u2019 improved velocity. It\u2019s simple math: an increase of just one mile per hour in average velocity can translate to millions of dollars in profitability.\nDown the line, Duos has its eyes on expansion into Europe and the international market. Additionally, the company has started helping intermodal and distribution centers automate their gatehouse operations with AI-based inspections and mobility software, replacing the age-old model of a guy with a clipboard checking things in and out.\nBut where Duos is most focused now is on working with the U.S. Federal Rail Administration, Transport Canada and the various Class I railroads on allowing its technology to augment the traditional manual railcar inspection, which is still required by law.\nThe idea, Carns said, is not to replace humans, but to enable rail operators to reallocate them to speed up repairs. Having its AI technology sanctioned and legislated by government regulators for day-to-day use could change how railroads operate forever.\nImages courtesy of Duos Technologies.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Metropolis | Smart Spaces | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Creative Technology is tackling 4K and 8K signals, as well as new broadcast workflows, with the latest NVIDIA networking technologies.\nThe London-based firm is one of the world\u2019s leading suppliers of audio visual equipment for broadcasting and online events. Part of global production company NEP Group, CT helps produce high-quality virtual and live events by providing advanced technologies and equipment, from large-screen displays to content delivery systems.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic hit, CT was looking to enhance the broadcast experience, bringing audiences and content closer together. Already in the process of switching from a baseband software-defined infrastructure (SDI) architecture to more advanced internet protocol (IP)-based technologies, CT was prepared when the pandemic led to an increased demand in virtual events.\nThe company decided to invest in KAIROS, Panasonic\u2019s next-generation IT and IP video processing platform. KAIROS is a software-based, open architecture platform that uses CPU and GPU processing to significantly improve broadcast performance.\nCT opted for NVIDIA GPUs to power KAIROS, which uses NVIDIA Rivermax IP streaming acceleration to enable direct data transfers to and from the GPU, leading to enhanced flexibility and increased performance for virtual events.\nWith plans to use KAIROS for the world\u2019s most recognized sporting event this month, CT is using IP enabled by NVIDIA switches and NVIDIA RTX GPUs. This technology allows CT to easily scale up for larger shows and save time in setting up new productions, while transforming broadcast workflows.\nTaking Broadcast Beyond the Standard\nWith LED screens increasing in resolution, it\u2019s now more common for companies to deal with 4K and 8K signals. CT wanted a powerful solution that could keep up, while also providing better scalability and flexibility to enhance workflows.\nWhen CT first started testing KAIROS, they were discussing using the platform to accommodate a 3G-SDI workflow, which supports the move from 1080/50 interlaced video formats (1080i) to 1080/50 progressive video formats (1080p).\nIn interlaced scanning, the frame is divided into odd and even lines \u2014 only half the frame is shown on screen, and the other half appears in 1/60th of a second. The lines switch so quickly that viewers will see the entire frame, but they may also see flickers on screen.\nIn progressive scans, the entire frame is transmitted simultaneously. All the lines in the frame are shown at once to fill the screen, which reduces flicker. Progressive scans are ideal for digital transmissions and have become the standard for high-definition TV displays.\nBut CT also needed to ensure its technology could keep up with any future video workflow advances demanded by clients.\nThe company has its own servers built on NVIDIA RTX GPUs with ConnectX-6 DX cards, and KAIROS delivers high performance by using the power and flexibility of the GPUs. The CT team no longer has to deal with the painful process of converting 4K and 8K signals to SDI. Instead, it can pass the signals to KAIROS, which can distribute video feeds to projectors or screens regardless of the resolution or format.\n\u201cEssentially, what KAIROS did was give us a lot more flexibility,\u201d said Sid Lobb, head of Vision and Integrated Networks at Creative Technology. \u201cThere is utter flexibility with what we can use and how we allocate the power that the NVIDIA RTX GPUs provide.\u201d\n\nSwitching It Up\u00a0\nTransitioning from SDI to IP allowed CT to use software for driving all the events. With IP, CT can use a switch instead of cables to connect systems.\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s more like connecting computers to each other versus directly connecting cameras to a processor,\u201d said Lobb. \u201cWe\u2019re able to use a network to connect the entire production signal path. It\u2019s a whole change to broadcast workflows.\u201d\nThe latest version of KAIROS enables CT to use the network as a matrix switcher, which allows the team to easily switch from one video or audio source to another. For example, in events that take place in a sports arena, there could be up to 100 PCs capturing and producing different content. During the event, CT could be switching from one PC to another, which would\u2019ve been challenging with traditional architectures. But with IP, CT can easily switch among sources, and also scale up and down to different size shows using the same solution.\nThe team is also experiencing massive time savings when it comes to getting new productions up and running, as the programming of KAIROS is intuitive and efficient. Each virtual event is different, but KAIROS makes it easy for CT to configure input and outputs based on their productions.\nThe team will use GPU-powered solutions to enhance the experience for future broadcasting and live events.\n\n\nCategories: Networking | Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Fueled by data, machine learning (ML) models are the mathematical engines of artificial intelligence.\nFor example, an ML model for computer vision might be able to identify cars and pedestrians in a real-time video. One for natural language processing might translate words and sentences.\nUnder the hood, a\u00a0machine learning model is a mathematical representation of objects and their relationships to each other. The objects can be anything from \u201clikes\u201d on a social networking post to molecules in a lab experiment.\nML Models for Every Purpose\nWith no constraints on the objects that can become features in an ML model, there\u2019s no limit to the uses for AI. The combinations are infinite.\nData scientists have created whole families of machine learning models for different uses, and more are in the works.\nA Brief Taxonomy of ML Models\n\n\n\nML Model TypeUses Cases\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression/classificationPatterns in numeric data, such as financial spreadsheets\n\n\nGraphic modelsFraud detection or sentiment awareness\n\n\nDecision trees/Random forestsPredicting outcomes\n\n\nDeep learning neural networksComputer vision, natural language processing and more\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, linear models use algebra to predict relationships between variables in financial projections. Graphical models express as diagrams a probability, such as whether a consumer will choose to buy a product. Borrowing the metaphor of branches, some ML models take the form of decision trees or groups of them called random forests.\nIn the Big Bang of AI in 2012, researchers found deep learning to be one of the most successful techniques for finding patterns and making predictions. It uses a kind of machine learning model called a neural network because it was inspired by the patterns and functions of brain cells.\nAn ML Model for the Masses\nDeep learning took its name from the structure of its machine learning models. They stack layer upon layer of features and their relationships, forming a mathematical hero sandwich.\nThanks to their uncanny accuracy in finding patterns, two kinds of deep learning models, described in a separate explainer, are appearing everywhere.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs), often used in computer vision, act like eyes in autonomous vehicles and can help spot diseases in medical imaging. Recurrent neural networks and transformers (RNNs), tuned to analyze spoken and written language, are the engines of Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Google\u2019s Assistant and Apple\u2019s Siri.\nDeep learning neural networks got their name from their multilayered structure.\nPssssst, Pick a Pretrained Model\nChoosing the right family of models \u2014 like a CNN, RNN or transformer \u2014 is a great beginning. But that\u2019s just the start.\nIf you want to ride the Baja 500, you can modify a stock dune buggy with heavy duty shocks and rugged tires, or you can shop for a vehicle built for that race.\nIn machine learning, that\u2019s what\u2019s called a pretrained model. It\u2019s tuned on large sets of training data that are similar to data in your use case. Data relationships \u2014 called weights and biases \u2014 are optimized for the intended application.\nIt takes an enormous dataset, a lot of AI expertise and significant compute muscle to train a model. Savvy buyers shop for pretrained models to save time and money.\nWho Ya Gonna Call?\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a pretrained model, find a dealer you can trust.\nNVIDIA puts its name behind an online library called the NGC catalog that\u2019s filled with vetted, pretrained models. They span the spectrum of AI jobs from computer vision and conversational AI and more.\nUsers know what they\u2019re getting because models in the catalog come with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. They\u2019re like the credentials of a prospective hire.\nModel resumes show you the domain the model was trained for, the dataset that trained it, and how it\u2019s expected to perform. They provide transparency and confidence you\u2019re picking the right model for your use case.\nMore Resources for ML Models\nWhat\u2019s more, NGC models are ready for transfer learning. That\u2019s the one final tune-up that torques models for the exact road conditions over which they\u2019ll ride \u2014 your application\u2019s data.\nNVIDIA even provides the wrench to tune your NGC model. It\u2019s called TAO and you can sign up for early access to it today.\nTo learn more, check out:\n\nOur web page on pretrained models\nA guide to the NGC catalog\nOur web page on TAO and related tools\nA technical blog on using pretrained models for computer vision to build a gesture recognition app and more.\nA talk from GTC 21 on transfer learning (free to view with registration)\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Data Science | Machine Learning | NGC \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By pairing Plainsight\u2019s vision AI platform and NVIDIA GPUs to develop video analytics applications, the company\u2019s system performs precision livestock counting and health monitoring.\nWith animals such as cows that look so similar, frequently shoulder-to-shoulder and moving quickly, inaccuracies in livestock counts are common in the cattle industry, and often costly.\nOn average, the cost of a cow in the U.S. is between $980 and $1,200, and facilities process anywhere between 1,000 to 5,000 cows per day. At this scale, even a small percentage of inaccurate counts equates to hundreds of millions of dollars in financial losses, nationally.\n\u201cBy applying computer vision powered by edge AI and NVIDIA Metropolis, we\u2019re able to automate what has traditionally been a very manual process and remove the uncertainty that comes with human counting,\u201d said Carlos Anchia, CEO of Plainsight. \u201cOrganizations begin to optimize existing revenue streams when accuracy can be operationally efficient.\u201d\nPlainsight is working with JBS USA, one of the world\u2019s largest food companies, to integrate vision AI into its operational processes. Vision AI-powered cattle counting was among the first solutions to be implemented.\nAt JBS, cows are counted by fixed-position cameras, connected via a secured private network to Plainsight\u2019s vision AI edge application, which detects, tracks and counts the cows as they move past.\nPlainsight\u2019s models count livestock with over 99.5 percent accuracy \u2014 about two percentage points better than manual livestock counting by humans in the same conditions, according to the company.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Plainsight_VisionAI_Cattle-Counting-1.mp4\n\u00a0\nFor a vision AI solution to be widely adopted by an organization, the accuracy must be higher than humans performing the same activity. By monitoring and tracking each individual animal, the models simplify an otherwise complex process.\nHighly robust and accurate computer vision models are only a portion of the cattle counting solution. Through continued collaboration with JBS\u2019s operations and innovation teams, Plainsight provided a path to the digital transformation required to more accurately provide accountability when receiving livestock at scale and thus ensure that the payment for livestock received is as accurate as possible.\nHigher Accuracy with GPMoos\nFor JBS, the initial proof of value involved building models and deploying on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit.\nAfter quickly achieving nearly 100 percent accuracy levels with their models, the teams moved into a full pilot phase. To augment the model to handle new and often challenging environmental conditions, Plainsight\u2019s AI platform was used to quickly and easily annotate, build and deploy model improvements in preparation for a nationwide rollout.\nAs a member partner of NVIDIA Metropolis, an application framework that brings visual data and AI together, Plainsight continues to develop and improve models and AI pipelines to enable a national rollout with the U.S. division of JBS.\nThere, Plainsight uses a technology stack built on the NVIDIA EGX platform, incorporating NVIDIA-Certified Systems with NVIDIA T4 GPUs. Plainsight\u2019s application processes multiple video streams per GPU in real time to count and monitor livestock as part of managing the accounting of livestock when received.\n\u201cInnovation is fundamental to the JBS culture, and the application of AI technology to improve efficiencies for daily work routines is important,\u201d said Frederico Scarin do Amaral, Senior Manager Business Solutions of JBS USA. \u201cOur partnership with Plainsight enhances the work of our team members and ensures greater accuracy of livestock count, improving our operations and efficiency, as well as allowing for continual improvements of animal welfare.\u201d\nMilking It\nInaccurate counting is only part of the problem the industry faces, however. Visual inspection of livestock is arduous and error-prone, causing late detection of diseases and increasing health risks to other animals.\nThe same symptoms humans can identify by looking at an animal, such as gait and abnormal behavior, can be approximated by computer vision models built, trained and managed through Plainsight\u2019s vision AI platform.\nThe models identify symptoms of particular diseases, based on the gait and anomalies in how livestock behave when exiting transport vehicles, in a pen or in feeding areas.\n\u201cThe cameras are an unblinking source of truth that can be very useful in identifying and alerting to problems otherwise gone unnoticed,\u201d said Anchia. \u201cThe combination of vision AI, cameras and Plainsight\u2019s AI platform can help enhance the vigilance of all participants in the cattle supply chain so they can focus more on their business operations and animal welfare improvements as opposed to error-prone manual counting.\u201d\nLegen-Dairy\nIn addition to a variety of other smart agriculture applications, Plainsight is using its vision AI platform to monitor and track cattle on the blockchain as digital assets.\nThe company is engaged in a first-of-its-kind co-innovation project with CattlePass, a platform that generates a secure and unique digital record of individual livestock, also known as a non-fungible token, or NFT.\nPlainsight is applying its advanced vision AI models and platform for monitoring cattle health. The suite of advanced technologies, including genomics, health and proof-of-life records, will provide 100 percent verifiable proof of ownership and transparency into a complete living record of the animal throughout its lifecycle.\nCattle ranchers will be able to store the NFTs in a private digital wallet while collecting and adding metadata: feed, heartbeat, health, etc. This data can then be shared with permissioned viewers such as inspectors, buyers, vets and processors.\nThe data will remain with each animal throughout its life through harvest, and data will be provided with a unique QR code printed on the beef packaging. This will allow for visibility into the proof of life and quality of each cow, giving consumers unprecedented knowledge about its origin.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | Metropolis \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Combined, they\u2019re bringing creators closer to the goal of cinema-quality 3D imagery rendered in real time.\nAt a series of graphics conferences this summer, NVIDIA Research is sharing groundbreaking work in real-time path tracing and content creation, much of it based on cutting-edge AI techniques. These projects are tackling the hardest unsolved problems in graphics with new tools that advance the state of the art in real-time rendering.\nOne goal is improving the realism of rendered light as it passes through complex materials like fur or fog. Another is helping artists more easily turn their creative visions into lifelike models and scenes.\nPresented at this week\u2019s SIGGRAPH 2021 \u2014 as well as the recent High-Performance Graphics conference and the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering \u2014 these research advancements highlight how NVIDIA RTX GPUs make it possible to further the frontiers of photorealistic real-time graphics.\nRendering photorealistic images in real time requires accurate simulation of light, modeling the same laws that govern light in the physical world. The most effective approach known so far, path tracing, requires massive computational resources but can deliver spectacular imagery.\nThe NVIDIA RTX platform, with dedicated ray-tracing hardware and high-performance Tensor Cores for efficient evaluation of AI models, is tailor made for this task. Yet there are still situations where creating high-fidelity rendered images remains challenging.\nConsider, for one, a tiger prowling through the woods.\nSeeing the Light: Real-Time Path Tracing\nTo make a scene completely realistic, creators must render complex lighting effects such as reflections, shadows and visible haze.\nIn a forest scene, dappled sunlight filters through the leaves on the trees and grows hazy among the water molecules suspended in the foggy air. Rendering realistic real-time imagery of clouds, dusty surfaces or mist like this was once out of reach. But NVIDIA researchers have developed techniques that often compute the visual effect of these phenomena 10x more efficiently.\nThe tiger itself is both illuminated by sunlight and shadowed by trees. As it strides through the woods, its reflection is visible in the pond below. Lighting these kinds of rich visuals with both direct and indirect reflections can require calculating thousands of paths for every pixel in the scene.\nIt\u2019s a task far too resource-hungry to solve in real time. So our research team created a path-sampling algorithm that prioritizes the light paths and reflections most likely to contribute to the final image, rendering images over 100x more quickly than before.\nAI of the Tiger: Neural Radiance Caching\nAnother group of NVIDIA researchers achieved a breakthrough in global illumination with a new technique named neural radiance caching. This method uses both NVIDIA RT Cores for ray tracing and Tensor Cores for AI acceleration to train a tiny neural network live while rendering a dynamic scene.\nThe neural network learns how light is distributed throughout the scene. It evaluates over a billion global illumination queries per second when running on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, depicting the tiger\u2019s dense fur with rich lighting detail previously unattainable at interactive frame rates.\nSeamless Creation of Tough Textures\nAs rendering algorithms have progressed, it\u2019s crucial that the 3D content available keeps up with the complexity and richness that the algorithms are capable of.\nNVIDIA researchers are diving into this area by developing a variety of techniques that support content creators in their efforts to model rich and realistic 3D environments. One area of focus is on materials with rich geometric complexity, which can be difficult to simulate using traditional techniques.\nThe weave of a polo shirt, the texture of a carpet, or blades of grass have features often much smaller than the size of a pixel, making it difficult to efficiently store and render representations of them. NVIDIA researchers are addressing this with NeRF-Tex, an approach that uses neural networks to represent these challenging materials and encode how they respond to lighting.\nSeeing the Forest for the Trees\nComplex geometric objects also vary in their appearance depending on how close they are to the viewer. A leafy tree is one example: Close up, there\u2019s enormous detail in its branches, leaves and bark. From afar, it may appear to be little more than a green blob.\nIt would be a waste of time to render detailed bark and leaves on a tree that\u2019s on the other end of the forest in a scene. But when zooming in for a close-up, the model should be as realistic as possible.\nThis is a classic problem in computer graphics known as level of detail. Artists have often been burdened with this challenge, manually modeling multiple versions of each 3D object to enable efficient rendering.\nNVIDIA researchers have developed a new approach that generates simplified models automatically based on an inverse rendering method. With it, creators can generate simplified models that are optimized to appear indistinguishable from the originals, but with drastic reductions in their geometric complexity.\nNVIDIA at SIGGRAPH 2021\u00a0\nMore than 200 scientists around the globe make up the NVIDIA Research team, focusing on AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and more. At SIGGRAPH, which runs from Aug. 9-13, our researchers are presenting the following papers:\n\nReal-Time Neural Radiance Caching for Path Tracing\nNeural Scene Graph Rendering\nAn Unbiased Ray-Marching Transmittance Estimator\nStrokeStrip: Joint Parameterization and Fitting of Stroke Clusters\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss NVIDIA\u2019s special address at SIGGRAPH on Aug. 10 at 8 a.m. Pacific, revealing our latest technology, demos and more.

The number of AI startups in media and entertainment is about the same as that in retail. More than one in 10 of all AI startups is based in California.\nHow do we know this? NVIDIA Inception, our acceleration platform for AI startups, has now surpassed 8,500 members. That\u2019s about two-thirds of the total number of AI startups worldwide, as estimated by Pitchbook. With total cumulative funding of over $60 billion and members in 90 countries, NVIDIA Inception is one of the largest AI startup ecosystems in the world.\nWith this type of scale, NVIDIA Inception is more than a singular program; it\u2019s a reflection of the larger startup landscape. And there\u2019s plenty that can be inferred based on this.\nData Across 8,500+ Startups\nNVIDIA Inception figures show the United States leads the world in terms of both the number of AI startups, representing nearly 27 percent, and the amount of secured funding, accounting for over $27 billion in cumulative funding.\nOf U.S.-based startups, 42 percent were based in California \u2014 more than one in 10 AI startups is based in the state \u2014 with 29 percent in the San Francisco Bay Area. This underscores the continued draw of the region for startup founders and VC funding.\nFollowing the U.S. is China, in terms of both funding and company stage, with 12 percent of NVIDIA Inception members based there. India comes in third at 7 percent, with the United Kingdom right behind at 6 percent.\nTaken together, AI startups based in the U.S., China, India and the U.K. account for just over half of all startups in NVIDIA Inception. Following in order after these are Germany, Russia, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Korea and Japan.\nIn terms of industries, healthcare, IT services, intelligent video analytics (IVA), media and entertainment (M&E) and robotics are the top five in NVIDIA Inception. AI startups in healthcare account for 16 percent of Inception members, followed by those in IT services at 15 percent. AI startups in IVA make up 8 percent, with M&E and robotics AI startups tied at 7 percent.\nDetails Spanning 3,000+ Startups Since 2020\nMore than 3,000 AI startups have joined NVIDIA Inception since 2020. Similar to data across Inception as a whole, AI startups from the U.S. account for the largest segment (27 percent), followed by China (12 percent), and India and the U.K. (tied at 6 percent).\nAdditionally, startups that have joined since 2020 are concentrated in the same top five industries, though in slightly different order. IT services leads the way at 17 percent, followed by healthcare at 16 percent, M&E at 9 percent, IVA at 8 percent and robotics at 5 percent.\nWithin the top two industries \u2014\u00a0 healthcare and IT services \u2014 there\u2019s more detail among AI startups who have joined since 2020. The dominant segment within IT services is computer vision at 27 percent, with predictive analytics in second place at 9 percent. The top two segments in healthcare are medical analytics at 38 percent and medical imaging at 36 percent, though the fastest growth is among AI startups in the pharma and AI biology industries at 15 percent.\nVirtual and augmented reality startup companies are far outpacing any other segment within M&E, mostly due to the pandemic. These startups are coming to NVIDIA Inception with a shared vision of building an ecosystem for the metaverse.\nDisruption Through Startups\u00a0\nSince Inception\u2019s launch in 2016, it has grown more than tenfold. This growth has accelerated year over year, with membership increasing to 26 percent in 2020, and already reaching 17 percent in the first half of 2021.\nNVIDIA Inception is a program built to accommodate and nurture every startup that is accelerating computing, at every stage in their journey. All program benefits are free of charge \u2014 there are no fees ever. And unlike other accelerators or incubators, startups never have to give up equity to join.\nStartups are the single best lens into the future of modern AI, so join with us today by applying for NVIDIA Inception.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Deep Learning | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

One moment, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang was holding forth from behind his sturdy kitchen counter.\nThe next, the kitchen and everything in it slid away, leaving Huang alone with the audience and NVIDIA\u2019s DGX Station A100, a glimpse at an alternate digital reality.\nFor most, the metaverse is something seen in sci-fi movies. For entrepreneurs, it\u2019s an opportunity. For gamers, a dream.\nFor NVIDIA artists, researchers and engineers on an extraordinarily tight deadline last spring, it was where they went to work \u2014 a shared virtual world they used to tell their story and a milestone for the entire company.\nDesigned to inform and entertain, NVIDIA\u2019s GTC keynote is filled with cutting-edge demos highlighting advancements in supercomputing, deep learning and graphics.\n\n\u201cGTC is, first and foremost, our opportunity to highlight the amazing work that our engineers and other teams here at NVIDIA have done all year long,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse engineering and simulation at NVIDIA.\nWith this short documentary, \u201cConnecting in the Metaverse: The Making of the GTC Keynote,\u201d viewers get the story behind the story. It\u2019s a tale of how NVIDIA Omniverse, a tool for connecting to and describing the metaverse, brought it all together this year.\nTo be sure, you can\u2019t have a keynote without a flesh and blood person at the center. Through all but 14 seconds of the hour and 48 minute presentation \u2014 from 1:02:41 to 1:02:55 \u2014 Huang himself spoke in the keynote.\nCreating a Story in Omniverse\nIt starts with building a great narrative. Bringing forward a keynote-worthy presentation always takes intense collaboration. But this was unlike any other \u2014 packed not just with words and pictures \u2014 but with beautifully rendered 3D models and rich textures.\nWith Omniverse, NVIDIA\u2019s team was able to collaborate using different industry content-creation tools like Autodesk Maya or Substance Painter while in different places.\nKeynote slides were packed with beautifully rendered 3D models and rich textures.\n\u201cThere are already great tools out there that people use every day in every industry that we want people to continue using,\u201d said Lebaredian. \u201cWe want people to take these exciting tools and augment them with our technologies.\u201d\nThese were enhanced by a new generation of tools, including Universal Scene Description (USD), Material Design Language (MDL) and NVIDIA RTX real-time ray-tracing technologies. Together, they allowed NVIDIA\u2019s team to collaborate to create photorealistic scenes with physically accurate materials and lighting.\nAn NVIDIA DGX Station A100 Animation\nOmniverse can create more than beautiful stills. The documentary shows how, accompanied by industry tools such as Autodesk Maya, Foundry Nuke, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe After Effects, it could stage and render some of the world\u2019s most complex machines to create realistic cinematics.\nWith Omniverse, NVIDIA was able to turn a CAD model of the NVIDIA DGX Station A100 into a physically accurate virtual replica Huang used to give the audience a look inside.\n\nTypically this type of project would take a team months to complete and weeks to render. But with Omniverse, the animation was chiefly completed by a single animator and rendered in less than a day.\nOmniverse Physics Montage\nMore than just machines, though, Omniverse can model the way the world works by building on existing NVIDIA technologies. PhysX, for example, has been a staple in the NVIDIA gaming world for well over a decade. But its implementation in Omniverse brings it to a new level.\nFor a demo highlighting the current capabilities of PhysX 5 in Omniverse, plus a preview of advanced real-time physics simulation research, the Omniverse engineering and research teams re-rendered a collection of older PhysX demos in Omniverse.\nThe demo highlights key PhysX technologies such as Rigid Body, Soft Body Dynamics, Vehicle Dynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Blast\u2019s Destruction and Fracture, and Flow\u2019s combustible fluid, smoke and fire. As a result, viewers got a look at core Omniverse technologies that can do more than just show realistic-looking effects \u2014 they are true to reality, obeying the laws of physics in real-time.\nDRIVE Sim, Now Built on Omniverse\nSimulating the world around us is key to unlocking new technologies, and Omniverse is crucial to NVIDIA\u2019s self-driving car initiative. With its PhysX and Photorealistic worlds, Omniverse creates the perfect environment for training autonomous machines of all kinds.\nFor this year\u2019s DRIVE Sim on Omniverse demo, the team imported a map of the area surrounding a Mercedes plant in Germany. Then, using the same software stack that runs NVIDIA\u2019s fleet of self-driving cars, they showed how the next generation of Mercedes cars would perform autonomous functions in the real world.\nWith DRIVE Sim, the team was able to test numerous lighting, weather and traffic conditions quickly \u2014 and show the world the results.\nCreating the Factory of the Future with BMW Group\nThe idea of a \u201cdigital twin\u201d has far-reaching consequences for almost every industry.\nThis year\u2019s GTC featured a spectacular visionary display that exemplifies what the idea can do when unleashed in the auto industry.\nThe BMW Factory of the Future demo shows off the digital twin of a BMW assembly plant in Germany. Every detail, including layout, lighting and machinery, is digitally replicated with physical accuracy.\nThis \u201cdigital simulation\u201d provides ultra-high fidelity and accurate, real-time simulation of the entire factory. With it, BMW can reconfigure assembly lines to optimize worker safety and efficiency, train factory robots to perform tasks, and optimize every aspect of plant operations.\nVirtual Kitchen, Virtual CEO\nThe surprise highlight of GTC21 was a perfect virtual replica of Huang\u2019s kitchen \u2014 the setting of the past three pandemic-era \u201ckitchen keynotes\u201d \u2014 complete with a digital clone of the CEO himself.\nThe demo is the epitome of what GTC represents: It combined the work of NVIDIA\u2019s deep learning and graphics research teams with several engineering teams and the company\u2019s incredible in-house creative team.\n\nTo create a virtual Jensen, teams did a full face and body scan to create a 3D model, then trained an AI to mimic his gestures and expressions and applied some AI magic to make his clone realistic.\nDigital Jensen was then brought into a replica of his kitchen that was deconstructed to reveal the holodeck within Omniverse, surprising the audience and making them question how much of the keynote was real, or rendered.\n\u201cWe built Omniverse first and foremost for ourselves here at NVIDIA,\u201d Lebaredian said. \u201cWe started Omniverse with the idea of connecting existing tools that do 3D together for what we are now calling the metaverse.\u201d\nMore and more of us will be able to do the same, accelerating more of what we do together. \u201cIf we do this right, we\u2019ll be working in Omniverse 20 years from now,\u201d Lebaredian said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss our next GTC keynote, register for GTC today.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AEC | Digital Twin | Game Development | Industrial and Manufacturing | Media and Entertainment | Metaverse | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Omniverse platform continues to expand, gaining Blender USD support, a new Adobe Substance 3D plugin, and a new extension, GANverse3D \u2014 designed to make 3D modeling easier with AI.\nOmniverse is currently in open beta and free for NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPU users. With today\u2019s launch of the NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU, millions more 3D artists and content creators will have the opportunity to explore the platform\u2019s capabilities.\nThe latest creative app updates, along with Omniverse and RTX A2000 GPUs, gain improved levels of support in the August NVIDIA Studio Driver, available for download today.\nOmniverse Expands the 3D Metaverse at SIGGRAPH\nNVIDIA announced that Blender, the world\u2019s leading open-source 3D animation application, will include support for Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) in the Blender 3.0 release, enabling artists to use the application with Omniverse production pipelines.\nThe open-source 3D file framework gives software partners and artists multiple ways to extend and connect to Omniverse through USD adoption, building a plugin, or an Omniverse Connector, extension or app.\nNVIDIA also unveiled an experimental Blender alpha 3.0 USD branch that includes more advanced USD and material support, which will be available soon for Blender users everywhere.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA and Adobe are collaborating on a new Substance 3D plugin that will enable Substance Material support in Omniverse.\nWith the plugin, materials created in Adobe Substance 3D or imported from the Substance 3D Asset Library can be adjusted directly in Omniverse. 3D artists will save valuable time when making changes as they don\u2019t need to export and reupload assets from Substance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Sampler.\nWe\u2019re also releasing a new Omniverse extension, GANverse3D \u2013 Image2Car, which makes 3D modeling easier with AI. It\u2019s the first of a collection of extensions that will comprise the Omniverse AI Toy Box.\nGANverse3D was built on a generative adversarial network trained on 2D photos, synthesizing multiple views of thousands of objects to predict 3D geometry, texture and part segmentation labels. This process could turn a single photo of a car into a 3D model that can drive around a virtual scene, complete with realistic headlights, blinkers and wheels.\nThe AI Toy Box extension allows inexperienced 3D artists to easily create scenes, and experienced artists to bring new enhancements to their multi-app workflows.\nHere\u2019s GANverse3D in action with an Omniverse-connected workflow featuring Omniverse Create, Reallusion Character Creator 3 and Adobe Photoshop.\n\nFor a further dive into the latest innovations in 3D, including Omniverse, watch the NVIDIA special address at SIGGRAPH on demand.\nOmniverse plays a critical role in many creative projects, like the GTC keynote with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.\nGet a sneak peek of how a small team of artists was able to blur the line between real and rendered.\n\nThe full documentary releases alongside the NVIDIA SIGGRAPH panel on Wednesday, August 11, at 11 a.m. PT.\nThe world\u2019s leading artists use NVIDIA RTX and Omniverse to create beautiful work and stunning worlds. Hear from them directly in the second edition of NVIDIA\u2019s RTX All Stars, a free e-book that spotlights creative professionals.\nMore RTX, More 3D Creative Freedom\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 joins the RTX lineup as the most powerful, low-profile, dual-slot GPU for 3D creators. The new desktop GPU encompasses the latest RTX technologies in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, including:\n\n2nd-gen RT Cores for real-time ray tracing with up to 5x performance from last gen with RTX ON.\n3rd-gen Tensor Cores to power and accelerate creative AI features.\n2x PCIe Gen 4 accelerating data paths in and out of the GPU and up to 6GB of GPU ECC memory for rendering and exporting large files.\n\nRTX A2000-based systems will be available starting in October.\nFor on-the-go creators, the NVIDIA RTX A2000 laptop GPU \u2014 available in Studio laptops shipping today like the Lenovo ThinkPad P17 Gen 2 \u2014 is the most power-efficient, professional RTX laptop GPU bringing ray tracing and AI capabilities to thin and light mobile workstations.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPUs support a wealth of creative workflows, including 3D modeling and Omniverse, whether behind a desktop or anywhere a laptop may travel.\nAugust Brings Creative App Updates and Latest Studio Driver\nSeveral exciting updates to cutting-edge creative apps shipped recently. The August Studio Driver, available today, sharpens support for all of them.\nTopaz Sharpen AI v3.2 offers refinements to AI models accelerated by RTX GPUs and Tensor Cores, adding 1.5x motion blur and Too Soft/Very Blurry features further reducing artifacts.\n\nIn-app masking has also been improved with real-time processing of mask strokes and customization controls for the overlay display.\n\nReallusion Character Creator v3.43, the first third-party app with Audio2Face integration, now allows artists to export characters from Character Creator to Omniverse as USD files with Audio2Face-compliant meshes. This allows facial and lip animations to be completely AI-driven solely from voice input, regardless of language, simplifying the process of animating a 3D character.\n\nCapture One 21 v14.3.0 adds a new Magic Brush tool to create complex masks for layer editing based on image content in a split second, working on an underlying processed image from the raw file. This process is hardware accelerated and is up to 3x faster when using the GPU compared to the CPU.\n\nSupport for these app updates, plus the new features in Omniverse, are only a click away. Download the August Studio Driver.\nBest Studio Laptops for 3D Workflows\n3D workflows range from modeling scenes in real time with complex lights and shadows, to visualizing architectural marvels, in or out of Omniverse, with massive exports. These necessitate major computational power, requiring advanced NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs to get jobs done quickly.\nThese Studio laptops are built to handle demanding 3D creative workflows:\n\nLenovo P1 Gen 4 is stylish and lightweight, at less than 4 pounds. It comes in a ton of configurations, including GeForce RTX 3070 and 3080, plus RTX A4000 and A5000 laptop GPUs.\nDell Precision 7760 is their thinnest, smallest and lightest 17-inch mobile workstation. With up to an RTX A5000 and 16GB of video memory, it\u2019s great for working with massive 3D models or in multi-app workflows.\nAcer ConceptD 7 Ezel features their patented Ezel Hinge with a 15.6-inch, 4K PANTONE-validated touchscreen display. Available later this month, it also comes with up to a GeForce RTX 3080 laptop GPU and 16GB of video memory.\n\nSet to make a splash later this year is the HP Zbook Studio G8. Engineered for heavy 3D work, it comes well-equipped with up to an RTX A5000 or GeForce RTX 3080 laptop GPU, perfect for on-the-go creativity.\nBrowse the NVIDIA Studio Shop for more great options.\nStay up to date on all things Studio by subscribing to the NVIDIA Studio newsletter and following us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\n\nCategories: Laptops | Pro Graphics | WorkstationTags: Creators | Metaverse | NVIDIA RTX | Omniverse | Open Source | Rendering | SIGGRAPH 2021 | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With it, artists can create beautiful 3D worlds, architects can design and virtually explore the next generation of smart buildings and homes, and engineers can create energy-efficient and autonomous vehicles that will drive us into the future.\nThe GPU has 6GB of memory capacity with error correction code (ECC) to maintain data integrity for uncompromised computing accuracy and reliability, which especially benefits the healthcare and financial services fields.\nWith remote work part of the new normal, simultaneous collaboration with colleagues on projects across the globe is critical. NVIDIA RTX technology powers Omniverse, our collaboration and simulation platform that enables teams to iterate together on a single 3D design in real time while working across different software applications. The A2000 will serve as a portal into this world for millions of designers.\nCustomer Adoption\u00a0\nAmong the first to tap into the RTX A2000 are Avid, Cuhaci & Peterson and Gilbane Building Company.\n\u201cThe A2000 from NVIDIA has made our modeling flow faster and more efficient. No longer are we sitting and wasting valuable time for graphics to render, and panning around complex geometry has become smoother,\u201d said Connor Reddington, mechanical engineer and certified SOLIDWORKS professional at Avid Product Development, a Lubrizol Company.\nA custom lattice pillow structure for lightweighting of 3D printed parts. Image courtesy of Avid.\n\u201cIntroducing RT Cores into the NVIDIA RTX A2000 has resulted in impressive rendering speedups for photorealistic visualization compared to the previous generation GPUs,\u201d said Steven Blevins, director of Digital Practice at Cuhaci & Peterson.\n\u201cThe small form factor and low power usage of the NVIDIA RTX A2000 is extraordinary and ensures fitment in just about any existing workstation chassis,\u201d said Ken Grothman, virtual design and construction manager at Gilbane Building Company.\nA building model in Autodesk Revit with point cloud data.

That\u2019s because people speak with complex rhythm, intonation and timbre that\u2019s challenging for AI to emulate.\nThe gap is closing fast: NVIDIA researchers are building models and tools for high-quality, controllable speech synthesis that capture the richness of human speech, without audio artifacts. Their latest projects are now on display in sessions at the Interspeech 2021 conference, which runs through Sept. 3.\nThese models can help voice automated customer service lines for banks and retailers, bring video-game or book characters to life, and provide real-time speech synthesis for digital avatars.\nNVIDIA\u2019s in-house creative team even uses the technology to produce expressive narration for a video series on the power of AI.\n\nExpressive speech synthesis is just one element of NVIDIA Research\u2019s work in conversational AI \u2014 a field that also encompasses natural language processing, automated speech recognition, keyword detection, audio enhancement and more.\nOptimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, some of this cutting-edge work has been made open source through the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit, available on our NGC hub of containers and other software.\nBehind the Scenes of I AM AI\nNVIDIA researchers and creative professionals don\u2019t just talk the conversational AI talk. They walk the walk, putting groundbreaking speech synthesis models to work in our I AM AI video series, which features global AI innovators reshaping just about every industry imaginable.\nBut until recently, these videos were narrated by a human. Previous speech synthesis models offered limited control over a synthesized voice\u2019s pacing and pitch, so attempts at AI narration didn\u2019t evoke the emotional response in viewers that a talented human speaker could.\nThat changed over the past year when NVIDIA\u2019s text-to-speech research team developed more powerful, controllable speech synthesis models like RAD-TTS, used in our winning demo at the SIGGRAPH Real-Time Live competition. By training the text-to-speech model with audio of an individual\u2019s speech, RAD-TTS can convert any text prompt into the speaker\u2019s voice.\nAnother of its features is voice conversion, where one speaker\u2019s words (or even singing) is delivered in another speaker\u2019s voice. Inspired by the idea of the human voice as a musical instrument, the RAD-TTS interface gives users fine-grained, frame-level control over the synthesized voice\u2019s pitch, duration and energy.\nWith this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script, and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator\u2019s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor \u2014 tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words, and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video\u2019s tone.\nThe AI model\u2019s capabilities go beyond voiceover work: text-to-speech can be used in gaming, to aid individuals with vocal disabilities or to help users translate between languages in their own voice. It can even recreate the performances of iconic singers, matching not only the melody of a song, but also the emotional expression behind the vocals.\nGiving Voice to AI Developers, Researchers\nWith NVIDIA NeMo \u2014 an open-source Python toolkit for GPU-accelerated conversational AI \u2014 researchers, developers and creators gain a head start in experimenting with, and fine-tuning, speech models for their own applications.\nEasy-to-use APIs and models pretrained in NeMo help researchers develop and customize models for text-to-speech, natural language processing and real-time automated speech recognition. Several of the models are trained with tens of thousands of hours of audio data on NVIDIA DGX systems. Developers can fine tune any model for their use cases, speeding up training using mixed-precision computing on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\nThrough NGC, NVIDIA NeMo also offers models trained on Mozilla Common Voice, a dataset with nearly 14,000 hours of crowd-sourced speech data in 76 languages. Supported by NVIDIA, the project aims to democratize voice technology with the world\u2019s largest open data voice dataset.\nVoice Box: NVIDIA Researchers Unpack AI Speech\nInterspeech brings together more than 1,000 researchers to showcase groundbreaking work in speech technology.

Accelerated by 2,240 NVIDIA\u00ae A100 Tensor Core GPUs, the system can achieve almost 1.4 exaflops of theoretical AI performance and approximately 44 petaflops of peak double-precision performance.\nPolaris, to be built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, will combine simulation and machine learning by tackling data-intensive and AI high performance computing workloads, powered by 560 total nodes, each with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\n\u201cThe era of exascale AI will enable scientific breakthroughs with massive scale to bring incredible benefits for society,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s GPU-accelerated computing platform provides pioneers like the ALCF breakthrough performance for next-generation supercomputers such as Polaris that let researchers push the boundaries of scientific exploration.\u201d\n\u201cPolaris is a powerful platform that will allow our users to enter the era of exascale AI,\u201d said ALCF Director Michael E. Papka. \u201cHarnessing the huge number of NVIDIA A100 GPUs will have an immediate impact on our data-intensive and AI HPC workloads, allowing Polaris to tackle some of the world\u2019s most complex scientific problems.\u201d\nThe system will accelerate transformative scientific exploration, such as advancing cancer treatments, exploring clean energy and propelling particle collision research to discover new approaches to physics. And it will transport the ALCF into the era of exascale AI by enabling researchers to update their scientific workloads for Aurora, Argonne\u2019s forthcoming exascale system.\nPolaris will also be available to researchers from academia, government agencies and industry through the ALCF\u2019s peer-reviewed allocation and application programs. These programs provide the scientific community with access to the nation\u2019s fastest supercomputers to address \u201cgrand challenges\u201d in science and engineering.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and AI.

[+] with stock market graphic on the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nNvidia has a market cap of roughly $550 billion compared to Apple\u2019s nearly $2.5 trillion. We believe Nvidia can surpass Apple by capitalizing on the artificial intelligence economy, which will add an estimated $15 trillion to GDP. This is compared to the mobile economy that brought us the majority of the gains in Apple, Google and Facebook, and contributes $4.4 trillion to GDP.\u00a0For comparison purposes, AI contributes $2 trillion to GDP as of 2018.\n\n\nWhile mobile was primarily consumer, and some enterprise with bring-your-own-device, artificial intelligence will touch every aspect of both industry and commerce, including consumer, enterprise, and small-to-medium sized businesses, and will do so by disrupting every vertical similar to cloud. To be more specific, AI will be similar to cloud by blazing a path that is defined by lowering costs and increasing productivity.\n\nI have an impeccable record on Nvidia including when I stated the sell-off in 2018 was overblown and missing the bigger picture as Nvidia has two impenetrable moats: developer adoption and the GPU-powered cloud. This was when headlines were focused exclusively on Nvidia\u2019s gaming segment and GPU sales for crypto mining.\n\n\nAlthough Nvidia\u2019s stock is doing very well this year, this has been a fairly contrarian stance in the past. Not only was Nvidia wearing the dunce hat in 2018, but in August of 2019, the GPU data center revenue\u00a0was flat to declining sequentially for three quarters, and in fiscal Q3 2020, also declined YoY (calendar Q4 2019). We established and defended our thesis on the data center as Nvidia clawed its way back in price through China tensions, supply shortages, threats of custom silicon from Big Tech, cyclical capex spending, and on whether the Arm acquisition will be approved.\n\nSuffice to say, three years later and Nvidia is no longer a contrarian stock as it once was during the crypto bust. Yet, the long-term durability is still being debated \u2014- it\u2019s a semiconductor company after all \u2014- best to stick with software, right? Right? Not to mention, some institutions are still holding out for Intel. Imagine being the tech analyst at those funds (if they\u2019re still employed!).\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nBefore we review what will drive Nvidia\u2019s revenue in the near-term, it bears repeating the thesis we published in November of 2018:\nNvidia is already the universal platform for development, but this won\u2019t become obvious until innovation in artificial intelligence matures. Developers are programming the future of artificial intelligence applications on Nvidia because GPUs are easier and more flexible than customized TPU chips from Google or FGPA chips used by Microsoft [from Xilinx]. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s CPU chips will struggle to compete as artificial intelligence applications and machine learning inferencing move to the cloud. Intel is trying to catch-up but Nvidia continues to release more powerful GPUs \u2013 and cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google cannot risk losing the competitive advantage that comes with Nvidia\u2019s technology.\n\nThe Turing T4 GPU from Nvidia should start to show up in earnings soon, and the real-time ray-tracing RTX chips will keep gaming revenue strong when there is more adoption in 6-12 months. Nvidia is a company that has reported big earnings beats, with average upside potential of 33.35 percent to estimates in the last four quarters. Data center revenue stands at 24% and is rapidly growing. When artificial intelligence matures, you can expect data center revenue to be Nvidia\u2019s top revenue segment. Despite the corrections we\u2019ve seen in the technology sector, and with Nvidia stock specifically, investors who remain patient will have a sizeable return in the future.\u201d\n\n\nNotably, the stock is up 335% since my thesis was first published \u2013 a notable amount for a mega cap stock and nearly 2-3X more returns than any FAAMG in the same period. This is important because I expect this to trend to continue until Nvidia has surpassed all FAAMG valuations.Although Nvidia\u2019s stock is doing very well this year, this has been a fairly contrarian stance in ... [+] the past.I/O Fund\nBelow, we discuss the Ampere architecture and A100 GPUs, the Enterprise AI Suite and an update on the Arm acquisition. These are some of the near-term stepping stones that will help sustain Nvidia\u2019s price in the coming year. We are also bullish on the Metaverse with Nvidia specifically but will leave that for a separate analysis in the coming month.\nNvidia Not Standing Still with Ampere Architecture and A100 GPU\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s acceleration may happen one or two years earlier as they are the core piece in the stack that is required for the computing power for the front-runners referenced in the graph above. There is a chance Nvidia reflects data center growth as soon as 2020-2021.\u201d -published August 2019, Premium I/O Fund\nLast year, Nvidia released the Ampere architecture and A100 GPU as an upgrade from the Volta architecture. The A100 GPUs are able to unify training and inference on a single chip, whereas in the past Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were mainly used for training. This allows Nvidia a competitive advantage by offering both training and inferencing. The result is a 20x performance boost from a multi-instance GPU that allows many GPUs to look like one GPU. The A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over the past 8 generations.\nAt the onset, the A100 was deployed by the world\u2019s leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure, among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory.\u00a0\nOne year later and the Ampere architecture is becoming one of the best-selling GPU architectures in the company\u2019s history. This quarter, Microsoft Azure recently announced the availability of Azure ND A100 v4 Cloud GPU which is powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The company claims it to be the fastest public cloud supercomputer. The news follows the launch by Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud general availability in prior quarters. The company has been extending its leadership in supercomputing. The latest top 500 list shows that Nvidia power 342 of the world\u2019s top 500 supercomputers, including 70 percent of all new systems and eight of the top 10. This is a remarkable update from the company.\nAmpere architecture-powered laptop demand has also been solid as OEM\u2019s adopted Ampere Architecture GPUs in a record number of designs. It also features the third-generation Max-Q power optimization technology enabling ultrathin designs. The Ampere architecture product cycle for gaming has also been robust, driven by RTX\u2019s real-time ray tracing.\nIn the area of GPU acceleration, Nvidia is\u00a0working with Apache Spark\u00a0to release Spark 3.0 run on\u00a0Databricks. Apache Spark is the industry\u2019s largest open source data analytics platform. The results are a 7x performance improvement and 90 percent cost savings in an initial test. Databricks and Google Cloud Dataproc are the first to offer Spark with GPU acceleration, which also opens up Nvidia for data analytics.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe demand has been strong for the company\u2019s products which have exceeded supply. In the earnings call, Jensen Huang mentioned \u201cAnd so I would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment.\u201d However, he assured that they have secured enough supplies to meet the growth plans for the second half of this year when he said, \u201cWe expect to be able to achieve our Company's growth plans for next year.\u201d\nVirtual Machines for AI Workloads\nVirtualization allows companies to use software to expand the capabilities of physical servers onto a virtual system. VMWare is popular with IT departments as the platform allows companies to run many virtual machines on one server and networks can be virtualized to allow applications to function independently from hardware or to share data between computers. The storage, network and compute offered through full-scale virtual machines and Kubernetes instances for cloud-hosted applications comes with third-party support, making VMWare an unbeatable solution for enterprises.\nTherefore, it makes sense Nvidia would choose VMWare\u2019s VSphere as a partner on the Enterprise AI Suite, which is a cloud native suite that plugs into VMWare\u2019s existing footprint to help scale AI applications and workloads. As pointed out by the write-up by IDC, many IT organizations struggle to support AI workloads as they do not scale as deep learning training and AI inferencing is very data hungry and requires more memory bandwidth than what standard infrastructures are capable of. CPUs are also not as efficient as GPUs, which have parallel processing. Although developers and data scientists can leverage the public cloud for the more performance demanding instances, there are latency issues with where the data repositories are stored (typically on-premise).\nThe result is that IT organizations and developers can deploy virtual machines with accelerated AI computing where previously this was only done with bare metal servers. This allows for departments to scale and pay only for workloads that are accelerated with Nvidia capitalizing on licensing and support costs. Nvidia\u2019s AI Enterprise targets customers who are starting out with new enterprise applications or deploying more enterprise applications and require a GPU. As enterprise customers of the Enterprise AI Suite mature and require larger training workloads, it\u2019s likely they will upgrade to the GPU-powered cloud.\nSubscription licenses start at $2,000 per CPU socket for one year and it includes standard business support five days a week. The software will also be supported with a perpetual license of $3,595, but support is extra. You also have the option to have get 24x7 support with additional charges. According to IDC, companies are on track to spend a combined nearly $342 billion on AI software, hardware, and services like AI Enterprise in 2021. So, the market is huge and Nvidia is expecting a significant business.\nNvidia also announced Base Command, which is a development hub to move AI projects from prototype to production. Fleet Command is a managed edge AI software SaaS offering that allows companies to deploy AI applications from a central location with real-time processing at the edge. Companies like Everseen use these products to help retailers manage inventory and for supply chain automation.\nFiscal Q2 Earnings and More on the Arm Acquisition:\nOver the past year, there have been some quarters where data center revenue exceeded gaming, while in the most recent quarter, the two segments are inching closer with gaming revenue at $3.06 billion, up 85 percent year-over-year, and data center revenue at $2.37 billion, up 35 percent year-over-year.\nIt was good timing for Jensen Huang to appear in a fully rendered kitchen for the GTC keynote as professional visualization segment was up 156% year-over-year and 40% quarter-over-quarter. Not surprisingly, automotive was down 1% sequentially although up 37% year-over-year.\nGross margins were 64.8% when compared to 58.8% for the same period last year, which per management \u201creflected the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition-related costs.\u201d Adjusted gross margins were 66.7%, up 70 basis points, and net income increased 282% YoY to $2.4 billion or $0.94 per share compared to $0.25 for the same period last year.\nAdjusted net income increased by 92% YoY to $2.6 billion or $1.04 per share compared to $0.55 for the same period last year.\nThe company had a record cash flow from operation of $2.7 billion and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $19.7 billion and $12 billion in debt. It returned $100 million to the shareholders in the form of dividends. It also completed the announced four-for-one split of its common stock.\nThe company is guiding for third quarter fiscal revenue of $6.8 billion with adjusted margins of 67%. This represents growth of 44% and with the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of sequential growth driven by the data center.\nWe\u2019ve covered the Arm acquisition extensively with in a full-length analysis you can find here on Why the Nvidia-Arm acquisition Should Be Approved. In the analysis, we point towards why we are positive on the deal, as despite Arm\u2019s extremely valuable IP, the company makes very little revenue for powering 90% of the world\u2019s mobile processors/smartphones (therefore, it needs to be a strategic target). We also argue that the idea of Arm being neutral in a competitive industry is idealistic, and to block innovation at its most crucial point would be counterproductive for the governments reviewing the deal. We also discuss how the Arm acquisition will help facilitate Nvidia\u2019s move towards edge devices.\nIn the recent earnings call, CFO Colette Kress reiterated that the Arm deal is a positive for both the companies and its customers as Nvidia can help expand Arm\u2019s IP into new markets like the Data Center and IoT. Specifically, the CFO stated, \u201cWe are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry.\u201d\nConclusion:\nThe conclusion to my analysis is the same as the introduction, which is that I believe Nvidia is capable of out-performing all five FAAMG stocks and will surpass even Apple\u2019s valuation in the next five years.\nAs stated in the article, Beth Kindig and I/O Fund currently own shares of NVDA.

He is eyeing a much bigger prize in the compute market that includes data processing units, purpose-built systems, enterprise software and eventually CPUs that can take on the best from Intel and AMD.\nWhat follows are the 10 biggest Nvidia news stories of 2021 so far, ranging from new enterprise software, programs and GPUs to new AI records, chip shortages and hurdles in the company\u2019s effort to acquire British chip designer Arm for $40 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. AI Chip Startups Raise Hundreds Of Millions To Challenge Nvidia\nSeveral AI chip startups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars this year so far to challenge Nvidia in the fast-growing market.\nAmong the AI chip startups that have raised money is SambaNova Systems, raised a $676 million funding round led by SoftBank Group that also included the venture arms of Google and Intel. The startup is using the funding to grow market share against Nvidia and other competitors with its subscription-based Dataflow-as-a-Service AI platform, which relies on SambaNova\u2019s RDU-based DataScale system to deliver what it says are \u201cunmatched capabilities and efficiency\u201d for AI.\nOther AI chip startups with new funding rounds in 2021 include Groq, which announced a $300 million round in April for its Tensor Streaming Processors; Lightmatter, which announced an $80 million round from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Google\u2019s venture arm and other investors for its silicon photonics chip technology; and SiMa.ai, which raised $80 million in funding from Dell Technologies Capital and other investors for its Machine Learning System-on-Chip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Nvidia-Certified Systems Program Launches To Steer Customers To Optimized Builds\nNvidia reached a new level of maturity in the data center market when it announced in January a new certification program that is meant to steer customers and partners to buy select GPU servers that will provide optimized AI performance.\nThe company called its new Nvidia-Certified Systems program an industry first because of the emphasis on testing the servers for \u201creal life\u201d workloads for AI and ensuring that such workloads can be supported in large server deployments. Nvidia kicked off the program with 14 certified GPU servers from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Gigabyte, Supermicro and Inspur. By the middle of 2021, the company had more than 50 servers in the program, with additions planned later in the year.\nAll systems have been certified to provide optimized performance for AI applications, frameworks and domain-specific software development kits from Nvidia\u2019s NGC repository of GPU-accelerated software. Customers who buy certified systems will also receive enterprise support from Nvidia and OEM partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Nvidia Continues BlueField DPU Push With Servers, Application Support\nFollowing last year\u2019s reveal of Nvidia\u2019s roadmap for BlueField data processing units, the chipmaker continued its push for the new product category with details of a next-generation product, the first batch of certified servers that run DPUs and applications that will benefit from the component.\nNvidia said BlueField-3, which is due out in early 2022, will be capable of offloading up to 300 CPU cores\u2019 worth of networking, storage and security workloads in data centers. That\u2019s 10 times greater offload capability than the company\u2019s latest DPU in the market, BlueField-2.\nTo push adoption among enterprises, the chipmaker announced that Nvidia-certified servers with BlueField-2 DPUs are expected to arrive this year from ASUS, Dell Technologies, Gigabyte, QCT and Supermicro. The company also announced that Palo Alto Networks has designed its new virtual next-generation firewall to take advantage of BlueField DPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Nvidia A100 Breaks 16 AI Performance Records In MLPerf Benchmarks\nNvidia announced in July that its A100 broke 16 AI performance records in the latest MLPerf benchmarks for training, which the company said makes the data center GPU the fastest for training performance among commercially available products.\nThe company broke the records with its A100-powered DGX SuperPOD supercomputer, delivered lower training times than other commercially available solutions for the ResNet 50 image classification model, the NLP BERT model, the DLRM recommendation model and the Transformation translation model and MiniGo reinforcement learning model, among others.\nA few months earlier, Nvidia said that it set records in every category for the latest MLPerf benchmarks for inference, which included data center and edge categories. The company said it also demonstrated the ability to run all seven MLPerf Offline tests on a single GPU using the Multi-Instance GPU capability of its Ampere architecture, which showed nearly identical performance to a single GPU instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Nvidia\u2019s Enterprise Data Center Biz Grew Faster Than Hyperscale Biz For 1st Time\nNvidia reported in February that data center GPU sales through OEMs to vertical industries grew faster than revenue from hyperscalers for the first time in the company\u2019s history, marking what CEO Jensen Huang called the next wave of AI adoption.\nThe shift in sales during the chipmaker\u2019s fourth quarter of its 2021 fiscal year meant that organizations in verticals ranging from financial services and higher education had higher compute needs than some of the world\u2019s largest consumers of data center infrastructure, which include tech giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Google, at least for Nvidia\u2019s latest quarter.\n\u201cAll of these industries, whether you\u2019re in medical imaging or in lawn mowers, you\u2019re going to have data centers that are hosting your products, just like the [cloud service providers], and so that\u2019s a brand-new industry,\u201d Huang (pictured) said.\nDuring the May earnings call for Nvidia\u2019s first quarter of its 2022 fiscal year, Huang said that enterprises represented more than 50 percent of the company\u2019s data center business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Nvidia Launches Cambridge-1, U.K.\u2019s Fastest Supercomputer\nNvidia in July announced the launch of Cambridge-1, an A100-powered supercomputer in the United Kingdom that will be used to accelerate research for the life sciences industry.\nThe company said Cambridge-1 ranks among the world\u2019s 50 fastest supercomputers, and it was made possible by a $100 million investment from the chipmaker. The first organizations to take advantage of the supercomputer include AstraZeneca, GSK and King\u2019s College London, the latter of which will use the supercomputer to research brain diseases like dementia.\nThe Cambridge-1 is, at least in part, meant as a gesture of Nvidia\u2019s commitment to the U.K., where the chipmaker is set to acquire one of the country\u2019s most strategic companies, British chip designer Arm. The supercomputer is set to become a part of a new AI Center of Excellence in Cambridge, U.K., where Nvidia has plans to eventually launch an Arm-based supercomputer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Nvidia Makes Enterprise Push With New Software, GPUs\nNvidia is making its biggest push yet into enterprises this year with new software and GPU products for AI, 3D design and other GPU-accelerated applications.\nAt the top of the new offerings is Nvidia AI Enterprise, a suite of software that allows organizations to run GPU-accelerated applications in traditional data center infrastructure with VMware\u2019s vSphere virtualization platform. Servers in the Nvidia-Certified Systems program are all certified to run and deliver optimized performance for Nvidia AI Enterprise.\nOther enterprise software offerings announced this year include Nvidia Base Command, a cloud-hosted development hub that provides access to a wide range of AI and data science tools; Nvidia Fleet Command, a managed services platform for deploying and managing AI applications at the edge; and Nvidia Omniverse Enterprise, a 3D design collaboration platform that lets designers work together across multiple software suites in real time.\nNew GPUs for enterprises include the Nvidia A10, which supports a mix of AI and graphics workloads; the Nvidia A16, which accelerates virtual desktop infrastructure performance; and the Nvidia A30, which supports a broad range of AI inference and mainstream enterprise compute workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Nvidia Reveals Arm-Based Data Center CPU For AI, HPC\nNvidia on April 12 revealed an Arm-based data center CPU for AI and high-performance computing it said will provide 10 times faster AI performance than one of AMD\u2019s fastest EPYC CPUs, a move that will give the chipmaker control over compute, acceleration and networking components in servers.\nThe new data center CPU, named Grace after computing programming pioneer Grace Hopper, will create new competition for x86 CPU rivals Intel and AMD when it arrives in early 2023, the launch window Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang provided during the company\u2019s virtual GTC 2021 conference in April. The move comes as Nvidia seeks to close on its controversial $40 billion acquisition of Arm, whose CPU designs are being used for Grace.\nWith the introduction of CPUs to Nvidia\u2019s portfolio, Huang said its data center product roadmap will now consist of three product lines \u2014 GPUs, data processing units (DPUs) and CPUs \u2014 and each product line will receive an updated architecture every two years. In a new roadmap, Nvidia showed that a next-generation Grace CPU is due out around 2025 following the release of a third-generation Ampere GPU and a BlueField-4 DPU the year before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Nvidia Struggles To Fulfill Strong GPU Demand Amid Global Chip Shortage\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs have been selling so fast the company has struggled to keep up with demand, which has resulted in shortages, inflated prices and shifts in strategy for how the chipmaker sells the products.\nThe chipmaker was among the companies last year to enjoy a pandemic-induced surge in spending on PCs and data centers, resulting in record revenues. Fast forward to mid-2021, and that surge has not let up, particularly on the consumer side. That means GeForce GPUs from Nvidia and the company\u2019s add-in board partners are only available for minutes or even seconds when new stock comes online, which has prompted some retailers to instate lotteries.\nTo create a better balance of supply between gamers and cryptocurrency users, Nvidia has introduced new GeForce GPUs with diminished mining capabilities as well as a new line of purpose-built cryptocurrency mining processors.\nDuring Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings call in May, CFO Colette Kress said the company expects GPU supply to remain tight for the rest of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Nvidia-Arm Deal Faces Scrutiny From Regulators, Big Tech Companies\nNvidia\u2019s proposal to acquire British chip designer Arm for $40 billion is receiving scrutiny on multiple fronts, including in the United Kingdom, where the government\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority is undergoing an investigation into potential national security, competition and jurisdiction issues.\nThe U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority said it delivered its report on such concerns to Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden, who is now expected to make a decision on whether to clear the acquisition, clear it with certain conditions or call for a phase two investigation. At the same time, The Telegraph reported that the European Commission\u2019s decision on the deal could be delayed because the regulatory body has yet to receive necessary documents from Nvidia.\nThe Nvidia-Arm deal is reportedly facing scrutiny from Microsoft, Google and Qualcomm, the latter of which has voiced its opposition to the deal in comments to the Federal Trade Commission, the European Commission, the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority and China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation. In addition, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger recently reiterated in an interview with CRN that his company is concerned about Nvidia acquiring Arm. At the same time, chipmakers Broadcom, MediaTek and Marvell have all voiced support for the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Noyce Award at SIA Awards Dinner on Nov. 18\nWASHINGTON\u2014Aug. 12, 2021\u2014The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA and a trailblazer in building accelerated computing platforms, is the 2021 recipient of the industry\u2019s highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.\n\nSIA presents the Noyce Award annually in recognition of a leader who has made outstanding contributions to the semiconductor industry in technology or public policy. Huang will accept the award at the SIA Awards Dinner on Nov. 18, 2021.\n\u201cJensen Huang\u2019s extraordinary vision and tireless execution have greatly strengthened our industry, revolutionized computing, and advanced artificial intelligence,\u201d said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. \u201cJensen\u2019s accomplishments have fueled countless innovations \u2014 from gaming to scientific computing to self-driving cars \u2014 and he continues to advance technologies that will transform our industry and the world. We\u2019re pleased to recognize Jensen with the 2021 Robert N. Noyce Award for his many achievements in advancing semiconductor technology.\u201d\nHuang founded NVIDIA in 1993 and has served since its inception as CEO and a member of the board of directors. Starting out in 3D graphics, NVIDIA helped build the gaming market into the world\u2019s largest entertainment industry. More recently, NVIDIA ignited modern AI \u2014 the next era of computing \u2014 with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars.\nHuang is a recipient of the IEEE Founder\u2019s Medal, the Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award, and honorary doctorate degrees from Taiwan\u2019s National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University, and Oregon State University.

Hyperlinking will \u201cevolve into hyper-jumping between 3D worlds.\u201d\n\u201cLike games today, 3D worlds are experienced through 2D displays and TVs,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd, on occasion, with VR and AR glasses.\u201c\nThose ideas are already being put to work with NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for connecting 3D worlds into a shared virtual universe, or metaverse.\n\u201cThe opportunity of the metaverse is vast \u2014 larger than that of the physical world,\u201d NVIDIA Vice President for Omniverse and Simulation Rev Lebaredian told the audience at SIGGRAPH.\n\u201cJust like in the infancy of the internet, no one can predict exactly how and how large the metaverse will grow \u2014 but today, we know we can lay the foundations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat are metaverse applications?\u201d Huang asked. \u201cThey\u2019re already here.\u201d\n\nFashion designers, furniture and goods makers, and retailers offer virtual 3D products you can try with augmented reality, he explained.\nTelcos are creating digital twins of their radio networks to optimize and deploy radio towers, Huang said.\nCompanies are creating \u201cdigital twins\u201d of warehouses and factories to optimize their layout and logistics, he added.\nAnd \u201cNVIDIA is building a digital twin of the Earth to predict the climate decades into the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe metaverse will grow organically as the internet did \u2014 continuously and simultaneously across all industries, but exponentially, because of computing\u2019s compounding and network effects,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cAnd, as with the internet, the metaverse is a computing platform that requires a new programming model, a new computing architecture and new standards,\u201d Huang said.\nBMW Group uses NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise to create a future factory, a perfect \u201cdigital twin\u201d designed entirely in digital and simulated from beginning to end in NVIDIA Omniverse.\nHow NVIDIA Omniverse Creates, Connects Worlds Within the Metaverse\nSo how does Omniverse work?\nNVIDIA Omniverse weaves together the Universal Scene Description interchange\u00a0framework invented by Pixar with technologies for modeling physics, materials and real-time path tracing.\nOmniverse is built on USD, or Universal Scene Description, an interchange framework invented by Pixar in 2012.\nReleased as open-source software in 2016, USD provides a rich, common language for defining, packaging, assembling and editing 3D data for a growing array of industries and applications.\nLebaredian and others say USD is to the emerging metaverse what hypertext markup language, or HTML, was to the web \u2014 a common language that can be used, and advanced, to support the metaverse.\nOmniverse is a platform built from the ground up to be physically based. Thanks to NVIDIA RTX graphics technologies, it is fully path traced, simulating how each ray of light bounces around a virtual world in real time.\nOmniverse simulates physics with NVIDIA PhysX. It simulates materials with NVIDIA MDL, or material definition language.\nBuilt in NVIDIA Omniverse Marbles at Night is a physics-based demo created with dynamic, ray-traced lights and over 100 million polygons.\nAnd Omniverse is fully integrated with NVIDIA AI, which is key to advancing robotics.\nOmniverse is cloud native, scales across multiple GPUs, runs on any RTX platform and streams remotely to any device.\nYou can teleport into Omniverse with virtual reality, and AIs can teleport out of Omniverse with augmented reality.\nMetaverse Made Real\u00a0\nNVIDIA released Omniverse to open beta in December 2020 and NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise in November 2021. Professionals in a wide variety of industries quickly put it to work.\nAnd industrial manufacturing leader Siemens and NVIDIA are already collaborating to accelerate industrial automation.\nThe partnership brings together Siemens Xcelerator\u2019s vast industrial ecosystem and NVIDIA Omniverse\u2019s AI-enabled, physically accurate, real-time virtual world engine. This will enable full-design-fidelity, live digital twins that connect software-defined AI systems from edge to cloud.\n\nVisual effects pioneer Industrial Light & Magic is testing Omniverse to bring together internal and external tool pipelines from multiple studios.\nOmniverse lets them collaborate, render final shots in real time and create massive virtual sets like holodecks.\n\nMultinational networking and telecommunications company Ericsson uses Omniverse to simulate 5G wave propagation in real time, minimizing multi-path interference in dense city environments.\nInfrastructure engineering software company Bentley Systems is using Omniverse to create a suite of applications on the platform. Bentley\u2019s iTwin platform creates a 4D infrastructure digital twin to simulate an infrastructure asset\u2019s construction, then monitor and optimize its performance throughout its lifecycle.\nThe Metaverse Can Help Humans and Robots Collaborate\u00a0\nThese virtual worlds are ideal for training robots.\nOne of the essential features of NVIDIA Omniverse is that it obeys the laws of physics. Omniverse can simulate particles and fluids, materials and even machines, right down to their springs and cables.\n\nModeling the natural world in a virtual one is a fundamental capability for robotics.\nIt allows users to create a virtual world where robots \u2014 powered by AI brains that can learn from their real or digital environments \u2014 can train.\nOnce the minds of these robots are trained using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, roboticists can load those brains onto an NVIDIA Jetson edge AI module, and connect them to real robots.\nThose robots will come in all sizes and shapes \u2014 box movers, pick-and-place arms, forklifts, cars, trucks and even buildings.\nIn the future, a factory will be a robot, orchestrating many robots inside, building cars that are robots themselves.\nHow the Metaverse, and NVIDIA Omniverse, Enable Digital Twins\u00a0\nNVIDIA Omniverse provides a description for these shared worlds that people and robots can connect to \u2014 and collaborate in \u2014 to better work together.\nIt\u2019s an idea that automaker BMW Group is already putting to work.\nThe automaker produces more than 2 million cars a year. In its most advanced factory, the company makes a car every minute. And each vehicle is customized differently.\nBMW Group is using NVIDIA Omniverse to create a future factory, a perfect \u201cdigital twin.\u201d\nIt\u2019s designed entirely in digital and simulated from beginning to end in Omniverse.\n\nThe Omniverse-enabled factory can connect to enterprise resource planning systems, simulating the factory\u2019s throughput. It can simulate new plant layouts. It can even become the dashboard for factory employees, who can uplink into a robot to teleoperate it.\nThe AI and software that run the virtual factory are the same as what will run the physical one. In other words, the virtual and physical factories and their robots will operate in a loop. They\u2019re twins.\nNo Longer Science Fiction\u00a0\nAnd the hardware needed to run it is here now.\nComputer makers worldwide are building NVIDIA-Certified workstations and laptops, which all have been validated for running GPU-accelerated workloads with optimum performance, reliability and scale.\nAnd in the data center, NVIDIA OVX computer systems, announced in March, can power large-scale digital twins. NVIDIA OVX is purpose-built to operate complex digital twin simulations that will run within NVIDIA Omniverse.\nOVX will be used to simulate complex digital twins for modeling entire buildings, factories, cities and even the world.\nBack to the Future\u00a0\nSo what\u2019s next?\nThe metaverse is \u201cthe next era in the evolution of the internet \u2014 a 3D spatial overlay of the web \u2014 linking the digital world to our physical world,\u201d Lebaradian said.\nIn this new iteration of the internet, websites will become interconnected 3D spaces akin to the world we live in and experience every day, he explained.\n\u201cMany of these virtual worlds will be reflections of the real world, linked and synchronized in real-time,\u201d he added.\nMany of these virtual worlds will be designed for entertainment, socializing and gaming-matching the real world\u2019s laws of physics in some cases, but often choosing to break them to make the experience more \u201cfun.\u201d\nExtended reality (XR) devices and robots will act as portals between our physical world and virtual worlds.\n\u201cHumans will portal into a virtual world with VR and AR devices, while AIs will portal out to our world via physical robots,\u201d Lebaradian said.\nLearn more about the metaverse on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AEC | CloudXR | Digital Twin | Game Development | Industrial and Manufacturing | Media and Entertainment | Metaverse | NVIDIA RTX | Scientific Visualization | SIGGRAPH 2021 | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Formerly a railway that was used to transport goods between Singapore and Malaysia, the Rail Corridor has been enhanced by National Parks Board (NParks) with a focus on three themes \u2014 heritage & culture, biodiversity & greenery, and recreation \u2014 to create \u201cmeaningful experiences for everyone\u201d.  Some elements of the central route have already been gazetted for conservation. The central route stretches from the Bukit Timah truss bridge at Hillview at one end, to the Upper Bukit Timah truss bridge at King Albert Park at the other. Known to be popular photography spots, both steel bridges have been gazetted for conservation since 2015. The old Bukit Timah Railway Station, gazetted for conservation since 2011, is currently undergoing refurbishment.

Its authentic Fujian cuisine include signature dishes such as Prawn Ball Ngo Hiang, Fujian Fried Noodles (Hokkien Mee), Oyster Omelette and Braised Pork Bun (Kung Bak Pao), which generations of Singaporeans grew up eating. (See also: Commercial shophouse in Thomson for sale at $6.5 mil) As Singapore continues to battle the Covid pandemic, a vicious cycle of shutdown, reopening at reduced capacity, and shutdown, has exacted a toll on restaurants. It has claimed many victims over the past 1\u00bd years. Even heritage names have not been spared. Swee Kee Eating House on Amoy Street closed at the end of May. Famous for its Cantonese-style fish soup, Swee Kee was founded in the 1930s. Yet Con Restaurant on Purvis Street closed last year. The Hainanese hotpot restaurant first opened in 1940. Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant at Keppel Road, one of only two revolving restaurants in Singapore, closed last year, after operating for 43 years.  The demise of these heritage names has made the owners of Beng Thin more determined to keep their family legacy alive. \u201cWe are doing the business to preserve the name of Beng Thin,\u201d says Lim Lai Lai, on behalf of her siblings, who are the second-generation owners of the restaurant. \u201cThat is our priority.\u201d She believes it is timely to draw from the lessons learnt from the struggles of the previous generation of immigrants to Singapore, like her father, Lim Yew Hoon, who founded Beng Thin in 1949. \u201cWhen Beng Thin started, it struggled too, just as Singapore struggled after the World War II and before its independence,\u201d says Lim.

He came from Quanzhou, a port city in Fujian province, and arrived in Singapore penniless and hungry for a better life. His only work experience had been helping out in kitchens and cooking in restaurants back in Quanzhou. When he first arrived, he found shelter at lodgings operated by one of the Hokkien clan associations for new migrants. They could live rent-free until they found a job. After they found a job, they only needed to pay a nominal rent of $2 a month.   Story continues For 1\u00bd years after he arrived, he could not find any permanent work. \u201cHe did whatever odd jobs that came along, but couldn\u2019t find a permanent job,\u201d recounts Lim. He even took up a job as a painter, even though he could not paint then, but that landed him full-time employment. His income improved from 70 cents a day to $1.20 a day.When he earned 70 cents a day, he would limit his daily expenses to 20 cents a day, and save the rest. Once he hit the daily limit of 20 cents, even if he had not had his meal, he would rather starve for the rest of the day. He continued that strict discipline even after he had a permanent job. \u201cHe continued to scrimp and save, so that he could start his own business,\u201d relates Lim. \u201cBy the age of 22, he knew he wanted to be a business owner.\u201dTo save money, he would buy a loaf of bread and cut into three portions \u2014 for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If he was still hungry, he would fill himself up by drinking water. The only indulgence he allowed himself was cigarettes. Even then, he would cut each cigarette into three, to make them last longer.Eventually, he saved enough to start a business with three other chefs. \u201cMost people would start by opening a hawker stall or coffeeshop first, instead of a full-fledged restaurant,\u201d says Lim. \u201cBut he wanted to open a restaurant right from the start.\u201d  The original Hokien Street, built in the 1820s, is one of the oldest streets in Singapore (Photo: Beng Thin Hoon Kee website)Shophouse at Hokien StreetThe elder Lim and his three partners rented the ground floor of a shophouse along Hokien Street, and opened Beng Thin in 1949. He was 26 years old then. \u201cThe early years were a struggle, as it was after World War II, and times were tough,\u201d says Lim.The partners chose Hokien Street, so named because it was the main settlement of the Hokkien immigrants, the largest of the four dialect groups in Singapore. Built in the 1820s, Hokien Street is one of the oldest streets in Singapore. Today, Hokien Street is a pedestrianised walkway between Great Eastern Centre commercial building and the shophouses that make up Nankin Row. (See: Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory)As the business struggled in the early years, the other three partners decided to sell their shares to the elder Lim and left. \u201cUnlike my father who was still single then, the other partners were married with children, so they found it difficult to continue while supporting their families,\u201d says Lim.The elder Lim did not have enough money to buy out the other partners, so he asked his father in China to help. With his father\u2019s help, he managed to buy out the other three partners\u2019 shares, and became the sole owner of the restaurant. That was when he added his name in, and the restaurant became Beng Thin Hoon Kee, as it is known today.Following the departure of his partners, the elder Lim realised he needed help in the kitchen. He recalled a chef in Quanzhou whom he had worked for, and contacted him to ask if he would like to come over to Singapore to help him with the business. Fortunately, the chef was not working at that time, and agreed to come to Singapore to help him. And he remained with Beng Thin until he passed away. \u201cMy father was destined to succeed,\u201d says Lim. \u201cHe always had people who helped him along the way.\u201dIn the initial years, a lot of the business came from referrals and by word of mouth. \u201cThere was one particular banker who really helped him a lot,\u201d relates Lim. \u201cThis person was a bank teller who knew a lot of people and introduced them to the restaurant. My father said he would always be grateful to this person.\u201d  The 52-storey OCBC Centre, once Singapore\u2019s tallest skyscraper, showing the carpark podium and the open rooftop carpark on the fifth floor, where Beng Thin Hoon Kee Restaurant is located (Photo: The Edge Singapore)Upwards to Singapore\u2019s tallest skyscraper of the 1970s-80sThe business became so successful that the elder Lim decided to expand the restaurant from one unit to two adjoining units. As the restaurant became famous, many landlords approached the elder Lim about moving to their building. \u201cBut my dad always said no,\u201d says Lim.That is, until he was approached by Tan Chin Tuan, the former chairman of OCBC Bank, who was a regular customer of Beng Thin. At that time, the 52-storey OCBC Centre was the tallest skyscraper in Singapore. It was the first high-rise structure in Singapore to be designed by an international architect, namely IM Pei. The building opened on Oct 1, 1976, and remains a landmark at the Raffles Place financial district today.The novelty of the building was the restaurant unit at the rooftop carpark on the fifth floor of the skyscraper. The previous tenant, also a Chinese restaurant, had failed. Hence, Tan invited Beng Thin to move in. \u201cMy father hesitated, but Tan Chin Tuan made it possible with favourable rents and terms,\u201d Lim relates. \u201cThere were so few restaurants in those days, and we were the only authentic Fujian restaurant in the financial district. So my father agreed.\u201dBeng Thin moved into its premises of more than 5,000 sq ft at the carpark of OCBC Centre in 1979, and has been there since. \u201cAfter we moved in, business flourished,\u201d relates Lim. Customers included the Who\u2019s Who in Singapore, from businessmen to politicians and movie stars \u2014 the likes of Hong Kong actors Jackie Chan and Fung Bo Bo, as well as Chinese-turned-Singaporean, Gong Li.Lim\u2019s mother, Jenny Wong, helped in the business too. While the elder Lim was humble, shy and soft-spoken, his wife was \u201cgutsy and outgoing\u201d, says Lim. \u201cEven though she didn\u2019t speak English very well, she wasn\u2019t afraid to speak to the expatriates who came to our restaurant,\u201d she recounts. \u201cGiven our location in the financial district, we had a lot of expatriate customers too.\u201dOn weekdays, the office crowd frequented the restaurant for lunch. In the evenings, the customers went there to meet friends or clients, or to celebrate a corporate or family event. On weekends, the business came from families, typically comprising three generations. There were birthdays, anniversaries and even wedding celebrations. Not only did they have wedding dinners at the restaurant, Beng Thin did private dining and catering too.  Lim Yew Hoon, founder of Beng Thin Hoon Kee Restaurant and his wife, Jenny Wong. The couple has eight children, four sons and four daughters. The two elder sons and two elder daughters are now running the businessSecond generationThe elder Lim officially retired from the business on Oct 1, 1987, and handed over the business to his children. He and his wife have eight children \u2014 four sons and four daughters. The two elder sons were roped into the business when they were young, and learnt to cook from the chefs. They helm the kitchen today, and ensure that the quality of the food is consistent. Meanwhile, the two elder daughters also joined the business in the mid-1980s. Lim joined the business a few years after she graduated in 1984.\u201cWe were handed the business on a silver platter,\u201d recalls Lim. \u201cBut it\u2019s very important that we run the business properly and make sure that the name Beng Thin lives on.\u201dTo be sure, there were ups and downs along the way. There was the recession in the mid-1980s, the Asian Financial Crisis in 1996/97, the bursting of the dotcom bubble followed by the recession in 2001/02, SARS in 2003, and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/09. Beng Thin has weathered all these crises well.However, Covid-19 and the recent return to Phase Two (Heightened Alert), from July 22 to Aug 18, \u201cis a time to pause and think about things; and to pivot if we have to\u201d, says Lim.Since only food delivery is allowed for now, Lim wants to focus on ensuring that when the food arrives at the customer\u2019s place, \u201cit\u2019s still restaurant quality, and still hot\u201d, she says. \u201cThe packaging is really important, and we put a lot of effort into that.\u201d As it is a family restaurant, she also wants to ensure that the portions are generous. \u201cWhen it comes to food delivery, you only get one chance: if someone receives the food and they are not happy with it, we won\u2019t get a repeat customer,\u201d she adds.And this is where Beng Thin stands out: \u201cFortunately, we have a lot of regular customers, and they have been ordering our food delivery for 1\u00bd years already,\u201d says Lim. She is now thinking of adding some new dishes to the menu, on top of the traditional favourites.It has been a long journey for the second generation that is managing Beng Thin. \u201cTo me, running this business is like a marathon \u2014 we really want to go on for another 70 years,\u201d Lim says.Check out the latest listings near Hokien Street, OCBC Centre, Chulia Street, Raffles Place, Great Eastern CentreSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) The Executive Centre unveils new flagship space at One Raffles Quay JLL\u2019s Chris Archibold: CBD occupiers see light at the end of the tunnel CBD Grade A office rents reach turning point in 2Q2021: Colliers En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

OPEC+ Gradually Unwinds Supply Curbs The alliance, looking to shore up crude prices from the coronavirus-induced depths due to demand destruction, started to withhold output by almost 10 million barrels per day \u2014 the largest in history \u2014 from May last year. The initial reduction lasted three months. Beginning August, the production cap was relaxed to 7.7 million barrels per day through the remainder of the year. Continuing with its oil price support mechanism, the group agreed to increase output by 500,000 barrels a day from January 2021 instead of the pre-scheduled 2 million barrels per day.On a further positive note and to nearly everyone\u2019s surprise, Riyadh pledged to reduce the oil output by 1 million barrels per day in February and March, thereby pumping for two months at levels below the production limit fixed under the OPEC+ agreement. The deeper cuts by the world\u2019s largest oil exporter also helped to offset Russia and Kazakhstan\u2019s combined addition of 75,000 barrels per day to the market.In March, the OPEC+ alliance decided to continue withholding production by around 7 million barrels per day (or about 7% of the global consumption) through April. Moreover, OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia pledged to extend its voluntary supply curbs of 1 million barrels per day.Over the next two meetings, the group stuck to its previous plans to slightly relax output curbs from May through July. The producer alliance decided to return 2.1 million barrels per day of production (including Saudi Arabia\u2019s unilateral cuts) to the market during this period, easing curtailments to around 6 million barrels per day.In July, the coalition decided to hike production by 400,000 barrels a day every month from August through late 2022 until all of its halted production has been brought back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0It must be mentioned that the existing curbs have been instrumental in lifting a barrel of crude from the negative territory to around $70 now, in between hitting a more than six-year high of $76.98 in July. Demand Recovery Underway Apart from the OPEC+ cartel\u2019s calibrated production policy, oil\u2019s sharp rebound has been driven by continued vaccine-related developments and their successful deployment around the world, leading to an earlier-than-expected pickup in demand. The stalled prospect of renewed Iranian exports, marked improvement in U.S. gasoline consumption, the ongoing government stimulus, and an improving situation in the world\u2019s second-largest oil consumer, China, following a resurgence in infections, are the other positives in the oil story. In particular, much of the bullish argument is simply a bet on stronger economic growth in the Western markets and the subsequent improvement in consumer spending.In fact, demand is set to surpass the pre-pandemic threshold of 100 million barrels per day once again next year, especially with most individuals resuming activities post vaccination and pent-up consumption starting to take effect. The upbeat demand picture has boosted the OPEC+ group\u2019s confidence in the commodity\u2019s medium-term outlook. The coalition believes that with restrictions being lifted in most of Europe and the United States, and people taking to the road with a vengeance, the record storage glut from 2020 is likely to be eliminated sooner than later.   Story Continues Supported by Shale\u2019s Restrained Drilling ProgramsAt the same time, one has to remember that the rise in oil prices might open the door for U.S. shale operators that were forced to dial back production in response to the decimation in demand and prices. In other words, OPEC\u2019s strategy to revive oil markets is dependent on all-round production restraint. The primary risk to this comes from the U.S. shale patch whose constituents are quick to pick up drilling activities on any steep rise in the price.Yet, this time, the companies seem to be in no hurry to boost output. Finally, learning their lesson, shale operators are focusing primarily on improving cost and increasing free cash flow rather than looking at boosting production. While oil at $70 is profitable for almost all shale entities, the industry, for its part, is sticking to the mantra of capital discipline and sustainable production.According to the weekly data provided by Houston-based Baker Hughes BKR, the last time that WTI crude traded at these levels, more than 850 oil rigs were operational. Now, it\u2019s just 410, which is proof of the wariness on the part of the producers to raise production too quickly.The Cartel to Maintain Its CommitmentDespite some downside risks associated with the Delta variant-induced demand concerns, the Oil/Energy market is on the mend with a supportive macro backdrop and robust fundamentals. Crude supplies are now at their lowest levels since January 2020, with U.S. commercial stockpiles down nearly 14% since mid-March. There is also a marked improvement in gasoline demand on the back of rebounding road and airline travel even as U.S. shale producers stick to austerity. In fact, the last four-week average for petroleum demand is 21 million barrels a day, 13.4% above the year-ago levels and the highest since March last year. This bodes well for oil prices for the remainder of 2021.The tightening demand-supply outlook means that OPEC+ will most likely choose to boost output by the scheduled 400,000 barrels a day next month. With the Delta variant of COVID-19 seemingly under control, the group appears to be reasonably confident about the trajectory of demand, which should be enough to absorb the additional crude.Watch the E&P SpaceThe volatile oil exploration and production companies will be the most affected by the OPEC meeting\u2019s outcome, as their fortunes are tied to commodity price fluctuation.

To push as many pixels as possible you\u2019re going to want the fastest graphics card you can afford\u2014but ever-shifting prices and product lineups make it difficult to keep track of what\u2019s available, especially in the midst of a crippling GPU shortage.\nIn honor of keeping frame rates high, we decided to rank all the major available discrete GPUs from Nvidia GeForce and AMD Radeon, starting with the fastest graphics card available and working on down. This list focuses on each company\u2019s most current GPU lineups, and doesn\u2019t include significantly older graphics cards. You\u2019ll find all GeForce RTX 20- and 30-series offerings, however, as well as AMD\u2019s last two graphics card generations.\n\nPrice to performance is\u00a0not a consideration here\u2014just pure performance. Concrete example: The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is technically more powerful than the GeForce RTX 3070, and hence higher on this list, but it\u2019s essentially tied in performance and the newer GeForce option is significantly cheaper at its recommended price, making it a better buy. That said, finding graphics cards anywhere near MSRP is extremely rare during the GPU shortage, so this guide can be used to help you wrap your head around the relative performance of any recent graphics cards you might manage to find, new or used.\nWe\u2019ve verified this information through hours of blood, sweat, and benchmarking. Feel free to hit up the individual reviews to see our work in greater detail. Or, if you want more concrete buying advice for your specific budget or display resolution, be sure to read our guide to the best graphics cards for gaming. It provides much more information than this simple list, complete with discussion about considerations like value, various form factors, and what to look for in a customized model.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut if you just want to know if GPU A is faster than GPU B, starting with the current consumer gaming champion, read on. The higher up a graphics card is on this list, the faster and more powerful it is.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was last updated to add the Radeon RX 6600 XT, GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, and RTX 3080 Ti\u00a0to the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,829.99 at

It's a relatively understood proposition for gamers, not unlike DLSS or FidelityFX Super Resolution, but we also know Intel intends to offer this frame rate-boosting technology on its competitors' GPUs.Exactly which competitors' graphics cards will benefit from the technology will come down to support for DP4A instructions.So let's get right into the thick of it. On Intel Alchemist GPUs, Intel XeSS will operate through XMX acceleration\u2014specific matrix engines built into the architecture that perform a role similar to that of Nvidia's Tensor Cores. It's this deep learning acceleration that'll help XeSS boost your performance in-game.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAMD's FSR 4 will use machine learning but requires an RDNA 4 GPU, promises 'a dramatic improvement in terms of performance and quality'\n\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows will let you take your pick from the frame gen and upscaling buffet as 'a mix and match approach is possible'\n\n\n\nFor non-Intel Xe-HPG graphics cards, however, this acceleration can instead be done through DP4A instructions at a somewhat greater expense (meaning it won't be quite as performant as XMX-accelerated XeSS). These DP4A instructions are used to multiply 8-bit integers (one byte, INT8) accumulated into one 32-bit integer and then run on a GPU's ALUs. These are also used to accelerate certain operations that do not require high precision, i.e. deep learning.Modern GPUs support DP4A (Signed Integer Dot-Product of 4 Elements and Accumulate) in line with Microsoft Shader Model 6.4, while other older GPUs don't. That means some GPUs can accelerate certain instructions required by XeSS, while others are unable to.Swipe to scroll horizontallyExpected XeSS compatibilityArchitectureCompatibleIntel Xe-HPGYes - XMX (confirmed)Intel Xe-LPYes - DP4A (confirmed)Older Intel architectures (Gen 11, Gen 9)NoAMD RDNA 2Yes - DP4A (confirmed)AMD RDNANoAMD VegaNoAMD Vega 7nmPossible - DP4AAMD PolarisNoNvidia AmpereYes - DP4ANvidia TuringYes - DP4ANvidia PascalYes - DP4AOlder Nvidia architecturesNoAMD has confirmed that RDNA 2 graphics cards support DP4A, in a comment to ComputerBase. This is achieved through Rapid Packed Math, a feature originally introduced with AMD's Vega architecture, though AMD says it's only the RX-6000 series that will support DP4A instructions.You don't only have to take AMD's word for it; the RDNA 1 ISA reference guide [PDF warning] does not list DP4A compatibility, nor does first-gen Vega. While the RDNA 2 guide notes \"Dot product ALU operations added accelerate inference and deep-learning\" as a feature change with the more recent architecture.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It's worth noting that 7nm Vega, found within the Radeon VII, lists support for DP4A operations, which could mean it too supports XeSS and owners of that card can finally feel justified in purchasing it instead of an RX 5700 XT.Intel does not expect a major performance loss between XMX acceleration and DP4A. (Image credit: Intel)Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restAMD does, however, note that older GPUs may in theory be able to run XeSS on FP32/FP16 ALUs, but this would be slower. We'll probably never find out if that's the case, though, as Intel has already largely shot down a more general FP32/FP16 implementation of XeSS in a recent interview with WCCFTech, citing possible performance questions.\u00a0I've reached out to AMD for any further clarification on DP4A support and will update this article if I hear anything back.Onwards to Nvidia, and it appears that the company's Ampere and Turing architectures will support DP4A. No qualms there. In fact, the Pascal architecture should also support DP4A, actually as the first architecture to support the instruction for team green.This is potentially great news for 10-series owners, as Nvidia's own DLSS technology is supported only on 20-series RTX cards or newer.In the aforementioned interview, Intel's Karthik Vaidyanathan also states it will not be looking to program specifically for Nvidia's Tensor Cores as that would require bespoke programming.I've also reached out to Nvidia to see if it will share any more information on supported GPUs.\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nAs for older Intel kit, it appears that Xe-LP based iGPUs found in 11th Gen mobile chips should support the instruction and therefore work with XeSS. I've not seen any evidence to prove any previous iGPUs or desktop iGPU models will be supported, however, so as far as I'm concerned today the cut-off will be more recent Intel Xe-based chips.Still, it's looking like large numbers of older discrete graphics cards will be open to using Intel's XeSS technology. That should be a big win for Intel's technology, but does rely on it being able to deliver higher frame rates without too much loss in clarity, even with DP4A over XMX. Success will also rely on game support, too, and Nvidia has a multi-year head start in that regard.If it all goes Intel's way, though, XeSS is sure to crank up the pressure on AMD and Nvidia.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Now NVIDIA introduces a new graphics card, RTX A2000, designed for everyday workflows, so professionals can develop photorealistic renderings, build physically accurate simulations and use AI-accelerated tools.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU is not just another graphics card added to the lineup, but NVIDIA\u2019s most powerful low-profile, dual-slot GPU for professionals. The new desktop GPU encompasses all the latest RTX technologies in a compact form factor designed to fit a wide range of standard and small-form-factor workstations, so it becomes easier to access RTX from anywhere.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A2000 features the latest technologies in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture:\n\nSecond-Generation RT Cores: Real-time ray tracing for all professional workflows. Up to 5x the rendering performance from the previous generation with RTX on.\nThird-Generation Tensor Cores: Available in the GPU architecture to enable AI-augmented tools and applications.\nCUDA Cores: Up to 2x the FP32 throughput of the previous generation for significant increases in graphics and compute workloads.\nUp to 6GB of GPU Memory: Supports ECC memory, the first time that NVIDIA has enabled ECC memory in its 2000 series GPUs, for error-free computing.\nPCIe Gen 4: Double the throughput with more than 40 percent bandwidth improvement from the previous generation for accelerating data paths in and out of the GPU.\n\nWith remote work part of the new normal, simultaneous collaboration with colleagues on projects across the globe is critical. NVIDIA RTX technology powers Omniverse, NVIDIA\u2019s own collaboration and simulation platform that enables teams to iterate together on a single 3D design in real time while working across different software applications. The A2000 will serve as a portal into this world for millions of designers, says the company.\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 arrives in October\nFor on-the-go creators, the NVIDIA RTX A2000 laptop GPU \u2014 available in Studio laptops is the most power-efficient, professional RTX laptop GPU bringing ray tracing and AI capabilities to thin and light mobile workstations. The NVIDIA RTX A2000 desktop GPU will be available in workstations from manufacturers including ASUS, BOXX Technologies, Dell Technologies, HP and Lenovo as well as NVIDIA\u2019s global distribution partners starting in October.\nAt the SIGGRAPH 2021 virtual conference NVIDIA also revealed new developments for its NVIDIA Omniverse. As part of that expansion the company announced that Blender, the world\u2019s leading open-source 3D animation application, will include support for Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) in the Blender 3.0 release, enabling artists to use the application with NVIDIA Omniverse production pipelines.\nNVIDIA and Adobe are collaborating on a new Substance 3D plugin that will enable Substance Material support in Omniverse. With the plugin, materials created in Adobe Substance 3D or imported from the Substance 3D Asset Library can be adjusted directly in Omniverse, saving 3D artists valuable time.\nA new Omniverse extension GANverse3D \u2013 Image2Car is being announced, making 3D modeling easier with AI. This was built on a generative adversarial network trained on 2D photos, synthesizing multiple views of thousands of objects to predict 3D geometry, texture and part segmentation labels.\nOmniverse and new Studio Driver\nNVIDIA also shared during SIGGRAPH 2021 news about exciting updates to cutting-edge creative apps shipped recently. The August Studio Driver, available August 10, sharpens support for all of them.\n\nTopaz Sharpen AI v3.2 offers refinements to AI models accelerated by RTX GPUs and Tensor Cores, adding 1.5x motion blur and Too Soft/Very Blurry features further reducing artifacts. In-app masking has also been improved with real-time processing of mask strokes and customization controls for the overlay display.\n\n\nReallusion Character Creator v3.43, the first third-party app with Audio2Face integration, now allows artists to export characters from Character Creator to Omniverse as USD files with Audio2Face-compliant meshes. This allows facial and lip animations to be completely AI-driven solely from voice input, regardless of language, simplifying the process of animating a 3D character.\n\n\nCapture One 21 v14.3.0 adds a new Magic Brush tool to create complex masks for layer editing based on image content in a split second, working on an underlying processed image from the raw file. This process is hardware accelerated and is up to 3x faster when using the GPU compared to the CPU.\n\nDuring the virtual NVIDIA SIGGRAPH presentation the company shared the special address Graphics, AI and the Emergence of Shared Worlds, and also debuted the documentary, Connecting in the Metaverse: The Making of the GTC Keynote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport ProVideo Coalition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShop with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmtools\nFilmmakers go-to destination for pre-production, production & post production equipment!\nShop Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia RTX\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNVIDIA RTX A2000\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSIGGRAPH 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat Do You Think?

The Google file system (GFS) partitioned, distributed, and replicated file data across the data nodes in a cluster. MapReduce distributed computation across the data nodes in a cluster: users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Both the GFS and MapReduce were designed for fault tolerance by failing over to another node for data or processing.\n\nReference: MapReduce Google White Paper\nA year after Google published a white paper describing the MapReduce framework, Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella created Apache Hadoop.\u00a0\nHowever, Hadoop performance is bottlenecked by its model of checkpointing results to disk. At the same time, Hadoop adoption has been hindered by the low-level programming model of MapReduce. Data pipelines and iterative algorithms require chaining multiple MapReduce jobs together, which can be difficult to program and cause a lot of reading and writing to disk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Spark Makes Big Data Processing Faster and Easier\nApache Spark started as a research project at UC Berkeley in the AMPLab, became a top level Apache Software Foundation project in 2014, and is now maintained by a community of hundreds of developers from hundreds of organizations. Spark was developed with the goal of keeping the benefits of MapReduce\u2019s scalable, distributed, fault-tolerant processing framework, while making it more efficient and easier to use. Spark is more efficient than MapReduce for data pipelines and iterative algorithms because it caches data in memory across iterations and uses lighter weight threads. Spark also provides a richer functional programming model than MapReduce.\u00a0\u00a0\nDistributed Datasheet\n\nSpark mitigated the I/O problems found in Hadoop, but now the bottleneck has shifted from I/O to compute for a growing number of applications. This performance bottleneck has been thwarted with the advent of GPU-accelerated computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPUs Accelerate Computer Processing\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) are popular for their extraordinarily low price per flop (performance) and are addressing the compute performance bottleneck today by speeding up multi-core servers for parallel processing.\u00a0\nA CPU consists of a few cores, optimized for sequential serial processing. Whereas, a GPU has a massively parallel architecture consisting of thousands of smaller, more efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously. GPUs are capable of processing data much faster than configurations containing CPUs alone.\n\nOnce large amounts of data need to be broadcasted, aggregated, or collected across nodes in a cluster, the network can become a bottleneck. GPUDirect Remote direct memory access with the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library can solve this bottleneck by allowing GPUs to communicate directly with each other, across nodes, for faster multi-GPU and multi-node reduction operations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe benefits of GPUDirect RDMA are also critical for large, complex extract, transform, load (ETL) workloads, allowing them to operate as if they were on one massive server.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU-Accelerated Data Science Powered by RAPIDS\nA key component of data science is data exploration. Preparing a data set for ML requires understanding the data set, cleaning and manipulating data types and formats, and extracting features for the learning algorithm. These tasks are grouped under the term ETL. ETL is often an iterative, exploratory process. As data sets grow, the interactivity of this process suffers when running on CPUs.\nGPUs have been responsible for the advancement of deep learning (DL) in the past several years, while ETL and traditional ML workloads continued to be written in Python, often with single-threaded tools like Scikit-Learn or large, multi-CPU distributed solutions like Spark.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRAPIDS is a suite of open-source software libraries and APIs for executing end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs, achieving speedup factors of 50X or more on typical end-to-end data science workflows. RAPIDS accelerates the entire data science pipeline, including data loading, enabling more productive, interactive, and exploratory workflows.\u00a0\nBuilt on top of NVIDIA\u00ae CUDA\u00ae, an architecture and software platform for GPU computing, RAPIDS exposes GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly APIs. RAPIDS focuses on common data preparation tasks for analytics and data science, offering a powerful GPU DataFrame that is compatible with ApacheArrow data structures with a familiar DataFrame API.\nApache Arrow specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format, optimized for data locality, to accelerate analytical processing performance on modern CPUs or GPUs, and provides zero-copy streaming messaging and interprocess communication without serialization overhead.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe DataFrame API integrates with a variety of ML algorithms without incurring typical serialization and deserialization costs, enabling end-to-end pipeline accelerations.\u00a0\n\nBy hiding the complexities of low-level CUDA programming, RAPIDS creates a simple way to execute data science tasks. As more data scientists use Python and other high-level languages, providing acceleration with minimal to no code change is essential to rapidly improving development time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting Data Science Frameworks with GPUs and the RAPIDS Library\nAnother way RAPIDS accelerates development is with integration to leading data science frameworks, such as PyTorch, Chainer, and ApacheMxNet for DL and distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark and Dask for seamless scaling from GPU workstations to multi-GPU servers and multi-node clusters. Also, products such as BlazingSQL, an open source SQL engine, are being built on top of RAPIDS, adding even more accelerated capabilities for users.\nApache Spark 3.x empowers GPU applications by providing user APIs and configurations to easily request and utilize GPUs and is now extensible to allow columnar processing on the GPU; all of which wasn\u2019t supported prior to Spark 3.x. Internally, Spark added GPU scheduling, further integration with the cluster managers (YARN, Kubernetes, etc.) to request GPUs, and plugin points to allow it to be extended to run operations on the GPU. This makes GPUs easier to request and use for Spark application developers, allows for closer integration with DL and AI frameworks, such as Horovod and TensorFlow on Spark, and allows for better utilization of GPUs. This extensibility also allows columnar processing, which opens up the possibility for users to add plugins that accelerate queries using the GPU.\nLater in this eBook, we explore how the Apache Spark 3.x stack shown below accelerates Spark 3.x applications.\nAPACHE SPARK 3.x GPU-ACCELERATED SOFTWARE STACK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GPUs in Action\nRegardless of industry or use case, when putting ML into action, many data science problems break down into similar steps: iteratively preprocessing data to build features, training models with different parameters, and evaluating the model to ensure performance translates into valuable results.\nRAPIDS helps accelerate all of these steps while maximizing the user\u2019s hardware investments. Early customers have taken full data pipelines that took days, if not weeks, and ran them in minutes. They\u2019ve simultaneously reduced costs and improved the accuracy of their models since more iterations allow data scientists to explore more models and parameter combinations, as well as train on larger datasets.\nRetailers are improving their forecasting. Finance companies are getting better at assessing credit risk. And adtech firms are enhancing their ability to predict click-through rates. Data scientists often achieve improvements of 1-2 percent. This can translate to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Please fill out the form below to keep reading this E-book\n\n\nWelcome back.\n\t\t\tNot you?

The A2000 mid-range graphics card has 3,328 CUDA cores, 104 tensor cores, 8GB of video memory, and a 70 Watt TDP. The card is expected to begin shipping in October at $450 USD. The RTX A2000 is rated for 8 TFLOPS of single precision compute and 63.9 TFLOPS tensor performance rating.\r The other exciting element of this stable driver update is VK_KHR_wayland_surface finally being supported by the NVIDIA proprietary driver. This extension is used for creating a Vulkan surface object that is backed by a Wayland surface while also being able to query support for rendering to a Wayland compositor. This goes along with other recent NVIDIA Wayland Linux driver work.\r Rounding out this small but important stable driver update is a Vulkan driver performance regression fix for rFactor2.\r This new NVIDIA 470 series Linux driver update can be downloaded from NVIDIA.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Comments \n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\nNVIDIA RTX Remix 1.0 Released With DXVK DLSS4 & Neural Radiance CacheThe New Rust-Written NVIDIA \"NOVA\" Driver Submitted Ahead Of Linux 6.15NVIDIA Is Finding Great Success With Vulkan Machine Learning - Competitive With CUDANVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver Updated For Blackwell & New ExtensionsNVIDIA 570.124.04 Linux Driver Brings Additional FixesNVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression \"RTXNTC\" Beta\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

When doing a price comparison of EVGA versus other brands of GPUs, so far EVGA takes the cake as the cheapest brand to sell the GPUs!EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiThere have been restocks in the past costing twice the original SRP or even soaring up to $1000 past its SRP! Finally, things have changed. It seems like the prices of EVGA GPUs have started to go down. This all started with the previous EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which was selling for just $200 past its SRP!For one of the more expensive GPUs in the market, which is usually priced at at least $500 more than its SRP, the situation has finally improved! While the EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is being sold at $200 past its SRP, another GPU by EVGA also sells for a really small markup.EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060A restock tracker online has just spotted the EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 selling for just $70 past its SRP! Although this might still seem like a lot to some, when compared to other markups, the $70 is actually pretty small!The EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is meant to be an entry level GPU to higher tier gaming! Although it might not be as massive in performance as the RTX 3080 Ti, it still boasts pretty impressive graphics.EVGA Least Marked Up GPURestock trackers online have been alerting of different GPUs from ZOTAC, MSI, and more but so far, the GPUs are being priced at over $500 past its SRP. The difference in brand, as of the moment, cannot specifically be determined. Although EVGA might not be as expensive, it has still proven itself to be quite reliable.According to an article by Tom's Hardware, the original SRP for the EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is at $329. With the recent listing of $399 found online, the markup remains at just a bare $70 which is still quite impressive for any GPU as of the moment.Read Also: Top 10 NFT Games August 2021 Aside from 'Axie Infinity' | 'Splinterlands,' 'Gods Unchained,' 'Alien Worlds,' and More!Global Chip Shortage and GPU PricesAnother EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was spotted just recently at exactly the same price! This would somehow confirm that the EVGA GPUs are probably selling at smaller marked up prices.The same goes for the EVGA NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which is consistently spotted selling for just $200 past its SRP. This is also quite impressive considering the GPU is one of the more powerful GPUs in the market today.With the global chip shortage and the rise of scalpers, gamers have been struggling to get their hands on viable GPUs being sold at the least marked up prices as possible. Another option, however, is to purchase a gaming laptop with a built in GPU in order to save on GPU prices when building a PC.[New]EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Gamin...

A company blog post convinced many observers that the entire presentation was computer-generated.\nNvidia has now updated the blog post to clarify that the CGI Huang spoke for only 14 seconds of the 108-minute keynote.\nThe difference between the fake and real parts is pretty clear to my eyes. You can judge it for yourself by watching the video below. The CG footage starts at\u00a01:02:41. \n\nThe keynote provided a showcase for Omniverse, a platform used to create and simulate virtual 3D worlds.\u00a0Nvidia used the system to generate Huang\u2019s digital twin.\nThe \ud83d\udc9c of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!The company first took thousands of photos of Huang in a series of poses. These were\u00a0used to create a base for his 3D model.\nThe team then generated facial gestures for the model that matched Huang\u2019s speech. To enhance the realism, they mapped a photo of Huang to the CG version.\n\nNext, they filmed a motion-capture actor reading past transcripts of Huang\u2019s keynotes while physically mimicking his performances.\u00a0The footage was used to train an AI model to replicate\u00a0Huang\u2019s movements.\nThe performance was then loaded onto the virtual Huang to create the final CG video.\n\nI don\u2019t want to rain on the digital Jensen\u2019s parade, but it sounds like a lot of work for something that still doesn\u2019t look photorealistic to me.\nThe CGI doppelganger was also shown from a distance that concealed potential defects in its features and gestures.\nNvidia\u2019s AI is undoubtedly impressive, but it doesn\u2019t look ready to replace the real Huang with a virtual replica.\nHT \u2014 PCMag\nGreetings Humanoids!

It's complicated.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: 24 Entertainment)\n\n\n\n\nNaraka: Bladepoint is the latest game to hit the virtual shelves sporting a selection of Nvidia's technologies. Along with DLSS, it also benefits from Reflex, Nvidia's latency busting tech designed to give you an advantage in game. In fact, Nvidia has been working with developers to get Reflex into plenty of titles, and Naraka: Bladepoint is the 19th game to feature the tech.\u00a0But how much difference does it make, and is Reflex a setting you should turn on? I grabbed the testbed (AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, RTX 3080) and the 360Hz Alienware AW2521H with a mind to finding out. This setup also includes the Logitech Pro Wireless, which plugs straight into the Alienware monitor to allow you to measure full system latency.\u00a0Measuring latency is a tricky beast, even with the right hardware, as you need an area of the screen to flash after you press a button so that latency can be measured. Naraka: Bladepoint's main trade is melee combat, and the last time I checked swords don't usually produce an explosion of light when used. Thankfully there is some gunplay to enjoy in the game as well, and the game's musket produces a wonderfully over the top explosion every time you fire it. So we're good.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark is here, and my poor RTX 3070 is now crying sub-60 fps tears\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's latest 572.16 driver isn't just for the RTX 50-series, as 20, 30 and 40-series cards are also gifted with significant updates\n\n\n\nAfter a quick refresher about measuring and using Nvidia Reflex, I jumped into the training grounds. Grabbing the musket and a whole pile of repair chests (which essentially act as ammo as far as guns are concerned), I set about ascertaining just how much of an impact Reflex can have on a system.Spoilers: as far as the RTX 3080 is concerned, not a lot.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)For Reflex to really have an impact you need to be GPU bound: at 1080p, the RTX 3080 is quite happily throwing around over 200fps at the highest preset. Turning Reflex on improves latency by less than 4%.\u00a0The same isn't true when it comes to the GTX 1660 Super though, which struggles to maintain 30fps at the highest settings. Here you absolutely are GPU bound, and this is where you'll see the biggest improvement from turning Reflex on.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.In testing, you're looking at a 25% improvement to the latency here, and that rises to 30% for going for the Reflex On + Boost option. This will max out your GPU utilization, and thus draw more power, but it does help improve latencies that little bit more.(Image credit: 24 Entertainment)Of course, you're unlikely to play a competitive Battle Royale at 30fps, even with Reflex on. Dropping down to the very lowest settings at 1080p on the GTX 1660 Super, the framerate jumped up to be more in line with the 3080 at the highest settings\u2014around 200fps. It doesn't look anywhere as good, but it is a much smoother experience.\u00a0Of course, the latency drops significantly as well, and you're looking at the situation where the benefits of Reflex are diminished once again\u2014although Reflex On + Boost does improve things here from just over 2% to 7%.\u00a0(Image credit: 24 Entertainment)The whole point of Reflex though is that it allows you to up the settings while keeping latency reasonably in check. So some Medium or even High settings should be possible, while also maintaining a smooth and responsive gaming experience.So, back to the original question: is Reflex a setting you should turn on if you have an Nvidia graphics card? The simple answer is yes, particularly if you're sporting a slightly older card. It should allow you to go for slightly better settings, while also keeping overall system latency low. And better-looking games that are still responsive is obviously where it's at.\n\n\nAlan DexterSocial Links NavigationAlan has been writing about PC tech since before 3D graphics cards existed, and still vividly recalls having to fight with MS-DOS just to get games to load. He fondly remembers the killer combo of a Matrox Millenium and 3dfx Voodoo, and seeing Lara Croft in 3D for the first time. He's very glad hardware has advanced as much as it has though, and is particularly happy when putting the latest M.2 NVMe SSDs, AMD processors, and laptops through their paces. He has a long-lasting Magic: The Gathering obsession but limits this to MTG Arena these days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark is here, and my poor RTX 3070

The latest rumor comes from Greymon55, detailing the production and launch timeframe of NVIDIA's next-generation GPUs.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Graphics Cards With Ada Lovelace GPUs Enter Mass Production In Mid 2022, Alleges Rumor\nIn his latest tweet, the leaker states that NVIDIA's AD102 GPU which is likely to be the flagship chip within the Ada Lovelace lineup will be taping out either later this year or in early 2022. The GPU will then enter qualification sampling in Q2 2022 followed by mass production by mid of 2022. This is in line with what previous rumors have stated.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memoryhttps://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1426378568351707138\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will power the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards that will go head-on with AMD's RDNA 3 based Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards. There's still some speculation regarding the use of MCM by NVIDIA. The Hopper GPU, which is primarily aimed at the Datacenter & AI segment, is allegedly taping out soon and will feature an MCM architecture. NVIDIA won't be using an MCM design on its Ada Lovelace GPUs so they will keep the traditional monolithic design.\nAMD on the other hand is going on board with offering both MCM and Monolithic chips in its RDNA 3 and CDNA 2 families. The CDNA 2 GPUs will be MCM only while RDNA 3 will feature a mix of MCM and monolithic design as detailed here. It isn't confirmed which process node each company will be relying on but based on speculation, AMD's RDNA 3 & CDNA 2 family is going to be a mix of 6nm & 5nm nodes while NVIDIA is expected to utilize TSMC's 5nm process node for its Ada Lovelace GPUs though it is not confirmed if those will be fabricated on the N5 or N5P node. Intel, on the other hand, may also rely on an external fab for its own ARC Alchemist lineup of GPUs which enter mass production later this year.\n\nWe have previously heard rumors that NVIDIA's Ada Lovelace GPU-powered GeForce RTX 40 series is expected to bring the same jump (performance/efficiency) as we saw from Maxwell to Pascal but the launch will be pushed to late 2022 or Q1 2023.\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:\n\n\n\nGPUTU102GA102AD102\n\n\n\n\nFlagship SKURTX 2080 TiRTX 3090 TiRTX 4090?\n\n\nArchitectureTuringAmpereAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcessTSMC 12nm NFFSamsung 8nmTSMC 4N?\n\n\nDie Size754mm2628mm2~600mm2\n\n\nGraphics Processing Clusters (GPC)6712\n\n\nTexture Processing Clusters (TPC)364272\n\n\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SM)7284144\n\n\nCUDA Cores46081075218432\n\n\nL2 Cache6 MB6 MB96 MB\n\n\nTheoretical TFLOPs 16 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs?\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6XGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Capacity11 GB (2080 Ti)24 GB (3090 Ti)24 GB (4090?)\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps21 Gbps24 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth616 GB/s1.008 GB/s1152 GB/s?\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nPCIe InterfacePCIe Gen 3.0PCIe Gen 4.0PCIe Gen 4.0\n\n\nTGP250W350W600W?\n\n\nReleaseSep. 2018Sept. 202H 2022 (TBC)\n\n\n\n\nWe have also previously heard about a few specifications regarding the Ada Lovelace GPUs. It was rumored that the flagship GPU, the AD102, would pack up to 144 SM units for a total of 9216 cores or as NVIDIA's new algorithm states it, 18,432 CUDA cores. The successor to the RTX 3090 featuring such a GPU could feature around 2-2.5x the performance uplift though AMD's RDNA 3, once again, is expected to deliver a 3x performance uplift with the Navi 31 MCD GPU which would power their next-gen flagship graphics card.\n\nHowever, rest be assured that we will not see any next-gen GPU or graphics card till the end of 2022. NVIDIA has an intermediate\u00a0RTX 30 'SUPER' refresh\u00a0planned before it moves to next-gen parts but aside from that, AMD and NVIDIA will be focusing on developing their next-gen chips for the rest of 2022 with a launch focused by year's end.\n\n\n\nWhich next-generation GPUs are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X Radeon RX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (GeForce RTX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist  (ARC Graphics Cards)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n130\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Such features include mesh shading, real-time ray tracing and AI super sampling for incredibly detailed pictures. 4K video upscaling will also be supported.The first Intel Arc GPUs will be released in Q1 2022. Codenamed 'Alchemist', the first wave of products will be based on Intel's Xe-HPG microarchitecture, which helps the product more efficiently compute advanced graphical features like ray tracing.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nIntel's rumored 'Celestial' GPUs could finally give Nvidia and AMD cause for concern\n\n\n\n\nWatch out Nvidia, a Linux leak revealing three new Intel Arc Battlemage GPUs may challenge the RTX 5000 series\n\n\n\nFuture codenames that will supersede Alchemist include 'Battlemage', 'Celestial' and 'Druid', so Intel at least has a cool-sounding naming convention for its products.\u00a0Intel Xe graphics cards release date, specs, news and rumorsAMD vs Intel: which chipmaker does processors better?AMD vs Nvidia: who makes the best graphics cards?Intel vice president Roger Chandler said this of the Intel Arc announcement: \"Today marks a key moment in the graphics journey we started just a few years ago.\"The launch of the Intel Arc brand and the reveal of future hardware generations signifies Intel's deep and continued commitment to gamers and creators everywhere. We have teams doing incredible work to ensure we deliver first-class and frictionless experiences when these products are available early next year.\"Why Intel Arc mattersIntel entering the discrete GPU space isn't exactly a surprise. It's been long-rumored that the company was working on a high-end graphics solution for some time, and further rumors claim the GPUs could launch during CES 2022.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The shakeup this could cause for the GPU market alone gives us cause to keep an excited eye on Intel Arc. Nvidia and AMD have long been the dominant players in the GPU space, with the former taking a commanding lead thanks to the sheer impressiveness of its GeForce RTX 30 series. Intel will certainly have its work cut out if it intends to pose a threat to either GPU giant, so a strong first impression will be key to winning over consumers.Unfortunately for consumers, though, such cards haven't been the easiest to get hold of. Nvidia cards are still elusive beasts, sadly, due to the global chip shortage and cryptocurrency boom, among other factors.\u00a0Aftermarket cards like the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti are becoming more common, but still command high prices that may turn off less enthusiast consumers.Here's hoping, then, Intel Arc GPUs can throw a spanner in the works. Not only would it be great to see a bit more competition in the GPU space, but to have more cards readily available at more consumer friendly prices can only serve to introduce high-end PC gaming to much wider audiences.Today's best MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti dealsLow Stock $3,127.99ViewLow Stock $3,903.99View No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesBest processor: the best CPUs from Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nIntel\nAMD\nNvidia\n\n\nRhys WoodSocial Links NavigationHardware EditorRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for more than two years.

Intel has so far confirmed that the first discrete graphics cards will hit retail by Q1 2022 and will be based on the TSMC 6nm process node. Intel also detailed the specifications of Alchemist GPUs and the core building blocks which include the Xe-Core.\nRelated Story ASRock Intel Arc B570 Challenger OC \u201cBattlemage\u201d Graphics Card Review \u2013 10 GB Vs 8 GB RTX 4060 For $80 US LessIntel ARC Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU - The Building Blocks\n\nSo rounding up what we learned, the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU features a Xe-Core which is the fundamental DNA of the 1st Gen ARC lineup. The Xe-Core is a compute block that is composed of 16 Vector Engines (256-bit per engine) and 16 Matrix Engines (1024-bit per engine). Each Vector Engine is composed of 8 ALUs so, in total, we are looking at 128 ALUs per Xe-Core. Each Matrix Engine block is also referred to as an XMX block which will handle tensor operations in both FP16 and INT8 modes. The Xe-Core further features its own dedicated L1 cache.\n\nIntel fuses four Xe-Cores together to form a Render Slice which is composed of 4 Ray Tracing Units, four Sampler Units, Geometry/Rasterize/HiZ engines, and two Pixel Backend blocks with 8 units on each. These Render Slices are put together to form the main GPUs. The flagship is composed of an 8 Render Slice configuration which features 32 Xe-Cores, 512 Vector Engines, and 4096 ALUs. There will be different configurations with 2, 4, 6 Render Slices but we are focusing on the flagship part in this report.\n\nIntel ARC ACM-G10 vs NVIDIA GA104 & AMD Navi 22 GPUs\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameIntel ARC A770NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameACM-G10NVIDIA GA104AMD Navi 22\n\n\nArchitectureXe-HPGAmpereRDNA 2\n\n\nProcess NodeTSMC 6nmSamsung 8nmTSMC 7nm\n\n\nDie Size406mm2392mm2335mm2\n\n\nTransistors21.7B17.4B17.2B\n\n\nTransistor Density53.4M Transistors/mm244.4M Transistors/mm251.2M Transistors/mm2\n\n\nFP32 Cores32 Xe Cores48 SM Units40 Compute Units\n\n\nFP32 Units409661442560\n\n\nMax Clock2100 MHz1770 MHz2581 MHz\n\n\nFP32 TFLOPs17.2 TFLOPs21.75 TFLOPs13.21 TFLOPs\n\n\nMemory Bus256-bit256-bit192-bit\n\n\nMemory Capacity16 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6\n\n\nLaunchQ3 2022Q2 2021Q1 2021\n\n\n\n\nIntel ARC Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU - Comparing It To NVIDIA's GA104 & AMD's Navi 22\nA rundown of the specifications and comparison has been made by 3DCenter which gives us an idea of the theoretical performance that Intel's new GPU will have to offer. So right off the bat, Intel's ARC Xe-HPG Alchemist flagship will offer more TMUs and ROPs than the NVIDIA and AMD competition. The core count at 4096 is higher than AMD's Navi 22, Navi 21 (RX 6800) but lower compared to NVIDIA's GA104. NVIDIA is using a dual FP32 numbering methodology and should theoretically be 3072.\nIntel's ARC Alchemist GPUs have lower ray tracing units than the competition but we don't know exactly how their Ray tracing implementation works. For example, while Navi 22 offers more RT cores than the GA106 Ampere GPUs, the hardware-level integration within NVIDIA's RT cores is superior in all regards to AMD's implementation. So the final performance would depend upon Intel's hardware-level integration and software-level optimization for ray tracing applications.\n\nA major lead that Intel could have over the competition, especially NVIDIA since AMD lacks in this department, is AI assistance in supersampling technologies. Intel has already showcased an impressive demo of its XeSS technology and based on the expected numbers, Intel GPUs could outperform NVIDIA's Tensor Core implementation (DLSS) with its XMX architecture. Intel is also expected to feature a small but useful game cache on its GPUs and will be equipped with higher VRAM capacities of up to 16 GB (GDDR6) across a 256-bit bus interface. This would be twice as much memory as NVIDIA's RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti so they may have to prepare a refresh to counter it.\n\nLastly, the theoretical FP32 compute performance is computed with an expected peak clock rate of 2 GHz. That's the most likely scenario for TSMC's 6nm process node given how well clocks scale on TSMC's 7nm process node. Based on that, the Intel Xe-HPG Alchemist GPU could offer around 16-17 TFLOPs of Compute power. This is slightly lower FLOPs than what NVIDIA's GA104 produces but it should be noted that not all FLOPs should be measured equally as gaming architecture runs very different compared to datacenter chips.\nBased on these early specifications, we are looking at an Intel graphics card that could end up being faster than AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT and NVIDIA's RTX 3070 with ease. To push its 1st Gen graphics cards further into the consumer segment, Intel may likely offer very competitive prices against established giants like AMD and NVIDIA. And along with a strong suite of software-level optimizations, they might have a win-win in their hands which will only be pushed forward with future generations of ARC GPUs.\n\n\n\nWhich next-generation GPUs are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X Radeon RX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (GeForce RTX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist  (ARC Graphics Cards)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B570 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Tested In Geekbench: Roughly 12% Slower Than Arc B580 For 12% Lower Price\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B580 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Hits Retail, Starting at $249 But Runs Out of Stock Almost Instantly, Restock In Early January\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B580 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Benchmarks Leak: Faster Than RTX 4060 & RX 7600 XT In Vulkan\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Arc B580 \u201cBattlemage\u201d GPU Spotted On Geekbench: 20 Xe2 Cores, 12 GB VRAM & 2850 MHz Clock\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n22\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n20\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n17\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\n\n\n783\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

While we aren't getting similar drops in prices, the NVIDIA and AMD pricing trend shows that thanks to the ramping up of its Ampere GPUs, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics card lineup could hit its intended MSRP by this years end. AMD on the other hand is seeing the graphics card prices go up once again due to 7nm supply constraints for its RDNA 2 GPUs that are featured within Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards on desktop PCs.\nRelated Story AMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\nGraphics Card Prices in \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9 Aug 8, 2021\n\ud83d\udc49 Availability is good, but prices don't move much.\n\ud83d\udc49 AMD's prices are tending slightly upwards.\n\ud83d\udc49 nVidia's prices are trending slightly downwards consistently.

The company launched its CMP (Crypto Mining Processor) series which are graphics cards designed specifically for mining purposes. The company also launched its LHR (Lite Hash Rate) GPU lineup which replaced the entire existing GeForce RTX 30 Ampere GPU lineup and enforced mining algorithm restrictions. The LHR cards hold little to a low value for crypto mining purposes & NVIDIA has made a dent in overall prices in various markets as still-operational cryptocurrency setups are unable to use them & gamers are reluctant to buy graphics cards at such high prices that retailers are ultimately cutting down prices in a significant manner.\nNVIDIA GeForce & AMD Radeon Graphics Card (GPU) Prices Trend for Early August, 2021. (Image Source: 3DCenter)\nThere's still a large stock of non-LHR GeForce RTX 30 GPUs in the market which distributors and retailers are holding on to and will release at exorbitant prices once the next crypto boom occurs though that would be the last of the non-LHR stock. The LHR Ampere GPUs are currently being ramped up by NVIDIA and their supply has improved tremendously over the past few weeks and that can be seen on major retail outlets. The prices are still 40-45% higher than the MSRP but the trend shows that we can expect MSRP-level pricing by the year-end.\nMoving over to AMD, well we did talk to a few big AIB partners of AMD and they aren't hopeful on the supply getting better anytime soon. The problem still exists with TSMC's 7nm process node & that's been gobbled up by competitors and other AMD products to which the company has given more priority to such as Zen 3 CPUs and custom SOCs for consoles.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechEpiphany/status/1424288368775639043\n\nTotal Gaming GPU Sales Week 32\n\nNvidia Units 2130 = 75.66%\nRadeon Units 685 = 24.34%\n\nRadeon Top 5 Selling Brand Line!\n\n\nRX 6700XT = 385 units\n\n\nRX 6800XT = 170 Units.\n\n\nRX 6900XT = 50 Units.\n\n\nRX 6800 = 40 Units\n\n\nRX 580 = 20 Units.\n\n\nNvidia Top 5 Selling Brand Lines!\n\n\nRTX 3060 TI 8GB = 445 Units.\n\n\nRTX 3060 12GB = 430 Units.\n\n\nRTX 3080 TI 12GB = 230 Units\n\n\nRTX 3070 8GB = 200 Units\n\n\nRTX 1650 4GB = 200 Units\n\n\n\nThis is also leading NVIDIA to capture higher sales and usage figures for its GeForce RTX GPUs over AMD's Radeon RX GPUs in leading retail outlets and Steam's database.

Pricing of NVIDIA's high-end lineup such as the 3080 Ti and 3090 has improved tremendously and currently costs just 15-20 percent over MSRP. It's the older RTX 3060, RTX 3070, RTX 3080 stock that's still priced on the high-side but those have also fallen around 15% on average from the previous month.\nAMD graphics cards continue to remain on the high side with the Big Navi GPU starting at 30% over MSRP and up to 81% higher prices while the 6700 XT costs 44% more on average versus the MSRP. This doesn't bode well for the Radeon RX 6600 XT which launches tomorrow and already has been listed for around $700 US which is a 60-80% markup over its MSRP. But we should be hopeful for things to get better by end of 2021 as reported by all industry analysts.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n124\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n43\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The pictures show the extremely compact PCB design that resides underneath the single-single cooler which makes us want a half-length variant of the card.\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 Features The Smallest PCB For A Full GA104 Ampere GPU, Perfect For Custom SFF & Mini PCs\nThe NVIDIA RTX A4000 comes in a single-slot & full-length form factor. The graphics card features a blower fan that circulates air within the cooler shroud from both the top and bottom sides. That is why the backplate extends beyond the PCB and has a cutout for the blower-fan at the bottom too. It cools a really compact aluminum fin array which makes direct contact with the GPU and VRAM modules through flat copper heat pipes. The VRMs are also covered by a singular heatsink that is also part of the frame.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nUnderneath the shroud is a very compact PCB, almost as small as the AMD Radeon R9 Nano. The card itself features the NVIDIA GA104 GPU core in its full-fat configuration, featuring 6144 Cores & an impressive 16 GB GDDR6 memory bus with speeds of up to 16 Gbps for a total bandwidth out-put of 448 GB/s. The card has a TDP of 140W which is supplied through a single 6-pin connector & that's located beyond the PCB with extender cables routed in the shroud. As for VRMs, the card is powered by a 6+2 phase delivery and features four Display Outputs, all of which are Display Port 1.4a.\nA full teardown of the NVIDIA RTX A4000 graphics card has revealed its internals & an extremely compact PCB. (Image Source: NVIDIA Reddit)\nComing to the total horsepower of the NVIDIA RTX A4000, we are looking at around 20 TFLOPs of FP32 compute (19.2 TFLOPs to be exact). The AMD Radeon R9 Nano delivered 8.1 TFLOPs of FP32 compute at 170W. This shows just how far we have come in terms of efficiency with current-gen GPUs.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A4000 features a very compact PCB, making it perfect for Mini ITX and SFF setups. (Image Source; NVIDIA Reddit)\nIf NVIDIA wanted, they could've released a small form factor version of the GA104 GPU with a standard dual-slot, half-length board aimed at Mini ITX PCs. Even the 8 GB GDDR6 memory would have been absolutely fine and a TDP of around 150W would make it slightly higher clocked than the RTX A4000. So far, this generation has seen the least Mini ITX & small form factor graphics cards as manufacturers are putting more emphasis on bigger coolers and more power intense designs. It would be great if we had options on both sides. The GTX 1080 was the last high-end card to receive a MIni ITX treatment, that was scaled down to RTX 2070 and now a true ITX card is only available in the form of RTX 3060 Ti and below.\nNVIDIA also has a really cute RTX A2000 which was launched last week and features a dual-slot, half-height form factor. The card is based on the GA106 GPU and has a TDP of just 70W & doesn't require any external power input.\nNVIDIA Ampere Workstation Graphics Cards:\n\n\n\nGraphics CardNVIDIA RTX A2000NVIDIA RTX A4000NVIDIA RTX A4500NVIDIA RTX A5000NVIDIA RTX A5000NVIDIA RTX A6000\n\n\n\n\nGPUAmpere GA106 GPUAmpere GA104 GPUAmpere GA102 GPUAmpere GA102 GPUAmpere GA102 GPUAmpere GA102 GPU\n\n\nGPU ProcessSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie Size276 mm\u00b2392.5 mm\u00b2628mm\u00b2628mm\u00b2628mm\u00b2628mm\u00b2\n\n\nGPU Cores33286144716881921024010752\n\n\nTensor Cores104192224256320336\n\n\nBoost Clock1200 MHz1536 MHz1635 MHz1697 MHzTBD1455 MHz\n\n\nSingle Precision8.0 TFLOPs19.2 TFLOPs23.7 TFLOPs27.8 TFLOPsTBD31.2 TFLOPs\n\n\nVRAM6/12 GB GDDR616 GB GDDR620 GB GDDR624 GB GDDR624 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR6\n\n\nNVLINK VRAM\tN/AN/A40 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR648 GB GDDR696 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus192-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth228 GB/s448 GB/s640 GB/s768 GB/s768 GB/s768 GB/s\n\n\nTDP70W140W200W230W280W300W\n\n\nLaunch PriceTBCTBCTBCTBCTBD$4650 US\n\n\nLaunch Date\tOctober. 2021April, 2021Q4 2021April, 2021Q1 2022December, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 \u201cBlackwell\u201d Series Launched: Flagship GB202 GPU With 24K Cores, 96 GB VRAM, Up To 600W TDP\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n130\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

It transforms the seismic data recorded in time at the Earth\u2019s surface to an image of the Earth\u2019s subsurface. This is done by back-propagating data from time to space in a given velocity model. Kirchhoff depth migration is a well-known technique used in geophysics for seismic imaging. The fundamental difference between time and depth migration is that for every output location, the velocity model for time migration varies along depth only.\nOnce the travel-times are computed, both Kirchhoff time and depth migration produce an image with higher resolution and generate an image of the subsurface for a subset class of the data. This process provides valuable information about the petrophysical properties of the rocks and helps to determine how accurate the velocity model is.\nComputing Kirchhoff time and depth migration is memory bandwidth sensitive. It also depends on how fast the input data is copied to the accelerator memory. The problem is pleasingly parallel, meaning that individual processes do not need to communicate with others and all computations happen at the same time.\nWith an increasing demand for data processing, Kirchhoff migration methods on GPUs decrease computing cost and time to results.\nWhat is NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-optimized seismic code?\nNVIDIA developed a collection of seismic algorithms meticulously optimized for GPUs. This includes Forward Propagators for Reverse Time Migration (1, 2, 3 pass ISO, VTI, TTI), Kirchhoff Depth Migration, Kirchhoff Time Migration, Reverse Time Migration with Compression, Compression with DCT and OpenVDS Samples and more. The objective is to provide seismic algorithms with all the GPU best practices and optimizations available to maximize hardware price/performance. They are programmed in C++/CUDA and are very close to a production version. They are self-contained, read seismic input data and velocity models, and produce a depth or time imaged output. NVIDIA does not open-source these algorithms but encourages companies to use them as the foundation for derivative works or to benchmark against their own algorithm performance. Out of these applications, this blog focuses on Kirchhoff Depth and Time Migration evaluation on AWS.\nBenefits of running NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code on AWS\nRunning seismic imaging on AWS provides geophysicists the ability to balance time and cost using different GPU-based Amazon EC2 instance types.\nIn addition, these compute resources can be dynamically allocated when needed and deprovisioned when processing is finished. You can then switch to a different Amazon EC2 instance type, like a compute-optimized instance type for the post-processing, giving you flexibility in hardware choice and reducing cost.\nAlong with compute, you can also provision a high performance and managed file system with Amazon FSx for Lustre in one-click. Amazon FSx for Lustre can also be linked to an Amazon S3 bucket to seamlessly move data back and forth between Lustre and S3 while providing a familiar and performant file system. You can leverage Amazon S3 to store or archive input and output data with tiering using Amazon S3 Storage Classes for long term storage. It also enables you to share data around the globe in an easy and fast manner using the AWS network backbone.\nConfiguration/Solution\nAWS offers multiple GPU accelerated instances for high performance computing, machine learning, and graphics intensive workloads. For example, Amazon EC2 P4d instances provide 8 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs with 40 GB memory each, interconnected by NVLink and a 400 Gbps networking throughput per instance. Amazon EC2 P3 instances provide up to 8 NVIDIA Tensor Core V100 GPUs with up to 32GB of memory each, up to 100 Gbps of networking throughput, and supports NVLink for GPU peer-to-peer communication. Amazon EC2 G4dn instances offer a cost-effective solution and supports up to 4 NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs with 16GB of memory each, and up to 50 Gbps of networking throughput. G4dn metal instances support 8 NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs and 100 Gbps of networking throughput. For more details on the GPU based EC2 instances please take a look\u00a0here under Accelerated Computing.\nKirchhoff Time and Depth Migration applications from this collection were evaluated on three Amazon EC2 instances, g4dn.12xlarge, p3dn.24xlarge and p4d.24xlarge. These three instances are equipped with local NVMe storage and the performance data is presented in this blog. The tests were run with the local storage on each of these instances. The configuration details are listed in the following table.\n\n\n\nInstances\n GPUs\nvCPUs (Cores)\nMemory (GiB)\nProcessor\nNetwork (Gbps)\nInstance Storage\n\n\n\n          \u00a0 \n        \n\n\ng4dn.12xlarge\n4 x NVIDIA T4\n48 (24)\n192\nIntel Xeon Cascade Lake\n50\n1\u00d7900 GB NVMe SSD\n\n\np3dn.24xlarge\n8 x NVIDIA V100\n96 (48)\n768\nIntel Xeon Skylake\n100\n2 x 900 GB NVMe SSD\n\n\np4d.24xlarge\n8 x NVIDIA A100\n96 (48)\n1152\nIntel Xeon Cascade Lake\n400\n8 x 1 TB NVMe SSD\n\n\n\nIn addition to the tests on these local NVMe drives, each of these instances were attached with different\u00a0Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume\u00a0types like gp2 and io1 for performance comparison. These tested storage options were found to have near identical performance and a delta of\u00a0< 0.3%. Customers that have data storage requirements higher than the size of local NVMe drives in an EC2 instance can attach EBS volumes and expand capacity based on their requirements. Figure 1 shows an AWS architecture diagram that represents the test environment.\n\n\nFigure 1. AWS Architecture used for the price-performance benchmark study.\n\nCustomers can also take advantage of AWS\u00a0ParallelCluster to run their seismic workloads with the NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code.\u00a0AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS supported open-source cluster management tool that helps to deploy and manage high performance computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS Cloud. It automatically sets up the required compute resources and shared filesystem. AWS ParallelCluster can be used with batch schedulers, such as AWS Batch and Slurm. With the help of ParallelCluster, customers can run these applications on different instance types and at scale. In the same environment you can also configure a high-performance parallel file system like\u00a0Amazon FSx for Lustre (this can be used as scratch instead of local NVMe for larger datasets). You can also make use of the multi-queue feature supported by AWS ParallelCluster to configure separate job queues for compute and visualization with different types of Amazon EC2 instances.\nHow to run the NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code on AWS\nFor access to NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code, an NDA must first be in place. Please reach out to Reynaldo Gomez at reynaldog@NVIDIA.com to get started. After this step you can refer to instructions on GitHub on how to run this on AWS.\nPerformance and Price Comparison\nBelow we discuss the performance of Kirchhoff Time and Depth Migration, part of NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code on AWS. This code also includes a sample data reader script as well as instructions to download and configure public datasets (for example the BP dataset). Seismic data across customers are of different data formats. However, to provide a generic platform, the Depth and Time Migration algorithms expect the input data to be in binary format. The sample data reader utility included supports conversion of the SEG-Y data format to binary format. The data reader utility needs to be modified to convert other data formats into binary format.\nWe have used the 2007 BP Anisotropic Velocity Benchmark dataset to evaluate Kirchhoff Depth Migration and 2004 BP Velocity Estimation Benchmark dataset to evaluate Kirchhoff Time Migration. A sample parameter file is included in the data readers package and is customizable by customers to best suit their workload. This file defines the key parameters used for running the model such as number of GPUs, number of traces etc.\nFigures 2 and 3 represent performance data to migrate 1.3M traces in case of depth migration and 1.6M traces in case of time migration respectively. Local NVMe storage was used for both applications and on all instances tested as discussed in the previous section. The p4d.24xlarge instance based on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs shows up-to a 4.6x improvement for depth migration and up-to a 7x improvement for time migration compared to the g4dn.12xlarge instance based on NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU with the same number of GPUs.\n\n\nFigure 2. Kirchhoff Depth Migration Time\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Kirchhoff Time Migration Time\n\nCost Comparisons\nFigure 4 shows cost comparisons of running Kirchhoff Depth Migration on the Amazon EC2 instances tested.\u00a0Cost estimation for migrating 130M traces for depth migration is done by extrapolating migration time measured for 1.3M traces from data in Figure 2.\nFigure 5 shows cost comparisons of running Kirchhoff Time Migration on the Amazon EC2 instances tested.\u00a0Cost estimation for migrating 160M traces for depth migration is done by extrapolating migration time measured for 1.6M traces from data in Figure 3.\nAll pricing considered here is AWS Public On-Demand Pricing of these instances in the us-east-1 Region of AWS.\nFrom Figure 4,\u00a0p4d.24xlarge with A100 GPUs shows a price performance benefit of up to 11% compared to\u00a0g4dn.12xlarge and up to 34% compared to p3dn.24xlarge for depth migration.\nFrom Figure 5, p4d.24xlarge shows a price performance benefit of up to 37% compared to g4dn.12xlarge and up to 43% compared to p3dn.24xlarge for time migration.\n\n\nFigure 4. Kirchhoff Depth Migration Cost\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Kirchhoff Time Migration Cost\n\nConclusion\nThis blog showcases the performance of NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code on AWS. The data presented in this blog shows that Amazon EC2 p4d.24xlarge instances based on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs shows performance improvement of up-to 4.6x for Kirchhoff Depth migration and up-to 7x for Kirchhoff Time migration compared to g4dn.12xlarge instances based on NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs.\nThere is a potential to further improve the data transfer throughput by 10x by combining GPUDirect Storage and GPU Data compression. As a part of future work, there is an ongoing effort to implement this as part of NVIDIA\u2019s GPU optimized seismic code. Future work also includes evaluation of performance of other samples such as Reverse Time Migration (RTM) with compression and Forward Propagators for RTM on AWS GPU based instances.\nSpecial Acknowledgement: Special thanks to Fatmir Hoxha, Sr. Solutions Architect at NVIDIA for co-authoring this post.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorAug 24, 2021, 11:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.Enterprises have been slow to adopt AI in a big way. Recent forecasts predict that is about to change, and NVIDIA wants to reap the benefits.\nEnterprise IT organizations can easily be put off by the amount of new technology they will have to master in order to adopt AI and benefit from all the new capabilities it can offer. Many are just completing Big Data initiatives and are loathe to start down an entirely new journey requiring new skills as well as new technology. Nonetheless, 50% of enterprises plan to spend more on AI and ML this year, with 20% saying they will be significantly increasing their budgets, according to research by Algorithmia. The research also found that 76% of enterprises will prioritize AI and machine learning (ML) over other IT initiatives in 2021. Skill shortages remain a primary barrier, but complex AI technology also present significant hurdles.\n\n\nNVIDIA is way out in front\nWhile most AI semiconductor companies are just trying to get fast chips to work with adequate software that they can be used by ninja AI experts (see our analysis of MLPerf), NVIDIA has built a massive lead with application-specific frameworks as well as user interfaces, development and management tools, and of course very fast hardware to meet customers wherever they are in the journey to exploit AI.\n\nTo ease the AI onramp and spur enterprise adoption, NVIDIA has been putting together a suite of AI technologies over the last couple of years that should help enterprises get going. Many of the previously announced tools are now ready to deploy, so NVIDIA put a nice wrapper around the collection and presented the comprehensive suite of frameworks, software, hardware, services and partners. While this can be a bit dizzying, the comprehensive nature mirrors the myriad of enterprise AI use cases it intends to serve. And we were impressed by how much progress the AI leader has made since January, 2020; the company highlighted ten offerings that are all new in the last 18 months.\n\nSince 2020, NVIDIA has launched no less than 10 new frameworks, software tools, hardware platforms ... [+] and services with the intent to lower the barriers to adoption of AI in the enterprise. New products are circled in green.NVIDIA and Cambrian-AI Research\nWhat is notable in the stack?\nNVIDIA runs the risk of confusing some by having so many distinct products in this space, so let me help sort it out. At the top level of the figure above are the NVIDIA application frameworks. Not to be confused with the AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, these platforms provide the tools to simplify building specific classes of AI applications, including Smart Cities, Healthcare, Conversations, Recommendation engines, video conferencing, robotics, and Cybersecurity. NVIDIA invested in preparing these frameworks because it believes these to be the low-hanging fruit for enterprise adoption.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nBeneath these lie the software for building and running AI\u2019s in the data center and on the edge. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is now available (having been pre-launched at GTC earlier this year) providing a comprehensive cloud-native suite of AI software all built to run on VMware vSphere. Enterprises already comfortable with vSphere and AI concepts can just use AI Enterprise. For those who want to access\u00a0NVIDIA AI\u00a0from a managed and hosted platform, NVIDIA Base Command provides provides a turnkey platform of hardware, networking, and software hosted by NVIDIA Partners. Base Command can manage AI creation workloads on infrastructure in an NVIDIA AI LaunchPad environment. In the future, Base Command will be able to orchestrate workloads across EGX-based mainstream servers running NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\u00a0\n\nAll this makes it easy for teams to get started, prep their data and experiment with AI models. Once ready for deployment, customers can continue to run on Base Command or move to on-prem hardware or cloud services. Fleet Command manages the AI inference processing on edge AI devices.\n\n NVIDIA software supports the entire AI development workflow. NVIDIA\nAt the bottom of the stack is the NVIDIA hardware platforms available from NVIDIA and through OEM partners. Of note here is the\u00a0NVIDIA AI LaunchPad\u00a0which offers ready-to-run infrastructure for the complete lifecycle of AI from development to deployment. It includes\u00a0NVIDIA Base Command\u00a0built on DGX SuperPOD with NetApp storage offered in an Equinix-hosted environment, with pricing starting at $90k/month. These are completely configured systems with the software stack described above, all ready to go for initial enterprise experimentation and deployment.\nConclusions\nWhen people think of NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem advantage, many often refer to it as CUDA. As you can see, the enterprise offerings expand so far above the CUDA libraries that it is not even mentioned. By making AI easy to buy, easy to develop, easy to deploy, and easy to manage across the cloud and edge, NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem is massive and will remain a durable defensive moat competitors will struggle to cross.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the opinions of the author, and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from nor invest in the companies mentioned.

The brand new architecture will be built on TSMC's 5nm process. This is massive news if true - and let's talk about that for a second. Kopite has leaked pretty much all the details of the Turing and Ampere architectures and has historically been extremely accurate. That said, as always with leaks and before multiple confirmations, a grain of salt never hurt anyone.\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will \"come out a little bit earlier\" according to industry insider\nKopite had already previously confirmed that the Ada Lovelace architecture would be built on the 5nm process, but it was assumed that this would be a Samsung node. NVIDIA had made the (correct) decision to transition to Samsung for foundry services because it had (accurately) forecasted the demand that would be hitting TSMC. Having to share resources with Apple and AMD was a gamble and NVIDIA's decision to go with Samsung appears to have been mostly validated.\n\nof course TSMC N5\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 26, 2021\n\nYet, if this leak is correct then NVIDIA is going back to TSMC for their 5nm process - and likely means at least one flagship GPU series will be produced at TSMC - which is business that Samsung Foundries just lost out on. Even if they build the high end chips on TSMC and keep the low end at Samsung (which is where the volume usually lies) it is still interesting because it means that Jensen has lost faith in Samsung's ability to keep pace with the bleeding edge nodes.\n\nAda Lovelace will come out a little bit earlier. Keep patient.\n\u2014 kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) August 26, 2021\n\nKopite has also stated that Ada Lovelace GPU will be arriving sooner than expected, although since they have not confirmed the timeline in the first place, we still don't have a concrete date. Rumors have put the arrival of Ada Lovelace GPUs between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 so if Kopite is expecting NVIDIA to push back the production and commence mass production a bit early, the Q2 2022 timeframe might be the one to keep in mind going forward.\nRecap on NVIDIA ADA GPU architecture\nIn many ways, Ada Lovelace can be thought of as the world's first computer enthusiast. She is the first person to have realized that the Analytical Engine proposed by Charles Babbage had applications beyond pure calculation and also published what is thought to be the first algorithm (becoming the first computer programmer) intended to be carried by such a machine. This was almost half a century before Alan Turing would finish their work and invent the general-purpose computer during the world war.\nNVIDIA has been known to base its architectures on prominent physicists, mathematicians, and scientists and Ada Lovelace is no different. Videocardz actually managed to find a major hint in NVIDIA's own merchandise store that appears to confirm this rumor about Lovelace architecture being the next generation of GPUs from the company. If you look at the heroes showcased during GTC's 2018 keynote you find not only Ada Lovelace but what are potentially all future architectural codenames from NVIDIA. Jensen might have sneakily left the entire future roadmap (as far as codenames go) in the GTC'18 keynote.\n\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:\n\n\n\nGPUTU102GA102AD102\n\n\n\n\nFlagship SKURTX 2080 TiRTX 3090 TiRTX 4090?\n\n\nArchitectureTuringAmpereAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcessTSMC 12nm NFFSamsung 8nmTSMC 4N?\n\n\nDie Size754mm2628mm2~600mm2\n\n\nGraphics Processing Clusters (GPC)6712\n\n\nTexture Processing Clusters (TPC)364272\n\n\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SM)7284144\n\n\nCUDA Cores46081075218432\n\n\nL2 Cache6 MB6 MB96 MB\n\n\nTheoretical TFLOPs 16 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs?\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6XGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Capacity11 GB (2080 Ti)24 GB (3090 Ti)24 GB (4090?)\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps21 Gbps24 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth616 GB/s1.008 GB/s1152 GB/s?\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nPCIe InterfacePCIe Gen 3.0PCIe Gen 4.0PCIe Gen 4.0\n\n\nTGP250W350W600W?\n\n\nReleaseSep. 2018Sept. 202H 2022 (TBC)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA AD102 \"ADA GPU\" appears to have 18432 CUDA Cores based on the preliminary specs (which can change) provided by Kopite. This is almost twice the cores present in Ampere which was already a massive step up from Turing. The only way this is even possible is because NVIDIA is apparently building this on the 5nm process which has significant die area and power reduction. Interestingly, if you assume a clock speed of 1.75 GHz you can also get the peak single-precision performance of the ADA 102 GPU: 64 TFLOPs.\nAccording to Kopite the ADA architecture will feature a much bigger L2 Cache (both Turing and Ampere have 6 MB of cache) which means this might be a major architectural revision (as Turing was to Pascal and Pascal was to Fermi/Kepler) instead of just the usual process shrink.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n179\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n79\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n56\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1463\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1142\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The Aurora system is likely to be delivered next year as Intel reset expectations to Q2 2022. As a result, the DoE and Argonne National Laboratory picked HPE to add a new Polaris cluster to the mix.\nNew DoE Argonne Polaris Supercomputer\nMichael E. Papka, director at the\u00a0Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) said: \u201cPolaris is well equipped to help move the ALCF into the exascale era of computational science by accelerating the application of AI capabilities to the growing data and simulation demands of our users\u201d\u00a0(Source: Argonne)\nAside from the pretty cover photo, we got a few details on the cluster:\n\n280x HPE Apollo Gen10 Plus systems\n560x (2 per node) AMD EPYC 7002 \u201cRome\u201d and EPYC 7003 \u201cMilan\u201d processors\n2240x (4 per node) NVIDIA A100 GPUs\nHPE-Cray Slingshot interconnect (same as will be used on all three of the first exascale systems)\n\nSomething that is very interesting here is that the Argonne link to the HPE system went to the HPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 Plus that we covered in\u00a0HPE Adds a Quartet of New AMD EPYC 7003 Servers.\nHPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 Plus\nThis is quite interesting. HPE is likely using an 8x HGX A100 configuration we saw in our recent Inspur NF5488A5 8x NVIDIA A100 HGX platform review and the air and liquid-cooled Supermicro configurations we tested in Liquid Cooling Next-Gen Servers Getting Hands-on with 3 Options. With eight GPUs per node, this is most likely a \u201cDelta\u201d not a \u201cRedstone\u201d configuration.\nHPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 Plus 8x SXM4 GPU Configuration\nHPE has Apollo 6500 Gen10 Plus systems with NVIDIA Redstone, but these configurations have one CPU to one Redstone platform as can be seen in the diagram below.\nHPE Apollo 6500 Gen10 Plus 2x4x SXM4 GPU Configuration\nOur sense is that HPE has both options in the Apollo 6500 Gen10 Plus which is very cool.\nLast week we did a\u00a0Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 Review AMD EPYC and NVIDIA Redstone Server and several readers/ YouTube viewers asked why one would purchase a system with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs instead of eight GPU systems. Typically in HPC applications, like the Polaris cluster will be used for, having direct CPU to GPU connections is preferable to using a PCIe switch. Also, often DDR4 bandwidth and CPU core counts are designed for targeted ratios with the GPUs.\n\nHere is how this Dell EMC PowerEdge Redstone platform is set up.\nDell EMC PowerEdge XE8545 NVIDIA Redstone 4\nOf course, the PowerEdge we looked at is air-cooled and the Apollo 6500 is a more flexible platform, but the basic CPU/ GPU/ memory architecture we would expect to be similar.\n\nWe suspect Argonne is using rear-door heat exchangers in this installation.\nFinal Words\nOverall, let us be clear, Polaris is a relatively small cluster compared to Aurora. For some context, a few weeks ago in the STH lab, we had just over 30 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and many more AMD EPYC 7002/7003 CPUs running in systems. In the old lab, we did not have the capacity to run even a small portion of a modern top 10 supercomputer and that was enough to be around 2% of what is being deployed with Polaris.

Or am I confusing nodes with enclosures?\nCould you make an educated guess what such a system would cost? You mentioned ~ 150k per node ( ~42 million for 280 nodes), how much money would you need to add for storage and networking?\n\u2014 Max\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNikolay Mihaylov\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 25, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:09 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand the need for a switch between each CPU and the corresponding 4-GPU cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 26, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:44 am                                            \n\n\n\nMax \u2013 you are right. I think a bit got very unclear there during editing. We had a truck arrive with the last parts *hopefully* for the new studio. Hopefully, the edit helps.\nOn cost, that is pretty hard to say. There are storage, networking, but also software and professional services to think about as well and the pricing of this class of machine is often quite different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign me up for the STH newsletter! \n\n\u0394 \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

The market shipments increased 3.4% sequentially and 37% year over year while CPU shipments also saw a major uptick of 42% from the previous year. The research firm believes that the GPU market will continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.5% from 2020 till 2025 and will reach a total of 3,318 million units by the end of the forecast period.\nRelated Story Intel AI Chip Breakthrough To Compete With NVIDIA Unlikely Before 2027 \u2013 Report\n\nQuick highlights\n\nThe GPU\u2019s overall attach rate (which includes integrated and discrete GPUs, desktop, notebook, and workstations) to PCs for the quarter was 117%, down -0.1% from last quarter.\nThe overall PC CPU market increased by 3.5% quarter-to-quarter and increased 42.1% year-to-year.\nDesktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs that use discrete GPUs) decreased by -2.9% from the last quarter.\nThis quarter saw a 3.4% rise in tablet shipments from last quarter.\n\nAs for the vendor-specific shipments in Q2 2021, Intel led the GPU segment with a 68.29% share (up from 68.18% last quarter). NVIDIA followed with a slight increase in its overall GPU share that currently holds steady at 15.23% (up from 15.17% last quarter) while AMD's GPU share declined to 16.48% (down from 16.65% last quarter). Overall GPU shipments increased by 3.4% from the last quarter with AMD shipments increasing by 2.3%, Intel shipments increasing by 3.6% and NVIDIA's shipments increasing by 3.8%.\nIn a year like no other, suppliers reported shortages of component parts, capacitors, substrates, and other items. Even companies with a diverse portfolio were forced to allocate to the various segments they served. No one was happy about it, and unfortunately, the upcoming inventory build-out for the holiday season that usually takes place in the third quarter will be constrained until the supply chain catches up with demand.\nvia JPR\nDo note that the figures mentioned above include all GPUs (iGPUs / dGPUs). NVIDIA and AMD are currently the only two major companies offering discrete graphics cards but Intel is going to follow soon with its new ARC graphics card lineup hitting retail in Q1 2022. As for the discrete GPU share, NVIDIA's market share increased to 83% (up from 81% last quarter) while AMD's share declined to 17% (down from 19% last quarter).\n\n\n\n\nQ2'20\nQ1'21\nQ2'21\n\n\nAMD\n20%\n19%\n17%\n\n\nNVIDIA\n80%\n81%\n83%\n\n\nPC dGPU shipment market shares\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has managed to allocate its resources to ramp up the production of Ampere GPUs featured in the GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards while AMD is having a tough time due to constraints on TSMC's 7nm node which is being gobbled up by other products from AMD and competitors. It looks like the following quarters leading into 2022 would remain largely the same as hinted by NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Targets NVIDIA\u2019s Grace & Intel Granite Rapids Xeon CPUs With New 5th Gen EPYC Performance Showcase, Up To 2.75x Power Efficiency\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CEO Was Excited About Generative AI In 2022 Before ChatGPT Became Popular\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n54\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n40\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n36\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

For an annual keynote address known for impressive technical displays, this one certainly delivered.\u00a0Most viewers had no idea they hadn't seen the real Huang speaking from his real kitchen until a new documentary by Nvidia was released that detailed the efforts that went into making that presentation.A video of Nvidia's DGX Station A100 workstation was also entirely generated using Omniverse.Take a look at these best mobile workstationsHere are some of the best programming laptopsAnd here are the best laptops for editing videosThe news comes as a shock to just about everyone in the industry, given that the virtual presentation in April 2021 raised no suspicions among the tens of thousands of industry professionals and press who covered the event.

In the screen, Jensen Huang\u2019s kitchen, his leather clothes, even his expressions, movements, hair... are all synthetic#NVIDIA #SIGGRAPH pic.twitter.com/fyrb8wgCYaAugust 12, 2021In a blog post on Wednesday, Nvidia talked about the experience of recreating a space for which tech enthusiasts have developed a real attachment. \"Jensen's kitchen\" was a pandemic staple for PC hardware fans who were used to watching or even attending much larger, more heavily produced launches.\"The demo is the epitome of what GTC represents: It combined the work of NVIDIA\u2019s deep learning and graphics research teams with several engineering teams and the company\u2019s incredible in-house creative team,\" the company said.\"To create a virtual Jensen, teams did a full face and body scan to create a 3D model, then trained an AI to mimic his gestures and expressions and applied some AI magic to make his clone realistic.\"Digital Jensen was then brought into a replica of his kitchen that was deconstructed to reveal the holodeck within Omniverse, surprising the audience and making them question how much of the keynote was real, or rendered.\"Jensen's kitchen, meanwhile, brings its own understated charm to Nvidia's recent keynotes. There's nothing quite like seeing Huang pull the brand new RTX 3090 out of his oven during the Nvidia Ampere reveal last year, and for many people dealing with lockdowns and social distancing due to the pandemic, the keynotes were a way to digitally connect with fellow enthusiasts in the comments section of the livestream.It was a natural choice then to make Jensen's Kitchen the demonstration of Nvidia's Omniverse tool, which is all about creating realistic 3D workspaces where people can meet and collaborate. Cool as it is, though, we still prefer the real thing.\u00a0AMD vs Nvidia: who makes the best graphics cards?\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJohn LoefflerSocial Links NavigationComponents EditorJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

That led some to believe that hardware matters less.\nJust the opposite. It\u2019s now clear that the software-defined revolution relies on new chip architectures \u2014 GPUs and DPUs \u2014 to continue.\nOne GPU can already replace a dozen or even 100 CPUs for AI and machine learning.\nAnd one DPU can do the work of 20, 50 or even 120 CPU cores in a single chip. Future DPUs will offload the work of up to 300 CPU cores.\nHardware matters more than ever.\nHardware Matters Because AI Matters\nTo be sure, software remains important.\nEveryone \u2014 whether in stores, factories, offices or schools \u2014 relies on software. We even use software to socialize and date.\nBut the next decade will be a story of every business becoming not just a software company, but an AI company.\nBusinesses that don\u2019t embrace AI \u2014 the automation of automation \u2014 will fall behind.\nThis rush to AI has big implications.\nCommodity CPUs were enough for the software transformation of the previous decade.\nThe GPU and DPU will be the engines that drive the AI transformation of the next.\nSoftware-defined, hardware-accelerated infrastructure will displace the original software-defined infrastructure.\nInnovators Will Dual-Wield GPUs and DPUs\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because today\u2019s workloads are very different.\n\nData is growing exponentially.\nNetworking speeds in the data center have accelerated 20x \u2014 to 200 Gigabits per second, up from 10 Gbps.\nAI has become widespread in enterprises and the cloud.\nApplications run on many different servers at once and are always communicating with each other.\nMoore\u2019s law has ended \u2014 CPU performance now increases only linearly and can\u2019t keep up with the growth in everything else.\n\nWith all these trends accelerating, the standard CPU is already overwhelmed. AI training workloads and machine learning models can consume CPUs on servers for hours or days.\nIt\u2019s now common for a third of each server\u2019s CPU cores to run infrastructure tasks such as networking, storage management and security.\nSpecialized silicon is the solution.\nCPUs can then do what they do best: general, single-threaded applications.\n\n\n\nWorkloadCharacteristicsAcceleration NeededBest Processor\n\n\n\n\nGeneral applicationsSingle threadedNoneCPU \n\n\nAI, ML, HPCMassively parallelInteger or FP mathGPU\n\n\nGraphics & videoParallel, codecs Matrix math, transforms, ray tracing, probabilityGPU with ray tracing\n\n\nNetworkingMultithreaded, pipelinedPacket processing, routing, encapsulationDPU\n\n\nSecuritySingle- or multithreadedEncryption, inspection, domain isolationDPU\n\n\n\n\nHardware Innovation Fuels Software-Defined Innovation\nThe software-defined revolution has brought the hardware-software balance full circle. Hardware design is important again.\nBut it\u2019s no longer in the design of custom ASICs for each appliance or general-purpose CPUs that matters most. Instead, it\u2019s continuous innovation in specialized processors such as GPUs and DPUs.\nThe rapid pace of innovation in these processors poses challenges for the chip world. Taking advantage of ever-smaller semiconductor process nodes demands more complicated design efforts.\nEvery time the process shrinks, new design rules come into play. New, more efficient chips need larger design and verification teams.\nThe result is that chip companies must invest huge sums. Not only in the logical design of their chips. But also in the physical aspects. They need to follow the rules and limits of physics down to the quantum realm.\nOver time, only larger chip companies can design at scale. That means creating multiple new chips at each new process node. Other companies that make their own chips can\u2019t afford to design on the newest nodes. They\u2019ll have to settle for older, larger, less efficient processes.\nWe saw this in CPUs, where only three companies have been able to sustain innovation. They\u2019ve done that by amortizing their CPU design efforts over large numbers of chips and customers.\nThe same seems likely for GPU and DPUs. Big silicon players will support sustained innovation in software.\nInnovators Can Eat Hearty\nArmed with innovative GPUs and DPUs, data centers will deploy processors optimized for different tasks. As a result, software, driven by AI, will continue eating the world.\nThe modern datacenter is software-defined and hardware-accelerated. They go hand in hand.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | Hardware | Networking | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | GPU \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In last month's 'All Video Cards' section, the Radeon RX 6000 series is absent. That's not unusual as the category has never featured RDNA 2, despite the Radeon RX 6800 and Radeon RX 6800 XT releasing in November last year.\nBut Redditor @zyck_titan discovered that RDNA 2 is tucked away within the survey: in 'Vulkan Systems.' They are missing from the main category because any specific card needs to have at least a 0.15% share to be eligible for the \"All Video Cards\" section.\n\"If you compare the shares for Vulkan Systems versus Overall shares listed on [the Steam hardware survey] you'll see that all cards have twice the share under Vulkan Systems. So just divide by two to get the overall share,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Radeon 6800 XT is as popular as the GTX 650 Ti\nUsing this method, the most popular RDNA 2 card is the Radeon RX 6700 XT with an 0.11% share. It's followed by the RX 6800 XT (0.10%), the RX 6900 XT (0.08%), and the RX 6800 (0.05%), making a total of 0.34%. Nvidia's Ampere line, which all appear in the main category, has a total share of 3.98%. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\n Steam survey sees a shake-up as a new top graphics card is revealed \n\n\n\nProbably the most eye-opening stat here is that every single RTX 3000 series card has a larger market share than AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series combined. Even the flagship RTX 3090, which you'll struggle to find at its MSRP of $1,499, boasts a 0.38% share.\n\nThe biggest changes from the 'All video cards' category. It was a good month for Ampere\nWhile the Radeon RX 6000 cards can match Ampere's performance in many respects, the big problem has been availability. AMD GPUs come from TSMC, which has allocated much of its production capacity to the PS5/XBSX consoles. Nvidia, meanwhile, moved from TSMC to Samsung for the consumer RTX 3000 series.\nFor a look at other areas of the Steam survey, including AMD's CPU rebound and Windows 7's surprising resurgence, check out this article.\n\n\n\n\n 102 comments\n \n1.2K likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

According to an Nvidia spokesperson, it opens up RTX to so many more designers who may have been working on small assemblies but now they need to be ray traced.\nThis is a very smart move from Nvidia as it looks to extend the reach of its RTX technology among design, engineering and architecture firms.\nRead what AEC Magazine thinks\nSFF workstations like the HP Z2 SFF and Dell Precision 3450 SFF are extremely popular with AEC firms because they take up significantly less space than standard desktop towers. However, because of their size, they are limited to \u2018low-profile\u2019 form factor GPUs.\nThe Nvidia RTX A2000 is designed to work with both a low profile bracket and a full height bracket (pictured)\nHistorical low-profile GPUs like the Nvidia Quadro P1000 are not RTX-enabled and are only suitable for mainstream 3D CAD or BIM workflows (although some SFF workstations offer a custom version of the Nvidia Quadro RTX 3000, an MXM form factor GPU typically found in mobile workstations).\nThe Nvidia RTX A2000 is \u2018low-profile\u2019 but a lot thicker than others. It takes up two slots on the motherboard, something typically associated with high-end GPUs like the Nvidia RTX A5000 or Nvidia RTX A6000. However, The Nvidia RTX A2000 not limited to SFF workstations. When the GPU is purchased seperately (i.e. not as part of a fully configured workstation) it also comes with\u00a0 full height ATX bracket so it can be fitted in a standard tower.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nThere are now four Nvidia RTX GPUs, including the RTX A2000 (6 GB), RTX A4000 (16 GB), RTX A5000 (24 GB) and RTX A6000 (48 GB)\nSpecifications include 6 GB GDDR6 of ECC memory, four Mini DisplayPort connectors and a max power consumption of 70W. It features 8 TFLOPS of single precision performance (double that of the previous generation 5 GB Nvidia Quadro P2200), 15.6 TFLOPS of RT Core Performance and 63.9 TFLOPS of Tensor Performance.\nThese specs are a fair way behind the more powerful $999 Nvidia RTX A4000 (16 GB), which is available in mini towers, and features 19.2 TFLOPS of single precision performance, 37.4 TFLOPS of RT Core performance and 153.4 TFLOPS of Tensor performance.\nThe Nvidia RTX A2000 desktop GPU will be available in workstations from manufacturers including ASUS, BOXX Technologies, Dell Technologies, HP and Lenovo as well as Nvidia\u2019s global distribution partners starting in October.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat AEC Magazine thinks\nThis is a very smart move from Nvidia as it looks to extend the reach of its RTX technology among design, engineering and architecture firms.\nIt\u2019s also one that took us completely by surprise. We had expected Nvidia to launch an RTX A2000 GPU but had no idea that it would have a low profile form factor, using a dual slot design to deliver the required levels of performance.\nBy doing so Nvidia not only brings RTX technology into the mainstream but makes it compatible with the millions of Small Form Factor workstations already out in the market.\nThe hope is that firms that were previously unable to widely adopt RTX-enabled workflows without swapping out a whole fleet of workstations, can now do so with a relatively simple and low-cost upgrade.\nNvidia will be particularly keen to use this to drive adoption of its Nvidia Omniverse collaboration and simulation platform, although there are plenty of other RTX-enabled applications out there such as Enscape, V-Ray, KeyShot, Unreal Engine and Solidworks Visualize.\nBeyond RTX, the Nvidia RTX A2000 should also help give extended CAD- and BIM-focused teams access to other real-time viz tools and, of course VR.\nWe\u2019re excited by this announcement and look forward to testing out the GPU later this year. The one question mark we have is will 6 GB be too limiting for some pro users, even ones considered entry-level? For a GPU of this capability, we would have expected 8 GB, especially as it\u2019s quite a big step up to the 16 GB Nvidia RTX A4000.\n\nRelated articles:Chaos Vantage 2.0 launches for real-time ray tracingNEWS: HP ZBook G5 generation brings mobile workstation tally to eightAutodesk to acquire The Wild to boost XR capabilitiesNEWS: CL3VER delivers virtual tours of the Barcelona pavilionGetting ready to get it rightViewpoint offers free trial of Viewpoint Team during pandemicNEWS: NavVis enhances indoor mapping precisionQ&A: IMSCAD talks virtual workstations\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

After several weeks of prices falling rapidly towards their MSRP, both Nvidia's RTX 3000 series and AMD's Radeon RX 6000 cards saw their average prices rise during August. \nThe latest figures from 3DCenter.org, which looks at average selling prices of Ampere/RDNA 2 cards at retailers in Germany, show team green's products rising 9% throughout August to 59% above MSRP, while AMD's cards were up 5% to 64% above MSRP.\n\nFor Nvidia, the data reverses a trend that has seen the average price of the RTX 3000 series fall for over three months. It was at a high of over 200% more than MSRP in mid-May, declining to 50% in early August---the lowest since the year began.\nIt's been a slightly different story for AMD. The Radeon 6000 series' price peaked at 114% above MSRP before falling to 53% in early July, but it's slowly been on the increase since then and is now slightly above Nvidia at 64%. While the figures are from Germany, they reflect a global pattern.\nOur own GPU availability and pricing update for August also shows card prices (on eBay) rising by a few percent points.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMSRP\neBay Average Price June\neBay Average Price July\neBay Average Price August\nCurrent Price Inflation\nPrice Increase July to August\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3090\n$1,500\n$2,962\n$2,599\n$2,607\n74%\n0%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n$1,200\n$2,187\n$1,905\n$1,815\n51%\n-5%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n$700\n$1,948\n$1,623\n$1,643\n135%\n1%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\n$600\n$1,323\n$1,085\n$1,170\n95%\n8%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070\n$500\n$1,261\n$1,075\n$1,228\n146%\n14%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n$400\n$1,255\n$1,012\n$952\n138%\n-6%\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060\n$330\n$830\n$723\n$752\n128%\n4%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAverage\n109%\n2%\n\n\n\nAvailability also gotten worse since the start of the month. Whereas only the RTX 3070 and 3070 Ti failed to achieve four out of five stars in the previous report, the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 are also rated at 3/5 in the latest edition. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Razer Blade 16 pricing leaks: $2,000 for RTX 5060 model \n\n\n\n AMD board partner says Radeon RX 9070 GPU supply will stabilize after April \n\n\n\nIt's even worse for AMD. The RX 6800 is now the most difficult card to find at German retailers, ranked at 1/5 for availability. The RX 6600 XT and RX 6900 XT both score 3/5, and the RX 6700 XT and RX 6900 XT get 4/5.\nNvidia boss Jensen Huang recently said the supply issues plaguing graphics cards would last throughout next year, and with TSMC set to increase contract pricing by up to 20 percent, expect this sad situation to last for a while. On the positive side, AMD could be releasing its own line of mining-specific graphics cards, which might ameliorate the issues to some extent. And all this is despite GPU shipments increasing 42% in Q2.\n\n\n\n\n 42 comments\n \n847 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

One of the core components of a graphics card, its memory, is seeing reduced demand and lowering prices, according to TrendForce, and that could play a part in keeping prices from rising this year.The recent crackdowns on cryptomining and the fall of crypto currency values may be playing a big part in the sinking demand for graphics cards and, in turn, graphics DRAM. With prices of DRAM lowering in response, the prices of products that rely on these memory modules can drop correspondingly \u2014 or, at least, not get any higher.AMD vs Nvidia: who makes the best graphics card?GPU availability has a bright side, though not perfectly brightNvidia\u2019s RTX 4000 GPUs: all you need to knowThere's more to it than DRAMGraphics cards from Nvidia and AMD have taken us all on a wild ride over the past year as inventory has been hard to find and MSRP has felt like a laughable notion when confronted with the actual prices available from resellers. Anything that can bring those prices back toward MSRP is welcome by consumers and PC enthusiasts.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nSorry, AMD, Nvidia's price tags for its RTX 5000 GPUs could win me over\n\n\n\n\nAnother gloomy Nvidia RTX 5000 rumor suggests next-gen GPUs will be price hiked over the MSRP in many cases, and I\u2019m getting worried now\n\n\n\nGraphics DRAM like GDDR6 is a necessary component in the latest graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia. The high-end cards also tend to use more of it. It's also used heavily in the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. So, falling graphics DRAM prices should help bring those prices back down.Unfortunately, DRAM isn't the only component of graphics cards at issue. There's also the silicon \u2014 the GPU at the heart of the card itself. A recent announcement from Samsung has raised concerns that Nvidia graphics cards will see increased prices as they rely on Samsung's chip fabrication for their GPUs. Similarly, TSMC will be ending bulk discounts for large customers, and AMD is just such a customer.The net result could be that the falling DRAM prices and rising chip fabrication prices will balance out in some way, but it's impossible to predict just how everything will pan out.\u00a0Via WCCFTechGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nSamsung\n\n\nMark KnappSocial Links NavigationOver the last several years, Mark has been tasked as a writer, an editor, and a manager, interacting with published content from all angles.

The new NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU aims to bring a lower power and cost point to the Ampere generation. For those confused by the naming, the RTX A2000 would have previously been called a \u201cQuadro\u201d however the Quadro brand for workstation GPUs and Tesla brand for data center GPUs were retired. We covered this in Confirmed NVIDIA Quadro Branding Phased Out for New Products if you want to learn more.\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU\nThe NVIDIA RTX A2000 is an 8nm Samsung Ampere GPU, but it is designed for a lower power footprint than many of the other options. First off, it is designed to be a low-profile PCIe Gen4 x16 card which means it can fit in many compact workstations.\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 Front\nIn terms of memory, we get 6GB of GDDR6 with ECC and a 192-bit memory interface good for up to 288GB/s. The 276mm2 die has 13.25 billion transistors and 3328 CUDA cores, 104 Tensor cores, and 26 RT cores. This gives the solution the ability to do 8 TFLOPS of single-precision, 69.9 TFLOPS on the Tensor cores, and 15.6 TFOPS on the RT cores. We did not get double precision figures on the pre-brief for the card. There is also a NVENC and NVDEC onboard with AV1 decode.\nNVIDIA RTX A2000 Three Quarter\nThe card uses a dual-slot active cooler and is a 70W card meaning it does not need external power connectivity instead drawing power from the PCIe Gen4 x16 bus. For graphics, there are four miniDP 1.4 ports.\nFinal Words\nWhile big GPUs get a lot of attention, and for good reason, the trend towards AI inference and GPU acceleration being used by more applications is clear. NVIDIA along with AMD and Intel are racing to add GPU acceleration and AI inference to more edge systems. Intel has been adding DL Boost AI inference instructions as well as pushing its Xe graphics for this and NVIDIA cannot ignore this market. The RTX A2000 is a major step in the right direction here. While it may not be the fastest card on the market, getting Ampere-based compute to lower-end price points and smaller form factors is important for OEM adoption and inclusion in configurations.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAmpereNVIDIARTX \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleNetgear GS305EP Review PoE+ 63W Switch with L2 ManagementNext articleHow to Change Primary Proxmox VE IP Address Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTS\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 10, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            9:14 am                                            \n\n\n\nYuck, the professional line used to have 2x the VRAM than the Geforce counterpart, now the 192bit \u201cQuadro\u201d GPU has 6GB VRAM yet 3060 has 12GB.  What a regression, a mistake that needs to be immediately fixed by Nvidia.  12GB VRAM on the professional A2100 please, and preferably single slot with all power loaded by an 8pin power connector. (A4000 is single slot, I don\u2019t see why a lower 192bit part couldn\u2019t be)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAS\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 10, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:05 am                                            \n\n\n\nGiven the power budget of only 70W and the small form factor, this A2000 is nowhere near the RTX 3060. It is much closer to the old 50 series SKUs, which don\u2019t have an equivalent in the current lineup yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTS\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 10, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            11:28 am                                            \n\n\n\n@AS \nA2000\u2019s 192bit bus means it is a lower clocked 3060 GP106 chip.  70W is impressive, but 6gb is deprecated.  And loading all 70W from the PCIe bus means you can\u2019t use multiple A2000s(unless the board specifically has a 6pin 75w to power each PCIe x16 slot, which is rare outside of specific GPU servers). \n That\u2019s the same issue also with A4000 because it only had a 6pin, which means the PCIe bus is loaded too much to prevent multiGPU use on Asrock EPYC boards  (think 4GPU, 7GPU machines). An 8pin A4000 single slot would have been perfect.\nWhile we are at it, the beautiful A10(proving that even 384bit is doable in single slot with 8pin 150w TDP) is missing a blower for workstation use.  Make a new one and all it the A10C like the K40C?\nSo the entire 192bit, 256bit, 384bit line up all have some small but perhaps intentional market segmentation design flaws by Nvidia to prevent multiGPU computational use. (I mean, if they let you insert 7x A4000 or A10C on Asrock EPYC motherboard, you\u2019d think they will sell more professional GPU to actual AI researchers instead of stupid miners)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogoffon\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 10, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            3:38 pm                                            \n\n\n\nCan\u2019t wait to get one of this and put it in an OEM prebuilt. An RTX card at 70W alone just excited me so much, and its low profile size just makes it better. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrandomgenericdude\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 10, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            8:08 pm                                            \n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve made a very large assumption that is fundamentally incorrect @TS.\nPCIe isn\u2019t a bus as you believe, but instead is a point to point protocol. \nThe Wikipedia page shows the following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#Power\n\u201cAll PCI express cards may consume up to 3 A at +3.3 V (9.9 W). The amount of +12 V and total power they may consume depends on the type of card:[26]:35\u201336[27]\n\u00d71 cards are limited to 0.5 A at +12 V (6 W) and 10 W combined.\n\u00d74 and wider cards are limited to 2.1 A at +12 V (25 W) and 25 W combined.\nA full-sized \u00d71 card may draw up to the 25 W limits after initialization and software configuration as a \u201chigh power device\u201d.\nA full-sized \u00d716 graphics card[22] may draw up to 5.5 A at +12 V (66 W) and 75 W combined after initialization and software configuration as a \u201chigh power device\u201d.\n\u201d\nNote that as a x16 lane part it can draw up to 75W. That\u2019s each SLOT not for the entire motherboard. If it was for the whole board it wouldn\u2019t comply with the specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuca\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 11, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            4:34 am                                            \n\n\n\nI expected to have It the same CUDA core and VRAM of the GeForce RTX 3060 ti\u2026\nWhy dual slot??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDionysos\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 11, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            5:20 am                                            \n\n\n\n6Gb vram on a professional GPU in 2021?\nI Can\u2019t run any decent stress simulation on solid works with 6Gb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 11, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:36 pm                                            \n\n\n\nThe low-power Quadro cards never had 2x the memory of the low power GeForce cards. You must be thinking of the top-of-the-line Quadros. Going back through Fermi, Maxwell, Kepler, and Pascal, the Quadro cards at 80 watts or less had similar memory capacities to the 80 watt or less GeForce offerings. There were also low-power Quadros that had half the memory capacity of some low-power Geforce offerings. And if you go ahead and compare ~75 watt Quadros to higher-power Geforce cards (as you are doing here with the A2000 and the 3060) then you also find instances of the Quadros having far less memory.\nThe only professional low-power cards that NVIDIA seems to have made with high memory capacity were the P4 and the T4, which weren\u2019t Quadros at all, but Teslas.\nNVIDIA hasn\u2019t yet come out with a GA107 or GA108 to make this class of card on yet, so it\u2019s built on a downclocked larger die, something unusual for Quadros. And the GeForce RTX 3060 is an odd goat in the realm of GeForce 30 series cards, as well, having more VRAM than the 3060 Ti, 3070, 3070 Ti, and 3080. NVIDIA likely did that for marketing reasons, because consumers might worry about future games requiring more than 6 GB, not because 6 GB actually wouldn\u2019t have been enough for the card.\nWould it be nice for some people to have 12 GB of memory on the A2000 instead of 6? Sure. But the main thing different from previous history here is the strange large capacity of the 3060 (which is a GPU with over 2.4 times the TDP of the A2000, anyway).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            August 12, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            3:00 pm                                            \n\n\n\n> \u201cWe did not get double precision figures on the pre-brief for the card.\u201d\nNVidia has said of the RTX Ax000 series: \u201cThe FP64 TFLOP rate is 1/64th the TFLOP rate of FP32 operations.\u201d.

That seems quite significant. \n\n\n\nautarchprinceps - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\nI agree. With its main competitors in the field also using ARM, the ecosystem will standardise around that. Increasing amounts of workload will run on ARM, even on x86 servers.I think that is a good thing. With Xe HP(C) also using an actual GPU architecture, instead of trying to use x86 like Xeon Phi did, and an actual foundry service, Intel seems to be committing a lot more to make good products and sales where they can, rather than to rely on vendor lock in and economics of scale alone.\n\n\n\nOreoCookie - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\nTotally agree with you on Xeon Phi, it was such a bad idea to think that a massive amount of x86 cores (P54C derivatives if memory serves) are better suited than an architecture designed from the ground up for GPU workloads. Peak Intel hubris.Now that they let go of it, they can suddenly make products that seem to actually be competitive. Seem to, because nobody has tested them yet. But at least it looks as if they have all the right ingredients: the right architecture, up-to-date manufacturing, etc. \n\n\n\nIan Cutress - Thursday, August 26, 2021 - link\nPhi eventually went Silvermont in KNL.\n\n\n\njeremyshaw - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\nAlso plenty of arm products from the FPGA side of the business. One of which is quite popular for the MiSTer retro hardware (silicon logic) project.Intel FPGA are about as inhouse as Intel >10GbE network chips, so I think the FPGA business counts.\n\n\n\nwatersb - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\nSeems as if Hot Chips this year is really huge! Perhaps things deferred in 2020?\n\n\n\ntwotwotwo - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\nI think it's mostly that Ian decided to go all-out covering it this year!\n\n\n\nIan Cutress - Thursday, August 26, 2021 - link\nI did 18 live blogs last year as well! This year I decided to coalesce several blogs from one section into singular pieces\n\n\n\ntwotwotwo - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\nBecause I (apparently) love writing things down so I can later be officially, on-the-record wrong, I kind of think these will remain pretty specialized, and lose out in favor of (90%) putting accelerators and small cores in servers but without this tight coupling and (10%) smarter but not revolutionary networking/storage gear.Seems what distinguishes this hardware from any old mini-computer on an AIC is 1) high-bandwidth, fast communication between components on a SoC and 2) special-purpose accelerators and lots of small cores.But servers have an embarrassment of bandwidth that's expected to grow, and in the long term you can put accelerators and efficiency cores in them without bundling them into a second mini-computer like this. Meanwhile form the other end, it's possible to keep making incrementally smarter NVMe devices or NICs without inventing a whole new category.Maybe these end up priced to sell in volume, or the software and ecosystem around them is so good that they're an irresistible drop-in speedup for lots of datacenter apps. If they remain only economical for people who have otherwise maxed out a server and need to cram more power in the box, or for a few network/storage-centric uses, then for most of us it's gonna be another trend that comes and goes.\n\n\n\ntwotwotwo - Tuesday, August 24, 2021 - link\n(I should have said \"storage devices\"--I don't think NVMe as we know it could integrate compression offload, for example, and its crypto support is pretty specific to a single full-disk key I think, but you could imagine a storage device that could do more!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

NVIDIA has unveiled new research and tools that can capture those natural speech qualities by letting you train the AI system with your own voice, the company announced at the Interspeech 2021 conference.To improve its AI voice synthesis, NVIDIA\u2019s text-to-speech research team developed a model called RAD-TTS, a winning entry at an NAB broadcast convention competition to develop the most realistic avatar. The system allows an individual to train a text-to-speech model with their own voice, including the pacing, tonality, timbre and more.Another RAD-TTS feature is voice conversion, which lets a user deliver one speaker's words using another person's voice. That interface gives fine, frame-level control over a synthesized voice\u2019s pitch, duration and energy.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementUsing this technology, NVIDIA's researchers created more conversational-sounding voice narration for its own I Am AI video series using synthesized rather than human voices. The aim was to get the narration to match the tone and style of the videos, something that hasn't been done well in many AI narrated videos to date. The results are still a bit robotic, but better than any AI narration I've ever heard.\"With this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script, and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator\u2019s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor \u2014 tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words, and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video\u2019s tone,\" NVIDIA wrote.NVIDIA is distributing some of this research \u2014 optimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, of course \u2014 to anyone who wants to try it via open source through the NVIDIA NeMo Python toolkit for GPU-accelerated conversational AI, available on the company's NGC hub of containers and other software.\"Several of the models are trained with tens of thousands of hours of audio data on NVIDIA DGX systems. Developers can fine tune any model for their use cases, speeding up training using mixed-precision computing on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs,\" the company wrote.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

The company is also unmatched in its software ecosystem designed around its GPUs, with work and play both catered for.The Studio program has had a fair bit of recognition, partly because it accompanied a lot of shiny new laptops and software that many creative people use. But something which I think still flies under the radar too much is NVIDIA Broadcast.Born from RTX Voice, NVIDIA Broadcast is magical in what it can do. If you're a content creator or you spend a lot of time video conferencing, this is a piece of software you need in your arsenal. Assuming you can use it, that is.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast\n    \n\n\nDownload at NVIDIA\nDescription: One app that will transform the look of your webcam and the sound of your microphone, removing unnecessary distractions for all.Compatibility: Windows 10, requires NVIDIA RTX graphics cardBottom line: If you try to think too long about how NVIDIA Broadcast does what it does, it'll make your brain ache. If you work in a noisy environment or you want to do a little creative background work for your webcam, nothing does it as well as NVIDIA Broadcast.Highlights:AI background noise cancellationVideo background blurVideo background removal/replacement\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast: Price and availabilityNVIDIA Broadcast is available now and is a completely free download for anyone using Windows 10. It does require an RTX graphics card to operate, however, with the RTX 2060 listed as the minimum requirement.NVIDIA Broadcast: What you'll likeSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)NVIDIA Broadcast has three main sections covering a different part of your audiovisual experience. The first handles your microphone, the second your speakers, and the third your webcam. Each can be enabled individually and used in conjunction with the other features or by itself. Using NVIDIA Broadcast in any app that takes a microphone or webcam is super simple; you just choose Broadcast as your hardware device in place of your actual microphone or webcam.The original feature is the AI background noise cancellation for microphones. Prior to broadcast was RTX Voice, with the features then combined with the others to create Broadcast. Enabling it is as simple as turning on a toggle, and there's a sliding scale to determine how much effect you need.Image 1 of 2If you're in a really noisy room, you can turn it up higher, though it may have more overall effect on your microphone quality. So if you're in a less noisy environment you can scale it down a bit and preserve the quality. But you can test inside the app before committing to anything. Depending on just how loud your room is will have an effect, but if background noise isn't completely removed it will at least be heavily suppressed.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.This sample shows just how good it really is. Recorded in a room with both a fan operating on its highest speed and with music playing in the background.It really does seem to be able to block out anything that isn't your voice, and I've been able to use it consistently on conference calls without turning off my fan or my music without any of my coworkers hearing a thing.The speaker section again has an area to test out the effect, and it seems to do its thing. But everyone who's ever been talking to me could also be in a really quiet room! Given how good the microphone noise filtering is though there's no reason not to trust it's working as intended.The webcam tools are also excellent. It's particularly useful if you're a streamer, but also if you just want to jazz up your conference calls. The main functionality is to blur, remove or replace your background, and in each case, it does a great job. It isn't perfect, as none of these software solutions are, but if your webcam is in a small box on a stream it'll be hard to tell you're not using hardware to generate the effect.If you look closely you will notice around the edges of yourself where things get a bit dicey, but it's perfectly acceptable and you have a choice of quality or performance. More recent additions are an auto framing tool that will crop in as a fake zoom but will \"move\" as you move to ensure you stay in the center of the frame. As my colleagues have pointed out, it certainly does what it says. The other is video noise removal, which is particularly good for webcams as it makes video look smoother and less grainy. It's like a beauty filter for your webcam.NVIDIA Broadcast: What you won't likeSource: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)If you can use NVIDIA Broadcast there's nothing you won't like. Everything it says it will do, it does extremely well, and it runs quietly in the background not requiring much attention.The key is the \"if you can use it\" part. Broadcast makes use of tech found on NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards, so if you don't have one, you can't use it. I'm sure the app could be opened up, but it's designed to use NVIDIA's own hardware and make as little impact on your overall system resources as possible.There's also some quirkiness with which camera it chooses if you have multiple video devices in your system. Inside my PC I have a PCIe capture card that identifies as a regular, plug-and-play video device, just like a webcam. And for some reason, this will randomly become the selected camera in Broadcast.It could be something to do with Windows 10 as well, but it's a thing that happens from time to time.NVIDIA Broadcast: AlternativesSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)If you're a streamer you might well use NVIDIA Broadcast inside OBS Studio, but you can also use OBS on its own as a virtual camera with your other video apps. OBS is free, open-source, and extremely powerful, with a hefty catalog of plugins and features that you can use to make your webcam look better and your microphone sound sharper.For background blurriness and replacements on other PCs that don't have an NVIDIA RTX GPU, there is XSplit VCam. The downside is that it isn't free, but it's also not that expensive either. It can use either CPU or GPU to create background effects, though in the case of the former you'll need a beefy processor lest you start suffering from resource issues.NVIDIA Broadcast: Should you get it?If you spend any amount of time looking into a camera and/or speaking into a microphone you should absolutely get NVIDIA Broadcast. Even if you already have a setup for your audio and your camera, you'll probably find that just the noise cancellation alone on this app is unlike anything you've ever used.Whether it's your kids, your keyboard, some noisy builders outside, whatever it is that isn't your voice, this app can make it go away. Only your voice matters.NVIDIA Broadcast: The bottom lineIf you have the right hardware and you ever use a webcam or a microphone, this app should be on your PC. It's untouchable in what it does and the fact it's completely free is the icing on the cake. If you're an aspiring streamer and a mirrorless camera is out of your budget, use this app and generate a similar look without the expense.It is a shame that it isn't at least possible to use all these features on older NVIDIA graphics cards as well, but sometimes tech really does get in the way. I've been using NVIDIA Broadcast for some time now and it's one of the first apps I'd recommend to a streamer in particular. It's absolutely mind-blowing.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast\n    \n\n\nDownload at NVIDIA\nBottom line: The NVIDIA boffins have delivered something remarkable, and you won't find better noise-cancelling software than this with the added bonus that it's completely free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nRichard DevineSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor - Tech, ReviewsRichard Devine is a Managing Editor at Windows Central with over a decade of experience.
