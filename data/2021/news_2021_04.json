Additionally, the companies will partner on scientific and research breakthroughs to further advance physics-based computing and machine learning for drug discovery.\nFor each potential drug candidate, Schr\u00f6dinger routinely evaluates tens of thousands of molecules with its most computationally intensive physics-based approaches. This requires hundreds of thousands of hours of GPU time on high-performance computers.\nThrough the collaboration, the entire pharmaceutical industry comprising over 3,000 companies \u2014 from startups to multinationals \u2014 will be able to further accelerate drug discovery at supercomputing scale. The joint solution will enable companies of all sizes to simulate molecular combinations with physics and AI to identify and optimize the most promising compounds for potential therapeutic use. Pharmaceutical companies can run this research on their own easy-to-deploy private clouds featuring the Schr\u00f6dinger platform running on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which is available to install on premises or in a colocation facility.\n\u201cThe predictive modeling built into our platform is designed to dramatically expand and accelerate the search for high-quality therapeutic molecules, and NVIDIA is a key technology partner in this work,\u201d said Patrick Lorton, chief technology officer at Schr\u00f6dinger. \u201cOur advanced computational software helps the world\u2019s biggest pharma companies explore more of the chemical space and reach high-quality candidates more quickly, with far less compute cost, than traditional methods. We\u2019re proud to be working with NVIDIA to make that process run even more smoothly.\u201d\nNVIDIA research and engineering teams are working to advance and optimize the Schr\u00f6dinger suite to take advantage of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture and its Multi-Instance GPU technology. Customers will be able to easily deploy Schr\u00f6dinger software on a single DGX system or a cluster of 20 or more to create a DGX SuperPOD. This allows scaling the Schr\u00f6dinger platform to dozens of drug programs and screening and evaluating billions of molecules a week.\n\u201cComputational drug discovery is improving accuracy with Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s advanced combination of simulation with machine learning,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re giving the pharmaceutical industry a scientific instrument that delivers super-high-throughput lead generation to improve and accelerate the success of drug candidates.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2018s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

Evidence of this is provided by a lump of launches today from the likes of PowerColor, Colourful and Colorfire.\n\nPowerColor Japan is teasing a new 'Spectral White' version of its Hellhound Radeon RX 6700 XT via Twitter. The PCB looks rather striking even as it is shown bare, but will very likely be complemented by white shroud, backplate and fans with Blue LEDs and a backplate logo. For reference, check the link to the black version product page.\nIf white is out, but pink is your thing, then some new graphics cards from Colorful's Colorfire sub-brand might appeal. These are more entry level add-ins based around the Nvidia GTX 1660 Super, GTX 1650 Super, and GTX 1650 GDDR6. You will find that the beefiest card is a triple fan design while the others are amply cooled by dual-fan shrouds.\n\nVideoCardz notes that Colorful last used this sub-brand to hawk AMD Radeon graphics cards though that is obviously not the case in this instance. Other than the colour appeal, these cards are of little interest.\nLastly, Colorful has showcased what might be best described as a 'GeForce RTX 3060 Founders Edition refin'. For this Colorful iGame Bilibili E-Sports OC graphics card a shroud has been designed to look like a resprayed Founders Edition. Nvidia has never produced such an RTX 3060 reference design.\n\nAs you might expect from the description the design uses a double-sided fan and special livery created for the Bilibili social media prize lottery \u2013 where it will be a prize (lottery kicks off on 4th May). It is also up for pre-order for sale from 5th May. Pre-order price is equivalent to \u00a3665 at today's exchange rate.\nWith some variation in the Bilibili eSports design evidenced by the renders it is thought that the card design isn't finalised. It has a slight OC and increased power draw but still relies on a single 8-pin power connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 5 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

With the new partnerships announced today, we\u2019re taking important steps to expand the Arm ecosystem beyond mobile and embedded.\u201d\nNVIDIA GPU + AWS Graviton2-based Amazon EC2 Instances\r\nNVIDIA and AWS announced that they are working together to deploy GPU-accelerated Arm-based instances in the cloud. The new Amazon EC2 instances will bring together AWS Graviton2 processors and NVIDIA GPUs to provide a range of benefits, including lower cost, support for richer game-streaming experiences, and greater performance for Arm-based workloads.\nThe instances will enable game developers to run Android games natively on AWS, accelerate rendering and encoding with NVIDIA GPUs, and stream games to mobile devices without the need to run emulation software.\nDevkit for HPC\r\nNVIDIA unveiled the NVIDIA Arm HPC Developer Kit to support scientific computing amid the growing need for energy-efficient supercomputers and data centers. It includes an Ampere\u00ae Altra\u00ae CPU, with 80 Arm Neoverse cores running up to 3.3GHz; dual NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each delivering 312 teraflops of FP16 deep learning performance, as well as two NVIDIA BlueField-2\u00ae DPUs, which accelerate networking, storage and security.\nThe devkit runs the NVIDIA HPC SDK, a suite of compilers, libraries and tools that enable engineers, scientists and developers to create and migrate HPC and AI applications to a GPU-accelerated Arm computing system.\nDevelopers and ISV partners can use the devkit to easily migrate and validate their software, and conduct performance analysis. Among initial leading computing centers deploying it are Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Stony Brook University in the U.S.; the National Center for High Performance Computing, in Taiwan; and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology.\nSean Varley, senior director of Solutions at Ampere Computing, said, \u201cThe powerful combination of NVIDIA GPU and DPU accelerators with cloud-native Ampere Altra processors offers our customers leading performance, scalability, instance and core density, all while predictably executing very demanding data center and cloud workloads such as cloud gaming, HPC, scientific compute, artificial intelligence and networking. NVIDIA\u2019s Arm HPC Developer Kit is an easily accessible way to test drive this world-class combination for the most challenging workloads.\u201d\nDevelopers can apply for early access to the HPC devkit, which will be available in Q3.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA is working with lab directors, scientists and partners to help them port their software to run on Arm CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.\nCollaborations in Edge, PC\r\nNVIDIA is expanding its collaboration with Marvell to combine OCTEON\u00ae DPUs with GPUs to accelerate cloud, enterprise, carrier and edge applications.

There aren't any sharp movements to be seen, and indeed that would be a rarity, but there are some interesting trends and milestones to observe this month.\nPC video card usage\nThe most popular graphics card among Steam users remains the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. It looks set to stay that way for quite some time with its considerable lead. The rising GTX 1650 is still significantly behind in third place. With rumours of a re-introduction it might be the second placed GTX 1050 Ti that takes the crown later this year, if anything, but it actually slipped a little this month.\n\nThe biggest graphics card riser of the last month is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070. It climbed 0.17 per cent last month to take 17th spot in the chart with 1.29 per cent of Steam users owning this GPU. This result might be somewhat surprising given the well publicized shortages of Ampere GPUs out there. However, it is the only Ampere GPU in the top 20. I wonder what portion of these RTX 3070 GPUs are in laptops...\n\nAbove you can see the current top 20 GPUs among Steam gamers. Nvidia Pascal dominates the top half of the chart. Among the 20, AMD only has the duo of old Polaris graphics cards in there, Radeon RX 580 and 570, with the last spot of the table taken by the Vega 8 integrated graphics present on some of its APUs.\nPC CPUs\nAMD enjoys a much rosier picture and immediate outlook with regard to the CPU charts. Its Ryzen processors have grabbed an additional half a percent market share in the last month and are nearing the 30 per cent user base milestone. The current trend suffered a slight blip, in Intel's favour, in December. That is likely to have something to do with supply issues, which seems to be easing now for AMD Ryzen 5000 series desktop CPUs. Additionally, AMD enjoyed quite a good number of design wins in gaming and other laptops at the CES at the start of the year.\nElsewhere, I note the adoption / upgrading of systems to 16GB RAM is up half a per cent in the last month. There seem to be lots of 8GB folk upgrading right now, with most plumping for 16GB but a good portion also reaching 32GB. The 16GB minimum makes sense with the latest AAA games, and the larger 32GB quota is probably a popular choice for demanding multi-taskers and games streamers. Users moving to CPUs with more cores continues, with significant gains in users owning hexa-core and octa-core CPUs in the last month (physical cores).\n\nWindows 10's steady ascendancy continues. In the last month it climbed another 0.37 per cent. Among Steam users 92.38 per cent now use Windows 10 64-bit, with only 2.33 per cent holding on to Windows 7 64-bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nTSMC announces N4P process as value N3 alternative for 2023\n\n                    Fifth process to be developed from original N5 promises 6 per cent perf uplift over N4. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n5\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n                    Server and semi-custom chips are selling particularly well.

Each provides 24GB of HBM2 GPU memory and fast PCIe Gen 4 memory bandwidth while supporting four 6GB GPU instances with NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU technology.\nA30 supports a broad range of AI inference, training and traditional enterprise compute workloads. It can power AI use cases such as recommender systems, conversational AI and computer vision systems.\nFor AI training, its third-generation NVIDIA Tensor Cores support single-precision floating-point 32 calculations and an innovative new math mode known as TensorFloat-32, which boosts performance 20x over the previous-generation NVIDIA T4 GPUs.\nThe enterprise-grade NVIDIA A10\u202fTensor Core GPU powers accelerated graphics, rendering, AI and compute workloads in mainstream NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Built on the latest NVIDIA Ampere architecture, it provides 24GB of memory to accelerate the work of designers, engineers, artists and scientists.\nIndustry Leaders Embrace Virtualized AI\r\nIndustry innovators spanning healthcare, professional services, manufacturing and more are deploying NVIDIA-Certified Systems and NVIDIA and VMware\u2019s AI-ready enterprise platform to power virtualized AI and data science.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform gives us the flexibility to support a broad range of mission-critical applications,\u201d said Steven Walker, chief technology officer at Lockheed Martin. \u201cFrom enabling real-time collaborative design and simulation, to deep learning capabilities that are revolutionizing predictive maintenance, cybersecurity and humanitarian assistance missions, NVIDIA-Certified Systems and software are critical to scaling infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cVirtualization is enabling healthcare systems to deliver services to clinicians and patients at scale, across radiology departments and facilities,\u201d said Tom Schultz, director of Information Systems, Enterprise Medical Imaging, and Clinical Data Science at Mass General Brigham. \u201cIt has the potential to significantly increase the adoption of GPU-based AI applications. This allows for better utilization of technology infrastructure and minimizes the need for dedicated GPU systems for each project, which means AI can be applied more broadly to improve patient services.\u201d\nAvailability \r\nMore than 20 NVIDIA-Certified Systems are available now from worldwide computer makers.\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems featuring NVIDIA A30 and NVIDIA A10 GPUs will be available later this year from manufacturers.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is available as a perpetual license at $3,595 per CPU socket. Enterprise Business Standard Support for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $899 annually per license. Customers can apply for early access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise as they plan their upgrades to VMware vSphere 7 Update 2.\nRegister for free to learn more about the NVIDIA EGX platform, NVIDIA-Certified Systems and NVIDIA AI Enterprise for VMware vSphere during GTC21, taking place online April 12-16.

NVIDIA Research is revving up a new deep learning engine that creates 3D object models from standard 2D images \u2014 and can bring iconic cars like the Knight Rider\u2019s AI-powered KITT to life \u2014 in NVIDIA Omniverse.\nDeveloped by the NVIDIA AI Research Lab in Toronto, the GANverse3D application inflates flat images into realistic 3D models that can be visualized and controlled in virtual environments. This capability could help architects, creators, game developers and designers easily add new objects to their mockups without needing expertise in 3D modeling, or a large budget to spend on renderings.\nA single photo of a car, for example, could be turned into a 3D model that can drive around a virtual scene, complete with realistic headlights, tail lights and blinkers.\n\nTo generate a dataset for training, the researchers harnessed a generative adversarial network, or GAN, to synthesize images depicting the same object from multiple viewpoints \u2014 like a photographer who walks around a parked vehicle, taking shots from different angles. These multi-view images were plugged into a rendering framework for inverse graphics, the process of inferring 3D mesh models from 2D images.\nOnce trained on multi-view images, GANverse3D needs only a single 2D image to predict a 3D mesh model. This model can be used with a 3D neural renderer that gives developers control to customize objects and swap out backgrounds.\nWhen imported as an extension in the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and run on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, GANverse3D can be used to recreate any 2D image into 3D \u2014 like the beloved crime-fighting car KITT, from the popular 1980s Knight Rider TV show.\nPrevious models for inverse graphics have relied on 3D shapes as training data.\nInstead, with no aid from 3D assets, \u201cWe turned a GAN model into a very efficient data generator so we can create 3D objects from any 2D image on the web,\u201d said Wenzheng Chen, research scientist at NVIDIA and lead author on the project.\n\u201cBecause we trained on real images instead of the typical pipeline, which relies on synthetic data, the AI model generalizes better to real-world applications,\u201d said NVIDIA researcher Jun Gao, an author on the project.\nThe research behind GANverse3D will be presented at two upcoming conferences: the International Conference on Learning Representations in May, and the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, in June.\nFrom Flat Tire to Racing KITT\u00a0\nCreators in gaming, architecture and design rely on virtual environments like the NVIDIA Omniverse simulation and collaboration platform to test out new ideas and visualize prototypes before creating their final products. With Omniverse Connectors, developers can use their preferred 3D applications in Omniverse to simulate complex virtual worlds with real-time ray tracing.\nBut not every creator has the time and resources to create 3D models of every object they sketch. The cost of capturing the number of multi-view images necessary to render a showroom\u2019s worth of cars, or a street\u2019s worth of buildings, can be prohibitive.\nThat\u2019s where a trained GANverse3D application can be used to convert standard images of a car, a building or even a horse into a 3D figure that can be customized and animated in Omniverse.\nTo recreate KITT, the researchers simply fed the trained model an image of the car, letting GANverse3D predict a corresponding 3D textured mesh, as well as different parts of the vehicle such as wheels and headlights. They then used NVIDIA Omniverse Kit and NVIDIA PhysX tools to convert the predicted texture into high-quality materials that give KITT a more realistic look and feel, and placed it in a dynamic driving sequence.\n\u201cOmniverse allows researchers to bring exciting, cutting-edge research directly to creators and end users,\u201d said Jean-Francois Lafleche, deep learning engineer at NVIDIA. \u201cOffering GANverse3D as an extension in Omniverse will help artists create richer virtual worlds for game development, city planning or even training new machine learning models.\u201d\nGANs Power a Dimensional Shift\nBecause real-world datasets that capture the same object from different angles are rare, most AI tools that convert images from 2D to 3D are trained using synthetic 3D datasets like ShapeNet.\nTo obtain multi-view images from real-world data \u2014 like images of cars available publicly on the web \u2014 the NVIDIA researchers instead turned to a GAN model, manipulating its neural network layers to turn it into a data generator.\nThe team found that opening the first four layers of the neural network and freezing the remaining 12 caused the GAN to render images of the same object from different viewpoints.\nKeeping the first four layers frozen and the other 12 layers variable caused the neural network to generate different images from the same viewpoint. By manually assigning standard viewpoints, with vehicles pictured at a specific elevation and camera distance, the researchers could rapidly generate a multi-view dataset from individual 2D images.\nThe final model, trained on 55,000 car images generated by the GAN, outperformed an inverse graphics network trained on the popular Pascal3D dataset.\nRead the full ICLR paper, authored by Wenzheng Chen, fellow NVIDIA researchers Jun Gao and Huan Ling, Sanja Fidler, director of NVIDIA\u2019s Toronto research lab, University of Waterloo student Yuxuan Zhang, Stanford student Yinan Zhang and MIT professor Antonio Torralba.

Perhaps the strongest bit of evidence is a recently leaked photo of a pallet of supposed MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Ventus 3X OC graphics cards being prepped for shipment from China to the United States. Following up on that leak, it's said the new SKU will launch at $999 (MSRP).\n\n\nObviously there's little-to-no chance you will actually be able to buy one at MSRP, if and when the new part launches, at least not right away\u2014the GeForce RTX 30 series is always out of stock. Save for a few lucky folk who beat the bots and miners to the punch, the ongoing shortage of silicon, including GPUs, is very likely to render this a paper launch. Be that as it may, cards do still carry MSRPs, and here's how the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti allegedly fits within the pricing hierarchy of modern generation GPUs...\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090: $1,499\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: $999 (Leaked MSRP)\n\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT: $999\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080: $699\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT: $649\nAMD Radeon RX 6800: $579\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: $499\nAMD Radeon RX 6700: $479\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: $399\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060: $329\n\nIt is a smart launch, assuming NVIDIA positions the card as rumored, pricing it equivalently to AMD's Radeon RX 6900 XT. It will presumably offer better performance for the same money, in both rasterized rendering and real-time ray-traced visuals. At the same time, NVIDIA risks cutting into sales of the GeForce RTX 3090, though there are two reasons why the company might not be worried about that happening.\n\n\nFor one, NVIDIA is selling every GPU it can source. That will probably be the case throughout 2021, and manufacturing partner TSMC even suggested the silicon shortage in general (not just of GPUs) could last throughout next year and even into part of 2023 as well.\n\n\n\nSource: Lok LOK (via Facebook)\n\n\n\nSecondly, it appears NVIDIA revised the originally intended specifications for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, which in turn will create a bigger gap in performance between it and the GeForce RTX 3090. We mentioned this as a possibility when writing about the leaked photo of MSI-brand cards bound for the US, and according to HKEPC, which is hearing the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will cost $999, that's precisely what happened.\n\n\nAccording to the Chinese-language news site, the original plan was for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti to essentially be a slightly cut down version of the GeForce RTX 3090, with the same number of CUDA cores (10,496), almost the same amount of GDDR6X memory (20GB versus 24GB), and the same memory bus (384-bit).\n\n\n\nHowever, it's said NVIDIA is not really feeling the competitive pressure from the Radeon RX 6900 XT, AMD's flagship GPU, so it downgraded the specifications to 10,240 CUDA cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory.\n\n\nIs that really the case? Only NVIDIA truly knows, but we can say that earlier GeForce RTX 3080 Ti leaks and rumors did have it pegged as having 10,496 CUDA cores and 20GB of memory, whereas more recent ones reflect the seemingly downgraded specifications. As always, we'll have to wait and see what emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0\r\n\r\n                Nvidia, (nasdaq:nvda), geforce rtx 3080 ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nRSS\nEmail\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CONVERSATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich New GPU Is For You?\n\n\n\n\n Intel Arc B580\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\n\n 9070 XT\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\n\n Radeon RX 9070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE HOT HEADLINES \n\nNVIDIA Project DIGITS Renamed DGX Spark,...\nNVIDIA Blackwell RTX Pro To Supercharge...\nNVIDIA Unveils Blackwell Ultra GB300...\nXbox 360 Just Became A Modder's Dream...\nGemini AI Excels At Removing Watermarks...\nBeep-Beep!

Yahoo Finance Singapore   Sat, 1 May 2021, 11:42 am 3 min read               Employees say work-life boundaries have become blurred during the pandemic. (PHOTO: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images) \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images  By Wu Pei Chuan SINGAPORE \u2014 Labour Day is celebrated in Singapore and many other countries to honour workers. We have come far in reducing the working hours and improving the working conditions of workers. In Singapore, government statistics showed that the weekly paid hours have come down gradually, from 47.0 in the year 2000, to 46.2 in 2010 and then 44.0 in 2020.   However, Singapore was the second most overworked city in a Kisi survey in 2020, only behind Hong Kong. Singapore also placed 41st out of 50 cities in work-life balance, with the overworked population increasing from 23 per cent in 2019 to 25.1 per cent in 2020. It seems that we are still working hard. This phenomenon can be witnessed in other Asian cities as well. Japanese workers are reluctant to take annual leave. Chinese workers in the technology industry are burning out due to the infamous 996 work schedule, where they clock in from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. Why we work hard Many say this is due to the deep-rooted hard-working culture in Asia, where collectivism and power distance prevail. Workers shy away from knocking off earlier than their superiors and do not dare to say no when additional duties are assigned at odd hours. Technology has also prolonged the time that workers are connected to their jobs. The messages and emails beyond work hours could easily result in burnout, stress, and reduced levels of job and life satisfaction. This could have a negative impact on mental well-being.   The overworking situation intensified in 2020 when employees were required to work from home during global lockdowns. Employees say work-life boundaries have become blurred, whereas managers worry about \u201cface time\u201d and performance outcomes. In the May 2020 JobStreet Singapore survey report, employees in Singapore were less happy with their quality of life during the pandemic, with 44 per cent indicating that they were unhappy during the pandemic, compared to 9 per cent before the pandemic. Workers reported that they were facing heavier workload (31%) and work-family imbalance (30%). For those working from home, their top three concerns were working longer hours (55%), creating a separate workspace (47%), and changing the times they worked (44%). Changes can be taken in small steps But we can take small steps to change the working conditions. As companies balance safety measures and company operations, one thing to consider in addition is employee wellness and the employee experience. After all, people are the key to a company\u2019s success.   Some companies have tried to help employees cope better in these changing circumstances, such as organising virtual team-bonding events or sending care packages to their employees. Microsoft has recently added five \u201cwell-being days\u201d of annual leave to every employee across their global operations. Accenture launched an online resource kit in 2020 to help employees build mental resilience and improve mental well-being.   Story continues   Workers today may not encounter working conditions as harsh as decades ago. But they are facing constant job challenges. Providing social support and well-being perks are critical steps to safeguard employees\u2019 well-being and health. The next step would be centred on work itself. It\u2019s time for business leaders to turn around the table and address heavy workload situations in Asia. As we celebrate Labour Day, let\u2019s continue in our efforts to achieve greater work-life balance.

It isn't clear whether pre-orders will opened by Nvidia, partners, or retailers. This schedule info was outlined by a supposedly reliable source who shared the dates on the IT Home Chinese tech forums, via TPU.\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has been quite prominent on our news radar over recent weeks. This as-yet to be released premium consumer offering hit the headlines last Christmas but has since been reconfigured by Nvidia, so the story goes, to better fit the gap it is filling and better compete against the AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPUs that are now a known threat.\nIt seems certainly very clear that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti isn't a phantom or figment of any tech news site's imagination with the most recent reports featuring clearly labelled shipping cartons and GPU dies caught 'red-handed'. These were seen quite shortly after Gigabyte's EEC registration of twelve RTX 3080 Ti designs.\n\nAbove you can see where most tech news sites reckon the RTX 3080 Ti will sit, in spec terms (purple). The card has the potential to be very popular, like its previous gen predecessor, if it could be made available in quantity at the MSRP of US$999. It will be one of the first cards with Nvidia's new mining limiter tech, which might help deter crypto mining focussed purchasers.\nWe are also waiting patiently to see signs of the GeForce RTX 3050 / Ti, to see what pricing, performance and availability will be on offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 13 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

It features the HPE Cray software stack for a software-defined supercomputing experience, as well as the NVIDIA HGX\u2122 supercomputing platform, including NVIDIA GPUs, the NVIDIA HPC SDK and the new Arm-based NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPU, also announced today.\nTaking advantage of the tight coupling between NVIDIA CPUs and GPUs, Alps will be able to train GPT-3, one of the world\u2019s largest natural language processing models, in only two days \u2014 7x faster than NVIDIA\u2019s 2.8-AI exaflops Selene supercomputer, currently recognized as the world\u2019s leading supercomputer for AI by MLPerf.\nCSCS users will be able to apply this incredible AI performance to a wide range of emerging scientific research that can benefit from natural language understanding. This includes, for example, analyzing and understanding massive amounts of knowledge available in scientific papers and generating new molecules for drug discovery.\n\u201cWe are not simply procuring a new computer. For enabling scientific breakthroughs, we are retrofitting our computer center in several expansion phases to a service-oriented research infrastructure,\u201d said Thomas Schulthess, computational physicist at ETH Zurich and director of CSCS. \u201cAlps will use the HPE Cray EX supercomputing infrastructure based on a cloud-native software architecture to implement a software-defined research infrastructure, as well as NVIDIA\u2019s novel Grace CPU to converge AI technologies and classic supercomputing in one single, powerful data center infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cHPE has had a longstanding collaboration with the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) in advancing high performance computing (HPC) technologies to accelerate a range of scientific research,\u201d said Antonio Neri, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. \u201cWe are honored to continue this journey by designing a powerful new system that furthers CSCS\u2019s mission. Armed with this incredible tool, CSCS is equipped to harness new insights from its data that drive breakthroughs in advancing our world.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s monumental scientific challenges demand a new kind of supercomputer to fuel discovery,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cTaking advantage of our new Grace CPU designed for giant-scale AI and HPC, CSCS and NVIDIA are joining together to blaze a new trail \u2014 building a world-class, Arm-based supercomputing infrastructure that will let leading scientists apply the power of AI to do world-changing research.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAbout CSCS\r\nFounded in 1991, CSCS, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, develops and promotes technical and scientific services for the Swiss research community in the fields of high-performance computing.

We also had announcements with leading cloud service providers to deliver high-quality XR streaming from the cloud. And we released a new version of Variable Rate Supersampling to improve visual performance.\nBringing High Performance and VR Mobility Together\nNVIDIA CloudXR is an advanced technology that gives XR users the best of both worlds: the performance of NVIDIA GPUs with the mobility of untethered all-in-one head-mounted displays.\nCloudXR is designed to stream all kinds of XR content from any server to any device. Users can easily access powerful, high-quality immersive experiences from anywhere in the world, without being physically connected to a workstation.\nFrom product designers reviewing 3D models to first responders running training simulations, anyone can benefit from CloudXR using Windows and Android devices. We will soon be releasing CloudXR 2.1, which adds support for Apple iOS AR devices, including iPads and iPhones.\nTaking XR Streaming to the Cloud\nWith 5G networks rolling out, streaming XR over 5G from the cloud has the potential to significantly enhance workflows across industries. But the big challenge with delivering XR from the cloud is latency \u2014 for people to have a great VR experience, they have to maintain 20ms motion-to-photon latency.\nTo deliver the best cloud streaming experience, we\u2019ve fine-tuned NVIDIA CloudXR. Over the past six months, we\u2019ve taken great strides to bring CloudXR streaming to cloud service providers, from Amazon Web Services to Tencent.\nThis year at GTC, we\u2019re continuing this march forward with additional news:\n\nCloudXR is available on Amazon Marketplace as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)\nThe CloudXR platform will be available on NVIDIA GPU-powered virtual machine instances on Azure\n\nAlso at GTC, Google will present a session that showcases CloudXR running on a Google Cloud instance.\n\nTo support CloudXR everywhere, we\u2019re adding more client devices to our family.\nWe\u2019ve worked with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver boundless XR, and with Ericsson on its 5G radio and packet core infrastructure to optimize CloudXR. Hear about the translation of this work to the manufacturing environment at BT\u2019s session in GTC\u2019s XR track.\nAnd we\u2019ve collaborated with Magic Leap on a CloudXR integration, which they will present at GTC. Magic Leap and CloudXR provide a great step forward for spatial computing and an advanced solution that brings many benefits to enterprise customers.\nRedefining the XR Experience\u00a0\nThe quality of visuals in a VR experience is critical to provide users with the best visual performance. That\u2019s why NVIDIA developed Variable Rate Supersampling (VRSS), which allows rendering resources to be focused in a foveated region where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact on image quality.\nThe first VRSS version supported fixed foveated rendering in the center of the screen. The latest version, VRSS 2, integrates dynamic gaze tracking, moving the foveated region where the user is looking.\nThese advances in XR technology are also paving the way for a solution that allows users to learn, work, collaborate or play with others in a highly realistic immersive environment. The CloudXR iOS integration will soon be available in NVIDIA Omniverse, a collaboration and simulation platform that streamlines 3D production pipelines.\nTeams around the world can enter Omniverse and simultaneously collaborate across leading content creation applications in a shared virtual space. With the upcoming CloudXR 2.1 release, Omniverse users can stream specific AR solutions using their iOS tablets and phones.\nExpanding XR Workflows at GTC\nLearn more about these advances in XR technology at GTC.

The rupee was aided by dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters during the session, a trader at a mid-sized private bank said.   Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Using modern Nvidia hardware, with a fast display and the latest Game Ready driver gamers can expect system latency to be reduced by as much as 50 per cent in this popular competitive title.\n\nIn its blog post highlighting the Reflex / Overwatch news, Nvidia reminds us that in competitive eSports titles like Overwatch spit second reactions are often the difference between victory and failure, and between (virtual) life and death. Reflex delivers some big benefits in this arena, allowing gamers to \"acquire targets faster, react quicker, and increase aim precision,\" as you can see evidenced in the screen-grabs reproduced below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning on Nvidia Reflex is easy. For the Overwatch live game please make sure that both the game and your drivers are the newest versions and then head to the in game options > video settings > and toggle Nvidia Reflex on. If you wish to optimise further, to sharpen your competitive edge, Nvidia has a guide that you can follow to reduce system latency further. This guide walks you through lots of settings beyond game and graphics driver and is worth a look if eSports success is very important to you.\n\n*To use Nvidia Reflex and benefit from latency improvements in GPU-intensive games you should be packing an Nvidia GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU. Nvidia says that with popular mid-range cards, like the GeForce GTX 1660 Super, gamers can expect up to a 33 per cent improvement in PC responsiveness with Reflex. Faster cards and displays deliver increased benefits as you can see from the video / charts above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 12 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Good for sometime, but feels like almost cheating.There's not much in the article about any kind of advantage, it's just better translating your intended actions into actual actions (fire now=fire a bit closer to now than before). Therefore any skill elements designed in the game (e.g. bullet travel time/whatever) are closer to what you experience as a player. I guess that could end up giving you an advantage, but really this is going to improve the experience (in an undetectable way) for everyone - it applies even to pretty ancient cards, and AMD/MS have a similar thing coming too.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\nSEE NEWER \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin |\n                Register\n\nA\nA\nA\n\nFull HEXUS Site\n\nAbout Us -\n                Contact Us -\n                Advertise -\n                T&Cs \n\n\n\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.\n\u201cLeading-edge AI and data science are pushing today\u2019s computer architecture beyond its limits \u2013 processing unthinkable amounts of data,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cUsing licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.\u201d\nGrace is a highly specialized processor targeting workloads such as training next-generation NLP models that have more than 1 trillion parameters. When tightly coupled with NVIDIA GPUs, a Grace CPU-based system will deliver 10x faster performance than today\u2019s state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX\u2122-based systems, which run on x86 CPUs.\nWhile the vast majority of data centers are expected to be served by existing CPUs, Grace \u2014 named for Grace Hopper, the U.S. computer-programming pioneer \u2014 will serve a niche segment of computing.\nThe Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory are the first to announce plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers in support of national scientific research efforts.\nNVIDIA is introducing Grace as the volume of data and size of AI models are growing exponentially. Today\u2019s largest AI models include billions of parameters and are doubling every two-and-a-half months. Training them requires a new CPU that can be tightly coupled with a GPU to eliminate system bottlenecks.\nNVIDIA built Grace by leveraging the incredible flexibility of Arm\u2019s data center architecture. By introducing a new server-class CPU, NVIDIA is advancing the goal of technology diversity in AI and HPC communities, where choice is key to delivering the innovation needed to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\u201cAs the world\u2019s most widely licensed processor architecture, Arm drives innovation in incredible new ways every day,\u201d said Arm CEO Simon Segars. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s introduction of the Grace data center CPU illustrates clearly how Arm\u2019s licensing model enables an important invention, one that will further support the incredible work of AI researchers and scientists everywhere.\u201d\nGrace\u2019s First Adopters Push Limits of Science and AI\r\nCSCS and Los Alamos National Laboratory both plan to bring Grace-powered supercomputers, built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, online in 2023.\n\u201dNVIDIA\u2019s novel Grace CPU allows us to converge AI technologies and classic supercomputing for solving some of the hardest problems in computational science,\u201d said CSCS Director Prof. Thomas Schulthess. \u201cWe are excited to make the new NVIDIA CPU available for our users in Switzerland and globally for processing and analyzing massive and complex scientific datasets.\u201d\n\u201cWith an innovative balance of memory bandwidth and capacity, this next-generation system will shape our institution\u2019s computing strategy,\u201d said Thom Mason, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. \u201cThanks to NVIDIA\u2019s new Grace CPU, we\u2019ll be able to deliver advanced scientific research using high-fidelity 3D simulations and analytics with datasets that are larger than previously possible.\u201d\nDelivering Breakthrough Performance \r\nUnderlying Grace\u2019s performance is fourth-generation NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae interconnect technology, which provides a record 900 GB/s connection between Grace and NVIDIA GPUs to enable 30x higher aggregate bandwidth compared to today\u2019s leading servers.\nGrace will also utilize an innovative LPDDR5x memory subsystem that will deliver twice the bandwidth and 10x better energy efficiency compared with DDR4 memory. In addition, the new architecture provides unified cache coherence with a single memory address space, combining system and HBM GPU memory to simplify programmability.\nGrace will be supported by the NVIDIA HPC software development kit and the full suite of CUDA\u00ae and CUDA-X\u2122 libraries, which accelerate more than 2,000 GPU applications, speeding discoveries for scientists and researchers working on the world\u2019s most important challenges.\nAvailability is expected in the beginning of 2023.\nLearn more at GTC21, taking place online April 12-16 \u2014 registration is free.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

But Huang, one of the most powerful chief executives in all of technology, can't imagine not running the company he grew from making computer-graphics software to building broad artificial intelligence and super-computing platforms.\n\"Nothing is more fun to me than to build a once-in-a-generation company with all of my friends here,\" Huang told Insider in written comments. \"I can't imagine wanting to do anything other than that.\"\n\n\nIf comparisons to Gates and Bezos put Huang in rarefied company, consider this case for his inclusion in that group, from Rene Haas, a former Nvidia executive who is now an executive vice president of the British company Arm. \"He's one of these extremely rare individuals who has taken a zero-revenue company to $20 billion of revenue, and has been the CEO to lead through all those transactions. The other people who have done that are on a pretty short list.\"\nIn Insider's quantitative assessment of CEOs across a range of financial measurements, employee ratings, and ESG metrics, Huang and Nvidia came out at or near the top on most of the measures. Nvidia's stock price more than doubled in 2020. Huang was rated highly by Nvidia employees on the employee review sites Comparably and Glassdoor. And Nvidia was ranked second on Just Capital's 2021 ranking of US companies' commitment to a range of social and environmental issues.\nHuang founded his $370 billion Silicon Valley company of around 18,000 employees in 1993 with fellow engineers Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky. In a Silicon Valley Denny's, the three decided to launch a graphics-based computing company on Huang's 30th birthday, The Wall Street Journal reported. They had $40,000 in the bank and no name, Forbes wrote in 2017. NV, short for \"next version,\" was added to the end of file names for the anonymous company, and that quirky habit led to a search for words that contained \"NV.\" That led them to \"Invidia,\" Latin for \"envy.\" They lopped off the first letter, and the company had a name.\n\n\nIt also had a major opening. Making graphics-processing units and chips for computer games led to a prominent role in the development of the graphics-driven computer world we now take for granted.\nHaas \u2014 who worked for Huang for seven years and intends to work for him again after Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm, the English semiconductor and software-design company \u2014 said Huang has remained an engineer that entire time, with a keen focus on detail.\nHaas compared Huang to a chess grand master playing a dozen opponents at once and beating every one in the way he inspects executives' work by poring over vast spreadsheets of product details.\n\n\n\"He was able to go through every cell on that spreadsheet and pick apart every specific detail relative to the assumptions we were making,\" Haas said. \"We would prepare and prepare, and he would pop in and look at it for 20 to 30 minutes and find every hole in the strategy. He was very intense.\"\nHuang, who likes fast cars and black leather jackets, doesn't seem inclined to slow his company down. New tech horizons still beckon to him. \"Artificial intelligence, where software writes software, is revolutionizing every aspect of the computer industry \u2014 from how the computer is built, to how we develop software, to the products that are now possible, to the problems we can finally solve,\" he said.\nHarvard Business Review ranked Huang No. 1 on its list of the world's 100 best-performing CEOs over the lifetime of their tenure in 2019, the last year of the rankings. HBR underscored one aspect of Huang's makeup as a leader \u2014 even more than Nvidia's stock climb of almost 20 times in the past five years. That trait is his ability to look past current success to the next big thing. Transform, transform, transform.\n\n\nAutonomous cars, supercomputers, and medical research in particular stimulate his imagination. \"Our cars will drive automatically and be safer. Scientists will find lifesaving drugs with the help of AI studying vast amounts of chemical and biological data at the speed of light. A new way of computing is needed, and at a scale and performance unimaginable with conventional methods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Huang at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.\n                                \n                        \n                        \n                        Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\nThe 28-year-old firm remains ambitious. Nvidia plans to build the UK's most powerful supercomputer to help fight COVID-19. Huang believed Nvidia and Arm were \"perfect together,\" and could pursue new opportunities in AI, 5G telecom technologies, and \"edge\" computing that let users connect quickly to cloud substations.\nNot everyone is a fan of the acquisition \u2014 especially Nvidia's competitors. In February, Bloomberg reported that federal trade regulators were launching an investigation into the acquisition after complaints by rivals Alphabet (Google's parent company), Microsoft, and Qualcomm, among others.\n\n\nDespite the lofty rankings and goals \u2014 and his multibillion-dollar net worth \u2014 there remains a boyish side of the CEO. He seems genuinely excited about his company's latest developments. Huang said Nvidia's GTC conference in April will reveal \"amazing breakthroughs\" and where the company's heading. His answers to Insider's questions contained multiple uses of the words \"love,\" \"thrill,\" and \"amazing.\" He remains an avid gamer. He loves to show off his Nvidia tattoo \u2014 and laugh about how much it hurt to get.\nHe said he is \"thrilled to see\" that his approval rating by Nvidia's 18,000 employees is 99% on Glassdoor. \"It reflects their pride in the company's achievements and contribution to the world,\" he said.\nBut the ability to take the stage at global conferences, or go on live television to discuss AI and market changes, did not come naturally to him, he said. \"The social part of growing is as important as the academic part of growing, especially in my case,\" he told students at Oregon State in 2013. \"I was so introverted.\"\n\n\nHuang began attending Oregon State as a shy 16-year-old. In an engineering class, he found himself working with one of only three women in a class of 80. That lab partner became his life partner. He and his wife, Lori, have two grown children.\nFamily has been an important part of his story, he said, which he continues to reflect on. His parents moved the family to America from Taiwan to give their children \"the best education and opportunities.\" He said, \"It remains unimaginable to me to this day that my parents left everything behind to journey to a foreign world.\"\nHuang added, \"Their courage and sacrifice made everything possible for me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorApr 14, 2021, 10:40am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA AutomotiveNVIDIA\nYesterday, I tuned into NVIDIA's annual GTC event, GTC 2021, held \u2014 for what will hopefully be the last time \u2014 virtually. Like at many recent NVIDIA events, the company's automotive efforts were on display front and center . Let's take a look at the new hardware and software announcements from NVIDIA's automotive division.\n\n\nNVIDIA DRIVE Atlan\n\nThe showstopper, in my opinion, was the unveiling of NVIDIA's super-powerful new system-on-a-chip (SoC), DRIVE Atlan. Positioned as the latest addition to the company's autonomous vehicles roadmap, Atlan should be capable of processing over a whopping 1,000T operations per second (TOPS) and is aiming to debut in carmakers' 2025 models. Atlan comes on the heels of DRIVE Orin, capable of 254 TOPS and coming to vehicles, including Volvo\u2019s XC90, in 2022 and Mercedes-Benz in 2024. The original DRIVE SoC, Xavier, is capable of 30 TOPS and already running inside production vehicles. And like Xavier and Orin, Atlan will be a part of NVIDIA\u2019s end to end stack spanning L2+ to L5 driving - from data collection, to training, to simulation.\n\nAtlan promises to bring the latest AI, software, computing, networking and security to the DRIVE platform, leveraging new Arm CPU cores, NVIDIA's future-generation cutting-edge GPU architecture and new accelerators for deep learning and computer vision. NVIDIA refers to it as \"the most advanced AI and AV computing platform,\" with performance rivaling a data center chip. This makes sense as cars are becoming software-defined data centers on wheels. Just look at the TOPS from the previous two generations (30 and 254), and you get an idea of how much a game changer Atlan might be.\n\n\nIn addition to this crazy jump in performance, one of the big selling points for Atlan, as I see it, is its upgradability and resulting longevity. The march towards fully autonomous vehicles is an incremental one, with decades behind us and more ahead. NVIDIA claims that Atlan's architecture is \"perpetually upgradable\" via secure, over-the-air updates. If it weren\u2019t NVIDIA, I\u2019d probably eye roll this statement. But look at how many years it\u2019s continually been updating its Shield gaming system.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nIf this bears out, it means the auto industry will not have to go through the costly process of reinventing the wheel (pardon the pun) with every new generation. The same platform from the previous generation will evolve alongside the vehicles, keeping Atlan relevant for potentially decades to come. To cap it off, like its predecessors, Atlan will be programmable via open CUDA and TensorRT APIs and libraries, improving developers' ability to carry their investments over multiple generations.\n\nAtlan will not only likely have datacenter-worthy performance, but it also promises to incorporate datacenter-grade security. The SoC leverages NVIDIA's BlueField data processing units (or DPUs), one in every SoC, giving Atlan complete datacenter infrastructure-on-a-chip and a secure enclave to head off cybercrime and breaches.\n\n\nNVIDIA says it designed Atlan to meet the demands of the increasing number of AI applications functioning simultaneously inside of autonomous vehicles\u2014an order that's only going to grow as the industry matures.\nAll of these features add up to what NVIDIA calls the first \"data center on wheels.\" While it will be some time before we see Atlan in production vehicles, I believe this SoC has the potential to juice the AV industry significantly in the coming decades.\nHyperion\nThe other significant piece of automotive hardware news from GTC 2021 was the new generation of NVIDIA's DRIVE Hyperion platform. Hyperion is an open platform\u2014a full sensor setup with centralized computing power\u2014designed to accelerate the testing and validation of autonomous driving hardware and software. If NVIDIA's claims bear out, Hyperion stands to cut down on both the time and cost of AV development\u2014a crucial roadblock in the industry's advancement.\nAs for the guts, the 8th Gen Hyperion platform features two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoCs mentioned earlier\u2014sufficient compute power, according to NVIDIA, for level 4 self-driving and intelligent cockpit capabilities. These two Orins process data from Hyperion's twelve exterior cameras, three inside cameras, eight radars and two lidar sensor. The platform, with all of its sensors, comes production-ready and fully operational.\nNVIDIA says Hyperion can also be used to evaluate its DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software stacks. Additionally, it can record and capture driving data in real-time for processing and is synchronized and calibrated for 3D data collection. If NVIDIA pulls this off smoothly, test drives are about to get a lot more fruitful for AV automakers.\nOmniverse AV simulator\nLast but certainly not least was the unveiling of NVIDIA DRIVE Sim on Omniverse, what the company calls \"the next generation of autonomous vehicle simulation.\" This cloud-based vehicle simulator works by generating datasets that can teach a vehicle's perception system while providing a safe, virtual sandbox to test the vehicle's decision-making\u2014 there are no actual pedestrians or other cars to worry about harming. Both software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop configurations can connect to the platform via AV stack to replicate the complete driving experience.\nNVIDIA built its previous driving simulators upon game engines. While game engines certainly are essential, powerful tools, at the end of the day, their purpose is to build games. A genuinely effective simulator must meet many additional qualifications. It must be scientific and able to repeat simulations with precise timing. It must behave as a modular and extensible platform that can scale across GPUs and server nodes with ease. It has to replicate data sensor feeds with total physical accuracy. While this is no short order, if anyone can do it, it's NVIDIA.\nThe company decided to build DRIVE Sim on Omniverse, a full-blown simulation engine built specifically to support multi-GPU computing. Omniverse leverages a ray-tracing renderer built on NVIDIA RTX, enabling DRIVE Sim to simulate the physical properties of visible and non-visible waveforms\u2014in other words, realistic lighting\u2014in real-time. NVIDIA says the ability to generate physically accurate sensor datasets is crucial for training AI-based perception networks. These efforts are aided by the inclusion of dataset creation tools such as a Python scripting interface and domain randomization tools. Synthetic data is significantly cheaper and less time-consuming than gathering and annotating real-world data, hastening iterative development and, ultimately, deployment, although both are used in the training process.\nIn the realm of repeatability, NVIDIA says Omniverse handles the scheduling and management of every sensor and environment rendering function for total accuracy. This, according to NVIDIA, makes it adept at handling detailed environments and test automobiles with more complex sensor suites. Further, Omniverse can purportedly achieve accurate and repeatable results, running simulations both slower and faster than in real-time.\nThe platform also includes a scalable, extensible SDK for building interactive 3D applications and microservices that it has christened, simply as \"Kit.\" Kit aims to give developers the precise controls necessary to create repeatable simulations tailored to their specific use cases.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Sim will be available for early access this summer.\nWrapping up\nNVIDIA announced it has an $8B automotive backlog. This is substantial and indicates automotive isn\u2019t a science project. All of these new offerings tell us that NVIDIA isn't satisfied simply participating in the push for self-driving vehicles\u2014it wants to be the company that is driving the conversation and accelerating the development of the entire industry. It's providing the muscle, e.g., Atlan, to power next-generation vehicles, as well as hardware and software tools that speed up the testing, validation and deployment process. While, of course, it is impossible to know how things will play out, my sense is the wait for widespread, fully autonomous vehicles shrinks every time NVIDIA launches a new automotive product. NVIDIA looks to be in the driver's seat and it's doing everything it can to move the industry into the fast lane.\n\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy writers and editors may have contributed to this article.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMoor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including 8x8, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Applied Micro, ARM, Aruba Networks, AT&T, AWS, A-10 Strategies,\u00a0Bitfusion, Blaize, Box, Broadcom, Calix, Cisco Systems, Clear Software, Cloudera,\u00a0Clumio, Cognitive Systems, CompuCom, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics,\u00a0Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Frame (now VMware), Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google (Nest-Revolve), Google Cloud, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Ion VR,\u00a0Inseego, Infosys, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation,\u00a0MapBox, Marvell,\u00a0Mavenir, Marseille Inc, Mayfair Equity, Meraki (Cisco),\u00a0Mesophere, Microsoft, Mojo Networks, National Instruments, NetApp, Nightwatch, NOKIA (Alcatel-Lucent), Nortek,\u00a0Novumind, NVIDIA, Nuvia, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Oracle, Poly, Panasas,\u00a0Peraso, Pexip, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Poly,\u00a0Portworx, Pure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus,\u00a0Rayvolt\u00a0E-Bikes, Red Hat,\u00a0Residio, Samsung Electronics, SAP, SAS, Scale Computing, Schneider Electric, Silver Peak, SONY,\u00a0Springpath, Spirent, Splunk, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, Synopsys, Tanium, TE Connectivity,\u00a0TensTorrent,\u00a0Tobii\u00a0Technology, T-Mobile, Twitter, Unity Technologies, UiPath, Verizon Communications,\u00a0Vidyo, VMware, Wave Computing,\u00a0Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra,\u00a0Zededa, and Zoho which may be cited in blogs and research.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang just laid out a singular vision filled with autonomous machines, super-intelligent AIs and sprawling virtual worlds \u2013 from silicon to supercomputers to AI software \u2014 in a single presentation.\n\u201cNVIDIA is a computing platform company, helping to advance the work for the Da Vincis of our time \u2013 in language understanding, drug discovery, or quantum computing,\u201d Huang said in a talk delivered from behind his kitchen counter to NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference. \u201cNVIDIA is the instrument for your life\u2019s work.\u201d\nDuring a presentation punctuated with product announcements, partnerships, and demos that danced up and down the modern technology stack, Huang spoke about how NVIDIA is investing heavily in CPUs, DPUs, and GPUs and weaving them into new data center scale computing solutions for researchers and enterprises.\nHe talked about NVIDIA as a software company, offering a host of software built on NVIDIA AI as well as NVIDIA Omniverse for simulation, collaboration, and training autonomous machines.\nFinally, Huang spoke about how NVIDIA is moving automotive computing forward with a new SoC, NVIDIA Atlan, and new simulation capabilities.\n\nCPUs, DPUs and GPUs\nHuang announced NVIDIA\u2019s first data center CPU, Grace, named after Grace Hopper, a U.S. Navy rear admiral and computer programming pioneer.\nGrace is a highly specialized processor targeting largest data intensive HPC and AI applications as the training of next-generation natural-language processing models that have more than one trillion parameters.\nWhen tightly coupled with NVIDIA GPUs, a Grace-based system will deliver 10x faster performance than today\u2019s state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX-based systems, which run on x86 CPUs.\nWhile the vast majority of data centers are expected to be served by existing CPUs, Gracewill serve a niche segment of computing.\u201cGrace highlights the beauty of Arm,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang also announced that the Swiss National Supercomputing Center will build a supercomputer, dubbed Alps, will be powered by Grace and NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU. U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory will also bring a Grace-powered supercomputer online in 2023, NVIDIA announced.\nAccelerating Data Centers with BlueField-3\nFurther accelerating the infrastructure upon which hyperscale data centers, workstations, and supercomputers are built, Huang announced the NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU.\nThe next-generation data processing unit will deliver the most powerful software-defined networking, storage and cybersecurity acceleration capabilities.\nWhere BlueField-2 offloaded the equivalent of 30 CPU cores, it would take 300 CPU cores to secure, offload, and accelerate network traffic at 400 Gbps as BlueField-3\u2014 a 10x leap in performance, Huang explained.\n\u2018Three Chips\u2019\nGrace and BlueField are key parts of a data center roadmap consisting of 3 chips: CPU, GPU, and DPU, Huang said. Each chip architecture has a two-year rhythm with likely a kicker in between. One year will focus on x86 platforms, the next on Arm platforms.\n\u201cEvery year will see new exciting products from us,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThree chips, yearly leaps, one architecture.\u201d\nExpanding Arm into the Cloud\u00a0\nArm, Huang said, is the most popular CPU in the world. \u201cFor good reason \u2013 it\u2019s super energy-efficient and its open licensing model inspires a world of innovators,\u201d he said.\nFor other markets like cloud, enterprise and edge data centers, supercomputing, and PC, Arm is just starting. Huang announced key Arm partnerships \u2014 Amazon Web Services in cloud computing, Ampere Computing in scientific and cloud computing, Marvel in hyper-converged edge servers, and MediaTek to create a Chrome OS and Linux PC SDK and reference system.\nDGX \u2013 A Computer for AI\n\nWeaving together NVIDIA silicon and software, Huang announced upgrades to NVIDIA\u2019s DGX Station \u201cAI data center in-a-box\u201d for workgroups, and the NVIDIA DGX SuperPod, NVIDIA\u2019s AI-data-center-as-a-product for intensive AI research and development.\nThe new DGX Station 320G harnesses 320Gbytes of super-fast HBM2e connected to 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs over 8 terabytes per second of memory bandwidth. Yet it plugs into a normal wall outlet and consumes just 1500 watts of power, Huang said.\nThe DGX SuperPOD gets the new 80GB NVIDIA A100, bringing the SuperPOD to 90 terabytes of HBM2e memory. It\u2019s been upgraded with NVIDIA BlueField-2, and NVIDIA is now offering it with the NVIDIA Base Command DGX management and orchestration tool.\nNVIDIA EGX for Enterprise\u00a0\nFurther democratizing AI, Huang introduced a new class of NVIDIA-certified systems, high-volume enterprise servers from top manufacturers. They\u2019re now certified to run the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, exclusively certified for VMware vSphere 7, the world\u2019s most widely used compute virtualization platform.\nExpanding the NVIDIA-certified servers ecosystem is a new wave of systems featuring the NVIDIA A30 GPU for mainstream AI and data analytics and the NVIDIA A10 GPU for AI-enabled graphics, virtual workstations and mixed compute and graphics workloads, announced today.\nAI-on-5G\nHuang also discussed NVIDIA\u2019s AI-on-5G computing platform \u2013 bringing together 5G and AI into a new type of computing platform designed for the edge that pairs the NVIDIA Aerial software development kit with the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100, combining GPUs and CPUs into \u201cthe most advanced PCIE card ever created.\u201d\nPartners Fujitsu, Google Cloud, Mavenir, Radisys and Wind River are all developing solutions for NVIDIA\u2019s AI-on-5G platform.\nNVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse\nVirtual, real-time, 3d worlds inhabited by people, AIs, and robots are no longer science-fiction.\nNVIDIA Omniverse is cloud-native, scalable to multiple GPUs, physically accurate, takes advantage of RTX real-time path tracing and DLSS, simulates materials with NVIDIA MDL, simulates physics with NVIDIA PhysX, and fully integrates NVIDIA AI, Huang explained.\n\u201cOmniverse was made to create shared virtual 3D worlds,\u201d Huang said. \u201cOnes not unlike the science fiction metaverse described by Neal Stephenson in his early 1990s novel \u2018Snow Crash\u2019\u201d\nHuang announced that starting this summer, Omniverse will be available for enterprise licensing. Since its release in open beta partners such as Foster and Partners in architecture, ILM in entertainment, Activision in gaming, and advertising powerhouse WPP have put Omniverse to work.\nThe Factory of the Future\nTo show what\u2019s possible with Omniverse Huang, along with Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, showed how a photorealistic, real-time digital model \u2014 a \u201cdigital twin\u201d of one of BMW\u2019s highly-automated factories \u2014 can accelerate modern manufacturing.\n\u201cThese new innovations will reduce the planning times, improve flexibility and precision and at the end produce 30 percent more efficient planning,\u201d Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\n\nA Host of AI Software\nHuang announced NVIDIA Megatron \u2014 a framework for training Transformers, which have led to breakthroughs in natural-language processing. Transformers generate document summaries, complete phrases in email, grade quizzes, generate live sports commentary, even code.\nHe detailed new models for Clara Discovery \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s acceleration libraries for computational drug discovery, and a partnership with Schrodinger \u2014 the leading physics-based and machine learning computational platform for drug discovery and material science.\nTo accelerate research into quantum computing \u2014 which relies on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be 0, 1, or both \u2014 Huang introduced cuQuantum to accelerate quantum circuit simulators so researchers can design better quantum computers.\nTo secure modern data centers, Huang announced NVIDIA Morpheus \u2013 a data center security platform for real-time all-packet inspection built on NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA BlueField, Net-Q network telemetry software, and EGX.\nTo accelerate conversational AI, Huang announced the availability of NVIDIA Jarvis (since renamed Riva) \u2013 a state-of-the-art deep learning AI for speech recognition, language understanding, translations, and expressive speech.\nTo accelerate recommender systems \u2014 the engine for search, ads, online shopping, music, books, movies, user-generated content, and news \u2014 Huang announced NVIDIA Merlin is now available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s catalog of deep learning framework containers.\nAnd to help customers turn their expertise into AI, Huang introduced NVIDIA TAO to fine-tune and adapt NVIDIA pre-trained models with data from customers and partners while protecting data privacy.\n\u201cThere is infinite diversity of application domains, environments, and specializations,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNo one has all the data \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s rare, sometimes it\u2019s a trade secret.\nThe final piece is the inference server, NVIDIA Triton, to glean insights from the continuous streams of data coming into customer\u2019s EGX servers or cloud instances, Huang said.\n\u2018Any AI model that runs on cuDNN, so basically every AI model,\u201d Huang said. \u201cFrom any framework \u2013 TensorFlow, Pytorch, ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorRT, or custom C++/python backends.\u201d\nAdvancing Automotive with NVIDIA DRIVE\nAutonomous vehicles are \u201cone of the most intense machine learning and robotics challenges \u2013 one of the hardest but also with the greatest impact,\u201d Huang said.\nNVIDIA is building modular, end-to-end solutions for the $10 trillion transportation industry so partners can leverage the parts they need.\nHuang said NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, NVIDIA\u2019s AV computing system-on-a-chip, which goes into production in 2022, was designed to be the car\u2019s central computer.\nVolvo Cars has been using the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA DRIVE since 2016 and developing AI-assisted driving features for new models on NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier with software developed in-house and by Zenseact, Volvo Cars\u2019 autonomous driving software development company.\nAnd Volvo Cars announced during the GTC keynote today that it will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin to power the autonomous driving computer in its next-generation cars.\nThe decision deepens the companies\u2019 collaboration to even more software-defined model lineups, beginning with the next-generation XC90, set to debut next year.\n\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan, NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation automotive system-on-a-chip, and a true data center on wheels, \u201cwill be yet another giant leap,\u201d Huang announced.\nAtlan will deliver more than 1,000 trillion operations per second, or TOPS, and targets 2025 models.\n\u201cAtlan will be a technical marvel \u2013 fusing all of NVIDIA\u2019s technologies in AI, auto, robotics, safety, and BlueField secure data centers,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang also announced the NVIDIA 8th generation Hyperion car platform \u2013 including reference sensors, AV and central computers, 3D ground-truth data recorders, networking, and all of the essential software.\nHuang also announced that DRIVE Sim will be available for the community this summer.\nJust as Omniverse can build a digital twin of the factories that produce cars, DRIVE Sim can be used to create a digital twin of autonomous vehicles to be used throughout AV development.\n\u201cThe DRIVE digital twin in Omniverse is a virtual space that every engineer and every car in the fleet is connected to,\u201d Huang said.\nThe \u2018Instrument for Your Life\u2019s Work\u2019\nHuang wrapped up with four points.\nNVIDIA is now a 3-chip company \u2013 offering GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs.\nNVIDIA is a software platform company and is dedicating enormous investment in NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nNVIDIA is an AI company with Megatron, Jarvis, Merlin, Maxine, Isaac, Metropolis, Clara, and DRIVE, and pre-trained models you can customize with TAO.\nNVIDIA is expanding AI with DGX for researchers, HGX for cloud, EGX for enterprise and 5G edge, and AGX for robotics.\n\u201cMostly,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNVIDIA is the instrument for your life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center

Gettys frequently partners with visualization company Theia Interactive to turn the design process into interactive Unreal Engine VR experiences.\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic hit, Gettys and Theia used Nvidia CloudXR to deliver customer projects to a local Oculus Quest HMD, streaming from the AWS EC2 P3 instance with Nvidia Virtual Workstations.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer \u2014 by streaming collaborative experiences from AWS, we can digitally bring project stakeholders together on short notice for quick VR design alignment meetings,\u201d said Ron Swidler, chief innovation officer at The Gettys Group.\n\u201cThis is going to save a ton of time and money, but more importantly it\u2019s going to increase client engagement, understanding and satisfaction.\u201d\nCloudXR on more devices\nNvidia is adding support for iOS in the soon to be released CloudXR 2.1, so users can access Apple AR devices, including iPads and iPhones. The CloudXR iOS integration will soon be available in Nvidia Omniverse, a collaboration and simulation platform designed to streamline 3D production pipelines.\n\u201cThis iOS client is built on top of AR kit provides all the positioning, orientation information, the tracking data that we need to render frames on the remote system. And then, based on that virtual camera information, pass it back to AR kit and stream,\u201d explained an Nvidia spokesperson,\n\u201cSo imagine being anywhere, in the comfort of your living room, looking at a photorealistic physically accurate model of a car, a building, whatever the case may be, all streaming to a device that doesn\u2019t even need a GPU, on a network that\u2019s going to become more and more ubiquitous like like 5G.\u201d\nAlso on the hardware front, Magic Leap has developed a CloudXR client application for its Magic Leap 1 headset.\n\u00a0\n\nRedefining the XR experience\nWith 5G networks rolling out, streaming XR over 5G from the cloud has the potential to significantly enhance workflows across many industries. But the big challenge with delivering XR from the cloud is latency \u2014 for people to have a great VR experience, they have to maintain 20ms motion-to-photon latency.\nTo deliver the best cloud streaming experience, Nvidia has fine-tuned Nvidia CloudXR, working with the large cloud providers as well as Qualcomm Technologies and Ericsson.\nNvidia has also introduced Variable Rate Supersampling (VRSS) 2, a new version of the technology that allows rendering resources to be focused in a foveated region where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact on image quality.\nThe first VRSS version supported fixed foveated rendering in the centre of the screen. The new version integrates \u2018dynamic gaze tracking\u2019, moving the foveated region where the user is looking.\nThe Nvidia CloudXR streaming solution includes Nvidia RTX hardware, Nvidia Quadro Virtual Workstation (QvDWS) drivers, and the CloudXR software development kit (SDK).\nRelated articles:NEWS: Panasonic delivers pro graphics to semi-rugged laptopSketchUp and Meta bring SketchUp models into VRNEWS: Cidon Construction halves estimating costsNEWS: Umbra streams visually rich BIM models to any deviceHexagon joins forces with Nemetschek GroupAutodesk CivilsAllplan launches Allplan CloudDanish municipality adopts Autodesk Spacemaker\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

(Credit: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CEO has responded to NVIDIA's recent CPU launch which is targeted at AI data centers and servers. CEO Pat Gelsinger states that when it comes to CPUs specialized for AI processing, Intel has a great portfolio and they are the leaders in this domain.\nIntel CEO Hits Back at NVIDIA's Grace ARM CPU Announcement, Recognizes Themselves As A Dramatic Leader of CPUs With Enhanced AI Capabilities\nEarlier this week, NVIDIA announced its first CPU for data centers and AI cloud computing known as Grace. Based on the ARM architecture and making use of the Neoverse cores, NVIDIA is positioning the Grace CPU against x86 chips which primarily feature two rivals, Intel & AMD. The Grace CPU is expected to debut in 2023 with two supercomputers from CSCS & Los Alamos National Laboratory.\nRelated Story AMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units ShippedNow Intel holds an insanely huge CPU server market share, accounting for over 90% whereas the rest of the share belongs to AMD. AMD has been very competitive against Intel with their recent launches and they are further expected to gain market share with their EPYC Milan lineup that was also recently introduced.\n\nWith the announcement of NVIDIA's Grace CPUs, a 3rd Major (non-x86) player is entering the field and has already contracted a deal for two major supercomputers. Intel is not the kind that goes off easy with such news and Intel's CEO has issued the following response:\nNvidia today\u00a0announced\u00a0some new chips for the data center market, with a particular focus on speeding up artificial intelligence applications with standard chips known as central processing units, or CPUs. The stock market reacted quickly. What's your competitive position with them?\nWe\u00a0announced\u00a0our Ice Lake [a new microprocessor for servers] last week with an extraordinarily positive response. And in Ice Lake, we have extraordinary expansions in the A.I. capabilities. [Nvidia is] responding to us. It's not us responding to them. Clearly this idea of CPUs that are A.I.-enhanced is the domain where Intel is a dramatic leader.\nWe also have,\u00a0with our Habana product line [a specialized A.I. chipmaker Intel bought in 2019], unquestionably laid out a very aggressive path and our cloud partnership with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] is a great demonstration of that. So clearly, I'd say the idea of CPUs is Intel's provenance. We're now building A.I. into that and we expect this to be an area where we are on the offense, not the defense going forward.\nvia Yahoo Finance\nFollowing the announcement of Grace CPU, NVIDIA stocks increased while Intel shares dropped, simultaneously. Intel's CEO followed up by saying that even after the announcement of Grace, it is NVIDIA whose on the defense while they are on the offense. Pat also mentioned Intel's Ice Lake (3rd Gen Xeon Scalable Family) as being an extraordinary chip offering extraordinary AI capabilities & called his company a dramatic leader in the AI-enhanced CPU segment.\n\u201cThe takeaway is that Nvidia is serious about CPUs and will not be constrained by X86 owned by Intel and AMD,\u201d Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in a research note. \u201cThe level of platform innovation is mind-boggling and something that silicon competitors will be tasked to match for many, many years to come.\u201d\nvia Bloomberg\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU will be supported by the NVIDIA HPC software development kit\u00a0and the full suite of\u00a0CUDA and CUDA-X libraries, which accelerate more than 2,000 GPU applications, speeding discoveries for scientists and researchers working on the world\u2019s most important challenges. NVIDIA will definitely see the main competition from Intel moving forward while AMD is also planning on investing in AI capabilities in its next-generation Genoa lineup.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CEO Was Excited About Generative AI In 2022 Before ChatGPT Became Popular\n\nRamish Zafar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n98\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n90\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition Is Likely a Preview of GTA VI Features; RTGI Load on the CPU Suggests It Won\u2019t Push Beyond 30 FPS on Base Consoles\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n25\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1447\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Today, they announced a joint venture, as BMW is going to be using the Omniverse platform from now on in its research and development phase for new cars. The virtual factory planning tool integrates a range of planning data and applications and allows real-time collaboration with unrestricted compatibility.\u201cTogether we\u2019re about to make a huge leap forward and open up completely new perspectives in the field of virtual, digital planning. In the future a virtual representation of our production network will allow us to realize an innovative, integrated approach to our planning processes. Omniverse greatly enhances the precision, speed and consequently the efficiency of our planning processes,\u201d said Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107, BMW AG Board Member for Production.Virtual factory planning is already used in the industry, but until now it has required data to be imported from various applications. This is not only time-consuming but also raises compatibility issues. In addition, the data is not always up to date. In the future, the Omniverse platform will enable live data to be collected and collated from all the relevant databases to create a joint simulation \u2013 eliminating the need to reimport data.The goal is to enable modifications and adjustments to be assessed in the early stages of planning in order to create an overall view. This extreme transparency will allow planners and production specialists to plan highly complex production systems even more quickly and accurately, without interface losses or compatibility problems. Omniverse integrates data from various professional design and planning tools from a range of different producers and uses it to generate photo-realistic real-time simulations in a single collaborative setting.Another big advantage of the Omniverse platform is that workers and engineers from around the world can simply tap in whenever they need, to either check something or make changes to the process or product. Furthermore, Omniverse can be used in a lot of different scenarios too, from using real-time data which is synchronized across the cloud infrastructure, to logistics planning. The ability to carry out changes live will speed up decision-making noticeably.bmwnvidiaomniverseResearch  Facebook  Twitter  Email  Gabriel Nica Popular this week 1   BMW\u2019s New Batteries Will Deliver Up To 900 Km Of Range   0 2   Inside BMW\u2019s Gen6 Battery Revolution: A Deep Dive from Landshut   0 3   BMW Vision Driving Experience: The Most Powerful M Prototype Ever, Over 1300 HP   0 4   New BMW 3 Series M350 Imagined With Neue Klasse Styling   0 5   2027 BMW M3 (ZA0) Render: Imagining M\u2019s Electric Beast   0You may also like    Restoring Perfection: A One-of-a-Kind BMW E36 Touring in Techno Violet by Steven Paul Date: March 18, 2025    2025 Rolls-Royce Cullinan Gets Wild Makeover From Mansory by Adrian Padeanu Date: March 18, 2025    BMW iX Sales Dropped 25% In 2024 by Adrian Padeanu Date: March 18, 2025    The BMW M2 Was The Best-Selling Real M Car In 2024 by Adrian Padeanu Date: March 18, 2025    The BMW XM Sits at the Bottom of 2024\u2019s Sales Chart by Horatiu Boeriu Date: March 17, 2025    BMW M\u2019s Future: Manuals, Mystery Sportscars, and M5 Touring Surprises by Steven Paul Date: March 17, 2025More from News  The BMW M2 Was The Best-Selling Real M Car In 2024 By Adrian Padeanu Date: March 18, 2025  BMW Teams Up with Huawei: Neue Klasse in China to Run HarmonyOS By Horatiu Boeriu Date: March 17, 2025  Here\u2019s How Many Cars Each BMW Factory Built In 2024 By Adrian Padeanu Date: March 16, 2025 View more Videos See all    How-To Install the BMW LED Door Projectors 18 March 2025   2025 BMW M5 in 60 seconds! 17 March 2025   Unleashing the BMW M2 & M5 at Yas Marina F1 Circuit! | Ultimate BMW M Experience 15 March 2025   BMW M3 CS Touring Review: Ultimate Performance Wagon Walkaround & Sound! 13 March 2025   Drifting the new BMW M5 on the F1 Yas Marina Circuit 12 March 2025   2025 BMW i5 Range Test \u2013\u00a0 It BLOWS Past The EPA Rating! 11 March 2025   This BMW M5 in Sepia Looks Amazing! 10 March 2025   Waze in BMW\u2019s Instrument Cluster!

With DRIVE Sim, developers can improve productivity and test coverage, accelerating their time to market while minimizing the need for real-world driving.\nThe variety and depth of companies that form the DRIVE Sim ecosystem are core components to what makes the platform the foremost solution for autonomous vehicle simulation.\nDRIVE Sim enables high-fidelity simulation by tapping into NVIDIA\u2019s core technologies, including NVIDIA RTX, Omniverse and AI, to deliver a powerful, cloud-based simulation platform. It can generate datasets to train the vehicle\u2019s perception system or provide a virtual proving ground to test the vehicle\u2019s decision-making and control logic.\nThe platform can be connected to the AV stack in software-in-the-loop or hardware-in-the-loop configurations to test the full driving experience.\nDRIVE Sim comes with a rich library of configurable models for environments, scenarios, vehicles, sensors and traffic that work right out-of-the-box.\nIt also includes dedicated application programming interfaces that enable developers to build DRIVE Sim connectors, plugins, and extensions to tailor the simulation experience to specific requirements and workflows. These APIs make it possible to leverage past investment and development by allowing integration into pre-established AV simulation tool-chains.\nA broad partner ecosystem provides connectors, plugins and extensions to tailor the DRIVE Sim simulation experience to specific requirements and workflows.\nWith a broad ecosystem of simulation partners, DRIVE Sim always features the cutting edge in virtual simulation models, rich environments as well as verification and validation tools.\nEver-Changing Environments\nDriving behavior varies with the environment the vehicle is driving in. From the dense traffic of urban driving to the sparse, winding roads of highways, self-driving cars must be able to handle different domains, as well as follow the unique laws of different countries.\nDRIVE Sim ecosystem partners provide realistic virtual models of the three-dimensional road environment, including tools to create such environments, reference maps to create accurate road network and environment assets such as traffic signs and lights, other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, buildings, trees, lamp posts, fire hydrants and road debris.\nDRIVE Sim features realistic virtual models of complex road environments, either via out-of-the-box sample environments or via imported environments and assets from ecosystem partners.\nNVIDIA is partnering with various 3D model providers to make these assets available for easy download and import via Omniverse into simulated environments and scenarios for DRIVE Sim.\nModeling Vehicle Behavior\nIn addition to recreating the real-world environment in the virtual world, simulation must accurately reproduce the way the vehicle itself responds to road inputs and controls, such as acceleration, steering and braking.\nVehicle dynamics models respond to vehicle control signals sent by DRIVE Sim with the correct position and orientation of the vehicle given the inputs.\nThese models simulate the vehicle dynamics to help validate planning and control algorithms with the highest possible fidelity. They can recreate the orientation and motion of sensors as the vehicle turns or brakes suddenly, as well as the sensor reaction to road vibration or other harsh conditions.\nVehicle models also help assess the robustness of the autonomous driving system itself. As the vehicle experiences tire and brake wear, varying cargo loads and wheel alignment, it\u2019s critical to see how the system responds to ensure safety.\nHigh-fidelity vehicle dynamics models are necessary to evaluate planning & control algorithms, even for low-speed parking maneuvers.\nNVIDIA is collaborating with all major vehicle dynamics model providers to ensure that their models can be integrated into DRIVE Sim.\nSensing Simulation\nJust as with autonomous vehicles in the physical world, virtual vehicles also need sensors to perceive their surroundings. DRIVE Sim comes with a library of standard models for camera, radar, lidar and ultrasonic sensors.\nThrough APIs, it\u2019s also possible for users and ecosystem partners to integrate dedicated models for sensor simulation into DRIVE Sim.\nThese models typically simulate sensor components such as transmitters, receivers, imagers and lenses, as well as include signal-processing software and transcoders.\nPhysically accurate light simulation using RTX real-time raytracing, in combination with detailed sensor models, is used to validate perception edge cases, for example at sunrise or sunset when sunlight is directly shining into the camera.\nMultiple camera, radar and lidar suppliers already provide models of their sensors for DRIVE Sim. By incorporating sensor models with this level of granularity, DRIVE Sim can accurately recreate the output of what a physical sensor in the real world would create as the vehicle drives.\nFinding the Unknowns\nVehicles driving in the real world aren\u2019t the only ones on the road, and the same is true in simulation.\nWith detailed traffic models, developers can play out specific scenarios with the same variables and unpredictability of the real world. Some DRIVE Sim partners develop naturalistic traffic \u2014 or situations where the end result is unknown \u2014 to test and validate the autonomous vehicle systems.\nGetting realistic (and sometimes unpredictable) events into DRIVE Sim can be achieved via scenario catalogues, traffic simulation models and scenario-based V&V methodologies from ecosystem partners.\nOther partners contribute specific scenario-catalogs and scenario-based verification and validation methodologies that evaluate whether an autonomous vehicle system meets specific key performance indicators.\nThese criteria can be regulatory requirements or industry standards. NVIDIA is participating in multiple projects, consortia and standards organizations across the globe aimed at creating standards for autonomous vehicle simulation.\nAlways in the Loop\nFinally, the DRIVE Sim ecosystem makes it possible to use simulation to test and validate the full autonomous vehicle hardware system.\nThe NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation hardware-in-the-loop platform, which contains the AI compute system that runs in the vehicle, allows for bit-accurate at-scale validation of the AV stack on the target hardware.\nSystem integration partners provide the infrastructure to connect DRIVE Constellation to the rest of the vehicle\u2019s electronic architecture. This full integration with components like the braking, engine and cockpit control units enables developers to evaluate how the full vehicle reacts in specific self-driving scenarios.\nWith experienced partners contributing diverse and constantly updated models, self-driving systems can be continually developed, tested and validated using the highest quality content.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Spotted by Videocardz (via Lok LOK), the MSI Ventus 3X variant of the cards is being shipped out to US retailers which means we can expect an official announcement real soon.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB Custom Graphics Cards Being Shipped To Retailers In US, MSI's Ventus 3X OC Variant Spotted\nThe shipment consists of several graphics cards that are being shipped to US-based retailers. The boxes mention the GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080, Radeon RX 580, and GeForce GT 710 but also contain the MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Ventus 3X OC which is listed with 12 GB memory. There are no more specifications provided but the cards are made in MSI's China facility and now headed out to retail markets.\nRelated Story NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nShipments contained the MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB Ventus 3X OC custom graphics card have been spotted by Lok LOK Ivia Videocardz).\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB FE (Founders Edition) graphics card is expected to feature the PG132-SKU18 PCB design and the GA102-225-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-225 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and will now feature 10240 CUDA cores within a total of 80 SM units. Since the main core configuration is entirely brand new, the previously leaked clocks & TMU/ROP counts should now be dismissed.\n\nAs for memory, the card will feature 12 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting 12 GB memory, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be using a 384-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 912 GB/s. So while we see an 8 GB VRAM reduction over the previous spec, the larger bus interface should drive higher memory bandwidth.\nThe TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts. That's definitely needed to feed the extra cores so NVIDIA might have to optimize the clocks a bit here.

The clip shows thousands of dynamic lights as they move, turn on and off, change color, show reflections and cast shadows.\nPeople can also experience the latest technologies in graphics with the new RTX Technology Showcase, a playable demo that allows developers to explore an attic scene and interact with elements while seeing the visual impact of real-time ray tracing.\n\nHero Lighting Gets a Boost with RTXDI\nRunning on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, the RTXDI demo shows how dynamic, animated lights can be rendered in real time.\nCreating realistic night scenes in computer graphics requires lights to be simulated all at once. RTXDI does this by allowing developers and artists to create cinematic visuals with realistic lighting, incredible reflections and accurate shadows through real-time ray tracing.\n\nTraditionally, creating realistic lighting required complex baking solutions and was limited to a small number of \u201chero\u201d lights. RTXDI removes such barriers by combining ray tracing and a deep learning algorithm called spatio-temporal importance resampling (ReSTIR) to create realistic dynamic lighting.\nDevelopers and artists can now easily integrate animated and color-changing lights into their scenes, without baking or relying on just a handful of hero lights.\nBased on NVIDIA research, RTXDI enables direct lighting from millions of moving light sources, without requiring any complex data structures to be built. From fireworks in the sky to billboards in New York Times Square, all of that complex lighting can now be captured in real time with RTXDI.\nAnd RTXDI works even better when combined with additional NVIDIA technology, such as:\n\nRTX Global Illumination to provide a full lighting solution\nNVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers to achieve world-class denoising\nNVIDIA DLSS to significantly boost performance while still achieving high-quality images\n\nLearn more and check out RTXDI, which is now available.\n\nHit the Light Spots in RTX Technology Showcase\nThe RTX Technology Showcase features discrete ray-tracing capabilities, so users can choose to turn on specific technologies and immediately view their effects within the attic scene.\nWatch the RTX Technology Showcase in action:\n\nDevelopers can download the demo to discover the latest and greatest in ray-tracing innovations with RTX Technology Showcase.\nCheck out other GTC demos that highlight the latest technologies in graphics, and a full track for game developers here.

The required version is scheduled for release later this year; at which time we\u2019ll begin upgrading our servers. We\u2019ll provide additional information and timing as we know more. The base version of Metro Exodus will still be playable, including RTX for Founders and Priority members, as we work to upgrade the service.\nGFN Thursday reaches a fever pitch this week as we take a deeper look at two major updates coming to GeForce NOW from Deep Silver in the weeks ahead.\nCatching Even More Rays\nMetro Exodus was one of the first RTX games added to GeForce NOW. It\u2019s still one of the most-played RTX games on the service. Back in February, developer 4A Games shared news of an Enhanced Edition coming to PC that takes advantage of a new Fully Ray-Traced Lighting Pipeline.\nToday, we can share that it\u2019s coming to GeForce NOW, day-and-date, on May 6.\nThe PC Enhanced Edition features significant updates to Metro Exodus\u2019 real-time ray tracing implementations. Players will see improvements to the groundbreaking Ray-Traced Global Illumination (RTGI) featured in the base game, as well as new updates for the Ray-Traced Emissive Lighting techniques pioneered in \u201cThe Two Colonels\u201d expansion.\nThe PC Enhanced Edition also includes additional ray-tracing features, like Advanced Ray-Traced Reflections, and support for NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 on NVIDIA hardware \u2014 including GeForce NOW.\nThe list of RTX features coming to the PC Enhanced Edition is massive:\n\nFully ray-traced lighting throughout \u2014 every light sources is now ray traced\nNext-gen ray tracing and denoising\nNext-gen temporal reconstruction technology\nPer-pixel ray-traced global illumination\nRay-traced emissive surfaces with area shadows\nInfinite number of ray-traced light boundaries\nAtmosphere and transparent surfaces receiving ray-traced bounced lighting\nFull ray-traced lighting model support with color bleeding and for every light source\nAdvanced ray-traced reflections\nDX12 ultimate support, including DXR 1.1 and variable rate shading\nGPU FP16 support and thousands of optimized shaders\nSupport for DLSS 2.0\nAddition of FOV (field of view) slider to main game options\n\nIn short, the game is going to look even more amazing. And, starting next week, members who own Metro Exodus will have access to the update on GeForce NOW. But remember, to access the enhanced visuals you\u2019ll need to be a Founder or Priority member.\nDon\u2019t own Metro Exodus yet? Head to Steam or the Epic Games Store and get ahead of the game.\nMetro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition includes updated real-time ray tracing that GeForce NOW Founders and Priority members can experience across nearly all of their devices.\nA Strategic Move\nIron Harvest, the classic real-time strategy game with an epic single-player campaign, multiplayer and coop, set in the alternate reality of 1920+, is getting a new DLC on May 27. Dubbed \u201cOperation Eagle,\u201d the update brings a new faction to the game\u2019s alternate version of World War I: USA.\nYou\u2019ll guide this new faction through seven new single-player missions, while learning how to use the game\u2019s new Aircraft units across all of the game\u2019s playable factions, including Polania, Saxony and Rusviet.\n\u201cOperation Eagle\u201d also adds new multiplayer maps that RTS fans will love, and the new USA campaign can be played cooperatively with friends.\nIron Harvest\u2019s \u201cOperation Eagle\u201d DLC will be available on GeForce NOW day-and-date. You can learn more about the update here.\nDon\u2019t Take Our Word for It\nThe team at Deep Silver was gracious enough to answer a few questions we had about these great updates.\nQ: We\u2019re suckers for beautifully ray-traced PC games, on a scale from 1-to-OMG, how great does Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition look?\nA: We\u2019re quietly confident that the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition will register at the OMG end of the scale, but you don\u2019t need to take our word for it \u2013 Digital Foundry declared that, \u201cMetro Exodus\u2019 PC Enhanced Edition\u2019s Global Illumination produces without a doubt, the best lighting I\u2019ve ever witnessed in a video game.\u201d\nQ: What does it mean for the team to leverage GeForce NOW to bring these new real-time ray-tracing updates in Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition to gamers across their devices?\nA: We believe hardware-accelerated ray-tracing GPUs are the future, but right now the number of players with ray-tracing-capable GPUs is a small, albeit growing, percentage of the total PC audience. GeForce NOW will give those players yet to upgrade their gaming hardware a glimpse into the future.\nQ: How does \u201cOperation Eagle\u201d build on the story in Iron Harvest? We\u2019re excited to try this new faction.\nA: The American Union of Usonia stayed out of the Great War and became an economic and military powerhouse, unnoticed by Europe\u2019s old elites. Relying heavily on mighty \u201cDiesel Birds,\u201d the Usonia faction brings more variety to the Iron Harvest battlefields. Additional new buildings and new units for all factions will enhance the Iron Harvest roster to give players even more options to find the perfect attack and defence strategy.\nQ: How do you see GeForce NOW expanding the audience of gamers who can play Metro Exodus and Iron Harvest?\nA: We\u2019re committed to bringing the Metro Exodus experience to as many platforms as we can without compromising on the quality of the experience; GeForce NOW puts our state-of-the-art ray-traced version of Metro Exodus into the hands of gamers regardless of their own hardware setup.\nQ: Is there anything else you\u2019d want to share with your fans who are streaming Metro Exodus and Iron Harvest from the cloud?\nA: Watch out for the jump scares. You have been warned.\nThere\u2019s probably a jump scare coming here, right? GeForce NOW members can find out on May 6.\nGFN Thursday\nIn addition to rolling with a pair of Deep Silver announcements this week, members get their regular dose of GFN Thursday goodness. Read more about that and other updates this week here.\nGetting excited for more ray-traced goodness in Metro Exodus? Can\u2019t wait to get your hands on \u201cOperation Eagle\u201d?

Resizable BAR became part of the GPU performance conversation with the release of AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series. AMD was touting a new feature called Smart Access Memory or SAM, but in reality AMD had just rebranded a PCI Express feature, known as \"Resizable BAR\" that had gone unused for quite some time.\nThe way AMD promoted and implemented Resizable BAR on Radeon 6000 GPUs, it required to be paired with a Ryzen 5000 series CPU and newer 500 series motherboard. AMD made it sound as if this was a new optimization they had developed and would be exclusive to their products, but that's not the case. The claim was your AMD CPU/GPU combo could produce a performance uplift of 10% or greater in a number of games with SAM enabled, creating some buzz, but it was short lived after all.\n\nOf course, it's free performance and not something we often come by when testing new features. Enabling SAM boosts performance of the Radeon RX 6800 in Assassin's Creed Valhalla by 19%, 18% in Hitman 2, 14% in Borderlands 3 and 13% in Godfall, those are some seriously impressive gains and you're sacrificing nothing to achieve them.\nHowever, a deeper dive into SAM revealed a number of instances where performance was reduced, or in most other cases, it made no difference at all. In the end, when testing across a large sample of games we found that on average SAM brought a small 3% boost at 1440p.\nThe net gain is still welcome and it's possible resizable BAR could play a more consistent role in the future if developers design games with that capability in mind. Thus, Nvidia has jump aboard the resizable BAR train and now GeForce RTX 30 GPUs support it.\n\nThere are 3 things you'll need to enable resizable BAR on your RTX 30 series GPU:\n1) A supporting VBIOS is required. Anyone who purchased an RTX 3060 already has the required VBIOS, but RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, 3080 and 3090 owners will need to update.\nFor this article, we updated the VBIOS of the ROG Strix RTX 3080 OC and the process was simple. We navigated to Asus' support website, went to Driver & Tools > BIOS & Firmware and downloaded the latest BIOS. We ran the tool and it took just a few moments to complete. After a reboot, the VBIOS update was done.\n2) You'll require a compatible motherboard that supports resizable BAR, including its BIOS version. In our case, the MSI X570 Unify running with a Ryzen 9 5950X was already updated as we used it to test the Radeon RX 6800 before.\n3) The latest GeForce Game Ready driver. Support for resizable BAR was added with the March 30 release, but at this point just use the most up to date driver and you'll be set.\nOnce those steps are complete, you can verify if resizable BAR is working by opening the Nvidia control panel and entering the system information section. Under the details section you'll find \"resizable BAR\" and if it's working properly, the status will simply read 'yes'.\n\nNow, something we found interesting about Nvidia's implementation is a claim they made in their announcement...\n\n\"In practice, the performance benefits of Resizable BAR can vary substantially from game to game. In our testing, we've found some titles benefit from a few percent, up to 12%. However, there are also titles that see a decrease in performance, so Nvidia will be pre-testing titles and using game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only when it has a positive performance impact. That way you won't have to worry about bugs or performance decreases, and won't have to rely on the community to benchmark each title and discover whether Resizable BAR is beneficial in the games you're playing.\"\n\nThat sounds pretty great. Basically Nvidia's saying you can enjoy all the benefits of resizable BAR without any of the shortcomings. We saw performance regression of up to 7% in certain titles with the Radeon RX 6800. If true, this will be a win for Nvidia and their resizable BAR implementation will be much better than AMD's.\n\nAs of writing, the whitelist of supported games from Nvidia is fairly limited, consisting of just 17 games. Now of those 17 games we've tested 12, along with 8 others that aren't currently officially supported, so that could be quite interesting. So it's time we jump into the benchmark results. We're testing using the Ryzen 9 5950X on the MSI X570 Unify motherboard with 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 dual-rank, dual-channel memory.\n\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, we find that at 1080p performance is boosted by 8%, and 9% at 1440p, some nice gains there. Not nearly as big as the gains we've seen from the Radeon GPUs in this title, but still an extra ~8-9% is nothing to sneeze at. Unfortunately though, where we need a performance boost the most at 4K, we're looking at basically the same performance. Still overall a good result in this title.\n\n\nFrame rates in Forza Horizon 4 are already excessively high with the RTX 3080, but assuming these margins roughly translate down the product stack then that's a good result.\nAt 1080p we're looking at an 11% performance boost, 9% at 1440p, and 6% at 4K, which was nice to see.\n\nWe're looking at a mild performance uplift in Horizon Zero Dawn with resizable BAR enabled, just 3% at 1080p, 5% at 1440p and 4% at 4K. Not exactly something to get excited about, but again it's a small performance boost for free, so who's going to complain about that?\n\nThe gains in Borderlands 3 are also small: a 5% boost at 1080p, 4% at 1440p, and just 3% at 4K.\n\nWe see a reasonably strong 7% boost in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p, but then nothing at 1440p and 4K.\n\nThere were a number of titles like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order where performance went virtually unchanged. If we're to believe Nvidia's claims, we could be looking at a situation where resizable BAR has been disabled to avoid a performance regression as this isn't a whitelisted game, but more on that soon.\n\nWolfenstein Youngblood also isn't a whitelisted game, and here we're seeing no change in performance with virtually identical frame rates with and without resizable BAR.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider is another game that didn't make the Nvidia whitelist and again we're seeing no change in performance with resizable BAR enabled, though we're not sure that Nvidia's had a chance to test every single game just yet.\n\nFar Cry New Dawn also isn't a whitelisted game, but here we are seeing a performance regression with resizable BAR enabled at 1080p and 1440p, so what's going on here?\nShouldn't resizable BAR be disabled in this instance? The performance regression isn't big, but the 4% drop in frame rate at 1080p and 1440p was highly repeatable, so clearly the feature isn't being disabled here. But let's move on to an even more troublesome set of results...\n\nWatch Dogs Legion is a whitelisted game that's meant to benefit from resizable BAR and therefore see a performance improvement with it enabled. However the opposite is true with a rather substantial 10% performance reduction seen at 1080p and a 3% reduction at 1440p, or a massive 16% reduction when looking at the 1% low result.\nWe could reproduce these results consistently and each time we saw a steep decline in 1% low performance with resizable BAR enabled in Watch Dogs Legion.\nWe're not alone in these findings either, other tech media have also found the same poor performance with resizable BAR enabled on Nvidia GPUs and we've seen similar reports from users on forums and reddit.\nThis is quite odd given Nvidia claims a 9% performance uplift in Watch Dogs Legion using an RTX 3080 at 1440p with the Ryzen 9 5950X on an X570 motherboard with 32GB of RAM. It's possible there have been changes made since then that negatively impact performance, it's hard to say as their results were published about 2 weeks ago.\n\nThe odd results didn't stop there. Death Stranding also saw a reduction in performance at 1080p and 1440p with resizable BAR enabled despite being a whitelisted title. We did see up to a 9% increase at 4K which was great to see, but the implementation here is hardly flawless with up to a 9% reduction seen at 1080p and 8% at 1440p.\nPerformance Summary\nHere's a look at the average performance seen across the 20 games tested. We'll also jump to a per game breakdown in a moment but I wanted to show this graph first as this is typical of how we evaluate the performance and value of GPUs.\n\nWe're looking at no improvement for the RTX 3080 at 1080p, a 1% gain at 1440p if we round up, and 2% gain at 4K. This compares less favorably than the 3% gain for the Radeon GPUs on average. So when taking gaming performance as a whole into consideration, resizable BAR support does virtually nothing to change the picture.\n\nLooking at the margins seen in each of the 20 games tested at 1080p, and as you can see there are performance regressions. Nvidia claims that they use game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only when it has a positive performance impact, but based on our findings that's not true. The Division 2, for example, isn't a whitelisted game and therefore the game profile should automatically disable resizable BAR, resulting in no performance change, but we found the same issue with multiple titles.\n\nEven at 1440p we're still seeing a number of instances where performance regresses beyond the margin of error and these findings were highly repeatable.\nWithout the performance drop, the technology would only boost performance by 2%, but again without the disadvantages there'd be no reason not to enable it by default.\n\nResizable BAR is a little more effective at 4K. The 1-2% drops seen in Far Cry New Dawn and Dirt 5 are insignificant, while a few others stand to benefit, if only slightly.\n\nYou might find this last graph interesting. In the games that we can make a direct comparison with our Radeon RX 6800 testing, which is 18 of the 20 games just tested, this is how the GeForce RTX 3080 and RX 6800 compare.\nWhere Nvidia saw a ~1% improvement on average, AMD saw a 7% improvement with resizable BAR enabled in titles such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Hitman 2, Borderlands 3, Godfall and a few others. Based on these results, we AMD appears to have better implemented their resizable BAR support.\nWhat We Learned\nIt's great to see Nvidia adding support for resizable BAR on their latest generation GeForce 30 series GPUs, it's just a bit of a shame that it didn't work as well as we'd hoped. Likewise, this would be an amazing feature for AMD to implement across more/all products if they can, and it'd mean we'd be one step closer to testing with resizable BAR enabled by default.\n\nIt's worth noting that in order to enable/disable resizable BAR with a Radeon or GeForce graphics card, you need to reboot the system, enter the BIOS, and toggle it on or off there. So that's not exactly a practical solution and we'd argue doing so means the performance gains are no longer free, they come at the expense of your time and energy.\nIt was also interesting to see that at best the RTX 3080 saw up to a 9% performance improvement at 1440p, in AC Valhalla and Forza Horizon 4, whereas the RX 6800 saw up to a 19% performance gain in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, though we didn't test Forza Horizon 4 as it hadn't yet left the horrible Windows Store for Steam.\n\nAs it stands today, resizable BAR appears to be more beneficial to the Radeon users who happen to have the full Ryzen 5000 combo, though be aware it's not always going to result in positive performance. For GeForce owners, it's only worth going to the trouble of enabling resizable bar for 2 or 3 games, so it'll be up to you whether or not you bother, but at least the option now exists and it could improve over time.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5900X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 54\n\n\n Got something to say?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorApr 12, 2021, 01:00pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.It is all about tighter integration with memory, CPUs, and accelerators for trillion-parameter AI models.\n\nFor 12 years, NVIDIA has used its Spring GPU Technology Conference (GTC) to amaze its customers and investors with new GPUs for graphics and application acceleration.\u00a0But this year, Founder and CEO Jensen Huang surprised an audience of over 100,000 virtual attendees by announcing not a new GPU but a 2023 Arm-based CPU. NVIDIA believes a custom-designed CPU-GPU platform is the only way it can enable the next generation of hyper-scale Artificial Intelligence and begin to approach the level of computer-based \"general intelligence.\" To this end, NVIDIA announced that the company is developing a platform for AI that connects a forthcoming NVIDIA Arm CPU called Grace, connected to a next-gen GPU over a faster NVLink.\n\n\nWhile the company provided few details about Grace itself, let's look into this significant move's underlying motivation. There were many other exciting announcements from NVIDIA, such as the Bluefield 3 DPU and a new platform for Enterprise AI, but for now, let's focus on the big news: Arm.\n\nWhat did NVIDIA announce, and why?\nJensen says the goal is to create a tightly integrated computational foundation to pursue the next wave of AI innovation: a trillion-parameter computer intelligence. Today's largest AI model is the Open.ai GPT-3, totaling 170 billion parameters for language processing, requiring over one thousand NVIDIA GPUs hosted by Microsoft Azure. The human brain has about 100 trillion synapses, roughly equivalent to the deep neural network parameters. If successful, the NVIDIA system would be only 100 times slower than the human brain. While this still does not approach general intelligence, it could be an entire order of magnitude larger than currently planned Exascale systems planned by US DOE labs, as measured by 16-bit inference performance.\n\n\nIan Buck, GM and VP of accelerated computing at NVIDIA, made it clear that this is not about competing with other CPUs to solve today's problems. \"Grace will not out-perform an x86 CPU and NVIDIA GPU running today's MLperf benchmarks,\" said Buck. \"Rather, the system design will allow us to solve AI problems that are orders of magnitude larger than today's.\" NVIDIA had to rethink the entire system architecture to run a trillion-parameter model efficiently with fast response time.\nThis all about an integrated systems design for NVIDIA. The magic will come in part from a faster version of the NVLink, delivering 500 GB/S of cache-coherent interconnect from Grace to the GPU, \u00a0between GPUs, and between Grace CPUs. Since no CPU vendors are building such an interconnect to enable this level of outrageous performance, NVIDIA had no choice but to design it themselves. Also, NVIDIA indicated that Grace would support LPDDR5x, used today in mobile platforms such as Qualcomm. In total, memory access will be about 2 TB/S, or 30X faster than today's server memory to the GPU. The GPU will continue to depend on High Bandwidth Memory for local data storage.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nGrace will ship on an HGX board and in a future server, with four Grace CPUs and GPUs directly interconnect over NVLink. A future NVIDIA DPU will provide the interconnect to combine these servers into hyper-scaled AI machine.\nNVIDIA envisions a complete redesign of AI systems, with a dedicated Arm CPU attached to each GPU ... [+] over a fast interconnect providing higher memory bandwidth.NVIDIA\n\n\nNVIDIA envisions a complete redesign of AI systems, with a dedicated Arm CPU attached to each GPU over a faster interconnect and higher memory bandwidth. Comparing to existing X86 accelerated servers, one can see the dramatic improvements that NVIDIA envisions.NVLINK connectivity, missing from all X86 CPUs, is a primary driver of NVIDIA's decision to build ... [+] it's own Arm CPU.NVIDIA\nA 20 Exaflop Supercomputer?\nAt least one customer likes the idea, and I expect many more will follow. The Swiss National Computing Center (CSCS) and ETH Zurich will deploy a massive Grace-based system, delivered by HPE Cray, that will provide 20 Exaflops of (16-bit) AI performance for the largest AI networks. If performance scales linearly across 16- to 64-bit precisions, and it typically does for peak performance, that would be 10/2/2=2.5 times faster than the fastest DOE system currently envisioned, El Capitan, which is to use AMD CPUs and GPUs in 2023. It is now evident that the US DOE decision to exclude NVIDIA in the first Exascale systems did not foretell the end of NVIDIA leadership in HPC. Far from it, this announcement leapfrogs those competitors by over 2x in roughly the same timeframe.The Swiss National Supercomputing Center will deploy the Grace-enabled 20 Exaflop AI in 2023. This ... [+] behemoth will be ten times faster than the yet-to-be-installed US DOE El Capitan.NVIDIA\nWhile NVIDIA went to great lengths to ensure that this announcement in no way portends a shift to compete directly with Intel or AMD CPUs, the Grace CPU will certainly displace those CPUs in systems built to handle massive AI models.\nJensen also shared the new company roadmap, that will deliver yearly advances in CPUs, GPUs, and DPUs.NVIDIA plans to update its three primary chips yearly: CPUs, DPUs, and GPUs.NVIDIA\nConclusions\nNVIDIA constantly reminds me that its mission is to help customers solve only their most challenging problems. This announcement demonstrates that NVIDIA does not measure itself against the competition, but against the speed of light: perfection. Yes, this zeal now requires the company to design its Arm CPU to enable their vision. The upcoming Grace CPU is not about NVIDIA getting into the CPU business.\u00a0It is all about re-imagining the data center for trillion-parameter AI models Jensen and his partners envision.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the author's opinions and is not to be taken as advice to purchase from or invest in the companies mentioned.

The collaboration was part of NVIDIA\u2019s early adopters\u2019 programme for Omniverse over the past two years. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise makes it possible for designer and visualisation teams \u2014 which are often large, diverse in skills and geographically dispersed \u2014 to work seamlessly together on complex projects. Rather than requiring in-person meetings or exchanging and iterating on massive files, designers, artists and reviewers can work simultaneously in a virtual world from anywhere, on any device.\nGamma Basra, Partner and Head of Visualisation, Foster + Partners, said: \u201cDue to our long-standing relationship, NVIDIA invited us to test NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, an interface that allows us to expand our real-time collaboration workflow to include the visualisation pipeline. In partnership with NVIDIA, we are helping shape the future of collaboration for the AEC industry.\u201d\nMartha Tsigkari, Partner with the Applied Research and Development group at Foster + Partners, added: \u201cThis revolutionary platform allows our artists to collaborate on the same scene while working independently on their software of choice. Multiple design changes can be visualised simultaneously in real-time, allowing design options to be reviewed in parallel for faster design cycles. The vast reduction in time previously required for processing models means more time for creative design and visualisation. Integration of futuristic technologies such as machine learning will bring more opportunities to assist the creative process in the future.\u201d\nThis collaboration is a key part of the practice\u2019s efforts to push the boundaries of innovation and revolutionise the design process through the use of pioneering technologies. Omniverse Enterprise complements bespoke software developed by Foster + Partners that allows for design interoperability between teams, data exchange on demand, facilitate version control and track changes, all in real-time.\nThe practice will also be delivering an Omniverse online workshop at this year\u2019s NVIDIA GTC entitled \u2018Collaboration matters: An end-to-end workflow for the AEC industry\u2019. A team of designers, developers and artists from Foster + Partners will showcase how NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise can help transform a typical design to visualisation pipeline into a real-time collaborative workflow.\u00a0 The workshop will be available online through GTC21. Registration for the event is free.

worlds\n\n\n\nDean Takahashi@deantak \n\nApril 12, 2021 8:55 AM\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNvidia has announced its Omniverse, a virtual environment the company describes as a \u201cmetaverse\u201d for engineers, will be available as an enterprise service later this year.\nCEO Jensen Huang showed a demo of the Omniverse, where engineers can work on designs in a virtual environment, as part of the keynote talk at Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference, a virtual event being held online this week. I also moderated a panel on the plumbing for the metaverse with a number of enterprise participants.\nHuang said that the Omniverse is built on Nvidia\u2019s entire body of work, letting people simulated shared virtual 3D worlds that obey the worlds of physics.\n\u201cThe science fiction metaverse is near,\u201d he said in a keynote speech. \u201cOne of the most important parts of Omniverse is that it obeys the laws of physics.\u201d\nThe Omniverse is a virtual tool that allows engineers to collaborate. It was inspired by the science fiction concept of the metaverse, the universe of virtual worlds that are all interconnected, like in novels such as\u00a0Snow Crash\u00a0and\u00a0Ready Player One. The project started years ago as a proprietary Nvidia project called Holodeck, named after the virtual reality simulation in Star Trek. But it morphed into a more ambitious industry-wide effort based on the plumbing made possible by the Universal Scene Description (USD) technology Pixar developed for making its movies. Nvidia has spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars on the project, said Richard Kerris, Nvidia media and entertainment general manager, in a press briefing.\nAbove: Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, at GTC 21.Image Credit: Nvidia\nOmniverse debuted in beta form in December. More than 17,000 users have tested it since then, and now the company is making the Omniverse available as a subscription service for enterprises. It\u2019s just the kind of thing that engineers need during the pandemic to work on complex projects remotely.\nBMW Group, Ericsson, Foster + Partners, and\u00a0 WPP are using Omniverse. It has application support from Bentley Systems, Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, ESRI, Graphisoft, Trimble, Robert McNeel & Associates, Blender, Marvelous Designer, Reallusion, and Wrnch.\nAnd support comes from the likes of Asus, Boxx Technologies, Cisco, Dell Technologies, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro. More than 400 enterprises are going to use the new version for enterprises starting this summer. It comes with enterprise support for fully established enterprises, Kerris said.\nWhat the Omniverse can do\nAbove: Omniverse will be used across industries for design.Image Credit: Nvidia\nThe Omniverse, which was previously available only in early access mode, enables photorealistic 3D simulation and collaboration. It\u2019s a metaverse that obeys the laws of physics, and so it enables companies and individuals to simulate things from the real world that can\u2019t be tested easily in the real world, like self-driving cars, which can be dangerous to pedestrians if they aren\u2019t perfected.\nMattias Wikenmalm, technical specialist at Volvo, said on the panel that it\u2019s necessary to simulate not just the car but the context around the car, like a city environment.\n\u201cThe foundation is still the data, and this is the first time we can be data native, where we don\u2019t have to focus on moving data between different systems. In this case, data is a first-class citizen,\u201d Wikenmalm said. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice we can just focus on the data and borrow our data for different applications and transform that data. Exchanging data between systems has been complex. If we can get that out of the way, we can start building a proper metaverse.\u201d\nBMW is using Omniverse to simulate a full car factory before it builds it. And there\u2019s no limit to the testing. If someone wanted to create an entire city, or even build a simulation of the entire United States, for a self-driving car testing ground, it would be possible.\nIt is intended for tens of millions of designers, engineers, architects, and other creators to use at the same time. The designers can work on the same parts of their designs at the same times without overwriting each other, with changes offered as options for others to accept. That makes it ideal for large teams to work together.\nAbove: Nvidia OmniverseImage Credit: Nvidia\nSusanna Holt, vice president of engineering for Autodesk, said on the panel that being able to understand someone else\u2019s data is important, and it means you don\u2019t have to be locked into a single tool or workflow.\n\u201cWe need the bits to talk to one another, and that\u2019s been so hard until now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still hard, as you have to import and export data. With USD, it\u2019s the beginning of a new future.\u201d\nThe Omniverse uses Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3D simulation tech to enable engineers to do things like work on a car\u2019s design inside a simulation while virtually walking around it or sitting inside it and interacting with it in real time.\nMartha Tsigkari, partner at architectural firm Foster + Partners, said on the panel that the architecture and construction industries really need the ability to transfer data easily from one site to the next.\n\u201cBeing able to do that in an easy way without having to think about how we change that information is really important,\u201d Tsigkari said. \u201cIn order to run really difficult simulations, or understand how buildings perform, we need to use all kinds of software to do this. Working in these processes right now can be painful, and we need to create all of these bespoke tools to do this. A future where this becomes a seamless process and opens to all kinds of industries is a fantastic opportunity that we need to grasp and go for.\u201d\nEngineers on remote teams will be able to work alongside architects, 3D animators, and other people working on 3D buildings simultaneously, as if they were jointly editing a Google Doc, Kerris said. He added, \u201cThe Omniverse was built for our own needs in development.\u201d\nUSD\u2019s roots at Pixar\nAbove: Inside Out is Pixar\u2019s 2015 film.Image Credit: Dean Takahashi\nPixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) is the HTML of 3D, and it\u2019s the foundation for sharing different kinds of images from multiple parties in Omniverse, said Kerris.\n\u201cWe felt that with the entire community starting to move towards this open platform for exchanging 3D information including the objects, scenes, materials and everything, it was the best place for us to start with the foundation for what this platform would become,\u201d Kerris said.\nPixar\u2019s USD standard came from over a decade of film production.\nGuido Quaroni is director of engineering and 3D immersive at Adobe, and before that he was at Pixar, where he was responsible for open sourcing USD. In a panel at GTC, he said the idea emerged at Pixar in 2010 as the company was dealing with multiple libraries that dealt with large scenes in its movies.\n\u201cSome of the ideas in USD go back 20 years to Toy Story 2, but the idea was to formalize it and write it in a way that we could eventually open source it,\u201d Quaroni said.\nAbove: Nvidia\u2019s Marbles at Night demo showcases complex physics and lighting in the Omniverse.Image Credit: Nvidia\nHe worked with Sebastian \u201cSpiff\u201d Grassia, head of the team that built USD at Pixar.\n\u201cWe knew that every studio kind of had something like it,\u201d Quaroni said. \u201cAnd we wanted to see if we could offer something that became the standard, because for us, the biggest problem was the plugins and integrations with third parties. Why not give it to the world?\u201d\nThe problem that they had was that they needed to be able, at any point in the film pipeline, to extract an asset, to massage it with a third-party tool, and to stick it back into the production process without losing information, said Michael Kass, distinguished engineer at Nvidia and software architect of the Omniverse, in an interview.\nGrassia said USD is an interchange format for data.\n\u201cIt represents decades of Pixar\u2019s experience in building software that supports collaborative filmmaking,\u201d Grassia said. \u201cIt\u2019s for collaborative authoring and viewing for a very large 3D scene. It handles combining, assembling, overriding, and animating the assets that you have created in a non-destructive way. That allows for multiple artists to work on the same scene concurrently.\u201d\nBefore USD, artists had to check out a piece of digital art, work on it, and check it back in. With USD, Nvidia has enabled sharing across all applications and different ways of viewing the art. The changes are transmitted back and forth. A large number of people can view and work on the same thing, Kass said. A feature dubbed Nucleus serves as a traffic cop that communicates what is changing in a 3D scene.\nEarly on, Pixar tried to create tools itself, but it found there were tools like Maya, 3D Studio Max, Unreal Engine, or Blender that were more advanced at doing particular tasks. And rather than have to train those vendors to continuously update their tools, Pixar made USD available as an open standard.\nWhat Nvidia added\nAbove: Omniverse EnterpriseImage Credit: Nvidia\nThe platform also uses Nvidia technology, such as real-time photorealistic rendering, physics, materials, and interactive workflows between industry-leading 3D software products.\nPixar built a renderer, a data visualization engine dubbed Hydra. It was designed in a way to hook up other data sources, like a Maya image. So the artists can work with large datasets without having the vendor translate everything into their own native representation.\nKass and his colleagues at Nvidia found that USD was a \u201cgolden nugget\u201d that let them represent data in a way that could be used for all sorts of different purposes.\n\u201cWe decided to put USD at the center of our virtual worlds, but at Pixar, most of the collaboration was not real time. So we added on top of USD the ability to synchronize with different users,\u201d Kass said.\nAbove: COVID-19 simulation in Omniverse.Image Credit: Nvidia\nThe real test has been making sure that USD can be useful beyond the media and entertainment applications. Omniverse enables collaboration and simulation that could become essential for Nvidia customers working in robotics, automotive, architecture, engineering, construction, and manufacturing.\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything else like it,\u201d Kerris said. \u201cPixar built the standard, and we saw the potential in it. This is a demand and a need that everybody has. Can you imagine the internet without a standard way of describing a web page? It used to be that way. With 3D, no two applications use the same language today. That needs to change, or else we really can\u2019t build the metaverse.\u201d\nNvidia extended USD, which was built for Pixar\u2019s needs, and added what is necessary for the metaverse, Kass said.\n\u201cWe got to stand on top of giants, but we are pushing it forward in a direction they weren\u2019t envisioning when they started,\u201d he added.\nNvidia built a tool called Omniverse Create, which accelerates scene composition and allows users in real time to interactively assemble, light, simulate, and render scenes. It also built Omniverse View, which powers seamless collaborative design and visualization of architectural and engineering projects with photorealistic rendering. Nvidia RTX Virtual Workstation software gives collaborators the freedom to run their graphics-intensive 3D applications from anywhere.\nOmniverse Enterprise is a new platform that includes the Nvidia Omniverse Nucleus server, which manages the database shared among clients, and Nvidia Omniverse Connectors, which are plug-ins to industry-leading design applications.\nWith all of the applications working live, artists don\u2019t have to go through a laborious exporting or importing process.\n\u201cOmniverse is an important tool for industrial design \u2014 especially with human-robot interactions,\u201d said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at Tirias Research, in an email. \u201cSimulation is a big new market for GPU cloud services.\u201d\nBig problems\nThe Omniverse and USD aren\u2019t going to lead to the metaverse overnight.\nAbove: Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform.Image Credit: Nvidia\nTsigkari said that getting so many creative industries to work together has been a huge challenge, particularly for architecture firms that have to pull so many different disciplines to get work done from conception to completion.\n\u201cYou need a way to allow for the creative people to quickly pass things directly from engineers to consultants so they can do their analysis and pass it on to the manufacturers,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the simplest way, this doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nAt the same time, different industries work on different timetables, from long cycles to real time.\u00a0\u201cFor us, this has been really crucial to be able to do this in a seamless way where you don\u2019t have to think about the in-between space,\u201d she said.\nHolt at Autodesk said she would like to see USD progress forward in dealing with huge datasets, on the level of modeling cities for construction purposes.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not up to that yet,\u201d she said. \u201cSome changes would be needed as we take it into other areas like construction.\u201d\nGrassia said there are features that allow of \u201clazy loading,\u201d or different levels of detail becoming visible as a huge dataset loads.\nLori Hufford, vice president of applications integration at Bentley Systems, said on a panel her team has had good results so far working on large models. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about the open nature of USD,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very impressed with the scale we have been able to achieve with USD.\u201d\nThe Omniverse today\nAbove: WPP is using Omniverse to build ads remotely.Image Credit: Nvidia\nThe enterprise version will support Windows and Linux machines, and it is coming later this year.\nWhat can you do in this engineer\u2019s metaverse? You can simulate the creation of robots through a tool dubbed Isaac. That lets engineers create variations of robots and see how they would work with realistic physics, so they can simulate what a robot would do in the real world by first making the robot in a virtual world. There are also Omniverse Connectors, which are plugins that connect third-party tools to the platform. That allows the Omniverse to be customized for different vertical markets.\nBMW is using Omniverse to simulate the exact details of a car factory, simulating a complete physical space. The company calls the factory a \u201cdigital twin.\u201d The factory has enough detail to include 300 cars in it at a given time, and each car has about 10 gigabytes of data.\nThousands of planners, product engineers, facility managers, and lean experts within the global production network are able to collaborate in a single virtual environment to design, plan, engineer, simulate, and optimize extremely complex manufacturing systems before a factory is actually built or a new product is integrated.\nMilan Nedeljkovic, member of the board of management of BMW AG, said in a statement that the innovations will lead to a planning process that is 30% more efficient than before. Eventually, Omniverse will enable BMW to simulate all 31 of its factories.\nAbove: Bentley\u2019s tools used to create a digital twin of a location in the Omniverse.Image Credit: Nvidia\nVolvo is designing cars inside Omniverse before committing to physical designs, while Ericsson is simulating future 5G wireless networks. Industrial Light & Magic has been evaluating Omniverse for a broad range of possible workflows, but particularly for bringing together content created across multiple traditional applications and facilitating simultaneous collaboration across teams that are distributed all over the world.\nFoster + Partners, the United Kingdom architectural design and engineering firm, is implementing Omniverse to enable seamless collaborative design to visualization capabilities to teams spread across 14 countries.\nActivision Publishing is exploring Omniverse\u2019s AI-search capabilities for its games to allow artists, game developers and designers to search intuitively through massive databases of untagged 3D assets using text or images.\nWPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services organization, is using the Omniverse to reinvent the way advertising content is made by replacing traditional on-location production methods with entirely virtual production.\nPerry Nightingale, senior vice president at WPP, said on a panel that he is seeing collaboration on an enormous scale with multiple companies working together.\nAbove: Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse can be used for entertainment creation.Image Credit: Nvidia\n\u201cI\u2019m excited how far that could go, with governments doing it for city planning and other sorts of grand scale collaboration around USD,\u201d Nightingale said.\nNvidia will use Omniverse to enable Drive Sim 2.0, which lets carmakers test their self-driving cars inside Omniverse. It uses USD as Nvidia transitions from game engines to a true simulation engine for Omniverse, said Danny Shapiro, senior director for automobiles at Nvidia. Nvidia\u2019s own developers will now be able to support new hardware technologies earlier than they could in the past.\n\u201cWe initially built it for our own needs, so that when technologies were being developed in different groups that they could share immediately, rather than have to wait for the development of it into their particular area,\u201d Kerris said. \u201cThe same holds true with our developers. It used to be if we brought a technology out, we would then work with our developers, and it would take a period of time for them to support it. However, by building this platform that crosses over these, we have the ability now to bring out new technologies that they can take advantage of day one.\u201d\nThe metaverse of the future\nAbove: Omniverse enables collaboration on complex projects.Image Credit: Nvidia\nOne question is how well Omniverse will be able to deal with latency, or interaction delays across the cloud. That would be important for game developers, who have to create games that operate in real time. Scenes built with Omniverse can be rendered at 30, 60, or 120 frames per second as needed for a real-time application like a game.\nKerris said in an earlier chat that most of what you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have to be constantly refreshed on everybody\u2019s screen, making the real-time updating of the Omniverse more efficient. Nvidia\u2019s Nucleus tech is a kind of traffic cop that communicates what is changing in a scene as multiple parties work on it at once.\nAs for viewing the Omniverse, gamers could access it using a high-end PC with a single Nvidia RTX graphics card.\nHuang said in his speech, \u201cThe metaverse is coming. Future worlds will be photorealistic, obey the laws of physics or not, and inhabited by human avatars and AI beings.\u201d\u00a0He said that games like Fortnite or Minecraft or Roblox are like the early versions of the metaverse. But he said the metaverse is not only a place to play games. It\u2019s a place to simulate the future.\nAbove: Dean Takahashi moderates a panel of Omniverse experts at the Nvidia GTC 2021 event.Image Credit: Nvidia\n\u201cWe are building cities because we need to simulate these virtual worlds for our autonomous vehicles,\u201d Kerris said. \u201cWe need a world in which we can train them and test them. Our goal is to scale it so so you could drive continuously drive a virtual car continuously from Los Angeles to New York, in real time, using the actual hardware that\u2019s going to be inside the car and give it a virtual reality experience plugged into its sensory inputs, the output of our simulator, and fool it into thinking it\u2019s in the real world. And for that, it has to be an extremely large world. We\u2019re not quite there yet. But that is what we are moving towards.\u201d\nFor game companies, I can foresee game publishers eventually trading around their cities, as one might build a replica of Paris while another might build New York. After all, if everyone works with USD technology, there might not be a need to rebuild every city from scratch for simulations like games.\nIvar Dahlberg, technical artist at Embark Studios, a game studio in Stockholm, said it is tantalizing to think about trading cities back and forth between game developers who are working on city-level games.\n\u201cTraditionally, developers have focused on a world for someone else to experience,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it seems there are lots more opportunities for developers to create something together with the inhabitants of that world. You can share the tools with everybody who is playing. That ties in quite nicely to the idea of a metaverse. USD is definitely a step in that direction.\u201d\nTsigkari said, \u201cThat is an experience that may not be very far out. It won\u2019t matter if one company builds Paris, London, or New York. It will be more about what you are doing with those assets. What is the experience that you offer to the user with those assets?\u201d\nAs I saw recently in the film A Glitch in the Matrix, it will be easier to believe in the future that we\u2019re all living in a simulation. I expect that Nvidia will be able to fake a moon landing for us next.\n\n\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Nvidia expects this new processor to service a niche segment of computing.\u201cLeading-edge AI and data science are pushing today\u2019s computer architecture beyond its limits \u2013 processing unthinkable amounts of data,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.\u201cUsing licensed Arm IP, Nvidia has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data centre to advance AI. Nvidia is now a three-chip company.\u201dThe Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and the US Department of Energy\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory have already announced plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterSign up today and you will receive a free copy of our Focus Report 2025 - the leading guidance on AI, cybersecurity and other IT challenges as per 700+ senior executivesContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.This move could spell trouble for other chipmakers who already have a strong presence in the data centre market like Intel, which is currently dominating with a 90% share, and AMD. By promising a 10x increase in processing performance, it may cause some customers to take note of Grace. This was reflected in the markets where Intel and AMD are both down several percentage points following Nvidia's announcement.Nvidia also announced eight Nvidia Ampere architecture GPUs for next-generation laptops, desktops and servers.The new Nvidia RTX A5000 and Nvidia RTX A4000 GPUs will help speed AI, graphics and real-time rendering up to 2x faster than previous generations in desktops. In laptops, the new Nvidia RTX A2000, Nvidia RTX A3000, RTX A4000 and RTX A5000 GPUs deliver accelerated performance without compromising mobility.(Image credit: Nvidia)For data centres, the new Nvidia A10 GPU provides up to 2.5x the virtual workstation performance of the previous generation while the A16 GPU provides up to 2x user density with lower total cost of ownership and an enhanced virtual desktop infrastructure experience over the previous generation.In February, it emerged that Nvidia had turned to some of its older graphic cards to meet the demand for GPUs during a global shortage of PC components and chipsets. Nvidia was going to re-release its old chips, such as the GTX 1050 Ti chip, which was meant to have been phased out two years ago, as well as the GeForce RTX 2060.\n\n\nZach MarzoukSocial Links NavigationZach Marzouk is a former ITPro, CloudPro, and ChannelPro staff writer, covering topics like security, privacy, worker rights, and startups, primarily in the Asia Pacific and the US regions.

It packs key ingredients such as the NVIDIA BlueField-2 data processing unit (DPU) now in production.\nSo, What Is Cloud-Native Supercomputing?\nLike Reese\u2019s treats that wrap peanut butter in chocolate, cloud-native supercomputing combines the best of two worlds.\nCloud-native supercomputers blend the power of high performance computing with the security and ease of use of cloud computing services.\nPut another way, cloud-native supercomputing provides an HPC cloud with a system as powerful as a TOP500 supercomputer that multiple users can share securely, without sacrificing the performance of their applications.\nA BlueField DPU supports offload of security, communications and management tasks to create an efficient cloud-native supercomputer.\nWhat Can Cloud-Native Supercomputers Do?\nCloud-native supercomputers pack two key features.\nFirst, they let multiple users share a supercomputer while ensuring that each user\u2019s workload stays secure and private. It\u2019s a capability known as \u201cmulti-tenant isolation\u201d that\u2019s available in today\u2019s commercial cloud computing services. But it\u2019s typically not found in HPC systems used for technical and scientific workloads where raw performance is the top priority and security services once slowed operations.\nSecond, cloud-native supercomputers use DPUs to handle tasks such as storage, security for tenant isolation and systems management. This offloads the CPU to focus on processing tasks, maximizing overall system performance.\nThe result is a supercomputer that enables native cloud services without a loss in performance. Looking forward, DPUs can handle additional offload tasks, so systems maintain peak efficiency running HPC and AI workloads.\nHow Do Cloud-Native Supercomputers Work?\nUnder the hood, today\u2019s supercomputers couple two kinds of brains \u2014 CPUs and accelerators, typically GPUs.\nAccelerators pack thousands of processing cores to speed parallel operations at the heart of many AI and HPC workloads. CPUs are built for the parts of algorithms that require fast serial processing. But over time they\u2019ve become burdened with growing layers of communications tasks needed to manage increasingly large and complex systems.\nCloud-native supercomputers include a third brain to build faster, more efficient systems. They add DPUs that offload security, communications, storage and other jobs modern systems need to manage.\nA Commuter Lane for Supercomputers\nIn traditional supercomputers, a computing job sometimes has to wait while the CPU handles a communications task. It\u2019s a familiar problem that generates what\u2019s called system noise.\nIn cloud-native supercomputers, computing and communications flow in parallel. It\u2019s like opening a third lane on a highway to help all traffic flow more smoothly.\nEarly tests show cloud-native supercomputers can perform HPC jobs 1.4x faster than traditional ones, according to work at the MVAPICH lab at Ohio State, a specialist in HPC communications. The lab also showed cloud-native supercomputers achieve a 100 percent overlap of compute and communications functions, 99 percent higher than existing HPC systems.\nExperts Speak on Cloud-Native Supercomputing\nThat\u2019s why around the world, cloud-native supercomputing is coming online.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building the first academic cloud-native supercomputer in Europe to offer bare-metal performance with cloud-native InfiniBand services,\u201d said Paul Calleja, director of Research Computing Services at Cambridge University.\n\u201cThis system, which would rank among the top 100 in the November 2020 TOP500 list, will enable our researchers to optimize their applications using the latest advances in supercomputing architecture,\u201d he added.\nHPC specialists are paving the way for further advances in cloud-native supercomputers.\n\u201cThe UCF consortium of industry and academic leaders is creating the production-grade communication frameworks and open standards needed to enable the future for cloud-native supercomputing,\u201d said Steve Poole, speaking in his role as director of the Unified Communication Framework, whose members include representatives from Arm, IBM, NVIDIA, U.S. national labs and U.S. universities.\n\u201cOur tests show cloud-native supercomputers have the architectural efficiencies to lift supercomputers to the next level of HPC performance while enabling new security features,\u201d said Dhabaleswar K. (DK) Panda, a professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State and lead of its Network-Based Computing Laboratory.\nLearn More About Cloud-Native Supercomputers\nTo learn more, check out the NVIDIA Technical Blog, as well as our technical overview on cloud-native supercomputing.

The BMW Group and NVIDIA are generating a\n  completely new approach to planning highly complex manufacturing\n  systems \u2013 with the Omniverse platform. The virtual factory planning\n  tool integrates a range of planning data and applications and allows\n  real-time collaboration with unrestricted compatibility. As industry\n  leaders, the BMW Group and NVIDIA are setting new standards in virtual\n  factory planning.\nMilan Nedeljkovi\u0107, BMW AG Board Member for Production: \u201cTogether\n  we\u2019re about to make a huge leap forward and open up completely new\n  perspectives in the field of virtual, digital planning. In the future\n  a virtual representation of our production network will allow us to\n  realise an innovative, integrated approach to our planning processes.\n  Omniverse greatly enhances the precision, speed and consequently the\n  efficiency of our planning processes.\u201d\n\u201cBMW does personalized manufacturing at a massive scale - their\n  operations are among the most complex in the world,\u201d said Jensen\n  Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cIn their vision of future\n  factories, people and robots work together, engineers from all aspects\n  of factory design collaborate in a shared virtual space, and the\n  entire factory is simulated with photorealistic detail. NVIDIA\n  Omniverse was built to realize this future. I am delighted that BMW is\n  using NVIDIA Omniverse to connect their teams to design, plan and\n  operate their future factories virtually before anything is built in\n  the physical world. This is the future of manufacturing.\u201d\nVirtual factory planning is already widespread, but until now it has\n  required data to be imported from various applications. This is not\n  only time-consuming but also raises compatibility issues. In addition,\n  the data is not always up to date. In the future, the Omniverse\n  platform will enable live data to be collected and collated from all\n  the relevant databases to create a joint simulation \u2013 eliminating the\n  need to reimport data. The goal is to enable modifications and\n  adjustments to be assessed in the early stages of planning in order to\n  create an overall view. This extreme transparency will allow planners\n  and production specialists to plan highly complex production systems\n  even more quickly and accurately, without interface losses or\n  compatibility problems. Omniverse integrates data from various\n  professional design and planning tools from a range of different\n  producers and uses it to generate photo-realistic real-time\n  simulations in a single collaborative setting.\nOutstanding photorealistic quality is just one of the many benefits\n  of Omniverse. Another is that employees at different sites in\n  different time zones can access the virtual simulation and work\n  together to plan and optimise details of a process or production\n  system whenever they need to. In addition, Omniverse can be used in a\n  multitude of applications: in the future, planners and production\n  specialists will collaborate using real-time data that is synchronised\n  in the Omniverse cloud infrastructure. They will also be able to\n  discuss the integration of new production systems with suppliers.\n  Omniverse allows structure and facility data to be integrated, as well\n  as items and part numbers of materials in production. It can also be\n  used for logistics planning, offering unprecedented data consistency,\n  from planning through to production. \u201cThis is redefining\n  collaboration,\u201d emphasises Board Member for Production Milan\n  Nedeljkovi\u0107. The ability to carry out changes live will speed up\n  decision-making noticeably. Production planners at the BMW Group will\n  be able to visualise the entire planning lifecycle for every plant in\n  the global production network, accelerated by scalable GPU\n  performance. This will be supported by a wide range of AI-capable\n  application cases, from autonomous robotics to predictive maintenance\n  and data analysis.\nThe BMW Group and NVIDIA are long-standing partners. In a first pilot\n  project, the US-based company fitted high-performance technologies and\n  special AI control modules to logistics robots and to the BMW Group\u2019s\n  self-developed autonomous transport robots (STR).\n\n\n\nShow entire text\n\n\nArticle Offline Attachments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Release PDF, EN, 116.64 KB\n\n\n\n\nArticle Media Material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      My.PressClub\u00a0Login\n      \n\n\u00a0PressClub InformationANNUAL CONFERENCE 2025.\nMunich, 14 March 2025.\nHere you can see the On-Demand Webcast of the BMW Group Annual Conference 2025.\nOpen Website\n\nCO2 emission information.\nFuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption and range were measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC) 2007/715 as amended.

Nvidia says Grace is set to launch in 2023, but Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US and the Swiss National Computing Centre\u00a0have already announced plans for Grace-based supercomputers.Nvidia is famed as a maker of graphics cards; certainly, PC gaming and cryptocurrency mining are the company\u2019s bread-and-butter. But Nvidia technology already powers a whole range of high-performance, GPU-intensive applications\u2014including\u00a0AI,\u00a0finance,\u00a0imaging,\u00a0genome sequencing,\u00a0signal processing, and computational fluid dynamics.\u201cIt\u2019s specialty applications, really,\u201d says Douglas Lyon, a professor of computer engineering at Fairfield University in Connecticut. \u201cThey\u2019re killer apps, no doubt. They\u2019re important apps, yes indeed. But they\u2019re not Microsoft Word.\u201dThere\u2019s good reason Nvidia may want to delve deeper into a space they already have experience with. Many of those applications inhabit a lucrative world. \u201cIt\u2019s attracting a lot of research, a lot of investment dollars, a lot of intellectual capital, and it will continue to do so,\u201d says Lyon.Grace will use\u00a0architecture by ARM, the British firm that licenses its designs to other manufacturers. An Nvidia-ARM system aimed at the AI and HPC market could represent a potent coupling, too.\u00a0Because while Intel continues to dominate the Top500 list of the world\u2019s fastest HPC systems, last year Japan\u2019s ARM-based Fugaku\u00a0supercomputer (with more than seven million cores, running at 442 petaflops) secured the number one spot on the list, pointing down a higher-efficiency path toward exascale that the famously trim ARM architecture may yet enable.\u00a0\u00a0Nvidia is in the process of attempting to acquire ARM from its current owner SoftBank, but the deal has run into regulatory headwinds and many\u2014including Lyon\u2014feel that it deserves antitrust scrutiny.It\u2019s little help for Intel, which might feel that Nvidia\u2019s announcement is but the latest in a series of blows.Intel has already faced setbacks in home computers, long one of its wheelhouses. Since AMD launched its Ryzen processors in 2017, they have continually gained ground at Intel\u2019s expense. Earlier this year, AMD took the lead in desktop processors for the first time since 2006.\u00a0And Apple\u2014which already made its own chips for mobile phones\u2014broke with the company in a high-profile split last year, announcing that they would start making their own processors for their laptops and desktops.Not long afterwards, Intel announced it was joining forces with IBM to boost semiconductor manufacturing, but it\u2019s not clear what benefit that partnership will bring.Intel utterly dominates the processor market in data centers, but even there Intel is being challenged by AMD. It helps that TSMC, which supplies AMD\u2019s chips, has leapt ahead of Intel in fabrication technology. Many analysts do not doubt that Nvidia\u2019s move will add to the pressure Intel is facing.That said, Intel still has some notable advantages. If Nvidia\u2019s ARM acquisition does go through, Lyon thinks, it may punch a hole in the market of firms that licence out their designs. That may leave a space for the likes of Intel, which has always designed and manufactured its own chips.And Intel might perform better at certain tasks that are better suited to its hardware. Today, Nvidia\u2019s technology might have an advantage in certain tasks like pattern recognition and genomics, according to Lyon, but in others, such as playing board games or creating expert systems, it\u2019s not quite as good.\u201cAnybody can put a whole pile of CPUs in a box,\u201d says Lyon. \u201cThe critical problem has always been to program them.\u201dFrom Your Site ArticlesBehind Intel\u2019s HPC Chip that Will Break the Exascale Barrier \u203aNvidia Spools Up Quantum Jet Engine Simulations - IEEE Spectrum \u203adata centergrace hopperhardwarenvidiahpcamdintelsupercomputinggrace cpuRahul RaoRahul Rao is a freelance science and technology writer based in London.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\n*Update* I have since tweaked a few bits of my hardware and seen differing results, so updates will be added to various sections.\n\nA few weeks ago I was on a call that celebrated Google Chromebook's 10th birthday, and during the usual slides and feature announcements I noticed something a bit off. While a segment of the presentation was dedicated to how Chromebooks can be used as a gaming device alongside cloud streaming, not a single mention was made regarding Google Stadia.\n\nInstead, Nvidia's GeForce Now service was mentioned exclusively throughout the session as a fantastic option for folk wanting to play some games without the usually-required hardware.\n\nI've actually used the GeForce Now service before during the launch of Cyberpunk 2077 as my own gaming PC at the time didn't meet the required specifications to play. As a huge fan of the Witcher series, I stayed up till 4am attempting to get the game to run at something even remotely playable, to absolutely no avail. The following day I was suggested by colleagues that Nvidia's cloud gaming offering could be a viable alternative, and honestly, I'm glad I took their advice.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend that streaming games has been perfected, because there's a lot of development that still needs to happen to make this a 'console killing' technology, but I did manage to sign into the game and actually play it with far fewer issues than I had anticipated. In fact, I really enjoyed myself.\n\nThe fact that I enjoyed myself made me want to re-evaluate how I was looking at cloud gaming, given how I had previously felt about the somewhat tragic launch of Stadia, so I checked some hardware requirements and grabbed everything in my house that can supposedly support GeForce Now for some testing.On an ageing desktop(Image credit: Nvidia)Before I got my hands on a GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card I was still rocking a GTX 1070 Ti in my personal gaming rig \u2013 a perfectly respectable build if you glimpsed into my Steam library, mostly comprising of games from before 2018. However much I loved my 1070 Ti though, modern games didn't share that feeling, and the hardware demands of newer releases were usually simply too much for me to play anything without low framerates or with all the shiny graphics turned down to the lowest setting.\n\nThe desktop was by far the best experience I had using the GeForce Now service, giving me the promised 1080p 60fps with lower latency than I expected. For those who aren't familiar with the term, latency, in this case, refers to the time it took from me using controls on my mouse, keyboard or gamepad (with the accessories depending on hardware restrictions) to register on the display.\n\nFor single-player titles like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 it was certainly noticeable, but not to the extent that it interfered with gameplay. The graphics had a couple of issues, with motion blur during camera movement being slightly smeared, but that only became a pain when using rapid mouse movement.\n\nI also gave Outriders a spin given its recent release to see how well the game would perform, and it's a similar tale. The latency was noticeable and would certainly put you at a disadvantage in a firefight against pro players, but in single-player campaign mode I managed just fine and still had a blast.I also tried GeForce now alongside an Nvidia Shield Pro, hoping that the AI Upscaling feature on the Shield would help with the fact I was trying to stream on a Sony KD-49XE8396 4K TV. I sadly didn't notice any difference between having the upscaling enabled or not in games, but as the Shield was connected by Ethernet I got the same fast connection and negligible latency that I did when trying to stream on my desktop PC.\n\nAnd just because the upscaling didn't make a noticeable difference doesn't mean the overall result was terrible \u2013 Outriders only had a few issues with subtitle text appearing grainy (but still completely readable) and the same motion blurring that was seen when the camera swings around. The overall graphics were still 1080p, despite being on a 4K display of course, so I had to reign in my expectations, but for anyone using a native 1080P display, you'll find a much better result.\n\n*Update* After resetting my TV back to the factory settings I did see a slight improvement in the sharpness and contrast in Cyberpunk 2077, so please disregard the previous statement as user error. It did leave graphics looking crisper and more details could be made out on everything from the environment to clothing. I did not see an improvement in Outriders.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI haven't been this excited about PC gaming in decades \u2013 and it's all thanks to my early time with Nvidia's RTX 5070\n\n\n\n\nHave RTX 5090 and 5080 stock rumors spooked PC gamers? Nvidia GeForce Now is facing high demand, with many plans now unavailable\n\n\n\nUsing an old MacBook Air (2013) and Lenovo laptop(Image credit: Nvidia)Coming away from a wired internet connection had me a little nervous, even despite my Wi-Fi test results coming in at an average download speed of 99+ Mbps.\u00a0Moving from my relatively capable desktop, I wanted to try GeForce Now on some of the older, janky tech devices rather than installing the service onto a new, shiny gaming laptop I had in for review. And that meant relying on Wi-Fi.\n\nMy old university laptop, a Lenovo B50-80 from 2014, had served me well for numerous years, but was starting to show its age. I tested all three games again and immediately noticed a rise in latency, despite my alleged high wireless speed. The result still wasn't unplayable for the CD Project Red games, and actual load times didn't appear to be affected, given that any loading screens were almost non-existent.\n\nThe latency rise did affect performance in Outriders though. The delay resulted in escalated frustration with me being unable to react to threats on the screen that I knew I would have deftly handled on a non-streamed game. The counter to this was that the smaller display meant that the games actually looked much better than they did blown up to the much larger 27-inch computer monitor or 50-inch TV I had previously tried.\n\nI also installed it onto an old 2013 MacBook Air, and that actually fared better, having aged a little more gracefully. The condition of the devices does seem to have an impact beyond how fast your wireless connections are, as the latency for all games was similar on the MacBook Air as on the desktop PC, so the age or quality of the Wi-Fi chip is absolutely going to make a difference.\n\nIf I was restricted to using Apple hardware though, it seems like cloud streaming is going to become a very suitable alternative for anyone who is stuck between the old Windows vs Mac argument. It's far from feeling like a native gaming experience yet, though with more development I can see this becoming a gateway for Mac users to enter the PC gaming space in the coming years.Today's best Apple MacBook Air deals $819 $649ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesiPads & Android phones(Image credit: Shutterstock / aslysun)I had two iPads laying around to try out, an iPad Pro 12.9 (3rd gen) and an older iPad (5th gen). Given the iPad Pro is barely two years old and still works like new I had high expectations, but this ended in disappointment. Despite the website stating my device was compatible, GeForce Now refused to cooperate.\n\nWhen using an Android or iOS device you should be able to visit play.geforcenow.com and save the webpage to your device home screen. In the case of my iPad Pro, this page displayed a \"your device is not compatible\" message and no amount of troubleshooting would get the service to work, so I swiftly abandoned the newer Apple tech.\n\nThe older 5th-generation iPad did work however, and I was pleasantly surprised by its perfomance. You need to pair a Bluetooth gamepad with your iOS or Android device of choice to actually play anything, but it was easy enough to set up with a PS4 controller. The smaller screen made it very difficult to play Outriders, but I won't hold that against the streaming software \u2013 it's your decision what titles you play after all.\n\nThe latency was around the same as I saw on the Lenovo laptop, so playing anything competitive would likely cause some misery, but I was content to play some less demanding titles such as Don't Starve, and older titles like The Witcher 2 felt like the game had been ported to a Nintendo Switch.\n\nI sadly live in an iPhone-free household, so I installed Nvidia's streaming service on my Huawei Mate 20 Pro and an old Samsung Galaxy S8 to test how it would cope with mobile gaming and this is sadly where cloud gaming started to lose its charm again.\n\nBoth devices used a Wi-Fi connection, and the drop in quality was stark. Game loading screens were laggy, audio dropped out and the latency was unbearable. In some cases I was waiting almost a full second before I saw my gamepad actions carried out on the screen, which doesn't sound like much, but the delay resulted in every game being completely unplayable. I managed around 10 minutes of swearing and system tinkering before I gave up on the mobiles.\n\nI did also try with a 4G cellular connection to see how well it would fare, and that was also a laggy mess. That's to be expected though as Nvidia recommends using wired-in internet where possible and Wi-Fi if that's not feasible. A 5Ghz connection is required for a stable stream and it's very unlikely you'd get that over a cellular connection.\n\nNow, given both the Android phones I used were on the older side, this might not be the case for some newer devices, so this isn't a warning to not try using the GeForce Now service with the hardware available to you. You may find it fares better, and I remain hopeful that we can all soon be gaming on our mobiles or tablet devices over 5G connections as if we were playing natively installed games.Final thoughts(Image credit: CD Projekt RED)While the Founders tier was priced at $4.99, the new Priority membership for Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service will cost twice as much at $9.99 per month, with plans to introduce a yearly paid option for $99.99.\u00a0Anyone who signed into the original Founders tier will still only have to pay $4.99 for as long as their account remains active.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.This isn't small change for some, but is around the same as TV streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime. It does open up possibilities for anyone who is currently trying to purchase a new graphics card in the ongoing shortage, or perhaps folk deep into the Apple ecosystem who want to play PC games.\n\nI do still think that this is far from a perfect solution, but I found the games I played on anything with a wired internet connection to be very playable, with very few issues in regards to latency or graphical interference. Laptops weren't too far behind, and the internet speeds and age of your hardware does seem to have some impact on how strong your connection will be to the cloud server, so if you're rocking some fairly new tech then this may see better results for you.\n\nWhen it worked, GeForce Now performed admirably, and I'd wholly suggest giving it a try for yourself, especially as it has a free tier in the membership lineup.\n\nThe free option is really best used as a trial than for frequent use, given you have to queue for a server and are restricted to an hour of gameplay, but this will at least allow you to test to see if your hardware is well suited to use the system. It certainly seems to be the best of the available cloud gaming options available right now, and there are a lot of ongoing updates and features coming to help improve the GeForce Now experience.What's the point of releasing new graphics cards if nobody can actually buy them?\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

Dubbed Grace \u2013 after Grace Hopper, the computer programming pioneer and US Navy rear admiral \u2013 the CPU is NVIDIA\u2019s latest stab at more fully vertically integrating their hardware stack by being able to offer a high-performance CPU alongside their regular GPU wares. According to NVIDIA, the chip is being designed specifically for large-scale neural network workloads, and is expected to become available in NVIDIA products in 2023.\nWith two years to go until the chip is ready, NVIDIA is playing things relatively coy at this time. The company is offering only limited details for the chip \u2013 it will be based on a future iteration of Arm\u2019s Neoverse cores, for example \u2013 as today\u2019s announcement is a bit more focused on NVIDIA\u2019s future workflow model than it is speeds and feeds. If nothing else, the company is making it clear early on that, at least for now, Grace is an internal product for NVIDIA, to be offered as part of their larger server offerings. The company isn\u2019t directly gunning for the Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC server market, but instead they are building their own chip to complement their GPU offerings, creating a specialized chip that can directly connect to their GPUs and help handle enormous, trillion parameter AI models.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA SoC Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nGrace\nXavier\nParker\n\t\t\t(Tegra X2)\n\n\nCPU Cores\n?\n8\n2\n\n\nCPU Architecture\nNext-Gen Arm Neoverse\n\t\t\t(Arm v9?)\nCarmel\n\t\t\t(Custom Arm v8.2)\nDenver 2\n\t\t\t(Custom Arm v8)\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n>500GB/sec\n\t\t\tLPDDR5X\n\t\t\t(ECC)\n137GB/sec\n\t\t\tLPDDR4X\n60GB/sec\n\t\t\tLPDDR4\n\n\nGPU-to-CPU Interface\n>900GB/sec\n\t\t\tNVLink 4\nPCIe 3\nPCIe 3\n\n\nCPU-to-CPU Interface\n>600GB/sec\n\t\t\tNVLink 4\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nManufacturing Process\n?\nTSMC 12nm\nTSMC 16nm\n\n\nRelease Year\n2023\n2018\n2016\n\n\n\nMore broadly speaking, Grace is designed to fill the CPU-sized hole in NVIDIA\u2019s AI server offerings. The company\u2019s GPUs are incredibly well-suited for certain classes of deep learning workloads, but not all workloads are purely GPU-bound, if only because a CPU is needed to keep the GPUs fed. NVIDIA\u2019s current server offerings, in turn, typically rely on AMD\u2019s EPYC processors, which are very fast for general compute purposes, but lack the kind of high-speed I/O and deep learning optimizations that NVIDIA is looking for. In particular, NVIDIA is currently bottlenecked by the use of PCI Express for CPU-GPU connectivity; their GPUs can talk quickly amongst themselves via NVLink, but not back to the host CPU or system RAM.\n\nThe solution to the problem, as was the case even before Grace, is to use NVLink for CPU-GPU communications. Previously NVIDIA has worked with the OpenPOWER foundation to get NVLink into POWER9 for exactly this reason, however that relationship is seemingly on its way out, both as POWER\u2019s popularity wanes and POWER10 is skipping NVLink. Instead, NVIDIA is going their own way by building an Arm server CPU with the necessary NVLink functionality.\nThe end result, according to NVIDIA, will be a high-performance and high-bandwidth CPU that is designed to work in tandem with a future generation of NVIDIA server GPUs. With NVIDIA talking about pairing each NVIDIA GPU with a Grace CPU on a single board \u2013 similar to today\u2019s mezzanine cards \u2013 not only does CPU performance and system memory scale up with the number of GPUs, but in a roundabout way, Grace will serve as a co-processor of sorts to NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. This, if nothing else, is a very NVIDIA solution to the problem, not only improving their performance, but giving them a counter should the more traditionally integrated AMD or Intel try some sort of similar CPU+GPU fusion play.\nBy 2023 NVIDIA will be up to NVLink 4, which will offer at least 900GB/sec of cummulative (up + down) bandwidth between the SoC and GPU, and over 600GB/sec cummulative between Grace SoCs. Critically, this is greater than the memory bandwidth of the SoC, which means that NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs will have a cache coherent link to the CPU that can access the system memory at full bandwidth, and also allowing the entire system to have a single shared memory address space. NVIDIA describes this as balancing the amount of bandwidth available in a system, and they\u2019re not wrong, but there\u2019s more to it. Having an on-package CPU is a major means towards increasing the amount of memory NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs can effectively access and use, as memory capacity continues to be the primary constraining factors for large neural networks \u2013 you can only efficiently run a network as big as your local memory pool.\n\n\n\nCPU & GPU Interconnect Bandwidth\n\n\n\u00a0\nGrace\nEPYC 2 + A100\nEPYC 1 + V100\n\n\nGPU-to-CPU Interface\n\t\t\t(Cummulative, Both Directions)\n>900GB/sec\n\t\t\tNVLink 4\n~64GB/sec\n\t\t\tPCIe 4 x16\n~32GB/sec\n\t\t\tPCIe 3 x16\n\n\nCPU-to-CPU Interface\n\t\t\t(Cummulative, Both Directions)\n>600GB/sec\n\t\t\tNVLink 4\n304GB/sec\n\t\t\tInfinity Fabric 2\n152GB/sec\n\t\t\tInfinity Fabric\n\n\n\nAnd this memory-focused strategy is reflected in the memory pool design of Grace, as well. Since NVIDIA is putting the CPU on a shared package with the GPU, they\u2019re going to put the RAM down right next to it. Grace-equipped GPU modules will include a to-be-determined amount of LPDDR5x memory, with NVIDIA targeting at least 500GB/sec of memory bandwidth. Besides being what\u2019s likely to be the highest-bandwidth non-graphics memory option in 2023, NVIDIA is touting the use of LPDDR5x as a gain for energy efficiency, owing to the technology\u2019s mobile-focused roots and very short trace lengths. And, since this is a server part, Grace\u2019s memory will be ECC-enabled, as well.\n\nAs for CPU performance, this is actually the part where NVIDIA has said the least. The company will be using a future generation of Arm\u2019s Neoverse CPU cores, where the initial N1 design has already been turning heads. But other than that, all the company is saying is that the cores should break 300 points on the SPECrate2017_int_base throughput benchmark, which would be comparable to some of AMD\u2019s second-generation 64 core EPYC CPUs. The company also isn\u2019t saying much about how the CPUs are configured or what optimizations are being added specifically for neural network processing. But since Grace is meant to support NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs, I would expect it to be stronger where GPUs in general are weaker.\nOtherwise, as mentioned earlier, NVIDIA big vision goal for Grace is significantly cutting down the time required for the largest neural networking models. NVIDIA is gunning for 10x higher performance on 1 trillion parameter models, and their performance projections for a 64 module Grace+A100 system (with theoretical NVLink 4 support) would be to bring down training such a model from a month to three days. Or alternatively, being able to do real-time inference on a 500 billion parameter model on an 8 module system.\nOverall, this is NVIDIA\u2019s second real stab at the data center CPU market \u2013 and the first that is likely to succeed. NVIDIA\u2019s Project Denver, which was originally announced just over a decade ago, never really panned out as NVIDIA expected. The family of custom Arm cores was never good enough, and never made it out of NVIDIA\u2019s mobile SoCs. Grace, in contrast, is a much safer project for NVIDIA; they\u2019re merely licensing Arm cores rather than building their own, and those cores will be in use by numerous other parties, as well. So NVIDIA\u2019s risk is reduced to largely getting the I/O and memory plumbing right, as well as keeping the final design energy efficient.\nIf all goes according to plan, expect to see Grace in 2023. NVIDIA is already confirming that Grace modules will be available for use in HGX carrier boards, and by extension DGX and all the other systems that use those boards. So while we haven\u2019t seen the full extent of NVIDIA\u2019s Grace plans, it\u2019s clear that they are planning to make it a core part of future server offerings.\n\nFirst Two Supercomputer Customers: CSCS and LANL\nAnd even though Grace isn\u2019t shipping until 2023, NVIDIA has already lined up their first customers for the hardware \u2013 and they\u2019re supercomputer customers, no less. Both the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and Los Alamos National Laboratory are announcing today that they\u2019ll be ordering supercomputers based on Grace. Both systems will be built by HPE\u2019s Cray group, and are set to come online in 2023.\nCSCS\u2019s system, dubbed Alps, will be replacing their current Piz Daint system, a Xeon plus NVIDIA P100 cluster. According to the two companies, Alps will offer 20 ExaFLOPS of AI performance, which is presumably a combination of CPU, CUDA core, and tensor core throughput. When it\u2019s launched, Alps should be the fastest AI-focused supercomputer in the world.\n\nAn artist's rendition of the expected Alps system\nInterestingly, however, CSCS\u2019s ambitions for the system go beyond just machine learning workloads. The institute says that they\u2019ll be using Alps as a general purpose system, working on more traditional HPC-type tasks as well as AI-focused tasks. This includes CSCS\u2019s traditional research into weather and the climate, which the pre-AI Piz Daint is already used for as well.\nAs previously mentioned, Alps will be built by HPE, who will be basing on their previously-announced Cray EX architecture. This would make NVIDIA\u2019s Grace the second CPU option for Cray EX, along with AMD\u2019s EPYC processors.\nMeanwhile Los Alamos\u2019 system is being developed as part of an ongoing collaboration between the lab and NVIDIA, with LANL set to be the first US-based customer to receive a Grace system. LANL is not discussing the expected performance of their system beyond the fact that it\u2019s expected to be \u201cleadership-class,\u201d though the lab is planning on using it for 3D simulations, taking advantage of the largest data set sizes afforded by Grace. The LANL system is set to be delivered in early 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n119 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Monday, April 12, 2021 - link\nI think everyone saw this coming - Nvidia's been hiring a bunch of server-focused design engineers for a while, and the apparent breakup with IBM (Power10 has no NVlink) pointed pretty strongly to an Nvidia server processor.So what's the core going to be? N2, or a future Neoverse V-series? If it's going to be in systems in early 2023, it's gotta be pretty far in development already.\n\n\n\ngescom - Monday, April 12, 2021 - link\nAmazing.\n\n\n\nmdriftmeyer - Monday, April 12, 2021 - link\nIt won't be in production until 2025.\n\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Monday, April 12, 2021 - link\nWhere did you get that idea? They said systems would be installed by early 2023.\n\n\n\neva02langley - Monday, April 12, 2021 - link\nFirst gen is Gravityron CPUs by AWS.\n\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Tuesday, April 13, 2021 - link\nNo, it isn't.\n\n\n\neva02langley - Tuesday, April 13, 2021 - link\nJensen said it live... first instance is Graviton CPU this year.https://youtu.be/eAn_oiZwUXA?t=3935\n\n\n\nSarahKerrigan - Tuesday, April 13, 2021 - link\nThat's a separate thing. That is not the Grace CPU, which is specifically an HPC CPU for on-prem use arriving in 2023.\n\n\n\nMetaCube - Wednesday, April 14, 2021 - link\nAre you trolling ?\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Thursday, April 15, 2021 - link\nI, for one, am confused.  \"First gen\" of what?  Graviton 1 or 2?Because Graviton 1 used A72 cores.  So, it's not even first gen of Neoverse.If the comment was about first gen of Neoverse, then Graviton 2 did use N1 cores.  But, I have no idea what that even has to do with anything, much less the post it's written as a reply to.So, I think a short reply to a totally ambiguous claim is warranted.  It's sufficient to call into question said claim, without getting sucked into a potential troll like I appear to be doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n12\n\n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

And saving the world\u2019s honeybee population is about a lot more than just honey. All kinds of farmers now need to rent bees because of their scarcity to get their own crops pollinated.\nBeewise, a startup based in Israel, has developed robo hives with computer vision for infestation identification and treatment capabilities. In December, TIME magazine named the Beewise Beehome to its \u201cBest Inventions of 2020\u201d list. Others are using deep learning to understand hives better and look at improved hive designs.\nBeewise is a member of\u00a0NVIDIA Inception, a virtual accelerator program that helps startups in AI and data science get to market faster.\nOrange You Glad AI Helps\nIf it weren\u2019t for AI, that glass of orange juice for breakfast might be a puckery one. A rampant \u201ccitrus greening\u201d disease is decimating orchards and souring fruit worldwide. Thankfully, University of Florida researchers are developing computer vision for smart sprayers of agrochemicals, which are now being licensed and deployed in pilot tests by CCI, an agricultural equipment company.\nThe system can adjust in real time to turn off or on the application of crop protection products or fertilizers as well as adjust the amount sprayed based on the plant\u2019s size.\nSeeTree, based in Israel, is tackling citrus greening, too. It offers a GPU-driven tree analytics platform of image recognition algorithms, sensors, drones and a data collection app.\nThe startup uses NVIDIA Jetson TX2 to process images and CUDA as the interface for cameras at orchards. The TX2 enables it to do fruit-detection for orchards as well as provide farms with a yield estimation tool.\nAI Land of Sky Blue Water\nInception-accelerated startup Bilberry, located in Paris, develops weed recognition powered by the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform for precision application of herbicides. The company has helped customers reduce the usage of chemicals by as much as 92 percent.\nFarmWise, based in San Francisco, offers farmers an AI-driven robotic machine for pulling weeds rather than spraying them, reducing groundwater contamination.\nAlso, John Deere-owned Blue River offers precision spraying of crops to reduce the usage of agrochemicals harmful to land and water.\nAnd two students from India last year developed Nindamani, an AI-driven, weed-removal robot prototype that took top honors at the AI at the Edge Challenge on Hackster.io.\nMilking AI for Dairy Farmers\u00a0\nAI is going to the cows, too. Advanced Animal Diagnostics, based in Morrisville, North Carolina, offers a portable testing device to predict animal performance and detect infections in cattle before they take hold. Its tests are processed on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud. The machine can help reduce usage of antibiotics.\nSimilarly, SomaDetect aims to improve milk production with AI. The Halifax, Nova Scotia, company runs deep learning models on NVIDIA GPUs to analyze milk images.\nPhoto courtesy of Mark Kelly on Unsplash\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Agriculture and Food | Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And it\u2019s about to get a second fuel injection of accelerated computing for AI efforts across the corporation.\nSony\u2019s engineers are packing machine-learning smarts into products from its Xperia smartphones, its entertainment robot, aibo, and a portfolio of imaging components for everything from professional and consumer cameras to factory automation and satellites. It\u2019s even using AI to build the next generation of advanced imaging chips.\nMore Zip, Fewer Tolls\nTo move efficiently into the AI era, Sony is installing a cluster of NVIDIA DGX A100 systems linked on an NVIDIA Mellanox\u00a0 InfiniBand network. It expands an existing system now running at near full utilization with NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs, commissioned in October when the company brought AI training in house.\n\u201cWhen we were using cloud services, AI developers worried about the costs, but now they can focus on AI development on GAIA,\u201d said Kageyama.\nAn in-house AI engine torques performance, too. One team designed a deep-learning model for delivering super-resolution images and trained it nearly 16x faster by adding more resources to the job, shortening a month\u2019s workload to a day.\n\u201cWith the computing power of the DGX A100, its expanded GPU memory and faster InfiniBand networking, we expect to see even greater performance on larger datasets,\u201d said Yoshiki Tanaka, who oversees HPC and distributed deep learning technologies for Sony\u2019s developers.\nPowering an AI Pipeline\nSony posted fast speeds in deep learning back in 2018, accelerating its Neural Network Libraries on a system at Japan\u2019s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. And it\u2019s already rolling out products powered with machine learning, such as its Airpeak drone for professional filmmakers shown at CES this year.\nThere\u2019s plenty more to come.\n\u201cWe will see good results in our fiscal 2021 because we have collaborations with many business teams who have started some good projects,\u201d Kageyama said.\nNVIDIA is putting its shoulder to the wheel with software and services to \u201cbuild a culture of using GPUs,\u201d he added.\nFor example, Sony developers use NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s online container registry, for all the software components they need to get an AI app up and running.\nSony even created a container of its own, now available on NGC, sporting its Neural Network Libraries and other utilities. It supplements NVIDIA\u2019s containers for work in popular environments like PyTorch and TensorFlow.\nDrivers Give a Thumbs Up\nDevelopers tell Kageyama\u2019s team that having their code in one place helps simplify and speed their work.\nSome researchers use the system for high performance computing, tapping into NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software that accelerates a diverse set of technical applications including AI.\nTo keep it all running smoothly, NVIDIA provided a job scheduler as well as additions for Sony to NVIDIA\u2019s libraries for scaling apps across multiple GPUs.\n\u201cGood management software is important for achieving fairness and high utilization on such a complex system,\u201d said Masahiro Hara, who leads development of the GAIA system.\nAn Eye Toward Analytics\nNVIDIA also helped Sony create training programs on how to use its software on GAIA.\nLooking ahead, Sony is interested in expanding its work in data analytics and simulations. It\u2019s evaluating RAPIDS, open-source software NVIDIA helped design to let Python programmers access the power of GPUs for data science.\nAt the end of a work-from-home day keeping Sony ahead of the pack in AI, Kageyama enjoys playing with his kids who keep their dad on his digital toes. \u201cI\u2019m a beginner in Minecraft, and they\u2019re much better than me,\u201d he said.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | Customer Stories | GTC 2021 | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA DGX | RAPIDS \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Global teams can use Omniverse to view, interact with and update the same dataset with a live connection, making collaboration truly interactive.\nOmniverse ParaView Connector\nThe platform has expanded to address the scientific visualization community and now includes a connector to ParaView, one of the world\u2019s most popular scientific visualization applications. Researchers use ParaView on their local workstations or on HPC systems to analyze large datasets for a variety of domains, including astrophysics, climate and weather, fluid dynamics and structural analysis.\nWith the availability of the Omniverse ParaView Connector, announced at GTC21, researchers can boost their productivity and speed their discoveries. Large datasets no longer need to be downloaded and exchanged, and colleagues can get instantaneous feedback as Omniverse users can work in the same workspace in the cloud.\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse pipeline\nUsers can upload their USD format data to the Omniverse Nucleus DB from various application connectors, including the ParaView Connector. The clients then connect to the Omniverse Kit and take advantage of:\n\nPhotorealistic visuals \u2013 Users can leverage a variety of core NVIDIA technologies such as real-time ray tracing, photorealistic materials, depth of field, and advanced lighting and shading through the Omniverse platform\u2019s components such as Omniverse RTX Renderer. This enables researchers to better visualize and understand the results of their simulations leading to deeper insights.\nAccess to high-end visualization tools \u2013 Omniverse users can open and interact with USD files through a variety of popular applications like SideFX Houdini, Autodesk Maya and NVIDIA IndeX. See documentation on how to work with various applications in Omniverse to maximize analysis.\nInteractivity at scale \u2013 Analyzing part of a dataset at a time through batched renderings is time-consuming. And traditional applications are too slow to render features like ray tracing, soft shadows and depth of field in real time, which are required for a fast and uninterrupted analysis. Now, users can intuitively interact with entire datasets in their original resolution at high frame rates for better and faster discoveries.\n\nNVIDIA IndeX provides interactive visualization for large-scale volumetric data, allowing users to zoom in on the smallest details for any timestep in real time. With IndeX soon coming to Omniverse, users will be able to take advantage of both technologies for better and faster scientific analysis. This GTC session will go over what researchers can unlock when IndeX connects to Omniverse.\nVisualization of Mars Lander using NVIDIA IndeX in NVIDIA Omniverse. Simulation data courtesy of NASA.\n\nReal-time collaboration \u2013 Omniverse simplifies workflows by eliminating the need to download data on different systems. It also increases productivity by allowing researchers on different systems to visualize, analyze and modify the same data at the same time.\nPublish cinematic visuals \u2013 Outreach is an essential part of scientific publications. With high-end rendering tools on the Omniverse platform, researchers and artists can interact in real time to transform their work into cinematic visuals that are easy for wide audiences to understand.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, scientists generate visualizations that are useful for data analysis, but are not always aesthetic and straightforward to understand by a broader audience,\u201d said Brad Carvey, an Emmy and Addy Award-winning visualization research engineer at Sandia National Labs. \u201cTo generate a range of visualizations, I use ParaView, Houdini FX, Substance Painter, Photoshop and other applications. Omniverse allows me to use all of these tools, interactively, to create what I call \u2018impactful visualizations.\u2019\u201d\n\nLearn More from Omniverse Experts\nAttend the following GTC sessions to dive deeper into the features and benefits of Omniverse and the ParaView connector:\n\nCinematic Scientific Visualization with the Omniverse ParaView Connector \u2013 Peter Messmer \u2013 HPC DevTech \u2013 NVIDIA (S32572)\nReal-Time, High-Fidelity Visual Experience of Large-Scale Scientific Simulations in Omniverse Using NVIDIA IndeX \u2013 Marc Nienhaus, Jeorg Mensmann \u2013 Software Engineering \u2013 NVIDIA (S32064)\n\nGet Started Today\nThe Omniverse Paraview connector is available now.

It\u2019s AI infrastructure built and managed the way NVIDIA does its own.\nAs AI gets infused into almost every aspect of modern business, the need to deliver almost limitless access to computational resources powering development has been scaling exponentially. This escalation in demand is exemplified by business-critical applications like natural language processing, recommender systems and clinical research.\nOrganizations often tap into the power of DGX SuperPOD in two ways. Some use it to solve huge, monolithic problems such as conversational AI, where the computational power of an entire DGX SuperPOD is brought to bear to accelerate the training of complex natural language processing models.\nOthers use DGX SuperPOD to service an entire company, providing multiple teams access to the system to support fluctuating needs across a wide variety of projects. In this mode, enterprise IT is often acting as a service provider, managing this AI infrastructure-as-a-service, with multiple users (perhaps even adversarial ones) who need and expect complete isolation of each other\u2019s work and data.\nDGX SuperPOD with BlueField DPU\nIncreasingly, businesses need to bring the world of high-performance AI supercomputing into an operational mode where many developers can be assured their work is secure and isolated like it is in cloud. And where IT can manage the environment much like a private cloud, with the ability to deliver resources to jobs, right-sized to the task, in a secure, multi-tenant environment.\nThis is called cloud-native supercomputing and it\u2019s enabled by NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs, which bring accelerated, software-defined data center networking, storage, security and management services to AI infrastructure.\nWith a data processing unit optimized for enterprise deployment and 200 Gbps network connectivity, enterprises gain state-of-the-art, accelerated, fully programmable networking that implements zero trust security to protect against breaches, and isolate users and data, with bare-metal performance.\nEvery DGX SuperPOD now has this capability with the integration of two NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs in each DGX A100 node within it. IT administrators can use the offload, accelerate and isolate capabilities of NVIDIA BlueField DPUs to implement secure multi-tenancy for shared AI infrastructure without impacting the AI performance of the DGX SuperPOD.\nInfrastructure Management with Base Command Manager\nEvery week, NVIDIA manages thousands of AI workloads executed on our internal DGX SATURNV infrastructure, which includes over 2,000 DGX systems. To date, we\u2019ve run over 1.2 million jobs on it supporting over 2,500 developers across more than 200 teams. We\u2019ve also been developing state-of-the-art infrastructure management software that ensures every NVIDIA developer is fully productive as they perform their research and develop our autonomous systems technology, robotics, simulations and more.\nThe software supports all this work, simplifies and streamlines management, and lets our IT team monitor health, utilization, performance and more. We\u2019re adding this same software, called NVIDIA Base Command Manager, to DGX SuperPOD so businesses can run their environments the way we do. We\u2019ll continuously improve Base Command Manager, delivering the latest innovations to customers automatically.\nWhite-Glove Services\nDeploying AI infrastructure is more than just installing servers and storage in data center racks. When a business decides to scale AI, they need a hand-in-glove experience that guides them from design to deployment to operationalization, without burdening their IT team to figure out how to run it, once the \u201ckeys\u201d are handed over.\nWith DGX SuperPOD White Glove Services, customers enjoy a full lifecycle services experience that\u2019s backed by proven expertise from install to operations. Customers benefit from pre-delivery performance certified on NVIDIA\u2019s own acceptance cluster, which validates the deployed system is running at specification before it\u2019s handed off.\nWhite Glove Services also include a dedicated multidisciplinary NVIDIA team that covers everything from installation to infrastructure management to workflow to addressing performance-impacting bottlenecks and optimizations. The services are designed to give IT leaders peace of mind and confidence as they entrust their business to DGX SuperPOD.\nDGX SuperPOD at GTC21\nTo learn more about DGX SuperPOD and how you can consolidate AI infrastructure and centralize development across your enterprise, check out our session presented by Charlie Boyle, vice president and general manager of DGX Systems, who will cover our DGX SuperPOD news and more in two separate sessions at GTC:\n\n\u201cSolving the AI Infrastructure Dilemma in 2021\u201d (S31775)\n\u201cNew Approaches for Accelerating the Prototype-to-Production Cycle for Enterprise AI\u201d (S32159).\n\nRegister for GTC, which runs through April 16, for free.\nLearn more:\n\nwww.nvidia.com/dgx-superpod\nwww.nvidia.com/dgx-station\nwww.nvidia.com/dgx\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Hardware | SupercomputingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And it\u2019s easily deployed to PCs, data centers or in the cloud.\nShift Towards Remote Work\nVirtual collaboration continues to grow with 70 million hours of web meetings daily, and more global organizations are looking at technologies to support an increasingly remote workforce.\nPexip, a scalable video conferencing platform that enables interoperability between different video conferencing systems, was looking to push the boundaries of its video communications offering to meet this growing demand.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already using NVIDIA Maxine for audio noise removal and working on integrating virtual backgrounds to support premium video conferencing experiences for enterprises of all sizes,\u201d said Giles Chamberlin, CTO and co-founder of Pexip.\nWorking with NVIDIA, Pexip aims to provide AI-powered video communications that support virtual meetings that are better than meetings in person.\nIt joins other companies in the video collaboration space like Avaya, which incorporated Maxine audio noise reduction into its Spaces app last October and has now implemented virtual background, which allows presenters to overlay their video over presentations.\nHeadroom uses AI to take distractions out of video conferencing, so participants can focus on interactions during meetings instead. This includes flagging when people have questions, note taking, transcription and smart meeting summarization.\nSeeing Face Value for Virtual Events\nResearch has shown that there are over 1 million virtual events yearly, with more event marketers planning to invest in them in the future. As a result, everyone from event organizers to visual effects artists are looking for faster, more efficient ways to create digital experiences.\nAmong them is Touchcast, which combines AI and mixed reality to reimagine virtual events. It\u2019s using Maxine\u2019s super-resolution features to convert and deliver 1080p streams into 4K.\n\u201cNVIDIA Maxine is paving the future of video communications \u2014 a future where AI and neural networks enhance and enrich content in entirely new ways,\u201d said Edo Segal, founder and CEO of Touchcast.\nAnother example is Notch, which creates tools that enable real-time visual effects and motion graphics for live events. Maxine provides it with real-time, AI-driven face and body tracking along with background removal.\nArtists can track and mask performers in a live performance setting for a variety of creative use cases \u2014 all using a standard camera feed and eliminating the challenges of special hardware-tracking solutions.\n\u201cThe integration of the Maxine SDK was very easy and took just a few days to complete,\u201d said Matt Swoboda, founder and director of Notch.\nField of Streams\nWith nearly 10 million content creators on Twitch per month, becoming a live broadcaster has also never been easier. Live streamers are looking for powerful yet easy-to-use features to excite their audiences.\nBeLive, which provides a platform for live streaming user-generated talk shows, is using Maxine to process its video streams in the cloud so customers don\u2019t have to invest in expensive equipment. By running Maxine in the cloud, users can benefit from high-quality background replacement regardless of the hardware they\u2019re running in the client.\nWith BeLive, live interactive call-in talk shows can be produced easily and streamed to YouTube or Facebook Live, with participants calling in from around the world.\nOBS, the leading platform for streaming and recording, is a free and open source software solution broadly used for game streaming and live production. Users with NVIDIA RTX GPUs can now take advantage of noise removal, improving the clarity of their audio during production.\nDevelopers are using the Maxine SDK for building virtual collaboration and content creation applications.\nA Look Into NVIDIA Maxine\nNVIDIA Maxine includes three AI SDKs covering video effects, audio effects and augmented reality \u2014 each with pre-trained deep learning models, so developers can quickly build or enhance their real-time applications.\nStarting with the NVIDIA Video Effects SDK, enterprises can now apply AI effects to improve video quality without special cameras or other hardware. Features include super-resolution, generating 720p output live videos from 360p input videos along with artifact reduction to remove defects for crisper pictures.\nVideo noise removal eliminates low-light camera noise introduced in the video capture process while preserving all of the details. To hide messy rooms or other visual distractions, the Video Effects SDK removes the background of a webcam feed in real time, so only a user\u2019s face and body show up in a livestream.\nThe NVIDIA Augmented Reality SDK enables real-time 3D face tracking using a standard web camera, delivering a more engaging virtual communication experience by automatically zooming into the face and keeping that face within view of the camera.\nIt\u2019s now possible to detect human faces in images of video feeds, track the movement of facial expressions, create a 3D mesh representation of a person\u2019s face, use video to track the movement of a\u00a0 human body in 3D space, simulate eye contact through gaze estimation and much more.\nThe NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK uses AI to remove distracting background noise from incoming and outgoing audio feeds, improving the clarity and quality of any conversation.\nThis includes the removal of unwanted background noises \u2014 like a dog barking or baby crying \u2014 to make conversations easier to understand. For meetings in large spaces, it\u2019s also possible to remove room echoes from the background to make voices clearer.\nDevelopers can add Maxine AI effects into their existing applications or develop new pipelines from scratch using NVIDIA DeepStream, an SDK for building intelligent video analytics, and NVIDIA Video Codec, an SDK for accelerated video encode and decode on Windows and Linux.\nMaxine can also be used with NVIDIA Riva, a framework for building conversational AI applications, to offer world-class language-based capabilities such as transcription and translation.\nAvailability\nGet started with NVIDIA Maxine.\nAnd don\u2019t let the curtain close on the opportunity to learn more about NVIDIA Maxine during GTC, running April 12-16. Registration is free.\nA full list of Maxine-focused sessions can be found here. Be sure to watch Huang\u2019s keynote address on-demand. And check out a demo (below) of Maxine.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | DeepStream | GTC 2021 | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Maxine | NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing | Video Streaming | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We also continually refine the user experience in the GeForce NOW app, which is now rolling out version 2.0.29 with several improvements.\nGame in the Fast Lane\nFrom the Settings pane in the GeForce NOW app, you can link your Epic Games Store account to take advantage of some new features.\nOne feature we\u2019re currently testing with our Founders and Priority members is preloading, which loads parts of your game before you arrive so your launch times will be faster. Members testing this feature should see sessions launch up to a minute faster from the moment they click play in the GeForce NOW app. Free members are not guaranteed preloaded sessions and may see slightly longer startup times.\nTo enable the benefits of preloading, we\u2019re also testing a new account linking feature which lets you play games without having to login into your game store account. Both the preloading and account linking features are currently enabled for Fortnite\u2019s PC build on GeForce NOW. We anticipate an expansion of these features to more GeForce NOW games in the future.\nPC, macOS and Chromebook users can enable the new account linking features from a new tile on the My Library row in-app. This takes you to the Settings pane, where you can turn on account linking for Fortnite under Connections. Once complete, you won\u2019t need to log in to your Epic Account to play Fortnite\u2019s PC build on any other supported GeForce NOW platform, and you\u2019ll be eligible for preloaded sessions.\nFind What You\u2019re Looking For\nWe\u2019re also improving search results in the app to make managing libraries easier and get members in games faster. Searching for games to add to libraries will now return full page search results, providing easier access to the game\u2019s details and a quicker way to add it to your library.\nThe newest version of the GeForce NOW app includes improved search, account linking for Epic Games Store, and a whole lot more.\nIf you\u2019re playing on GeForce NOW from a Chrome browser, we\u2019ve recently added our in-game overlay.\u00a0 The overlay lets members configure many in-stream features, such as FreeStyle filters, network labels, microphone toggles and ending game sessions. To bring up the overlay, using Ctrl + G for PC and Chromebook, or CMD + G for macOS.\nAnd no GeForce NOW app update would be complete without squashed bugs. To get the full lowdown, check out the version 2.0.29 Release Highlights from the Settings pane in the app.\nThese updates are just a few of the improvements we\u2019re working on. We have a ton more in store, and every update is designed to make sure that when GFN members play their favorite PC games from our cloud servers, they\u2019re getting the best possible experience.\nRolling in the Deep (Silver)\nWe recently spoke with our friends at Deep Silver about new updates coming for KING Art Games\u2019 Iron Harvest and 4A Games\u2019 Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition, both of which will be supported on GeForce NOW. Catch up on all the details here.\nGet Your Game On\nThe latest in the classic R-Type series comes to GeForce NOW this week.\nFinally, below are the games joining the GeForce NOW library this week.\u00a0\n\nR-Type Final 2 (day-and-date release on Steam)\nChinese Parents (Steam)\nDarksiders II Deathinitive Edition (Epic Games Store)\nThe Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos (Epic Games Store)\nGoNNER (Epic Games Store)\nSOMA (Epic Games Store)\nYooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair (Epic Games Store)\n\nWhat do you think of the newest GeForce NOW updates?

To cope with these compute-intensive tasks, enterprises need accelerated servers that are optimized for high performance.\nIntel\u2019s 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named \u201cIce Lake\u201d), launched today, are based on a new architecture that enables a major leap in performance and scalability. These new systems are an ideal platform for enterprise accelerated computing, when enhanced with NVIDIA GPUs and networking, and include features that are well-suited for GPU-accelerated applications.\nIce Lake platform benefits for accelerated computing.\nThe move to PCIe Gen 4 doubles the data transfer rate from the prior generation, and now matches the native speed of NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs, such as the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU. This speeds throughput to and from the GPU, which is especially important to machine learning workloads that involve vast amounts of training data. This also improves transfer speeds for data-intensive tasks like 3D design for NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstations accelerated by the powerful NVIDIA A40 data center GPU and others.\nFaster PCIe performance also accelerates GPU direct memory access transfers. Faster I/O communication of video data between the GPU and GPUDirect for Video-enabled devices delivers a powerful solution for live broadcasts.\nThe higher data rate additionally enables networking speeds of 200Gb/s, such as in the NVIDIA ConnectX family of HDR 200Gb/s InfiniBand adapters and 200Gb/s Ethernet NICs, as well as the upcoming NDR 400Gb/s InfiniBand adapter technology.\nThe Ice Lake platform supports 64 PCIe lanes, so more hardware accelerators \u2013 including GPUs and networking cards \u2013 can be installed in the same server, enabling a greater density of acceleration per host. This also means that greater user density can be achieved for multimedia-rich VDI environments accelerated by the latest NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA Virtual PC software.\nThese enhancements allow for unprecedented scaling of GPU acceleration. Enterprises can tackle the biggest jobs by using more GPUs within a host, as well as more effectively connecting GPUs across multiple hosts.\nIntel has also made Ice Lake\u2019s memory subsystem more performant. The number of DDR4 memory channels has increased from six to eight and the data transfer rate for memory now has a maximum speed at 3,200 MHz.\u00a0 This allows for greater bandwidth of data transfer from main memory to the GPU and networking, which can increase throughput for data-intensive workloads.\nFinally, the processor itself has improved in ways that will benefit accelerated computing workloads. The 10-15 percent increase in instructions per clock can lead to an overall performance improvement of up to 40 percent for the CPU portion of accelerated workloads. There are also more cores \u2014 up to 40 in the 8xxx variant. This will enable a greater density of virtual desktop sessions per host, so that GPU investments in a server can go further.\nWe\u2019re excited to see partners already announcing new Ice Lake systems accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs, including Dell Technologies with the Dell EMC PowerEdge R750xa, purpose built for GPU acceleration, and new Lenovo ThinkSystem Servers, built on 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and PCIe Gen4, with several models powered by NVIDIA GPUs.\nIntel\u2019s new Ice Lake platform, with accelerator hardware, is a great choice for enterprise customers who plan to update their data center. Its new architectural enhancements enable enterprises to run accelerated applications with better performance and at data center scale and our mutual customers will be able to quickly experience its benefits.\nVisit the NVIDIA Qualified Server Catalog to see a list of GPU-accelerated server models with Ice Lake CPUs, and be sure to check back as more systems are added.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Networking \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on the Fusion of Virtual and Physical WorldsThe Metaverse Is Coming. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on the Fusion of Virtual and Physical Worlds8 minute readJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidiacourtesy of NvidiaBy Eben ShapiroApril 18, 2021 6:50 AM EDT(Miss this week\u2019s Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, April 18, to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)It\u2019s not altogether surprising that a company earning billions of dollars a year making the chips that power today\u2019s hyperrealistic video games has a business plan inspired by a science-fiction novel. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, the nation\u2019s most valuable semiconductor company, with a stock price of $645 a share and a market cap of $400 billion, is out to create the metaverse, what Huang describes \u201ca virtual world that is a digital twin of ours.\u201d Huang credits author Neal Stephenson\u2019s Snow Crash, filled with collectives of shared 3-D spaces and virtually enhanced physical spaces that are extensions of the Internet, for conjuring the metaverse.  This is already playing out with the massively popular online games like Fortnite and Minecraft, where users create richly imagined virtual worlds. Now the concept is being put to work by Nvidia and others. Partnering with Nvidia, BMW is using a virtual digital twin of a factory in Regensburg, Germany, to virtually plan new workflows before deploying the changes in real time in their physical factory. The metaverse, says Huang, \u201cis where we will create the future\u201d and transform how the world\u2019s biggest industries operate.From their roots in the gaming industry, Nvidia chips are now an important component of many of the world\u2019s most powerful computers, powering AI, drug discovery and the coming generation of autonomous vehicles. Huang joined TIME for a video conversation this week to talk about the chip shortage, the future of the car industry and his belief in the goodness of human nature. Subscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.(This interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been condensed and edited for clarity. Note: Some of Huang\u2019s comments, below, are from a keynote speech he gave earlier this week and the press conference that followed.)You describe the latest iteration of AI as \u201cthe modern Big Bang.\u201d Can you share your view of the transforming potential of AI?AI is a watershed moment for the world. Humans\u2019 fundamental technology is intelligence. We\u2019re in the process of automating intelligence so that we can augment ours. The thing that\u2019s really cool is that AI is software that writes itself, and it writes software that no humans can. It\u2019s incredibly complex. And we can automate intelligence to operate at the speed of light, and because of computers, we can automate intelligence and scale it out globally instantaneously. Every single one of the large industries will be revolutionized because of it. When you talk about the smartphone, it completely revolutionized the phone industry. We\u2019re about to see the same thing happen to agriculture, to food production, to health care, to manufacturing, to logistics, to customer care, to transportation. These industries that I just mentioned are so complex that no humans could write the software to improve it. But finally we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We\u2019re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we\u2019re going to see the automation of automation.Not to make any value judgments about the importance of video games, but do you find it ironic that a company that has its roots in entertainment is now providing vitally important computing power for drug discovery, basic research and reinventing manufacturing?No, not at all. It\u2019s actually the opposite. We always started as a computing company. It just turned out that our first killer app was video games. At the time video games was a zero billion-dollar market, and we postulated that this new industry called video games, with 3-D graphics that are really rich and beautiful was going to be one of the largest technology industries in the world. The condition is extremely rare that a market is simultaneously large and technologically demanding. It is usually the case that the markets that require really powerful computers are very small in size, whether it\u2019s climate simulation or molecular-dynamics drug discovery. The markets are so small, it can\u2019t afford very large investments. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a company that was founded to do climate research. Video games were one of the best strategic decisions we ever made. AI is a watershed moment for the world.What\u2019s your philosophy regarding entering new markets?Our primary preference is that we don\u2019t build something. If somebody else is building it, we\u2019re delighted to use it. That allows us to spare our critical resources in the company, and focus on advancing the industry in a way that is rather unique and advance the industry in a way that nobody else does. Why are recommendation algorithms so hard and so important?Recommender systems are the most important AI system of our time, the most important machine-learning pipeline in the world today. It is the engine for  search, ads, online shopping, music, books, movies, user-generated content, news.  They are processing hundreds of petabytes of data and moving toward terabytes. One of the most important things that intelligent people do is make recommendations. Recommender systems predict your needs and preferences from past interactions with you, your explicit  preferences, and learned preferences using methods called collaborative and content filtering. Trillions of items to be recommended to billions of people.How has the chip shortage affected the car industry?One of the dynamics that COVID exposed is a weakness in the supply chain of the automotive industry, which has too many components built into cars. When it shut down abruptly because of COVID, the recovery process\u2014the restart process\u2014was far more complicated than anybody imagined. It is very clear that the car has to be rearchitected, and instead of thousands of components, it really wants to be a few centralized components, because you could keep your eyes on four things a lot better than you can keep an eye on 1,000 things or 10,000 things coming from different places. We're going to see the automation of automation.Beyond the chip shortage, you work closely with major car companies: How will AI impact the automotive industry?The car industry could start thinking about their cars not as vehicles that they sell, but as part of their fleet and their installed base. They could provide software services over the course of the 15, 20 years that these cars are on the road. So the business model is transformed. How important is the advent and the adaptation of digital twins for manufacturing, business and society at large?In the future, the digital world or the virtual world will be thousands of times bigger than the physical world. There will be a new New York City. There\u2019ll be a new Shanghai. Every single factory and every single building will have a digital twin that will simulate and track the physical version of it. Always. By doing so, engineers and software programmers could simulate new software that will ultimately run in the physical version of the car, the physical version of the robot, the physical version of the airport, the physical version of the building. All of the software that\u2019s going to be running in these physical things will be simulated in the digital twin first, and then it will be downloaded into the physical version. And as a result, the product keeps getting better at an exponential rate. The second thing is, you\u2019re going to be able to go in and out of the two worlds through wormholes. We\u2019ll go into the virtual world using virtual reality, and the objects in the virtual world, in the digital world, will come into the physical world, using augmented reality. So what\u2019s going to happen is pieces of the digital world will be temporarily, or even semipermanently, augmenting our physical world. It\u2019s ultimately about the fusion of the virtual world and the physical world.Do you worry about bad actors getting their hands on all this powerful technology and using it to sow chaos, perpetrate evil and disrupt this utopian vision of the future? The best way is to democratize the technology in order to enable all society, which is vastly good\u2014and to put great technology in their hands, so that they could use the same technology\u2014and, ideally, superior technology\u2014to stay safe.

They used skeleton crews, social distancing protocols, and remote cable validation to achieve what typically takes months with a larger install team in a few weeks.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 NVIDIA\u2019s Julie Bernauer Talks Setting Up One of World\u2019s Fastest Supercomputers \u2013 Ep. 141\n\u00a0\nBernauer told NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about the goal in creating Selene, which was primarily to support NVIDIA\u2019s researchers. Referencing her time as a doctoral student, Bernauer explains how researchers are often prevented from working on larger models due to expense and infrastructure.\nWith Selene, the infrastructure is modular and can be scaled up or down depending on what users require, and allows for different types of research to be performed simultaneously. Bernauer said that Selene is proving most useful to autonomous vehicle and language modeling research at the moment.\nGoing forward, Bernauer envisions some of the power and efficiency of systems like Selene becoming more available on widely accessible devices, such as laptops or edge products such as cars.\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\nSelene\u2019s unique, pandemic-safe installation is further explained in an NVIDIA blog detailing the specific efforts of Bernauer\u2019s team and the lessons learned from past NVIDIA supercomputers such as SATURNV and Circe.\nBernauer joined NVIDIA in 2015, after spending 15 years in academia. She obtained her Ph.D. in structural genomics from Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, after which she studied with Nobel Prize winner Michael Levitt at Stanford.\n\nTweetables:\n\u201c[Selene] is an infrastructure that people can share, where we can do different types of research at a time\u201d \u2014 Julie Bernauer [8:30]\n\u201cWe did [Selene] for ourselves, but we also did it \u2026 to figure out how to make a product better by going through the experience\u201d \u2014 Julie Bernauer [13:27]\nYou Might Also Like:\nNVIDIA\u2019s Marc Hamilton on Building the Cambridge-1 Supercomputer During a Pandemic\nMarc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA, speaks about overseeing the construction of the U.K.\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, Cambridge-1.

We\u2019re working with NVIDIA to bring an Arm processor-based, NVIDIA GPU accelerated Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to the cloud in the second half of 2021. This instance will feature the Arm-based AWS Graviton2 processor, which was built from the ground up by AWS and optimized for how customers run their workloads in the cloud, eliminating a lot of unneeded components that otherwise might go into a general-purpose processor.\nAWS innovation with Graviton2 processors\nAWS has continued to pioneer cloud computing for our customers. In 2018, AWS was the first major cloud provider to offer Arm-based instances in the cloud with EC2 A1 instances powered by AWS Graviton processors. These instances are built around Arm cores and make extensive use of AWS custom-built silicon. They\u2019re a great fit for scale-out workloads in which you can share the load across a group of smaller instances.\nIn 2020, AWS released AWS-designed, Arm-based Graviton2 processors, delivering a major leap in performance and capabilities over first-generation AWS Graviton processors. These processors power EC2 general purpose (M6g, M6gd, T4g), compute-optimized (C6g, C6gd, C6gn), and memory-optimized (R6g, R6gd, X2gd) instances, and provide up to 40% better price performance over comparable current generation x86-based instances for a wide variety of workloads. AWS Graviton2 processors deliver seven times more performance, four times more compute cores, five times faster memory, and caches twice as large over first-generation AWS Graviton processors.\nCustomers including Domo, Formula One, Honeycomb.io, Intuit, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Nielsen, NextRoll, Redbox, SmugMug, Snap, and Twitter have seen significant performance gains and reduced costs from running AWS Graviton2-based instances in production. AWS Graviton2 processors, based on the 64-bit Arm architecture, are supported by popular Linux operating systems, including Amazon Linux 2, Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu. Many popular applications and services from AWS and ISVs also support AWS Graviton2-based instances. Arm developers can use these instances to build applications natively in the cloud, thereby eliminating the need for emulation and cross-compilation, which are error-prone and time-consuming. Adding NVIDIA GPUs accelerates Graviton2-based instances for diverse cloud workloads, including gaming and other Arm-based workloads like machine learning (ML) inference.\nEasily move Android games to the cloud\nAccording to research from App Annie, mobile gaming is now the most popular form of gaming and has overtaken console, PC, and Mac. Additional research from App Annie has shown that up to 10% of all time spent on mobile devices is with games, and game developers need to support and optimize their games for the diverse set of mobile devices being used today and in the future. By leveraging the cloud, game developers can provide a uniform experience across the spectrum of mobile devices and extend battery life due to lower compute and power demands on the mobile device. The AWS Graviton2 instance with NVIDIA GPU acceleration enables game developers to run Android games natively, encode the rendered graphics, and stream the game over networks to a mobile device, all without needing to run emulation software on x86 CPU-based infrastructure.\nCost-effective, GPU-based machine learning inference\nIn addition to mobile gaming, customers running machine learning models in production are continuously looking for ways to lower costs as ML inference can represent up to 90% of the overall infrastructure spend for running these applications at scale. With this new offering, customers will be able to take advantage of the price/performance benefits of Graviton2 to deploy GPU accelerated deep learning models at a significantly lower cost vs. x86-based instances with GPU acceleration.\nAWS and NVIDIA: A long history of collaboration\nAWS and NVIDIA have collaborated for over 10 years to continually deliver powerful, cost-effective, and flexible GPU-based solutions to customers including the latest EC2 G4 instances with NVIDIA T4 GPUs launched in 2019 and EC2 P4d instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs launched in 2020. EC2 P4d instances are deployed in hyperscale clusters called EC2 UltraClusters that are comprised of the highest performance compute, networking, and storage in the cloud.

The focal point of the revolutionary vehicle is the MBUX Hyperscreen, a truly intuitive and personalized AI cockpit, powered by NVIDIA.\nThe EQS is the first Mercedes-Benz to feature the \u201cone bow\u201d design, resembling a high-speed bullet train to increase efficiency as well as provide a quiet, comfortable interior experience.\nThe cabin is further transformed by the MBUX Hyperscreen \u2014 a single, 55-inch surface extending from the cockpit to the passenger seat. It delivers both safety and convenience by displaying all necessary functions at once.\nLike the MBUX system recently unveiled with the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, this extended-screen system runs on the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE platform for instantaneous AI processing and sharp graphics.\n\n\u201cThe EQS is high tech in a true luxury shell,\u201d said Ola K\u00e4llenius, chairman of the Mercedes-Benz Board of Management.\nWith NVIDIA\u2019s high-performance, energy-efficient compute, Mercedes-Benz was able to consolidate the varied and distributed cockpit components into one AI platform \u2014 with three separate screens under one glass surface \u2014 to simplify the architecture while creating more space to add new features.\nIntelligence in Many Flavors\nThe MBUX Hyperscreen makes it easy to focus on the road ahead, yet delivers beautiful graphics for when attention to driving isn\u2019t necessary.\nLeveraging a \u201czero layer\u201d design concept, the display features 90 percent of functions drivers and passengers need right on the surface, reducing the driver\u2019s reliance on buttons or voice commands. An augmented reality heads-up display provides clear, 3D, turn-by-turn navigation, keeping drivers focused.\nThe deep neural networks powering the system process datasets such as vehicle position, cabin temperature and time of day to prioritize certain features \u2014 like entertainment or points of interest recommendations \u2014 while always keeping navigation at the center of the display.\n\nThe EQS will be capable of level 3 automated driving with Mercedes-Benz DRIVE PILOT. For times when the driver\u2019s attention doesn\u2019t need to be on the road, the MBUX Hyperscreen provides crystal-clear graphics as well as an intelligent voice assistant for the utmost convenience.\nThe map feature allows drivers to view their route in 3D, down to the tiniest detail. It can also factor battery capacity, weather conditions and topography into route planning, suggesting charging points along the way if needed. Front-seat passengers also get a dedicated screen for entertainment and ride information that doesn\u2019t interfere with the driver\u2019s display. It also enables the front seat passenger to share content with others in the car.\n\u201cThe MBUX Hyperscreen surprises with intelligence in many flavors,\u201d said Sajjad Khan, executive vice president at Mercedes-Benz.\nAnd with high-performance NVIDIA compute at MBUX Hyperscreen\u2019s core, users can seamlessly experience these flavors, toggling between features without experiencing any lag or delay.\nAhead of the Curve\nEquipped with the most powerful battery in the industry, providing an estimated 478 miles of range and 516 horsepower, the EQS was designed to lead its class in every metric.\nThe sedan\u2019s sleek design optimizes aerodynamics for lightning-quick acceleration \u2014 it can bolt from 0 to 60 mph in 4 seconds \u2014 while maintaining battery efficiency and reducing cabin noise.\nTaking cues from its internal combustion engine sibling, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the EQS boasts the largest interior of any electric sedan on the market. The vehicle can recognize the driver either using facial recognition or fingerprint scanner, and adjust seating and climate settings to personal preferences. It also features customizable ambient lighting for whatever the mood.\nThe EQS is slated to arrive at U.S. dealerships this summer, ushering in a new generation of intelligent, electric luxury vehicles.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This is the latest post in our NVIDIA DRIVE Labs series, which takes an engineering-focused look at individual autonomous vehicle challenges and how NVIDIA DRIVE addresses them. Catch up on all of our automotive posts, here.\nAutonomous vehicles don\u2019t just need to detect the moving traffic that surrounds them \u2014 they must also be able to tell what isn\u2019t in motion.\nAt first glance, camera-based perception may seem sufficient to make these determinations. However, low lighting, inclement weather or conditions where objects are heavily occluded can affect cameras\u2019 vision. This means diverse and redundant sensors, such as radar, must also be capable of performing this task. However, additional radar sensors that leverage only traditional processing may not be enough.\nIn this DRIVE Labs video, we show how AI can address the shortcomings of traditional radar signal processing in distinguishing moving and stationary objects to bolster autonomous vehicle perception.\n\nTraditional radar processing bounces radar signals off of objects in the environment and analyzes the strength and density of reflections that come back. If a sufficiently strong and dense cluster of reflections comes back, classical radar processing can determine this is likely some kind of large object. If that cluster also happens to be moving over time, then that object is probably a car.\nWhile this approach can work well for inferring a moving vehicle, the same may not be true for a stationary one. In this case, the object produces a dense cluster of reflections, but doesn\u2019t move. According to classical radar processing, this means the object could be a railing, a broken down car, a highway overpass or some other object. The approach often has no way of distinguishing which.\nIntroducing Radar DNN\nOne way to overcome the limitations of this approach is with AI in the form of a deep neural network (DNN).\nSpecifically, we trained a DNN to detect moving and stationary objects, as well as accurately distinguish between different types of stationary obstacles, using data from radar sensors.\nTraining the DNN first required overcoming radar data sparsity problems. Since radar reflections can be quite sparse, it\u2019s practically infeasible for humans to visually identify and label vehicles from radar data alone.\nFigure 1. Example of propagating bounding box labels for cars from the lidar data domain into the radar data domain.\nLidar, however, can create a 3D image of surrounding objects using laser pulses. Thus, ground truth data for the DNN was created by propagating bounding box labels from the corresponding lidar dataset onto the radar data as shown in Figure 1. In this way, the ability of a human labeler to visually identify and label cars from lidar data is effectively transferred into the radar domain.\nMoreover, through this process, the radar DNN not only learns to detect cars, but also their 3D shape, dimensions and orientation, which classical methods cannot easily do.\nWith this additional information, the radar DNN is able to distinguish between different types of obstacles \u2014 even if they\u2019re stationary \u2014 increase confidence of true positive detections, and reduce false positive detections.\nThe higher confidence 3D perception results from the radar DNN in turn enables AV prediction, planning and control software to make better driving decisions, particularly in challenging scenarios. For radar, classically difficult problems like accurate shape and orientation estimation, detecting stationary vehicles as well as vehicles under highway overpasses become feasible with far fewer failures.\nThe radar DNN output is integrated smoothly with classical radar processing. Together, these two components form the basis of our radar obstacle perception software stack.\nThis stack is designed to both offer full redundancy to camera-based obstacle perception and enable radar-only input to planning and control, as well as enable fusion with camera- or lidar-perception software.\nWith such comprehensive radar perception capabilities, autonomous vehicles can perceive their surroundings with confidence.\nTo learn more about the software functionality we\u2019re building, check out the rest of our DRIVE Labs series.\n\n\nCategories: DRIVE Labs | DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I wanted to be a hair stylist as a kid, which is also cool, but AI is clearly important for our future!\u201d said Paige. \u201cEverything changed in my freshman year, when I heard about the AI Pathways Institute.\u201d\nThe initiative, known as AIPI for short, began in 2019 as a three-week pilot program offered by Boys & Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania (BGCWPA). Paige was in the first cohort of 40 youth to attend AIPI, which also included Tomi Oalore (left) and Makiyah Carrington (right), shown above.\nPaige Frank, robotics enthusiast and BGCWPA teen mentor\nBuilding on the success of that program, NVIDIA and BGCWPA this week have entered into a three-year partnership with the goal of expanding access to AI education to more students, particularly those from underserved and underrepresented communities.\nCore to the collaboration is the creation of an AI Pathways Toolkit to make it easy for Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide and other education-focused organizations to deliver the curriculum to their participants.\n\u201cAt first it was hard. But once we understood AI fundamentals from the AIPI coursework that the staff at BGCWPA taught and by using the NVIDIA Jetson online videos, it all began to come together,\u201d said Paige. \u201cLearning robotics hands-on with the Jetson Nano made it much easier. And it was exciting to actually see our programming in action as the Jetbot robot navigated the maze we created for the project.\u201d\nNew AI Pathways to the Future\nAI is spreading rapidly. But a major challenge to developing AI skills is access to hands-on learning and adequate computing resources. The AI Pathways Toolkit aims to make AI and robotics curriculum accessible for all students, even those without previous coding experience. It\u2019s meant to prepare \u2014 and inspire \u2014 more students, like Paige, to see themselves as builders of our AI future.\nAnother obstacle to AI skills development can be perception. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that excited at first \u2014 there\u2019s this thing that it\u2019s too nerdy,\u201d commented Paige, who says most of her friends felt similarly. \u201cBut once you get into coding and see how things work on the Jetbot, it\u2019s real fun.\u201d\nShe sees this transformation in action at her new internship as a mentor with the BGCWPA, where she helps kids get started with AI and coding. \u201cEven kids who aren\u2019t that involved at first really get into it. It\u2019s so inspiring,\u201d she said.\nBoys & Girls on an AI Mission\nComprising 14 clubhouses and two Career Works Centers, BGCWPA offers programs, services and outreach that serve more than 12,000 youth ages 4-18 across the region. The AIPI is a part of its effort to provide young people with the tools needed to activate and advance their potential.\nWith support from NVIDIA, BGCWPA developed the initial three-week AIPI summer camp to introduce local high school students to AI and machine learning. Its curriculum was developed by BGCWPA Director of STEM Education Christine Nguyen and representatives from Carnegie Mellon University using NVIDIA\u2019s educational materials, including the Jetson AI Specialist certification program.\nThe pilot in 2019 included two local summer camps with a focus on historically underrepresented communities encompassing six school districts. The camp attendees also created a hands-on project using the award-winning Jetson Nano developer kit and Jetbot robotics toolkit.\n\u201cWe know how important it is to provide all students with opportunities to impact the future of technology,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to utilize the NVIDIA Jetson AI certification materials with our students as they work toward being leaders in the fields of AI and robotics.\u201d\nStudents earned a stipend in a work-based learning experience, and all of the participants demonstrated knowledge gained in the \u201cFive Big Ideas in AI,\u201d a framework created by AI4K12, a group working to develop guidelines for K-12 AI education. They also got to visit companies and see AI in action, learn human-centered design and present a capstone project that focused on a social problem they wanted to solve with AI.\n\u201cWith the support of NVIDIA, we\u2019re helping students from historically underrepresented communities build confidence and skills in the fields of AI, ML and robotics,\u201d said Lisa Abel-Palmieri, Ph.D., president and CEO of BGCWPA. \u201cStudents are encouraged to develop personal and professional connections with a diverse group of peers who share similar passions. We also equip participants with the vital knowledge and tools to implement technology that addresses bias in AI and benefits society as a whole.\u201d\nFrom Summer Camp to Yearlong Program\nHelping youth get started on a pathway to careers in AI and robotics has become an urgent need. Moreover, learning to develop AI applications requires real-world skills and resources that are often scarce in underserved and underrepresented communities.\nNVIDIA\u2019s partnership with BGCWPA includes a funding grant and access to technical resources, enabling the group to continue to develop a new AI Pathways Toolkit and open-source curriculum supported by staff tools and training.\nThe curriculum scales the summer camp model into a yearlong program that creates a pathway for students to gain AI literacy through hands-on development with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Jetbot kits. And the tools and training will make it easy for educators, including the Boys & Clubs\u2019 Youth Development Professionals, to deliver the curriculum to their students.\nThe toolkit, when completed, will be made available to the network of Boys & Girls Clubs across the U.S., with the goal of implementing the program at 80 clubs by the middle of 2024. The open-source curriculum will also be available to other organizations interested in implementing AI education programs around the world.\nAs for Paige\u2019s future plans: \u201cI want to strengthen my coding skills and become a Python pro. I also would like to start a robotics club at my high school. And I definitely want to pursue computer science in college. I have a lot of goals,\u201d she said.\nBoys & Girls Club Joins AI Educators at GTC21\nAbel-Palmieri was a featured panelist at a special event at GTC21 last week. With a record 1,600+ sessions this year, GTC offers a wealth of content \u2014 from getting started with AI for those new to the field, to advanced sessions for developers deploying real-world robotics applications. Register for free to view on-demand replays.\nJoining Abel-Palmieri on the panel, \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader Who Knows AI?\u201d (SE2802), were Babak Mostaghimi, assistant superintendent of Curriculum, Instructional Support and Innovation for Gwinnett County Public Schools of Suwanee, Georgia; Jim Gibbs, CEO of Meter Feeder; Justin \u201cMr. Fascinate\u201d Shaifer; and Maynard Okereke (a.k.a. Hip Hop MD) from STEM Success Summit.\nFree GTC sessions to help students learn the basics of AI or brush up robotics skills include:\n\nJetson 101: Learning Edge AI Fundamentals (S32700)\nBuild Edge AI Projects with the Jetson Community (S32750)\nOptimizing for Edge AI on Jetson (S32354)\n\nMany GTC hands-on sessions are designed to help educators learn and teach AI, including: \u201cDuckietown on NVIDIA Jetson: Hands-On AI in the Classroom\u201d with ETH Zurich (S32637) and \u201cHands-On Deep Learning Robotics Curriculum in High Schools with Jetson Nano\u201d with CAVEDU Education (S32702).\nNVIDIA has also launched the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit Grant Program with a goal to further democratize AI and robotics. The new program offers limited quantities of Jetson Developer Kits to professors, educators and trainers across the globe.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Education | Embedded Computing | GTC 2021 | Jetson | Open Source \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Announced at GTC, the eighth-generation Hyperion platform includes the sensors, high-performance compute and software necessary for autonomous vehicle development, all verified, calibrated and synchronized right out of the box.\nDeveloping an AV \u2014 essentially a data center on wheels \u2014 requires an entirely new process. Both the hardware and software must be comprehensively tested and validated to ensure they can handle not only the real-time processing for autonomous driving, but also withstand the harsh conditions of daily driving.\nHyperion is a fully operational, production-ready and open autonomous vehicle platform that cuts down the massive amount of time and cost required to outfit vehicles with the technology required for AI features and autonomous driving.\nWhat\u2019s Included\nHyperion comes with all the hardware needed to validate an autonomous driving system at the highest levels of performance.\nAt its core, two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) provide ample compute for level\u00a04 self-driving and intelligent cockpit capabilities. These SoCs process data from a halo of 12 exterior cameras, three interior cameras, nine radars and two lidar sensors in real time for safe autonomous operation.\nHyperion also includes all the tools necessary to evaluate the NVIDIA DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software stack, as well as real-time record and capture capabilities for streamlined driving data processing.\nAnd this entire toolset is synchronized and calibrated precisely for 3D data collection, giving developers valuable time back in setting up and running autonomous vehicle test drives.\nSeamless Integration\nWith much of the industry leveraging NVIDIA DRIVE Orin for in-vehicle compute, DRIVE Hyperion is the next step for full autonomous vehicle development and validation.\nBy including a complete sensor setup on top of centralized compute, Hyperion provides everything needed to validate an intelligent vehicle\u2019s hardware on the road. And with its compatibility with the NVIDIA DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software stacks, Hyperion is also a critical platform for evaluating and validating self-driving software.\nPlus, it\u2019s already streamlining critical self-driving research and development. Institutions such as the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and Stanford University are leveraging the current generation of Hyperion in autonomous vehicle research pilots.\nDevelopers can begin leveraging the latest open platform soon \u2014 the eighth generation of Hyperion will be available to the NVIDIA DRIVE ecosystem later in 2021.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This follows the addition of DLSS to 9 other games this year, and the launch of the Unreal Engine 4 plugin, which enables developers to add DLSS to their titles with less than a day\u2019s work.\nThis month, the games adding DLSS include Call of Duty: Warzone, one of the planet\u2019s most popular battle royale multiplayer shooters, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Naraka: Bladepoint, Outriders, and Mortal Shell.\nBy enabling NVIDIA DLSS in each, frame rates are greatly accelerated, giving you smoother gameplay and the headroom to enable higher-quality effects and rendering resolutions.\nFor gamers, only GeForce RTX GPUs feature the Tensor Cores that power DLSS, and with DLSS now available in over 40 titles and counting, GeForce RTX offers the fastest frame rates in leading triple-A titles and indie darlings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone & Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Add NVIDIA DLSS Today\nCall of Duty: Warzone is Activision\u2019s phenomenally popular free-to-play, continually-updated battle royale shooter, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remains one of the most popular online multiplayer games out there. With the release of the Call of Duty update today, you can enable NVIDIA DLSS in Call of Duty: Warzone, Modern Warfare\u2019s multiplayer modes, and Modern Warfare\u2019s co-op Spec Ops mode.\nBy enabling NVIDIA DLSS in the options menu, you\u2019ll boost performance on GeForce RTX graphics cards by up to 70% at 4K. Alternatively, reinvest the extra performance in higher detail levels and higher rendering resolutions, which will help you spot distant targets, and make gameplay prettier and more immersive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is now available for use in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\u2019s campaign, as well as in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\u2019s Zombies, multiplayer and campaign modes, enabling GeForce RTX gamers to maximize performance in the full slate of currently available Call of Duty modes.\nTo see NVIDIA DLSS in action in Call of Duty: Warzone, check out our new video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Heading To Unity This Year\nUnity is one of the most used game engines amongst developers.

It also enables personalization in the vehicle, learning from individual driving habits and preferences while continuously improving from fleet data.\nThe Orin-powered supercomputer will debut in the flagship ET7 sedan, scheduled for production in 2022, and will be in every NIO model to follow.\n\nBreakout EV maker Li Auto will also develop its next generation of electric vehicles using NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin. These new vehicles are being developed in collaboration with tier 1 supplier Desay SV and feature advanced autonomous driving features, as well as extended battery range for truly intelligent mobility.\nThis high-performance platform will enable Li Auto to deploy an independent, advanced autonomous driving system with its upcoming fleet.\n\nXpeng is already putting its advanced driving technology on the road. In March, the automaker completed a six-day cross-country autonomous drive with a fleet of intelligent P7 sedans. The vehicles operated without human intervention using the XPilot 3.0 autonomous driving system, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier.\n\nFinally, one of the world\u2019s largest automakers, SAIC, is evolving to meet the industry\u2019s biggest technological transformations with two new EV brands packed with advanced AI features.\nR-Auto is a family of next-generation vehicles featuring the R-Tech advanced intelligent assistant, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin. R-Tech uses the unprecedented level of compute performance of Orin to run perception, sensor fusion and prediction for automated driving features in real time.\nThe ultra-premium IM brand is the product of a partnership with etail giant Alibaba. The long-range electric vehicles will feature AI capabilities powered by the high-performance, energy-efficient NVIDIA DRIVE Orin compute platform.\n\nThe first two vehicles in the lineup \u2014 a flagship sedan and SUV \u2014 will have autonomous parking and other automated driving features, as well as a 93kWh battery that comes standard. SAIC will begin taking orders for the sedan at the Shanghai Auto Show later this month, with the SUV following in 2022.\nEVs are driving the next decade of transportation. And with NVIDIA DRIVE at the core, these vehicles have the intelligence and performance to go the distance.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Energy | GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Plus Fortnite And Valorant Receive Further Latency Reduction\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                     By Andrew Burnes on April 06, 2021\n                \n\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFeatured Stories\nNVIDIA Reflex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex is already improving responsiveness in over a dozen games, including 7 of the top 10 competitive shooters. Today, we\u2019re announcing the launch of NVIDIA Reflex in Overwatch, plus the addition of Reflex in Rust and GhostRunner.\nNVIDIA Reflex will instantly reduce system latency in each game in GPU bound scenarios, enabling you to see enemies sooner, your shots to fire faster after clicking the mouse, and your shots to have a higher chance of hitting the target.\nThis month also sees the introduction of a new NVIDIA Reflex optimization in Fortnite and Valorant, which further reduces system latency in CPU bound scenarios, along with the addition of new features to GeForce Experience for the Reflex Latency Analyzer, and the launch of new mice and a new 360Hz monitor that are compatible with the Reflex Latency Analyzer.\nFor all the details, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwatch: NVIDIA Reflex Available Now\nNVIDIA Reflex support has moved from public test region to the live version of Overwatch, reducing system latency by up to 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNVIDIA Reflex is a game-changer with up to 50% less system latency.\u201d \u2013 John Lafleur, Overwatch Technical Director\nGet the full lowdown on Overwatch\u2019s NVIDIA Reflex integration in our dedicated article, and check out the tech in action in our new slow-mo video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex Coming To Rust\nFacepunch Studios\u2019 phenomenally successful Rust attracts ever more gamers to its high-stakes servers month after month, where everything and everyone is a threat to your survival. Sleep with one eye open, because a raid can occur at any time, and keep your head on a swivel when exploring, resource harvesting, and stalking enemy players.\nWith just a few hits being deadly, you want the fastest possible response times, your shots to land on the target, and your actions to occur that bit quicker than the enemy\u2019s. Enter NVIDIA Reflex, which is coming soon to Rust for all gamers with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU.\n\"I'm excited to have NVIDIA Reflex integrated into Rust. In Rust everyone wants you dead, reduced latency with Reflex will make sure you're staying ahead of the competition. It's as simple as enabling Reflex through the options menu.\" - Helk, Rust's Project Lead, Designer & Programmer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhostrunner To Introduce NVIDIA Reflex\nOne More Level\u2019s Ghostrunner is a unique high-stakes first-person single-player game where one hit leads to death. Navigate high-fidelity ray-traced worlds, accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS, and tackle combat arenas with nothing more than your sword, your wits, and some special abilities. As you play, you\u2019ll soon find yourself gracefully dashing and sliding, deflecting bullets with well-timed sword slashes, and speed running like a pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further improve your reactions and the fluidity of the gameplay, Ghostrunner is adding NVIDIA Reflex in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortnite and Valorant NVIDIA Reflex Boost Mode Gets An Upgrade\nWe\u2019re constantly updating and improving our tech through the launch of new Game Ready Drivers, new software development kits, and other advancements. Today it\u2019s NVIDIA Reflex\u2019s turn to be enhanced, with the release of a new enhancement for \u201cBoost Mode\u201d.\nEach NVIDIA Reflex game includes \u201cOn\u201d and \u201cBoost Mode\u201d, which players can opt to enable. Boost Mode increases GPU clock speeds in CPU-bound scenarios, allowing the GPU to submit frames to the display faster, thereby improving Reflex\u2019s effectiveness.\nWith a new NVIDIA Reflex SDK update, Boost Mode further reduces system latency in certain CPU-bound scenarios where the render submission thread is the limiting factor. These types of CPU bound scenarios can occur when there are many objects to render on the screen at once.\nBoost optimization is now available in Fortnite, and gamers in these CPU bound situations can see up to a 16% latency reduction. Valorant\u2019s Boost optimization will be coming in a future patch. Based on pre-release testing, gamers could see up to a 15% lower latency in these CPU-bound scenarios:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS and Corsair Launch New Reflex Latency Analyzer-Compatible Mice\nTo help competitive gamers measure and optimize end to end system latency, we created the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer. Using hardware and software built into mice and monitors, input lag can now easily be measured, allowing you to optimize your setup for the lowest possible system latency.\nAlready, there are a number of mice that support this technology, and now ASUS and Corsair have launched four new Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible mice:\n\nASUS ROG KERIS WIRED\nASUS ROG KERIS WIRELESS\nCORSAIR SABRE PRO CHAMPION SERIES\nCORSAIR SABRE RGB PRO CHAMPION SERIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, several previously announced mice now have firmware updates available to enable Reflex Latency Analyzer:\n\nAOPEN Fire Legend GM310\nAcer Predator Cestus 350\nRazer Deathadder v2 Pro\n\nOnce your mouse firmware has been updated, per click latency metrics will be available with Reflex Latency Analyzer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer Predator X25 360Hz Esports Monitor with Reflex Latency Analyzer Now Available\n360Hz esports-class gaming monitors help you achieve the fastest response times, reduce latency, and give you the clearest gaming possible thanks to the hyper speed refresh rates.

By centralizing control of these core domains, Orin can replace these components and simplify what has been an incredibly complex supply chain for automakers.\n\u201cThe future is one central computer \u2014 four domains, virtualized and isolated, architected for functional safety and security, software-defined and upgradeable for the life of the car \u2014 in addition to super-smart AI and beautiful graphics,\u201d Huang said.\nSecure Computing for Every Need\nManaging a system with multiple complex applications is incredibly difficult. And when it comes to automotive, safety is critical.\nDRIVE Orin supports multiple operating systems, including Linux, QNX and Android, to enable this wide range of applications. As a high-performance compute platform architected for the highest level of safety, it does so in a way that is secure, virtualized and accelerated.\nThe digital cluster, driver monitoring system and AV confidence view are all crucial to ensuring the safety of a vehicle\u2019s occupants. Each must be functionally secure, with the ability to update each application individually without requiring a system reboot.\nDRIVE Orin is designed for software-defined operation, meaning it\u2019s purpose-built to handle these continuous upgrades throughout the life of the vehicle.\nThe Highest Levels of Confidence\nAs vehicles become more and more autonomous, visualization within the cabin will be critical for building trust with occupants. And with the DRIVE Orin platform, manufacturers can integrate enhanced capability into their fleets over the life of their vehicles.\nThe confidence view is a rendering of the mind of the vehicle\u2019s AI. It shows exactly what the sensor suite and perception system are detecting in real time and constructs it into a 3D surround model.\nBy incorporating this view in the cabin interior, the vehicle can communicate the accuracy and reliability of the autonomous driving system at every step of the journey. And occupants can gain a better understanding of how the vehicle\u2019s AI sees the world.\nAs a high-performance AI compute platform, DRIVE Orin enables this visualization alongside the digital cluster, infotainment, and driver and occupant monitoring, while maintaining enough compute headroom to add new features that delight customers through the life of their vehicles.\nThe ability to support this multi-functionality safely and securely is what makes NVIDIA DRIVE Orin truly central to the next-generation intelligent vehicle experience.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So,\u2026\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\nQuantum computing is a sophisticated approach to making parallel calculations, using the physics that governs subatomic particles to replace the more simplistic transistors in today\u2019s computers.\nQuantum computers calculate using qubits, computing units that can be on, off or any value between, instead of the bits in traditional computers that are either on or off, one or zero. The qubit\u2019s ability to live in the in-between state \u2014 called superposition \u2014 adds a powerful capability to the computing equation, making quantum computers superior for some kinds of math.\nWhat Does a Quantum Computer Do?\nUsing qubits, quantum computers could buzz through calculations that would take classical computers a loooong time \u2014 if they could even finish them.\nFor example, today\u2019s computers use eight bits to represent any number between 0 and 255. Thanks to features like superposition, a quantum computer can use eight qubits to represent every number between 0 and 255, simultaneously.\nIt\u2019s a feature like parallelism in computing: All possibilities are computed at once rather than sequentially, providing tremendous speedups.\nSo, while a classical computer steps through long division calculations one at a time to factor a humongous number, a quantum computer can get the answer in a single step. Boom!\nThat means quantum computers could reshape whole fields, like cryptography, that are based on factoring what are today impossibly large numbers.\nA Big Role for Tiny Simulations\nThat could be just the start. Some experts believe quantum computers will bust through limits that now hinder simulations in chemistry, materials science and anything involving worlds built on the nano-sized bricks of quantum mechanics.\nQuantum computers could even extend the life of semiconductors by helping engineers create more refined simulations of the quantum effects they\u2019re starting to find in today\u2019s smallest transistors.\nIndeed, experts say quantum computers ultimately won\u2019t replace classical computers, they\u2019ll complement them. And some predict quantum computers will be used as accelerators much as GPUs accelerate today\u2019s computers.\nHow Does Quantum Computing Work?\nDon\u2019t expect to build your own quantum computer like a DIY PC with parts scavenged from discount bins at the local electronics shop.\nThe handful of systems operating today typically require refrigeration that creates working environments just north of absolute zero. They need that computing arctic to handle the fragile quantum states that power these systems.\nIn a sign of how hard constructing a quantum computer can be, one prototype suspends an atom between two lasers to create a qubit. Try that in your home workshop!\nQuantum computing takes nano-Herculean muscles to create something called entanglement. That\u2019s when two or more qubits exist in a single quantum state, a condition sometimes measured by electromagnetic waves just a millimeter wide.\nCrank up that wave with a hair too much energy and you lose entanglement or superposition, or both. The result is a noisy state called decoherence, the equivalent in quantum computing of the blue screen of death.\nWhat\u2019s the Outlook for Quantum Computing?\nA handful of companies such as Alibaba, Google, Honeywell, IBM, IonQ and Xanadu operate early versions of quantum computers today.\nToday they provide tens of qubits. But qubits can be noisy, making them sometimes unreliable. To tackle real-world problems reliably, systems need tens or hundreds of thousands of qubits.\nExperts believe it could be a couple decades before we get to a high-fidelity era when quantum computers are truly useful.\nQuantum computers are slowly moving toward commercial use. (Source: ISSCC 2017 talk by Lieven Vandersypen.)\nPredictions of when we reach so-called quantum computing supremacy \u2014 the time when quantum computers execute tasks classical ones can\u2019t \u2014 is a matter of lively debate in the industry.\nAccelerating Quantum Circuit Simulations Today\nThe good news is the world of AI and machine learning put a spotlight on accelerators like GPUs, which can perform many of the types of operations quantum computers would calculate with qubits.\nSo, classical computers are already finding ways to host quantum simulations with GPUs today. For example, NVIDIA ran a leading-edge quantum simulation on Selene, our in-house AI supercomputer.\nNVIDIA announced in the GTC keynote the cuQuantum SDK to speed quantum circuit simulations running on GPUs. Early work suggests cuQuantum will be able to deliver orders of magnitude speedups.\nThe SDK takes an agnostic approach, providing a choice of tools users can pick to best fit their approach. For example, the state vector method provides high-fidelity results, but its memory requirements grow exponentially with the number of qubits.\nThat creates a practical limit of roughly 50 qubits on today\u2019s largest classical supercomputers. Nevertheless we\u2019ve seen great results (below) using cuQuantum to accelerate quantum circuit simulations that use this method.\nState vector: 1,000 circuits, 36 qubits, depth m=10, complex 64 | CPU: Qiskit on dual AMD EPYC 7742 | GPU: Qgate on DGX A100\nResearchers from the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre will provide a deep dive on their work with the state vector method in session E31941 at GTC (free with registration).\nA newer approach, tensor network simulations, use less memory and more computation to perform similar work.\nUsing this method, NVIDIA and Caltech accelerated a state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulator with cuQuantum running on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. It generated a sample from a full-circuit simulation of the Google Sycamore circuit in 9.3 minutes on Selene, a task that 18 months ago experts thought would take days using millions of CPU cores.\nTensor Network \u2013 53 qubits, depth m=20 | CPU: Quimb on Dual AMD EPYC 7742 estimated | GPU: Quimb on DGX-A100\n\u201cUsing the Cotengra/Quimb packages, NVIDIA\u2019s newly announced cuQuantum SDK, and the Selene supercomputer, we\u2019ve generated a sample of the Sycamore quantum circuit at depth m=20 in record time \u2014 less than 10 minutes,\u201d said Johnnie Gray, a research scientist at Caltech.\n\u201cThis sets the benchmark for quantum circuit simulation performance and will help advance the field of quantum computing by improving our ability to verify the behavior of quantum circuits,\u201d said Garnet Chan, a chemistry professor at Caltech whose lab hosted the work.\nNVIDIA expects the performance gains and ease of use of cuQuantum will make it a foundational element in every quantum computing framework and simulator at the cutting edge of this research.\nSign up to show early interest in cuQuantum.\nLearn more about quantum computing on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: ExplainerTags: GTC 2021 | High-Performance Computing | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Research | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And NVIDIA virtual GPU (vGPU) performance has become essential to powering a wide range of graphics- and compute-intensive workloads from the cloud and data center.\nNow, designers, engineers and knowledge workers across industries can experience accelerated performance with the NVIDIA A10 and A16 GPUs.\nBased on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, A10 and A16 deliver more power, memory and user density to boost any workflow, from graphics and AI to VDI. And when combined with NVIDIA vGPU software, the new GPUs greatly improve user experience, performance and flexibility.\nA10 Delivers Powerful, Flexible Virtual Workstation Performance\nProfessionals are increasingly using advanced technologies like real-time ray tracing, AI, compute, simulation and virtual reality for their work. But to run these workflows, and with employee mobility crucial today, they require more power and flexibility to work from anywhere.\nThe NVIDIA A10 combined with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation software delivers the performance to efficiently power these complex workflows while ensuring employees get the best user experience possible.\nWith virtual workstations powered by the A10, businesses can deliver enhanced graphics and video with AI-accelerated applications from mainstream enterprise servers.\nSince the A10 can support graphics and AI workloads on virtualized infrastructure, data center administrators can flexibly provision resources and take advantage of any underutilized compute power to run AI inference or VDI workloads.\nThe A10 combines second-generation RT Cores and third-generation Tensor Cores to enrich graphics and video applications with powerful AI. It\u2019s built specifically for graphics, media and game developer workstations, delivering 2.5x faster graphics performance and over 2.5x the inference performance compared to the previous generation NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU.\nUsers can also run inference workloads on the A10 with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and achieve bare-metal performance. The A10 includes new streaming microprocessors with 24GB of GDDR6 memory, enabling versatile graphics, rendering, AI and compute performance. The single-wide, full-height, full-length PCIe form factor enables GPU server density, often five to six GPUs per server.\n\nA16 Enhances VDI User Experience for Remote Workers\nWith the rising adoption of web conferencing and video collaboration tools, the remote work environment is here to stay. According to an IDC survey, 87 percent of U.S. enterprises expect their employees to continue working from home three or more days per week once mandatory pandemic closures are lifted.(1)\nKnowledge workers use multiple devices and monitors to efficiently do their work.

A veritable data center on wheels, Atlan centralizes the vehicle\u2019s entire compute infrastructure into a single system-on-a-chip.\nWhile vehicles are packing in more and more compute technology, they\u2019re lacking the physical security that comes with data center-level processing. Atlan is a technical marvel for safe and secure AI computing, fusing all of NVIDIA\u2019s technologies in AI, automotive, robotics, safety and BlueField data centers.\nThe next-generation platform will achieve an unprecedented 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance and an estimated SPECint score of more than 100 (SPECrate2017_int) \u2014 greater than the total compute in most robotaxis today. Atlan is also the first SoC to be equipped with an NVIDIA BlueField data processing unit (DPU) for trusted security, advanced networking and storage services.\nWhile Atlan will not be available for a couple of years, software development is well underway. Like NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, the next-gen platform is software compatible with previous DRIVE compute platforms, allowing customers to leverage their existing investments across multiple product generations.\n\u201cTo achieve higher levels of autonomy in more conditions, the number of sensors and their resolutions will continue to increase,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAI models will get more sophisticated. There will be more redundancy and safety functionality. We\u2019re going to need all of the computing we can get.\u201d\nAdvancing Performance at Light Speed\nAutonomous vehicle technology is developing faster than it has in previous years, and the core AI compute must advance in lockstep to support this critical progress.\nCars and trucks of the future will require an optimized AI architecture not only for autonomous driving, but also for intelligent vehicle features like speech recognition and driver monitoring. Upcoming software-defined vehicles will be able to converse with occupants: answering questions, providing directions and warning of road conditions ahead.\nAtlan is able to deliver more than 1,000 TOPS \u2014 a 4x gain over the previous generation \u2014 by leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPU architecture, new Arm CPU cores and deep learning and computer vision accelerators.The platform architecture provides ample compute horsepower for the redundant and diverse deep neural networks that will power future AI vehicles and leaves headroom for developers to continue adding features and improvements.\nThis high-performance platform will run autonomous vehicle, intelligent cockpit and traditional infotainment applications concurrently.\nA Guaranteed Shield with BlueField\nLike every generation of NVIDIA DRIVE, Atlan is designed with the highest level of safety and security.\nAs a data-center-infrastructure-on-a-chip, the NVIDIA BlueField DPU is architected to handle the complex compute and AI workloads required for autonomous vehicles. By combining the industry-leading ConnectX network adapter with an array of Arm cores, BlueField offers purpose-built hardware acceleration engines with full programmability to deliver zero-trust security to prevent data breaches and cyberattacks.\nThis secure architecture will extend the safety and reliability of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform for vehicle generations to come. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin vehicle production timelines start in 2022, and Atlan will follow, sampling in 2023 and slated for 2025 production vehicles.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils AI-Q Blueprint to Connect AI Agents for the Future of Work\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Unveils Open Physical AI Dataset to Advance Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Development\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNew NVIDIA Software for Blackwell Infrastructure Runs AI Factories at Light Speed\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These forward-looking manufacturers are set to transform the way we move with safer, more efficient vehicles for everyday mobility.\n\nThe world moves 2 trillion miles a year. With some of those miles traveled through a mobility service, the opportunity for innovation is tremendous.\nRobotaxis are fully autonomous vehicles that can operate without human supervision in geofenced areas, such as cities or residential communities. With a set of high-resolution sensors and a supercomputing platform in place of a driver, they can safely operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nCurrently, the industry is working to roll out level 2+ AI-assisted driving features in private vehicles, with experts forecasting level 4 vehicles arriving later this decade.\nAnd as a safer alternative to current modes of transit, robotaxis are expected to draw quick adoption once deployed at scale, making up more than 5 percent of vehicle miles traveled worldwide by 2030.\nAchieving this mobility revolution requires centralized, high-performance compute. The amount of sensor data a robotaxi needs to process is 100 times greater than today\u2019s most advanced vehicles. The complexity in software also increases exponentially, with an array of redundant and diverse deep neural networks running simultaneously as part of an integrated software stack.\nNVIDIA is the only company that enables this level of AI development from end to end, which is why virtually every robotaxi maker and supplier is using its GPU-powered offerings.\nRedesigning the Wheel\nSome companies are approaching robotaxi development from square one, introducing entirely new vehicles purpose-built for autonomous ride-hailing.\nCruise, the San Francisco self-driving company, unveiled the Cruise Origin robotaxi in early 2020. The all-electric, self-driving, shared vehicle was purpose-built in partnership with GM and Honda to transform what it means to travel and commute in a city.\nCruise leverages the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA DRIVE GPUs to process the massive amounts of data its fleet collects on San Francisco\u2019s chaotic streets in real time. The result is a safer, cleaner and more efficient transportation alternative for city dwellers.\n\u201cIn a single day we ingest and process what would be equivalent to multiple Netflix libraries,\u201d said Mo ElShenawy, senior vice president of engineering at Cruise during a GTC session. \u201cWith NVIDIA DRIVE GPUs, we\u2019re able to use this data to catch our robotaxis up with human evolution.\u201d\n\nIn December, robotaxi maker Zoox took the wraps off its rider-focused autonomous vehicle. It features four-wheel steering, allowing it to pull into tight curb spaces without parallel parking. The vehicle is also bidirectional, so there is no fixed front or back end. It can pull forward into a driveway and forward out onto the road without reversing. In the case of an unexpected road closure, the vehicle can simply flip directions or use four-wheel steering to turn around. No reversing required.\nInside the vehicle, carriage seating facilitates clear visibility of the vehicle\u2019s surroundings as well as socializing. Each seat has the same amount of space and delivers the same experience \u2014 there\u2019s no bad seat in the house. Carriage seating also makes room for a wider aisle, allowing passengers to easily pass by each other without getting up or contorting into awkward positions.\n\nZoox was able to optimize this robotaxi design with centralized, high-performance compute built on NVIDIA DRIVE.\n\u201cWorking with NVIDIA, that\u2019s allowed us to get a couple of orders more magnitude of computation done with the same amount of power, just over the last decade, and that makes a lot of difference,\u201d said Zoox CTO Jesse Levinson during a GTC session.\nMoving the World\nThese companies are also delivering autonomous innovation worldwide.\nThis past year, self-driving startup AutoX launched a commercial autonomous ride-hailing service in Shenzhen, China.\nThe 100-vehicle AutoX fleet uses the NVIDIA DRIVE platform for AI compute, achieving up to 2,000 trillion operations per second to power the numerous redundant and deep neural networks for full self-driving.\n\nBased in the United Kingdom, Oxbotica has developed a \u201cUniversal Autonomy\u201d platform that enables companies to build a variety of autonomous vehicles, including robotaxis. Its upcoming Selenium platform leverages NVIDIA DRIVE Orin to achieve level 4 self-driving capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is developing level 4 autonomous vehicles for its mobility services using NVIDIA DRIVE and AI technology. Delivering 10 billion passenger trips per year, DiDi is working toward the safe, large-scale application of autonomous driving technology.\n\nNVIDIA Inception member Pony.AI is collaborating with global automakers such as Toyota and Hyundai, developing a robotaxi fleet with the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform at its core.\n\nWith the power of NVIDIA DRIVE, these robotaxi companies can continue to roll out this transformative technology to more consumers, ushering in a new age in mobility.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These models, equally adept at learning the syntactic rules to describe chemistry as they are at learning the grammar of languages, are finding applications across research domains and modalities.\nNVIDIA is collaborating with AstraZeneca on a transformer-based generative AI model for chemical structures used in drug discovery that will be among the very first projects to run on Cambridge-1, which is soon to go online as the UK\u2019s largest supercomputer. The model will be open sourced, available to researchers and developers in the NVIDIA NGC software catalog, and deployable in the NVIDIA Clara Discovery platform for computational drug discovery.\nSeparately, UF Health is harnessing NVIDIA\u2019s state-of-the-art Megatron framework and BioMegatron pre-trained model \u2014 available on NGC \u2014 to develop GatorTron, the largest clinical language model to date.\nNew NGC applications include AtacWorks, a deep learning model that identifies accessible regions of DNA, and MELD, a tool for inferring the structure of biomolecules from sparse, ambiguous or noisy data.\nMegatron Model for Molecular Insights\nThe MegaMolBART drug discovery model being developed by NVIDIA and AstraZeneca is slated for use in reaction prediction, molecular optimization and de novo molecular generation. It\u2019s based on AstraZeneca\u2019s MolBART transformer model and is being trained on the ZINC chemical compound database \u2014 using NVIDIA\u2019s Megatron framework to enable massively scaled-out training on supercomputing infrastructure.\nThe large ZINC database allows researchers to pretrain a model that understands chemical structure, bypassing the need for hand-labeled data. Armed with a statistical understanding of chemistry, the model will be specialized for a number of downstream tasks, including predicting how chemicals will react with each other and generating new molecular structures.\n\u201cJust as AI language models can learn the relationships between words in a sentence, our aim is that neural networks trained on molecular structure data will be able to learn the relationships between atoms in real-world molecules,\u201d said Ola Engkvist, head of molecular AI, discovery sciences, and R&D at AstraZeneca. \u201cOnce developed, this NLP model will be open source, giving the scientific community a powerful tool for faster drug discovery.\u201d\nThe model, trained using NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, gives researchers ideas for molecules that don\u2019t exist in databases but could be potential drug candidates. Computational methods, known as in-silico techniques, allow drug developers to search through more of the vast chemical space and optimize pharmacological properties before shifting to expensive and time-consuming lab testing.\nThis collaboration will use the NVIDIA DGX A100-powered Cambridge-1 and Selene supercomputers to run large workloads at scale. Cambridge-1 is the largest supercomputer in the U.K., ranking No. 3 on the Green500 and No. 29 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful systems. NVIDIA\u2019s Selene supercomputer topped the most recent Green500 and ranks fifth on the TOP500.\nLanguage Models Speed Up Medical Innovation\nUF Health\u2019s GatorTron model \u2014 trained on records from more than 50 million interactions with 2 million patients \u2014 is a breakthrough that can help identify patients for lifesaving clinical trials, predict and alert health teams about life-threatening conditions, and provide clinical decision support to doctors.\n\u201cGatorTron leveraged over a decade of electronic medical records to develop a state-of-the-art model,\u201d said Joseph Glover, provost at the University of Florida, which recently boosted its supercomputing facilities with NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD. \u201cA tool of this scale will enable healthcare researchers to unlock insights and reveal previously inaccessible trends from clinical notes.\u201d\nBeyond clinical medicine, the model also accelerates drug discovery by making it easier to rapidly create patient cohorts for clinical trials and for studying the effect of a certain drug, treatment or vaccine.\nIt was created using BioMegatron, the largest biomedical transformer model ever trained, developed by NVIDIA\u2019s applied deep learning research team using data from the PubMed corpus. BioMegatron is available on NGC through Clara NLP, a collection of NVIDIA Clara Discovery models pretrained on biomedical and clinical text.\n\u201cThe GatorTron project is an exceptional example of the discoveries that happen when experts in academia and industry collaborate using leading-edge artificial intelligence and world-class computing resources,\u201d said David R. Nelson, M.D., senior vice president for health affairs at UF and president of UF Health. \u201cOur partnership with NVIDIA is crucial to UF emerging as a destination for artificial intelligence expertise and development.\u201d\nPowering Drug Discovery Platforms\nNVIDIA Clara Discovery libraries and NVIDIA DGX systems have been adopted by computational drug discovery platforms, too, boosting pharmaceutical research.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger, a leader in chemical simulation software development, today announced a strategic partnership with NVIDIA that includes research in scientific computing and machine learning, optimizing of Schr\u00f6dinger applications on NVIDIA platforms, and a joint solution around NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD to evaluate billions of potential drug compounds within minutes.\nBiotechnology company Recursion has installed BioHive-1, a supercomputer based on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD reference architecture that, as of January, is estimated to rank at No. 58 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful computer systems. BioHive-1 will allow Recursion to run within a day deep learning projects that previously took a week to complete using its existing cluster.\nInsilico Medicine, a partner in the NVIDIA Inception accelerator program, recently announced the discovery of a novel preclinical candidate to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2014 the first example of an AI-designed molecule for a new disease target nominated for clinical trials. Compounds were generated on a system powered by NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, taking less than 18 months and under $2 million from target hypothesis to preclinical candidate selection.\nVyasa Analytics, a member of the NVIDIA Inception accelerator program, is using Clara NLP and NVIDIA DGX systems to give its users access to pretrained models for biomedical research. The company\u2019s GPU-accelerated Vyasa Layar Data Fabric is powering solutions for multi-institutional cancer research, clinical trial analytics and biomedical data harmonization.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s work in healthcare at this week\u2019s GPU Technology Conference, which kicks off with a keynote address by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

This system has been running on GPUs since 2016.\nThat long-standing experience with operational NWP on GPUs will be key to future climate simulations as well \u2014 key not only to modeling long-term changes to climate, but to building models able to more accurately predict extreme weather events, saving lives.\nOne of that team\u2019s goals is to run global climate models with a spatial resolution of 1 km that can map convective clouds such as thunderclouds.\nThe CSCS supercomputer is also used by Swiss scientists for the analysis of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Council for Nuclear Research. It is the Swiss Tier-2 system in the World LHC Computing Grid.\nBased in Geneva, the LHC \u2014 at $9 billion, one of the most expensive scientific instruments ever built \u2014 generates 90 petabytes of data a year.\nAlps uses a new software-defined infrastructure that can support a wide range of projects.\nAs a result, in the future, different teams, such those from MeteoSwiss, will be able to use one or more partitions on a single, unified infrastructure, rather than different machines.\nThese can be virtual ad-hoc clusters for individual users or predefined clusters that research teams can put together with CSCS and then operate themselves.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Featured image source: Steve Evans, from Citizen of the World.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | Hardware | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2021 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur and Lenovo are expected to integrate the GPUs into their highest volume servers starting this summer.\nNVIDIA achieved these results taking advantage of the full breadth of the NVIDIA AI platform \u2015 encompassing a wide range of GPUs and AI software, including TensorRT\u2122 and NVIDIA Triton\u2122 Inference Server \u2015 which is deployed by leading enterprises, such as Microsoft, Pinterest, Postmates, T-Mobile, USPS and WeChat.\n\u201cAs AI continues to transform every industry, MLPerf is becoming an even more important tool for companies to make informed decisions on their IT infrastructure investments,\u201d said Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNow, with every major OEM submitting MLPerf results, NVIDIA and our partners are focusing not only on delivering world-leading performance for AI, but on democratizing AI with a coming wave of enterprise servers powered by our new A30 and A10 GPUs.\u201d\nMLPerf Results\r\nNVIDIA is the only company to submit results for every test in the data center and edge categories, delivering top performance results across all MLPerf workloads.\nSeveral submissions also use Triton Inference Server, which simplifies the complexity of deploying AI in applications by supporting models from all major frameworks, running on GPUs, as well as CPUs, and optimizing for different query types including batch, real-time and streaming. Triton submissions achieved performance close to that of the most optimized GPU implementations, as well as CPU implementations, with comparable configurations.\nNVIDIA also broke new ground with its submissions using the NVIDIA Ampere architecture\u2019s Multi-Instance GPU capability by simultaneously running all seven MLPerf Offline tests on a single GPU using seven MIG instances. The configuration showed nearly identical performance compared with a single MIG instance running alone.\nThese submissions demonstrate MIG\u2019s performance and versatility, which enable infrastructure managers to provision right-sized amounts of GPU compute for specific applications to get maximum output from every data center GPU.\nIn addition to NVIDIA\u2019s own submissions, NVIDIA partners Alibaba Cloud, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro submitted a total of over 360 results using NVIDIA GPUs.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Expanding AI Platform\r\nThe NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs are the latest additions to the NVIDIA AI platform, which includes NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs, NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier\u2122 and Jetson Xavier NX, and a full stack of NVIDIA software optimized for accelerating AI.\nThe A30 delivers versatile performance for industry-standard servers, supporting a broad range of AI inference and mainstream enterprise compute workloads, such as recommender systems, conversational AI and computer vision.\nThe NVIDIA A10 GPU accelerates deep learning inference, interactive rendering, computer-aided design and cloud gaming, enabling enterprises to support mixed AI and graphics workloads on a common infrastructure. Using NVIDIA virtual GPU software, management can be streamlined to improve the utilization and provisioning of virtual desktops used by designers, engineers, artists and scientists.\nThe NVIDIA Jetson platform, based on the NVIDIA Xavier\u2122 system-on-module, provides server-class AI performance at the edge, enabling a wide variety of applications in robotics, healthcare, retail and smart cities. Built on NVIDIA\u2019s unified architecture and the CUDA-X\u2122 software stack, Jetson is the only platform capable of running all the edge workloads in compact designs while consuming less than 30W of power.\nAvailability\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs are available in servers from leading manufacturers and in the cloud from all major cloud service providers. Additionally, A100 GPUs are featured across the NVIDIA DGX\u2122 systems portfolio, including the NVIDIA DGX Station A100, NVIDIA DGX A100 and NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.\nThe A30 and A10, which consume just 165W and 150W, are expected in a wide range of servers starting this summer, including NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 that go through rigorous testing to ensure high performance across a wide range of workloads.\nThe Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson Xavier NX system-on-module are available from distributors globally.\nNVIDIA Triton and NVIDIA TensorRT are both available on NGC\u2122, NVIDIA\u2019s software catalog.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

Deploying Morpheus with security applications takes advantage of NVIDIA AI computing and NVIDIA\u00ae BlueField\u00ae-3 DPUs to provide users the ability to protect their data center from its core to the edge.\n\u201cZero-trust security models demand we monitor every transaction in the data center in real time. This poses a significant technical challenge \u2013 needing to sense intrusion within the server, detecting threats immediately, and operating at the data rate of modern data centers,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA Morpheus combines Mellanox in-server networking and NVIDIA AI to do real-time, all-packet inspection to anticipate threats and eliminate them as they arise.\u201d\nMorpheus, when combined with BlueField DPUs, enables every compute node in the network to serve as a cyber-defense sensor at the edge, letting organizations analyze every packet with line-rate speed without data replication. In contrast, traditional AI security tools typically sample around five percent of network traffic data, leading to threat-detection algorithms based on incomplete models.\nMorpheus applies real-time telemetry, policy enforcement and processing at the edge coupled with AI to analyze more security data without sacrificing cost or performance. Developers can also create their own Morpheus AI skills using deep learning models, leveraging existing IP investments.\nAI-Enabled Security Ecosystem\r\nLeading hardware, software and cybersecurity solutions providers are working closely with NVIDIA to optimize and integrate data center security offerings with the NVIDIA Morpheus AI framework. This includes industry leaders ARIA Cybersecurity Solutions, Cloudflare, F5, Fortinet and Guardicore, along with hybrid-cloud platform providers Canonical, Red Hat and VMware.\n\u201cDefending complex and evolving environments requires constant visibility,\u201d said Adam Mishler, chief information security officer at Best Buy. \u201cProviding real-time, dynamic network maps will help identify areas where we can further strengthen our posture and serve as a foundation for enhancing ML-based anomaly detection. The NVIDIA Morpheus framework helps provide a flexible and scalable platform for anomaly detection capable of adapting with the ever changing cyber-threat landscape.\u201d\n\u201cWith a rapidly expanding attack surface, our tools for advanced detection at the edge are becoming increasingly important,\u201d said Aaron Sant-Miller, a chief data scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton. \u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with NVIDIA to design, develop and deliver portable cyber AI tools that address this need. Morpheus is the foundation for our Cyber Precog Flyaway Kit, an AI-enabled cyber-hunt platform that packs data center compute into a small, ruggedized GPU form factor.\u201d\n\u201cSplunk is excited to collaborate with NVIDIA to uncover more ways to utilize GPU-accelerated deep learning to enhance how we help our joint customers turn their data into doing,\u201d said Tim Tully, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Splunk. \u201cWe look forward to using the Morpheus framework to potentially provide a path for our team to quickly prototype and integrate new capabilities in our platform, as well as offload compute-intensive tasks to GPU architectures to aid our customers.\u201d\nAdditionally, Morpheus is optimized to run on NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 from the world\u2019s leading server manufacturers, including Atos, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, H3C, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo, QCT and Supermicro.\nAvailability\r\nNetworking and cybersecurity developers, software partners, startups and computer manufacturers can apply now for early access to the NVIDIA Morpheus platform.\nTune in to watch Huang\u2019s GTC21 keynote address streaming live on April 12 starting at 8:30 a.m. PT.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and AI.

It is optimized for multi-tenant, cloud-native environments, offering software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking, storage, security and management services at data-center scale.\nOne BlueField-3 DPU delivers the equivalent data center services of up to 300 CPU cores, freeing up valuable CPU cycles to run business-critical applications.\n\u201cModern hyperscale clouds are driving a fundamental new architecture for data centers,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cA new type of processor, designed to process data center infrastructure software, is needed to offload and accelerate the tremendous compute load of virtualization, networking, storage, security and other cloud-native AI services. The time for BlueField DPU has come.\u201d\nBlueField-3 and Morpheus Put Security Everywhere\r\nBlueField-3 DPUs transform traditional infrastructure into \u201czero-trust\u201d environments \u2014 in which every data center user is authenticated \u2014 by offloading and isolating data center infrastructure from business applications. This secures enterprises from cloud to core to edge while increasing efficiency and performance.\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s first 400GbE/NDR DPU, BlueField-3 delivers unmatched networking performance. It features 10x the accelerated compute power of the previous generation, with 16x Arm A78 cores and 4x the acceleration for cryptography. BlueField-3 is also the first DPU to support fifth-generation PCIe and offer time-synchronized data center acceleration.\nBlueField-3 provides real-time network visibility, detection and response for cyber threats and acts as the monitoring, or telemetry, agent for NVIDIA Morpheus, a state-of-the-art, AI-enabled, cloud-native cybersecurity platform, also announced today.\nNVIDIA DOCA SDK 1.0\r\nBlueField-3 takes advantage of NVIDIA DOCA\u2122, the data-center-on-a-chip architecture that gives developers a complete, open software platform for building software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking, storage, security and management applications running on BlueField DPUs.\n\r\nReleased today and available for download, DOCA includes a runtime environment to create, compile and optimize applications for the BlueField DPU; orchestration tools to provision, update and monitor thousands of DPUs across the data center; as well as libraries, APIs and a growing number of applications, such as deep packet inspection and load balancing.\nEcosystem Adoption of NVIDIA DPUs\r\nLeading server manufacturers Dell Technologies, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro are integrating BlueField DPUs into their systems. Cloud service providers across the world are using BlueField DPUs to accelerate workloads, including Baidu, JD.com and UCloud. The BlueField ecosystem is also expanding with BlueField-3 support from leading hybrid cloud platform partners Canonical, Red Hat and VMware; cybersecurity leaders Fortinet, Guardicore and storage providers DDN\u00ae, NetApp and WekaIO; and edge platform providers Cloudflare, F5 and Juniper Networks.\n\u201cRed Hat continues to collaborate with NVIDIA as part of an open ecosystem that accelerates innovation while providing access to the latest hardware innovations for composable infrastructure,\u201d said Chris Wright, chief technology officer of Red Hat. \u201cWe recognize the need to develop advanced solutions for network security and automation and are excited to support BlueField DPUs and the NVIDIA Morpheus AI framework via Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift, industry-leading containers and Kubernetes-powered hybrid cloud platform.\u201d\n\u201cOur mutual customers are racing to harness the power of AI for enterprise applications,\u201d said Lee Caswell, vice president of marketing for the Cloud Platform Business Unit at VMware. \u201cThe vision of enterprise infrastructure powered by the VMware Cloud Foundation and to be certified with the newly announced NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU shows customers a path to improved application performance, a consistent operating model across virtualized and bare-metal environments, along with a new model for delivering zero-trust security without compromising performance.\u201d\nBlueField-2 Now Available\r\nBlueField-3 is fully backward-compatible with BlueField-2, which provides unparalleled performance for offloading, accelerating and isolating data center workloads. BlueField-2 is generally available with dual 100Gb/s Ethernet or InfiniBand network ports and up to eight Arm cores. The BlueField-2 DPU includes accelerators for software-defined storage, networking, security, streaming, line rate TLS/IPSEC cryptography, precision timing for 5G telco and time-synchronized data centers and other cloud infrastructure services.\nAvailability\r\nBlueField-3 is expected to sample in the first quarter of 2022.\nTune in to watch Huang\u2019s GTC21 keynote address streaming live on April 12 starting at 8:30 a.m. PT.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and AI. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and artificial intelligence is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

Rather than requiring in-person meetings or exchanging and iterating on massive files, designers, artists and reviewers can work simultaneously in a virtual world from anywhere, on any device.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise has been in early evaluations with some of the world\u2019s most sophisticated design teams at companies like BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP. It follows the launch three months ago of an open beta for individuals, which has been downloaded by nearly 17,000 users.\n\u201cEvery few decades, technologies converge to enable a whole new thing \u2013 Omniverse is such an invention,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cBuilding on NVIDIA\u2019s entire body of work, Omniverse lets us create and simulate shared virtual 3D worlds that obey the laws of physics. The immediate applications of Omniverse are incredible, from connecting design teams for remote collaboration to simulating digital twins of factories and robots. The science-fiction metaverse is near.\u201d\nOmniverse Enterprise is a new platform that includes the NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus server, which manages the database shared among clients, and NVIDIA Omniverse Connectors, which are plugins to industry-leading design applications.\nIt also includes two end-user applications: NVIDIA Omniverse Create \u2014 which accelerates scene composition and allows users in real time to interactively assemble, light, simulate and render scenes \u2014 and NVIDIA Omniverse View, which powers seamless collaborative design and visualization of architectural and engineering projects with photorealistic rendering. NVIDIA RTX\u2122 Virtual Workstation (vWS) software, also part of the platform, gives collaborators the freedom to run their graphics-intensive 3D applications from anywhere.\nOmniverse Enterprise is tested and optimized for professionals to run on NVIDIA RTX laptops and desktops as well as NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 on the NVIDIA EGX\u2122 platform. This makes it possible to deploy the tool across organizations of any scale, from small workgroups using local desktops and laptops, to globally distributed teams accessing the data center using various devices.\nGlobal Leaders Adopt Omniverse \r\nAmong the more than 400 companies that have been evaluating Omniverse over the past two years are:\nThe BMW Group is the first car manufacturer to use NVIDIA Omniverse to design an end-to-end digital twin of an entire factory. Thousands of planners, product engineers, facility managers and lean experts within the global production network are able to collaborate in a single virtual environment to design, plan, engineer, simulate and optimize extremely complex manufacturing systems before a factory is actually built or a new product is integrated.\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA AI give us the chance to simulate all 31 factories in our production network. All elements of the complete factory model \u2014 including the associates, the robots, the buildings and the assembly parts \u2014 can be simulated to support a wide range of AI-enabled use cases such as virtual factory planning, autonomous robots, predictive maintenance and big data analytics,\u201d said Milan Nedeljkovic, member of the board of management of BMW AG, responsible for production. \u201cThese new innovations will reduce the planning times, improve flexibility and precision, and at the end produce 30 percent more efficient planning processes. Omniverse is a game-changer that is setting the standard for collaboration platforms for our industry.\u201d\nIndustrial Light & Magic has been evaluating Omniverse for a broad range of possible workflows, but particularly for bringing together content created across multiple traditional applications, and facilitating simultaneous collaboration across teams that are distributed all over the world. Omniverse has the potential to remove the technical barriers that used to get in the way of the creative process, facilitating real-time decision-making across all disciplines.\nFoster + Partners, the U.K. architectural design and engineering firm, is implementing Omniverse to enable seamless collaborative design to visualization capabilities to teams spread across 14 countries.\n\u201cOmniverse is a revolutionary platform that has allowed our designers to collaborate and visualize multiple design changes to a scene simultaneously while working on their software of choice,\u201d said Martha Tsigkari, partner with the Applied Research and Development Group at Foster + Partners. \u201cAs we can review design options in parallel, we have much more time for creative design and visualization. Integration of futuristic technologies such as machine learning will bring more opportunities to assist the creative process in the future.\u201d\nWPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services organization, is using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to reinvent the way advertising content is made by replacing traditional on-location production methods with entirely virtual production. When COVID-19 restrictions were put in place, the WPP team faced limitations shooting commercials for clients on location. They used the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to collaboratively design, build and simulate a photoreal virtual forest without having to shoot it in person.\n\u201cWPP\u2019s global content production specialist Hogarth is the largest of its kind in the world. We manage over 1,500 shoots per year for our clients,\u201d said Richard Glasson, Global CEO of Hogarth. \u201cOmniverse has improved the way we work by enabling multiple artists at different touchpoints in the pipeline to collaborate on a single scene virtually at the same time and from any place in the world. It dramatically reduces our carbon footprint and brings sustainable production to life.\u201d\nEricsson, a leading telecommunications company, is using the Omniverse platform to simulate and visualize future 5G networks.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA Omniverse platform lets our teams virtually explore any city\u2019s unique geography \u2014 whether it is San Francisco\u2019s hills or Frankfurt\u2019s high-rises \u2014 and its impact on radio network performance,\u201d said Joakim Sorelius, head of Development Unit Networks at Ericsson. \u201cBy combining our extensive simulation expertise with the stunning visualizations of Omniverse, we bring radio network analysis to a new level, creating insights that ensure our customers get the best possible 5G experience. We see Omniverse as the future of collaboration and planning.\u201d\u202f\nActivision Publishing, Inc., is exploring NVIDIA Omniverse\u2019s AI-search capabilities for its award-winning, blockbuster video game experiences to allow artists, game developers and designers to search intuitively through massive databases of untagged 3D assets using text or images.\nBuilding the Metaverse \u2014 Open Standards and Interoperability \r\nThe world\u2019s 3D industries are making great strides toward building the metaverse \u2014 a massive shared virtual world \u2014 by adopting open file frameworks like Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description, and encouraging interoperability between software applications. The NVIDIA Omniverse ecosystem continues to grow, connecting industry-leading applications from software companies such as Bentley Systems, Adobe, Autodesk, Epic Games, ESRI, Graphisoft, Trimble, McNeel & Associates, Blender, Marvelous Designer, Reallusion and wrnch Inc.\nBentley Systems, the infrastructure engineering software company, announced it is bringing infrastructure digital twins to NVIDIA Omniverse. Bentley is the first to harness real-time rendering, AI and simulation capabilities of NVIDIA Omniverse.\nA complete list of software partners is available at nvidia.com/omniverse.\nAvailability\r\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise software is available on a subscription basis and includes NVIDIA\u2019s enterprise support services. NVIDIA\u2019s partner network of leading computer makers \u2014 including ASUS, BOXX Technologies, Cisco, Dell Technologies, HP, Lenovo and Supermicro \u2014 are supporting NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

NVIDIA Jarvis brings this state-of-the-art conversational AI out of the cloud for customers to host AI services anywhere.\u201d\nNVIDIA Jarvis will enable a new wave of language-based applications previously not possible, improving interactions with humans and machines. It opens the door to the creation of such services as digital nurses to help monitor patients around the clock, relieving overloaded medical staff; online assistants to understand what consumers are looking for and recommend the best products; and real-time translations to improve cross-border workplace collaboration and enable viewers to enjoy live content in their own language.\nJarvis has been built using models trained for several million GPU hours on over 1 billion pages of text, 60,000 hours of speech data, and in different languages, accents, environments and lingos to achieve world-class accuracy. For the first time, developers can use NVIDIA TAO, a framework to train, adapt and optimize these models for any task, any industry and on any system with ease.\nDevelopers can select a Jarvis pre-trained model from NVIDIA\u2019s NGC\u2122 catalog, fine-tune it using their own data with the NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit, optimize it for maximum throughput and minimum latency in real-time speech services, and then easily deploy the model with just a few lines of code so there is no need for deep AI expertise.\nBroad Industry Support\r\nSince Jarvis\u2019 early access program began last May, thousands of companies have asked to join. Among early users is T-Mobile, the U.S. telecom giant, which is looking to AI to further augment its machine learning products using natural language processing to provide real-time insights and recommendations.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA Jarvis services, fine-tuned using T-Mobile data, we\u2019re building products to help us resolve customer issues in real time,\u201d said Matthew Davis, vice president of product and technology at T-Mobile. \u201cAfter evaluating several automatic speech recognition solutions, T-Mobile has found Jarvis to deliver a quality model at extremely low latency, enabling experiences our customers love.\u201d\nNVIDIA is also partnering with Mozilla Common Voice, an open source collection of voice data for startups, researchers and developers to train voice-enabled apps, services and devices. The world\u2019s largest multi-language, public domain voice dataset, Common Voice contains over 9,000 total hours of contributed voice data in 60 different languages. NVIDIA is using Jarvis to develop pre-trained models with the dataset, and then offer them back to the community for free.\n\u201cWe launched Common Voice to teach machines how real people speak in their unique languages, accents and speech patterns,\u201d said Mark Surman, executive director at Mozilla. \u201cNVIDIA and Mozilla have a common vision of democratizing voice technology \u2014 and ensuring that it reflects the rich diversity of people and voices that make up the internet.\u201d\nNVIDIA\u2019s conversational AI tools have had more than 45,000 downloads. These can be combined with technology from hundreds of partners and support leading software libraries, allowing developers worldwide to build innovative and intuitive conversational AI applications.\n\u201cJarvis has a wide selection of pre-trained models, making it a truly end-to-end pipeline for conversational AI \u2014 from automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and text-to-speech,\u201d said Harrison Kinsley, YouTuber and founder of PythonProgramming.net. \u201cAll of the models are shockingly fast and well optimized and the API is easy for developers to use with examples that apply to many conversational AI tasks.\u201d\nAvailability\r\nNewly announced features will be released in the second quarter as part of the ongoing NVIDIA Jarvis open beta program. Developers can download it today from NGC with more information available here.\nRegister for free to learn more about NVIDIA Jarvis during GTC21, taking place online April 12-16.

In all, there are 2,100 possible ways to configure a new BMW.\n\u201cBMW may very well be the world\u2019s largest custom-manufacturing company,\u201d Huang said.\nThese vehicles are produced in 31 factories located around the world, explained Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG.\nMoving the Parts That Go into the Machines That Move Your Parts\nIn an instant, Huang and Nedeljkovi\u0107 summoned a digital twin of one of BMW\u2019s factories \u2014 and the screen was filled with gleaming cars being assembled by banks of perfectly synchronized robots \u2014 all simulated.\nTo design and reconfigure its factories, BMW\u2019s global teams can collaborate in real-time using different software packages like Revit, Catia, or point clouds to design and plan the factory in 3D and all the changes are visible, in real-time, on Omniverse.\n\u201cThe capability to operate in a perfect simulation revolutionalizes BMW\u2019s planning processes,\u201d Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\nSome of that work has to be hands-on. BMW regularly reconfigures our factories to accommodate new vehicle launches. Now, thanks to Omniverse that doesn\u2019t mean workers have to travel.\nNedeljkovi\u0107 showed two BMW planning experts located in different parts of the world testing a new line design in Omniverse.\nOne of them \u201cwormholes\u201d \u2014 or travels virtually \u2014 into an assembly simulation with a motion capture suit and records task movements.\nThe other adjusts the line design, in real time.\n\u201cThey work together to optimize the line as well as worker ergonomics and safety,\u201d Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\nThe next step: recreating these kinds of interactions, at scale, in simulations, Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\nTo simulate workflow in Omniverse, digital humans are trained with data from real associates, they\u2019re then used to test new workflows in simulation to plan for worker ergonomics and efficiency.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why NVIDIA has Digital Human for simulation,\u201d Huang said. \u201cDigital Humans are trained with data from real associates.\u201d\nThese digital humans can be used in simulations to test new workflows for worker ergonomics and efficiency.\nBMW\u2019s 57,000 factory workers share workspace with robots designed to make their jobs easier.\nOmniverse, Nedeljkovi\u0107 said, will help robots adapt to BMW\u2019s reconfigured factories rapidly.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform, BMW is deploying a fleet of intelligent robots for logistics to improve the material flow in our production,\u201d Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\nThat agility is necessary since BMW produces 2.5 million vehicles per year, and 99 percent of them are custom.\nOmniverse can tap into NVIDIA Isaac for synthetic data generation and domain randomization, Huang said. That\u2019s key to bootstrapping machine learning.\n\u201cIsaac Sim generates millions of relevant synthetic images, and varies the environment to teach robots. \u201d Huang said.\nDomain randomization can generate an infinite permutation of photorealistic objects, textures, orientations, and lighting conditions, Huang said.\n\u201cSimulation offers perfect ground truth, whether for detection, segmentation or depth perception,\u201d he added.\nHuang and Nedeljkovi\u0107 showed a BMW employee monitoring operations in the factory. The operator is able to assign missions to different robots, and see a photorealistic digital win of its progress in Omniverse \u2014 all updated by sensors throughout the factory.\nWith NVIDIA Fleet Command software, workers can securely orchestrate robots, and other devices, in the factory, Huang explained.\nThey can monitor complex manufacturing cells in real-time, update software over the air, and launch robots in the factory on missions.\nHumans can even lend robots a \u201chelping hand.\u201d When an alert is sent to MIssion Control, one of BMW\u201ds human associations can teleoperate the robot \u2014 looking through its camera to guide it through a 5G connection.\nThen, with a push of a button, the operator returns the robot to autonomous control.\nContinuous Improvement, Continually Improving\nOmniverse will help BMW reduce planning time and improve flexibility and precision, producing 30% more efficient planning processes.\n\u201cNVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA AI give us the chance to simulate the 31 factories in our production network,\u201d Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\nAll the elements of the complete factory model \u2014 including the associates, the robots, the buildings, the assembly parts \u2014 can be simulated to support a wide range of AI-enabled use cases such as virtual factory planning, autonomous robots, predictive maintenance, big data analytics, he explained.\n\u201cThese new innovations will reduce the planning times, improve flexibility and precision, and at the end produce 30 percent more efficient planning processes,\u201d Nedeljkovi\u0107 said.\nThe result: a beautifully crafted new car, an amazing machine that\u2019s the product of an amazing machine \u2014 a factory able to capture and replicate every motion in the real world to a digital one, and back.\n\nTo learn more about how Omniverse is accelerating workloads within the Manufacturing industry, check out some of our sessions from GTC 21 here.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: AEC | GTC 2021 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Omniverse | Omniverse Enterprise | Simulation and Design | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They include the latest generations of Max-Q and RTX technologies and are backed by the NVIDIA Studio\u2122 ecosystem, which includes exclusive driver technology that enhances creative apps for optimal levels of performance and reliability.\nFor the data center, there are the new NVIDIA A10 GPU and A16 GPU. The A10 provides up to 2.5x the virtual workstation performance of the previous generation for designers and engineers, while the A16 GPU provides up to 2x user density with lower total cost of ownership and an enhanced virtual desktop infrastructure experience over the previous generation.\nCombined with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) and NVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC) software, the A10 and A16 GPUs deliver more power, memory and speed to boost any workflow, from graphics and AI to VDI, so users can focus more time on working efficiently and productively.\nCustomer Adoption \r\nAmong the first to tap into the RTX A5000 is Woods Bagot, a global architectural and consulting practice.\n\u201cThis new NVIDIA Ampere GPU microarchitecture is a huge leap forward. I was shocked by the performance gain I saw with the NVIDIA RTX A5000 versus the equivalent model previous generation RTX when running applications such as Chaos Vantage and NVIDIA Omniverse,\u201d said Robert Cervellione, studio leader of Design Technology at Woods Bagot. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the NVIDIA RTX A5000 professional GPU was designed for this intensive multi-tasking compared to game-level cards.\u201d\nPolaris, a manufacturer of motorcycles, snowmobiles, ATV and electric vehicles, is also using the RTX A5000.\n\u201cSpeed is everything when we need to evaluate new concepts for the most adventurous vehicles, and the NVIDIA RTX A5000 really delivers what we need,\u201d said EM Green, 3D/CGI lead at Polaris. \u201cThe basic viewport rendering is incredibly fast in Octane Render \u2014 5x faster \u2014 and unlocks things we couldn\u2019t have even tried before.\u201d\n\u201cAt Important Looking Pirates, we\u2019re constantly pushing creative boundaries, and breakthrough technology is the great enabler,\u201d said Ola Bj\u00f6rling, producer of Virtual Production & Real-Time Graphics at Important Looking Pirates. \u201cWith the RTX A5000 powering NVIDIA Omniverse, we\u2019re seeing high-end cinematic results in real time that used to take hours per frame.\u201d\nNext-Generation RTX Technology\r\nThe new NVIDIA RTX GPUs feature the latest generation of NVIDIA RTX technology to accelerate graphics, ray tracing, AI and compute. The new RTX laptop GPUs also include the latest generation of NVIDIA Max-Q technology, enabling a new generation of powerful thin and light laptops designed for professionals.

This data-center-like performance provides automakers ample compute capabilities to build software-defined vehicles that are richly programmable and perpetually upgradeable through secure, over-the-air updates.\n\u201cThe transportation industry needs a computing platform that it can rely on for decades. The software investment is too immense to repeat for each car. NVIDIA DRIVE is the most advanced AI and AV computing platform, with rich global software and developer ecosystems, and architecturally compatible for generations,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cToday, we are announcing the next extension of our roadmap \u2014 our new DRIVE Atlan is truly a technical marvel, fusing all of NVIDIA\u2019s strengths in AI, auto, robotics, safety and BlueField-secure data centers to deliver safe, autonomous-driving fleets.\u201d\nData-Center-Grade Security Technology\r\nDRIVE Atlan will integrate an NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae data processing unit (DPU), which delivers a broad range of advanced networking, storage and security services to support complex compute and AI workloads found in autonomous vehicles. BlueField offers full data-center-infrastructure-on-a-chip programmability, armed with a safe security enclave to prevent data breaches and cyberattacks. DRIVE Atlan is designed from the ground up to handle the large number of AI applications that run simultaneously in autonomous machines, safely and securely.\nContinuous NVIDIA DRIVE Improvement Across Generations\r\nThe company\u2019s original processor for autonomous driving, NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier\u2122 (30 TOPS) is found in production cars and trucks today, while NVIDIA DRIVE Orin\u2122 (254 TOPS) has already been selected by leading automakers for production timelines starting in 2022. NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan will extend the NVIDIA DRIVE family of SoCs\u2019 leadership for vehicles\u2019 2025 production targets and beyond.\nSince NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan, Orin and Xavier are all programmable through open CUDA\u00ae and TensorRT\u2122 APIs and libraries, developers can leverage their investments across multiple product generations as they establish their future AV production roadmaps.\nWatch Huang\u2019s GTC21 keynote address, where he announced NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan and more, and register for free for GTC21, running April 12-16.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

It can generate datasets to train the vehicle\u2019s perception system and provide a virtual proving ground to test the vehicle\u2019s decision-making process while accounting for edge cases. The platform can be connected to the AV stack in software-in-the-loop or hardware-in-the-loop configurations to test the full driving experience.\nDRIVE Sim on Omniverse is a major step forward as NVIDIA transitions the foundation for autonomous vehicle simulation from a game engine to a simulation engine.\nThis shift to simulation architected specifically for self-driving development has required significant effort, but brings an array of new capabilities and opportunities.\nEnter the Omniverse\nCreating a purpose-built autonomous vehicle simulation platform is not a simple undertaking. Game engines are powerful tools that provide incredible capabilities, however, they\u2019re designed to build games, not scientific, physically accurate, repeatable simulations.\nDesigning the next generation of DRIVE Sim required a new approach. This new simulator had to be repeatable with precise timing, easily scale across GPUs and server nodes, simulate sensor feeds with physical accuracy and act as a modular and extensible platform.\nNVIDIA Omniverse is the confluence of almost every core technology developed by NVIDIA. And DRIVE Sim takes advantage of the company\u2019s expertise in graphics, high performance computing, AI and hardware design. Combining these capabilities provides a technology platform that is perfect for autonomous vehicle simulation.\nSpecifically, Omniverse provides a platform that was designed from the ground up to support multi-GPU computing. It incorporates a physically accurate, ray-tracing renderer based on NVIDIA RTX technology.\nNVIDIA Omniverse also includes \u201cKit,\u201d a scalable and extensible simulation framework for building interactive 3D applications and microservices. Using Kit over the last year, NVIDIA has implemented the DRIVE Sim core simulation engine in a way that supports repeatable simulation with precise control over all processes.\nTiming and Repeatability\nAutonomous vehicle simulation can only be an effective development tool if scenarios are repeatable and timing is accurate.\nFor instance, NVIDIA Omniverse schedules and manages all sensor and environment rendering functions to ensure repeatability without loss of accuracy.\u00a0 It does this across GPUs and across nodes giving DRIVE Sim the ability to handle detailed environments and test vehicles with complex sensor suites. Additionally, it can manage such workloads at slower or faster than real time, while generating repeatable results.\nOmniverse was designed to scale to many GPUs providing DRIVE Sim real-time rendering capabilities with repeatable results for complex sensor sets.\nNot only does the platform enable this flexibility and accuracy, it does so in a way that\u2019s scalable, so developers can run fleets of vehicles with various sensor suites at large scale and at the highest levels of fidelity.\nPhysically Accurate Sensors\nIn addition to accurately recreating real-world driving conditions, the simulation environment must also render vehicle sensor data in the exact same way cameras, radars and lidars take in data from the physical world.\nWith NVIDIA RTX technology, DRIVE Sim is able to render physically accurate sensor data in real time. Ray tracing provides realistic lighting by simulating the physical properties of visible and non-visible waveforms. And the NVIDIA Omniverse RTX renderer coupled with NVIDIA RTX GPUs enables ray tracing at real-time frame rates.\nThis scene of vehicles in a tunnel uses indirect lighting, which is challenging to render accurately in real-time, but is enabled in DRIVE Sim by the Omniverse RTX renderer.\nThe capability to simulate light in real time has significant benefits for autonomous vehicle simulation. It makes it possible to recreate lighting environments that can be virtually impossible to capture using rasterization \u2014 from the reflections off a tanker truck to the shadows inside a dim tunnel.\nGenerating physically accurate sensor data is especially powerful for building datasets to train AI-based perception networks, outputting the ground-truth data with the virtual sensor data. DRIVE Sim includes tools for advanced dataset creation including a powerful Python scripting interface and domain randomization tools.\nUsing this synthetic data in the DNN training process saves the cost of collecting and labeling real-world data, and speeds up iteration for streamlined autonomous vehicle deployment.\nDRIVE Sim provides tools to generate ground truth data with simulation data, enabling rapid generation of complex datasets to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for autonomous vehicle perception.\nModular and Extensible\nAs a modular, open and extensible platform, DRIVE Sim provides developers the ultimate flexibility and efficiency in simulation testing.\nDRIVE Sim on Omniverse allows different components of the simulator to be run to support different use cases. One group of engineers can run just the perception stack in simulation. Another can focus on the planning and control stack by simulating scenarios based on ground-truth object data (thus bypassing the perception stack).\nThis modularity significantly cuts down on development time by allowing developers to focus on the task at hand, while ensuring that the entire team is using the same tools, scenarios, models and assets in simulation for consistent results.\nUsing the NVIDIA Omniverse Kit SDK, DRIVE Sim allows developers to build custom models, 3D content and validation tools or to interface with other simulations. Users can create their own plugins or choose from a rich library of vehicle, sensor and traffic plugins provided by DRIVE Sim ecosystem partners. This flexibility enables users to customize DRIVE Sim for their unique use case and tailor the simulation experience to their development and validation needs.\nDRIVE Sim on Omniverse will be available to developers via an early access program this summer. Check out how Omniverse is already changing the automotive world by watching some of our various GTC 21 sessions here.\nLearn more about DRIVE Sim and accelerate the development of safer, more efficient transportation today.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Rendering | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Janitor Ahti has clearly done a bang-up job in my absence, despite his \u2013 SPOILERS \u2013 fairly significant duties in the Oldest House.\nBecause the laptop I\u2019m using \u2013 a top-of-the-line NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080-toting MSI GS66 Stealth \u2013 is comfortably the most powerful gaming setup I\u2019ve ever used, ray tracing is maxed out on the 2K screen and it really shows wherever you look.\u00a0\nRay tracing, for those who don\u2019t know, is an astonishing development in graphical realism, where every beam of light is accurately modelled by NVIDIA\u2019s RTX GPU, leading to incredibly realistic lighting, reflections, and shadows. With this extra graphical sheen, I spend an embarrassing amount of time patrolling the lobby, delighting in the way my body reflects back on the extremely shiny floor.\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would make quite a nice tech demo in its own right, but as anybody who has played Control will tell you, this period of calm won\u2019t last too long. Within minutes, protagonist Jesse Faden is stumbling across the dead body of the Director of the Bureau and stepping into his recently vacated shoes, ready to take on all the paranormal nasties the game has to offer.\nRead More About NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptops Here\nRay tracing \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 can be taxing on PC hardware. Fortunately, Control lets you implement it in degrees with five settings to toggle on and off: reflections, transparent reflections, indirect diffuse lighting, contact shadows, and debris. Enable everything \u2013 something that most modern PCs would struggle with \u2013 and the graphics are truly mind blowing.\u00a0\nOn the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series laptop, light reflects gratifyingly in pools of blood, and the generally unsettling shadowy atmosphere of the Oceanview Motel ups to a solid 9/10 on the creepy meter. Even in the chaos of the infamous Ashtray Maze, I still can\u2019t help but notice the shadow of objects as I fire them across the transforming rooms after waves and waves of enemies.\nAll of this visual splendor might slow lesser hardware to a crawl, but on the high-spec gaming laptop loaned by NVIDIA, these frequent confrontations with the Hiss are fast, fluid, and exhilarating. I first played Control through to completion a year ago on a PS4 Pro, and while it was an enjoyable experience it wasn\u2019t exactly a smooth one. On Sony\u2019s top-end last-gen hardware, Control aims for 30 fps but has some well documented and noticeable dips to the high teens \u2013 especially around the power plant section early on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t a problem on gaming setups powered by NVIDIA\u2019s RTX graphics cards. Control is a visually demanding game, but it\u2019s no match for NVIDIA\u2019s AI powered DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology. DLSS taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images for your games.\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl is a great showcase for this mind blowing tech. NVIDIA\u2019s own testing on a laptop of identical specs to the one I\u2019m using shows the game managing a respectable 35.3 fps natively at 1440p with high detail and max ray tracing settings enabled, but enabling DLSS is simply transformational. This takes the FPS up to an average of 80.8 fps with the same settings \u2013 a rise of 129%. I managed to replicate this once my laptop power settings were fully unleashed and found my fps went as high as 90fps.\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\nGet the best of Den of Geek delivered right to your inbox!\n\n\n \n\n\nA high frame rate is essential to play Control, which requires quick, fluid responses while fighting waves of pesky enemies. While lesser GPUs would require you to choose between graphical niceties and smoothness, a RTX 30 Series laptop lets you have the best of both worlds: fast, fluid gameplay with all of the visual bells and whistles to make Control\u2019s shifting architectural splendor pop.\u00a0\nIn fact, it\u2019s a little bit distracting at first \u2013 embarrassing as it was, I caught a glimpse of my own ray-traced reflection and instinctively fired off a few rounds at my mirror image. So perhaps my version of Jesse isn\u2019t the best candidate to run and protect the Federal Bureau of Control, after all.\u00a0\n\nBut the one thing I can\u2019t blame for that is the superb hardware that accompanied me on my journey back to the Oldest House. As rusty as I proved to be on my return, it\u2019s certainly nice to be back on top-of-the-range hardware.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAd\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops here.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:Share on Facebook (opens in a new tab)Share on Twitter (opens in a new tab)Share on Linkedin (opens in a new tab)Share on email (opens in a new tab) | Comment:\nComments count:0 \nTags: ControlNvidiaPC GamingTech\n\n\n\n\nWritten by\n\n\t\t\t\tAlan Martin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\tAlan is a London-based technology writer, who has written for the likes of Gizmodo, Wired and The New Statesman.

We\u2019re also sharing some sales Firefly is running on the Stronghold franchise. And of course, we have more games joining the GeForce NOW library.\nFortify Your Castle\nBuild your castle, defend it, and expand your kingdom. That\u2019s the Stronghold way.\nThe Stronghold series focuses on \u201ccastle sim\u201d gameplay, challenging players to become the lord of their kingdom. Your goal is to build a stable economy and raise a strong military to defend against invaders, destroy enemy castles and accomplish your mission objectives.\nFirefly\u2019s latest entry in the series, Stronghold: Warlords, expands on the formula by granting options to recruit, upgrade and command AI-controlled warlords that increase your influence and give you more options in each battlefield.\nAs you answer threats from Great Khans, Imperial warlords and Sh\u014dgun commanders, you\u2019ll lead your forces to victory and defend against massive sieges. It wouldn\u2019t be a Stronghold game if you didn\u2019t watch the great hordes of your enemies collapse as they crash against your defenses.\nStronghold: Warlords joined the GeForce NOW library at the game\u2019s release on March 9, and members can muster their forces across nearly all of their devices, even low-powered rigs or Macs.\n\u201cRather than porting to new platforms, we love that GeForce NOW can stream the real PC version to players regardless of their system,\u201d said Nicholas Tannahill, marketing director at Firefly Studios. \u201cWe can focus on improving one build, whilst our players can take their kingdoms with them.\u201d\nA Kingdom for the Ages\nGeForce NOW members can oversee each skirmish in Stronghold: Warlords across all their supported devices.\nFirefly only released Stronghold: Warlords a month ago, but has robust plans for content updates for players.\nThose plans include a free update on April 13 that adds a new AI character, Sun Tzu, plus AI invasions in Free Build mode, and a new Free Build map. This update is just the beginning for how Firefly will continue giving gamers new challenges to master as they grow their kingdom.\nTo celebrate our work with Firefly to bring the Stronghold franchise to GeForce NOW, the studio\u2019s games are currently on sale on Steam. Members can find more info on the Firefly games streaming from the cloud, and their current Steam discounts, below.\nLet\u2019s Play Today\nOf course, GFN Thursday has even more games in store for members. In addition to the rest of the Stronghold franchise, members can look for the following games to join our library:\n\nAron\u2019s Adventure (day-and-date release on Steam, April 7)\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV (day-and-date release on Steam, April 9)\nEARTH DEFENSE FORCE: IRON RAIN (Steam)\nSpintires (Steam)\nStronghold Crusader HD (80 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\nStronghold 2: Steam Edition (60 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\nStronghold HD (70 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\nStronghold Crusader 2 (90 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\n\nStronghold Crusader 2 DLC \u2013 (20-50 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\n\n\nStronghold 3 Gold (70 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\nStronghold Kingdoms (free-to-play on Steam)\n\nStronghold Kingdoms (Starter Pack) (70 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\n\n\nStronghold Legends: Steam Edition (60 percent off on Steam for a limited time)\nUNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH Exe:Late[cl-r] (Steam)\n\nWill you accept the challenge and build your kingdom in a Stronghold game this weekend?

Nvidia has, for instance, its family of Arm-based system-on-chips dubbed the Tegra family, which are aimed at embedded electronics and the Internet of Things. It also hinted it wanted to build its own more powerful processors when it put in a $40bn bid to snap up British chip designer Arm last year.\n\nJensen's cooking chips in his kitchen ... Source: Nvidia GTC keynote livestream\n\nSpeaking from his kitchen to kick off Nvidia's annual GPU Technology Conference, CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday the forthcoming processor was named after Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, the American computer scientist known for, among other things, assisting in the creation of the COBOL programming language.\n\nNvidia shrinks GPUs to help squeeze AI into your data center, make its VMware friendship work\nREAD MORE\nThough graphics processors can, and are, being used to accelerate the training of neural networks and their inference operations, these GPUs rely on general-purpose processors to orchestrate the whole effort and direct data between software applications and the hardware accelerators. Thus, these host processors can form a bottleneck for the specialized GPU cores, which is a problem Nvidia wants to solve with Grace. This chip family is designed to work in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, and is said to sport a CPU-GPU interconnect speed of 900GB/s using the company\u2019s NvLink technology.\nFor comparison, an Nvidia spokesperson told us that half an Nvidia DGX A100 system with one CPU connected to four GPUs has a total bandwidth of 64GB/s. \"With Grace, the similar four GPU configuration will have four Grace CPUs each connected to a GPU via next generation NVLink at over 900GB/s of bidirectional bandwidth for an aggregate bi-directional bandwidth across four GPUs of nearly 4000 GB/s or nearly 2000 GB/s in one direction. So, four GPUs can access system memory at nearly 30x higher bandwidth,\" we're told.\"\n\nAlso from GTC...\nEight more Ampere RTX GPUs for laptops, desktops and servers\nA16 data-center GPUs for virtual remote desktops, available later this year\nAmazon Web Services' Arm-compatible Graviton2 instances will be optionally accelerated using Nv GPUs\nNvidia touted Maxine, an AI-based toolkit for enhancing video conferencing, live streaming, and similar applications. We also learned of Morpheus, which does the same for information security apps.\nAnd for enterprises, there's Omniverse which aims to help 3D design teams collaborate in real time.\n\nGrace also has a CPU-CPU interconnect speed of 600GB/s and a LPDDR5x memory bandwidth of 500GB/s, it is said. It will use Arm\u2019s to-be-disclosed next-generation 64-bit Neoverse processor cores, and is aimed at running the \"largest AI and high-performance computing workloads,\" according to Nv. There really isn't a lot of technical detail available yet.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s introduction of the Grace data center CPU illustrates clearly how Arm\u2019s licensing model enables an important invention, one that will further support the incredible work of AI researchers and scientists everywhere,\u201d Arm CEO Simon Segars said in a statement.\nNvidia said it will begin shipping its Grace chips in 2023, and reckons the silicon will be able to train models containing a trillion parameters in mere days. The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and America's Los Alamos National Laboratory have put in orders to build Grace-powered AI supercomputers, it was announced.\n\nMore to come\n\nGrace isn\u2019t the only chip Nvidia has promised to deliver over the next few years. Here\u2019s what else is said to be coming: the BlueField-3 DPU, its next-generation data processing unit; and the Nvidia Drive Atlan, a system-on-a-chip for autonomous cars.\nNvidia's BlueField DPUs are designed to accelerate SmartNIC-style workloads, such as software-defined networking, storage operations, and security defenses. Essentially, you offload tasks from host processors to the DPU. BlueField can be connected to Nvidia's GPUs, too. Huang said his mega-corp's servers powering its cloud gaming platform GeForce Now uses BlueField chippery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cModern hyperscale clouds are driving a fundamental new architecture for data centers,\" said the chief exec. \"A new type of processor, designed to process data center infrastructure software, is needed to offload and accelerate the tremendous compute load of virtualization, networking, storage, security and other cloud-native AI services. The time for BlueField DPU has come.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's essentially a beefy system-on-chip sporting 16 Arm Cortex-A78 CPU cores, totaling 22 billion transistors. It can handle up to 400 gigabits per second of Ethernet and InfiniBand connectivity, we're told, and talk PCIe 5.0. The BlueField-3 is expected to be ten times more powerful than its predecessor, and is expected to sample in 2022 and ship thereafter. Huang also hinted that a BlueField-4 is coming in 2024 and that it can handle up to 800Gbps of network traffic.\n\nNvidia's BlueField roadmap ... Source: Nvidia. Click to enlarge\n\nNext up is Atlan. Not much is known about it other than it will deliver about four times the performance of Nvidia's Orin self-driving car chip that\u2019s due to ship in 2022, apparently. Expected to arrive three years later in 2025, Atlan will combine Nvidia\u2019s next-generation GPU architecture, Arm CPU cores, and BlueField technology onto a single system-on-chip.\nNvidia also announced that its DGX SuperPODs with 20 or more Nvidia DGX A100 systems \u2013 that's at least 160 80GB A100 GPUs \u2013 will be available to order this quarter; this equipment has a $60m price tag for a full configuration.\nA DGX Station 320G, which is supposed to be more affordable, will be available, too, via a $9,000-a-month subscription or a one-off $149,000 payment.\n\nThe DXG Station 320GB for shared labs ...

The new GPUs are referred to as LHR (Lite Hash Rate) and should come with Resizable BAR support enabled by default. \nNvidia had previously stated that they wouldn't limit mining performance of GPU already sold, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't do it to GPUs not yet in the market. It's not in Nvidia's best interest to reduce any revenue originated by selling cards for mining, which is quite high. However, with the CMP HX series already out, the company can reclaim the RTX series for their original purpose, a graphics cards series for PC gamers.\nLike the RTX 3060, the rest of the GeForce RTX 30 GPU family is expected to receive a similar treatment, as Nvidia reportedly plans to update the whole lineup with new graphics processors featuring anti-mining capabilities \u2013 the kind that can't be bypassed.\nThe LHR GPUs will be named differently, ending with a '2' instead of '0' (GA102-200 is now GA102-202). The PCI Device ID will also differ, but performance-wise, both GAxx0 and GAxx2 chips will be the same.\n\nThe new GPUs are expected to start shipping in the middle of May, meaning that customers should start receiving them about a month later. This may result in improved GPU stock levels for PC builders and gamers if miners can't figure out a practical way to override the mining limiter, leading them to the CMP HX series.\nThe report further indicates that the RTX 3090 may not come with the cryptomining limiter because it already has a high ROI. Nonetheless, it'll still be revised with a new GPU code-name (GA102-302), which may have something to do with Nvidia's push to enable Resizable BAR support by default without the need for customers to update their card's vBIOS. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Canada aims to become a major player in rare earth mining for chips and batteries \n\n\n\nWe benchmarked initial support for Resizable BAR on GeForce RTX GPUs and it's still a work in progress, especially if the drivers can't tell if the game will receive a boost or a decrease in performance once it's enabled.\n\n\n\n\n 22 comments\n \n218 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

See our ethics statement.Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered noise-removal technology does an excellent job at cancelling out background noise. Image: NvidiaJon Porter is a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), the go-to software for streamers, is getting native support for Nvidia\u2019s excellent noise-removal technology, the graphics card manufacturer announced today. Although it was previously possible to get the same effect by combining OBS with Nvidia\u2019s Broadcast software, you\u2019ll now be able to adjust the background noise-removal feature directly from within OBS. It\u2019s currently available with the beta version of OBS Studio 27 and will be coming in a full release soon.Nvidia\u2019s noise-removal technology has been around for a little while, first as RTX Voice and then as one of the features built into Nvidia Broadcast. The AI-powered tool can cancel out everything from keyboard clacking to your PC\u2019s loud fans. It\u2019s a great addition to a streamer\u2019s arsenal, helping to filter out distracting background noise so viewers can focus on game audio and a streamer\u2019s commentary.The integration means you can control the noise-removal feature from OBS. Image: NvidiaNvidia says you\u2019ll need to download its Broadcast Audio Effects SDK to get the feature to work with OBS, alongside its latest game-ready driver. Once you\u2019ve got those downloaded, here\u2019s how Nvidia describes the setup process: To use the new feature, open OBS, right click on your audio source in the Audio Mixer, select \u201cFilters\u201d, click on the \u201c+\u201d on the lower left of the new Filters window, pick the \u201cNoise Suppression\u201d filter, enter a name, click on the new filter in the list, expand the \u201cMethod\u201d dropdown, select \u201cNVIDIA Noise Removal\u201d, tweak the intensity based on how loud your background noises are, then close the Filters window. NVIDIA Noise Removal is now active.The new integration arrived with Nvidia\u2019s latest game-ready driver, which also adds support for Mortal Shell\u2019s RTX update as well as six new G-Sync-compatible displays. Correction July 21st, 7:39AM ET: Nvidia originally told us that users wouldn\u2019t be required to download its SDK separately to use its noise-cancelling technology in the release version of OBS Studio 27. This is incorrect. The company has now confirmed that its SDK is still required.See More: CreatorsEntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingTechTwitchMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

It\u2019s designed to enable the enormous compute requirements of the most powerful AI applications, including natural language processing, recommendation systems and AI supercomputer-powered drug discovery.\nNvidia said Grace is designed to work best in systems that combine its better-known graphics processing units, such as the Nvidia A100 GPU. When tightly coupled with Nvidia GPUs, executives said, a Grace-based system will deliver 10 times the performance of its current DGX-based systems running on Intel Corp.\u2019s x86 CPUs.\nThe Nvidia Grace CPU is named after the American computer programming pioneer Grace Hopper and is designed to power a new breed of supercomputers, the company said. One of the first examples will be the new Alps supercomputer at the Swiss National Computing Center, or CSCS.\nAlps is currently being built by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. and will be based on that company\u2019s Cray EX supercomputer product line and powered by the Nvidia HGX supercomputing platform, which includes the A100 GPUs, the Nvidia High-Performance Computing software development kit and the new Grace CPUs. Once it\u2019s up and running, Alps will be able to train GPT-3, the world\u2019s biggest natural language processing model, in just two days, which is seven times faster than the 2.8-AI exaflops Selene supercomputer that\u2019s currently recognized by MLPerf as the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer for AI.\nIn a press briefing, Paresh Kharya, senior director of Accelerated Computing at Nvidia, said Grace is the first CPU that\u2019s designed to address the exploding size of the world\u2019s most powerful AI models today. He noted that the GPT-3 model for example has passed more than 100 billion parameters, and said that existing CPU architectures simply cannot cope with this any more.\n\u201cGiant models are pushing the limits of existing architecture,\u201d Kharya said. The problem is that they can\u2019t fit into GPU memory, only system memory, which is slower.\nKharya explained that the Grace CPUs were built to advance computing architectures to handle AI and HPC better. \u201cWe have innovated from the ground up to create a CPU to deliver on that promise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one that\u2019s tightly coupled to GPU to provide a balanced architecture that eliminates bottlenecks.\u201d\nWith the Alps supercomputer, CSCS researchers are aiming to tackle a wide range of scientific research that can benefit from natural language understanding, for example analyzing thousands of scientific papers and generating new molecules that can be used to aid drug discovery.\n\u201dNvidia\u2019s novel Grace CPU allows us to converge AI technologies and classic supercomputing for solving some of the hardest problems in computational science,\u201d said CSCS Director Thomas Schulthess.\nNvidia said the Grace CPUs in its new systems will be linked to its GPUs through its Nvidia NVLink interconnect technology. It provides a blazing-fast 900 gigabits per second connection that will enable a 30 times higher aggregate bandwidth than other computer servers, the company added.\nThe Grace CPUs are further supported by an LPDDR5x memory subsystem that enables double the bandwidth and 10 times more energy efficiency compared with DDR4 memory, Nvidia said. Of course, it will also support the Nvidia HPC SDK and the company\u2019s full suite of CUDA and CUDA-X libraries of GPU applications.\nAnalyst Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that Nvidia is opening a new chapter in its long corporate history with the launch of Grace. He said the company is announcing the first complete AI platform based on Arm technology to address one of the biggest challenges of AI.\n\u201cIt enables Nvidia to move data fast and efficiently to an array of GPUs and data processing units,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural extension of Nvidia\u2019s AI portfolio and will be one that gives other, cloud-based AI and ML workloads a run for their money, on-premises. That\u2019s great for companies that want more choice on where to run those workloads.\u201d\nAnalyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said Grace is the biggest announcement by far at GTC 2021.\n\u201cGrace is\u00a0a tightly integrated CPU for over 1 trillion parameter AI models,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to address those with classic x86 CPUs and GPUs connected over PCIe. Grace is focused on IO and memory bandwidth, shares main memory with the GPU and shouldn\u2019t be confused with general purpose datacenter CPUs from AMD or Intel.\u201d\nNvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a keynote that\u00a0 \u201cunthinkable\u201d amounts of data are being used in AI workloads today. The launch of Grace means his company now has a third foundational technology for AI alongside its GPUs and data processing units, giving it the ability to re-architect the data center completely for those workloads.\u00a0\u201cNvidia is now a three-chip company,\u201d he said.\nNvidia said the Grace CPUs are slated for general availability sometime in 2023.\nWorld\u2019s first cloud-native multitenant AI supercomputer\nIn the meantime, companies will still be able to get their hands on a very capable AI supercomputing platform in the form of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation, cloud-native\u00a0Nvidia DGX SuperPOD AI hardware.\nThe new Nvidia DGX SuperPOD (pictured, below) for the first time features the company\u2019s BlueField-2 DPUs. Those are data processing units that offload, accelerate and isolate data to connect users securely to its AI infrastructure. The BlueField-2 DPUs are combined with a new Nvidia Base Command service to make it possible for multiple users and teams to access, share and operate the DGX SuperPOD infrastructure securely, Nvidia said. Base Command can be used to coordinate AI training and operations for teams of data scientists and developers located around the world.\nThe basic building block of the new SuperPODs is Nvidia\u2019s DGX A100 appliance. It pairs eight of the chipmaker\u2019s top-of-the-line A100 data center GPUs with two central processing units and a terabyte of memory.\n\n\u201cAI is the most powerful technology the world has ever known, and Nvidia DGX systems are the most effective tool for harnessing it,\u201d said Charlie Boyle, vice president and general manager of DGX systems at Nvidia. \u201cThe new DGX SuperPOD, which combines multiple DGX systems, provides a turnkey AI data center that can be securely shared across entire teams of researchers and developers.\u201d\nNvidia said the cloud-nativeDGX SuperPODS and Base Command will be available in the second quarter through its global partners.\nNvidia also announced a new DPU, the BlueField-3 chip that has 10 times the power of the previous generation. It also provides real-time network visibility, detection and response for cybersecurity threats. The company added that it acts as the monitoring or telemetry agent for Nvidia Morpheus, an AI-enabled, cloud-native cybersecurity platform, which was also announced today.\nJarvis interactive conversational AI framework\nNvidia isn\u2019t letting up on the software side either. As part of its efforts to encourage greater adoption of its new AI infrastructure, the company today announced availability of the Nvidia Jarvis framework. It provides a raft of pre-trained deep learning models and software tools for developers. They can use them to create interactive conversational AI services that can be adapted for use in a variety of industries.\nAvailable on the Nvidia GPU cloud service, the deep learning models in the Jarvis framework are trained on billions of hours of phone calls, web meetings and streaming broadcast video content. They can be used for what the company says is \u201chighly accurate\u201d automatic speech recognition and \u201csuperhuman\u201d language understanding. They can also be applied to real-time translation in multiple languages and create new text-to-speech capabilities that can be used to power conversational chat bots, Nvidia said.\nThe Jarvis models are exceptionally fast as well. Nvidia said that through GPU acceleration, it can run the end-to-end speech pipeline in under 100 milliseconds in order to listen, understand and then create a response faster than you can blink.\u00a0Nvidia said developers will be able to use the Nvidia Tao framework to train, adapt and optimize the Jarvis models using their own data for almost any task in any industry and on any system they use.\nPossible applications of the Jarvis deep learning models include new digital nurse services that can help to monitor patients, easing the burden on overloaded human medical staff, or online assistants for e-commerce that can understand what consumers are looking for a provide useful recommendations. Real-time translation also can help enable better cross-border work collaboration.\n\n\u201cConversational AI is in many ways the ultimate AI,\u201d said Huang. \u201cDeep learning breakthroughs in speech recognition, language understanding and speech synthesis have enabled engaging cloud services. Nvidia Jarvis brings this state-of-the-art conversational AI out of the cloud for customers to host AI services anywhere.\u201d\nNvidia said the Jarvis deep learning models will be released in the second quarter as part of the ongoing open beta program.\nWith reporting from Robert Hof\nImage: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Photo Courtesy LANL LANL NEWSNext-generation system powered by the Grace CPU will shape the future of the Laboratory\u2019s computing strategy\nLOS ALAMOS, N.M., April 12, 2021\u2013 Los Alamos National Laboratory today announced a major milestone resulting from its collaboration with NVIDIA\u00a0to develop tailored High Performance Computing system architectures that will meet the Laboratory\u2019s diverse mission needs. As announced this week at\u00a0GTC, the Laboratory will be the first United States customer to receive a NVIDIA Grace Central Processing Unit (CPU), with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as the system provider; the target delivery is set for early 2023.\u201cWith an innovative balance of memory bandwidth and capacity, this next-generation system will shape our institution\u2019s computing strategy,\u201d said Thom Mason, Los Alamos National Laboratory Director. \u201cThanks to NVIDIA\u2019s new Grace CPU, we\u2019ll be able to deliver advanced scientific research using high-fidelity 3D simulations and analytics with data sets that are larger than previously possible.\u201dThe Grace CPU is an Arm-based processor that addresses the computing requirements for the world\u2019s most data-intensive applications requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive amounts of fast memory. It is named for Grace Hopper, the computer-programming pioneer.Developments from this\u00a0partnership \u00a0are well underway. The first step was the purchase of NVIDIA\u2019s A100 graphic processing units (GPUs), which will be installed in Los Alamos\u2019 latest Institutional Computing capability. The second step is the 2023 delivery of a leadership-class advanced technology supercomputer based on the Grace CPU to conduct modeling, simulation, and data analysis in support of Laboratory research and missions. The third step is a multi-year collaboration focused on codesign for a broad spectrum of computing, memory, and software technologies.Codesign draws on the combined expertise of vendors, hardware architects, system software developers, domain scientists, computer scientists, and applied mathematicians working together to make informed decisions about hardware and software components.\u201cAdvanced computational tools provide a powerful enabler to help advance scientific discovery and use across all our applications, ranging from climate and disease modeling to materials science, to nuclear deterrence and monitoring,\u201d said John Sarrao, deputy director for Science, Technology and Engineering at Los Alamos. \u201cWe are pleased and excited to be on this journey with NVIDIA.

Carla Lauter 3D Technology AEC Innovations Asset & Facility Management Featured     \u201cWe have a very common vision of where [digital twins]are going. I\u2019m amazed at how much work gets done with Bentley Tools and the complexity and the size of the projects. When we look at that and then we see it in Omniverse, we\u2019re just excited about it \u2013 we see the world in the same way.\u201d -Richard Kerris, NVIDIAIn addition to the much-discussed release of the NVIDIA Omniverse 3D development platform, an additional announcement from Bentley Systems revealed just how far NVIDIA is planning to go in pursuit of digital twins.As part of the Omniverse-related announcements at GTC, Bentley Systems, shared that they would be bringing infrastructure digital twins to NVIDIA Omniverse. Bentley will be the first to harness real-time rendering, AI and simulation capabilities of NVIDIA Omniverse, and will continue to build upon the platform going forward. The shared vision of a \u201cdigital twin\u201d was apparent from CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s comments in the keynote, only a few minutes into his talk.\u201c[Bentley] has a platform called\u00a0iTwin for digital twins \u2013 an exciting strategy to use the 3D models after construction to monitor and optimize the performance throughout its life. We\u2019re super excited to partner with Bentley, to create infrastructure digital twins and Omniverse, Bentley is the first third-party company to be developing a suite of applications on the omniverse platform. This is just an awesome use of Omniverse, a great example of digital twins and Bentley is the perfect partner.\u201dThe nature of the partnership is that Bentley Systems has extended the Bentley iTwin platform\u00a0to integrate with\u00a0NVIDIA Omniverse\u00a0to provide a graphics pipeline for AI-enhanced, real-time visualization, and simulation of infrastructure digital twins. This integration allows engineering-grade, millimeter-accurate digital content to be visualized with photorealistic lighting and environmental effects on multiple devices including web browsers, workstations, tablets, and virtual reality and augmented reality headsets from anywhere in the world.To find out more about this partnership, SPAR 3D editor Carla Lauter sat down with Richard Kerris, GM of Omniverse of NVIDIA and\u00a0Lori Hufford VP of Applications Integration at Bentley Systems to discuss how Bentley Systems will plan to bring their digital twins expertise to NVIDIA Omniverse.\u201cOmniverse allows for infrastructure digital twins to be visualized with photo-realistic lighting and environmental effects\u2026 it allows for that to happen on multiple devices, including web browsers and workstations tablets, virtual reality, augmented reality headsets, from really anywhere in the world. So the possibilities that it opens are super exciting.\u201d \u2013Lori Hufford, Bentley SystemsWatch the full interview (12 minutes) below:\u00a0 Want more stories like this?

That also could prove relevant as the pandemic has folks looking for work.\nMusic and live visual work means one thing \u2013 stuff has to happen live. And so that makes these chips more interesting. It means that fundamentally what musicians and artists do, which is to work with materials live in time, now matches up with the way graphics (and AI) chips work. Since they\u2019re crunching numbers faster, it means the ability to create \u201cliquid\u201d interfaces. (That was the concept interactive visionary and legend Joy Mountford introduced years ago in a talk we had together on the South by Southwest stage, and it\u2019s stuck with me.)\nNow, I won\u2019t lie, some of this is awaiting GDC, the game dev event. That\u2019s because when you don\u2019t have a BMW factory-sized budget, the punk-style approach of gaming has a ton of appeal. (You can see a bunch of gamers complaining on YouTube actually, I think misunderstanding that this is not a gaming keynote and \u2026 that\u2019s coming later and \u2026 NVIDIA has always had workstation customers. But we know gaming trolls are not the most reasonable folks and \u2013 I for one enjoy watching Mercedes Benz simulate the Autobahn. It\u2019s the Kraftwerk in me. GTA: Normal German Life Simulator. The Edeka parking lot is off the chain.)\n\n\n\nBut having listened to NVIDIA talk about their new offerings, I think there\u2019s more here than just pro and enterprise applications and the usual workstation / gaming PC divide.\nFollow along as there is a ton of geeky machine learning, metaverse, Omniverse, and 3D artistry stuff coming \u2013 https://gtc21.event.nvidia.com/\nOmniverse\nThe big pillar here that impacts audiovisual creation is Omniverse. I wrote about this connected platform for collaboration and exchange of all things 3D, built on open tools like Pixar\u2019s very own USD file format (also a subtle hint that y\u2019all can make bank with this stuff):\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse hit beta, and all your creative 3D worlds just got more connected\n\nThis week, we get a lot of the questions answered about where NVIDIA was going strategically. \nBut yeah, if you\u2019re wondering if this could allow audiovisual artists and musicians to connect to big-budget projects \u2013 at a time when even the shows you watch at night (Mandalorian, cough) are made with these tools? You bet.\nFirst, the most exciting detail for me was a commitment that Omniverse for individuals and artists will always be free \u2013 meaning anyone can get at this platform. That also means that individual 3D artists and AV creators can play with big industry \u2013 so it\u2019s a source of gigs.\nAlso, the Omniverse pricing is not astronomical for those \u201centerprise\u201d use cases. A small team can buy into it at a per-seat license of $1800 a year, plus a $25,000 cost for a nucleus server. That\u2019s within reach of interactive and design shops, and it seems NVIDIA may even work to adapt to those kinds of small use cases even beyond that.\nOmniverse on a shoot? Yes.\nI expect NVIDIA may even be underestimating the demand for those individuals \u2013 partly because as their tools and partner tools get massively more powerful and easier-to-use, it may not even take an entire team to do great work.\nNow, the wait is on just for connectors. 3DS Max, Photoshop, Maya, Substance, and awesomely, Unreal Engine are all supported. But keep an eye out for Blender, Marvelous Designer, Solidworks, and Houdini for even more sign this is on.\nIt\u2019s an open beta; keeping an eye on the convention is a chance to stay posted:\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/omniverse/\nAnd yes, yes Unreal:\n\n\n\nThe new RTX stuff is here\nIt\u2019s tough to mention anything to do with semiconductors right now, given the global shortage that\u2019s on. But yeah, the new pro RTX architecture looks predictably insanely great, for anyone doing real-time visuals, rendering, graphics, and AI.\nSo, if you\u2019re planning to make your proud reentry into music festivals in 2022 with that fully immersive 3D opera involving live artificial intelligence, you\u2019ll want to go ahead and write these into the grant application.\nDesktops get the A5000 and A4000. Laptops get A2000, A3000, A4000, and A5000.\n\u201cBut how will I fit them in my case?\u201d the tiny man wonders. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need a bigger boat.\u201d And then he stares into one too long and a whole Kubrick dream sequence starts, alas.\nEither way, you get all the new technology for tons of creative use. Also, even though there\u2019s the mention of \u201cpro,\u201d these laptop chips fit in low-power, thin and light machines. You could wind up buying them in a reasonably inexpensive notebook computer and using it to run a live stream. \nEven apart from all the utterly essential graphics applications, that\u2019s good news for music, because the ongoing pandemic ripples are likely to disrupt at least some international travel for the foreseeable future. Oh yeah, and it also means thin-and-light PCs with NVIDIA architectures to compete with Apple\u2019s own silicon solutions. (I wouldn\u2019t write out Apple from possibly future pro interoperability with these architectures, too.)\nYep, laptops will have these \u2013 though keep an eye on the semiconductor shortage to see what\u2019s shipping when, as it\u2019s \u2026 a doozy, generally.\nBut the performance gains are huge \u2013 in short:\nRT cores with up to 2X the previous generation\u2019s throughput (for tracing your rays, shading your whatever, all that jazz)Third-generation Tensor Cores, also up to 2X throughput (so you can make a HAL that might open the pod bay doors even before someone has to ask)CUDA cores (2.5X FP32 throughput) for \u2026 everything (and possibly even some audio/music applications, but certainly anything that uses the word \u2018render\u2019 in it)\nAssuming some pros are the right generation for this, so \u2013 \u201cIt will be mine. Oh yes.\u201c\nSpecific to desktop:\nUp to 24GB GPU memory (or even 48GB with a two-GPU NVLink rig)Virtualization (tell the server admin)PCIe Gen 4 (twice the previous bandwidth \u2013 yeah, you might want your actual data transfer to catch up with the chip specs above, so this is essential)\nSpecific to laptop:\nThird-gen Max-Q \u2013 so it doesn\u2019t sound like a you\u2019re vacuuming the carpet any more (\u201cwhisper\u201d quiet is the phrase you want)Up to 16 GB GPU memory\nAlso specific to pretty high-end workstation laptops, the the NVIDIA T1200 and NVIDIA T600 refresh of the Turing architecture is out. (That either means something to you because you use multiple-application workflows, or nothing to you and is a cool name.)\nI might note, too, that these don\u2019t look quite like the specs of that Apple Silicon stuff \u2013 not at the M1 level. I think it\u2019s safe to say that for now, these are different use cases. But I also wouldn\u2019t worry about it, either \u2013 the general scene is that working with 3D, video, AI, and streaming all get substantially easier in 2021 industry-wide, once chips get out there.\nI also can imagine making an investment this year that lasts a good while, which is what happens when you do make a generational leap.\nAI on the cloud\nWithout going into too much detail (I\u2019ll leave that to NV), there is also a bunch of news this week for delivering GPU acceleration and (crucially for servers) AI computation via the cloud. There are a lot of \u201ccool demo!\u201d capabilities \u2013 machine translation, speech recognition, face recognition, eye contact, and live video processing continue to evolve through machine learning techniques from NVIDIA. (Yes, that also means more uncanny valley stuff and questions about the fabric of society, surveillance, and reality.) \nBut it means the ability to do stuff with big volumes of data, and in a way that doesn\u2019t actually require you to be a huge enterprise to use.\nThis also deals with science \u2013 meaning artists who do understand machine learning now can make these topics relatable to the public. That\u2019s potentially important, as we live in a world that demands more scientific understanding. (NVIDIA included an AstraZeneca chemistry example \u2013 and suddenly our lives are all revolving around that chemistry.)\nI\u2019ve been critical of some of the very examples NVIDIA uses here \u2013 like Spotify making playlist personalization more \u201cefficient.\u201d That\u2019s nothing new \u2013 automating music based on trends and profit is basically as old as the music industry. But to really be able to criticize these things, I think it matters that musicians can understand, re-engineer, explain, and advocate with a solid grounding in the science and technology behind the topic. In the case of music, it\u2019s now more complex to talk about the impact of playlists when they\u2019re AI-driven than when you could point to something as intuitive as \u201cpayola.\u201d\nBut science? Yeah, you can do genome analysis on your laptop.\n\n\n\nAnd they continue to advance the state of the art in machine learning \u2013 even with smaller data sets:\n\n\n\nWatch this space\nI realize this was a very niche look at this stuff and will cause anyone not familiar with the area to have their eyes glaze over.\nBut AI + graphics + 3D + collaboration capabilities will pour into more recognizable use cases soon, powered by this tech.\nAnd watch this space for what this might mean for artists, musicians, and creativity using tools like Unreal. Because there is no question in my mind that Unreal and Blender might well be mentioned in the same breath as Ableton Live and a Eurorack rig more frequently in the coming months and years.\nBut hey, at the very least, maybe tonight you\u2019ll dream about standing on top of a surrealist skyscraper, gazing up at a King Kong-sized graphics card, and shouting at it \u201cwhen are you shipping? why do these crypto people keep buying you? I just want to play some video games!\u201c\nGiant video card is listening. (Cue 2001-style Ligeti soundtrack\u2026 aeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\u2026\u2026)\nAlso, this is super cute \u2013 and great to see what young people are doing with this stuff, especially knowing this is a tough time for them and they deserve some fresh opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n \n\nTags: a3000, a5000, artits, chips, cloud, collaboration, CUDA, GPU, Hardware, machine learning, Omniverse, Unreal, Unreal Engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious postPremiere: Dark Forces by The Allegorist plunges us into a gorgeously surreal, shamanistic future \n\nNext postNotch just added killer NVIDIA Broadcast support with cool features like body tracking \n\n\n\nRelated posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealUnreal Engine \nThis artist is connecting Unreal, Ableton Live for production-grade visualizers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware \n303 Day: the freaky CDM Megaroundup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware \nIn flickering feedback, an audiovisual synth hums and sings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware \nUkrRack, the all-Ukrainian modular system in action, module details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDM is a home for people who make and play music and motion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet news and special deals from us in your inbox weekly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOpt in to receive news and updates.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you!\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade by Create Digital Media, GmbH in Berlin\n\n\n\nImpressum\nContact us\nSubmit a news item\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But the content those phones can create can\u2019t compare to the quality of those made with a good camera.\nBritish entrepreneur Vishal Kumar\u2019s startup Photogram wants to combine the benefits of mirrorless cameras \u2014 replete with interchangeable lenses, big sensors, and often complex, fiddly controls \u2014 with the smarts and connectivity of your smartphone.\nThe Alice Camera, due for release in October for around $760 to early backers on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, is, first of all, a compact, mirrorless camera.\nThe Alice camera focuses on what cameras do well\u2026\nBut its machined aluminum body is sleeker than other mirrorless cameras. There\u2019s no onboard screen or viewfinder of any kind \u2014 just a shutter button, a control wheel and a cold-shoe adapter.\nInstead, photographers mount their smartphone to the Alice camera. Alice focuses on what smartphones can\u2019t do: it houses a big, light-soaking sensor, and it can be screwed to a wide array of lenses.\nAlice links to your smartphone via a 5Ghz Wi-Fi connection \u2014 so your smartphone can do what traditional cameras can\u2019t do. An app on your phone provides not just an easily updatable software interface on the smartphone\u2019s big, bright screen, but the connectivity to easily share images and stream video.\nThe secret ingredient: an AI built using NVIDIA GPU-accelerated deep learning to help photographers wring the most out of Alice\u2019s hardware.\nA Star Is Born\nKumar, whose startup is part of NVIDIA Inception, an acceleration program that offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for AI, data science and HPC startups, sees the opportunity for this device literally staring everyone in the face.\nThere are more than 1 billion active Instagram users, more than 1 billion active TikTok users, and more than 2.3 billion YouTube users. Social media influencers who can deliver great content to all these users become instantaneous global superstars, Kumar explains.\nConsider Charli D\u2019Amelio, who has more than 115 million followers, or Addison Rae, with more than 86 million, or YouTube star Mr. Beast, with more than 71 million followers.\nContent creators like these may rely, in large part, on smartphone users to provide an audience. Most, however, left their smartphones behind long ago, adopting more sophisticated gear to create their content.\nFirsthand Frustration\n\u2026 and relies on a user\u2019s smartphone, mounted on the back, to do what smartphones do well.\nKumar, a self-described cultural data scientist, learned this firsthand working as a data scientist at Sotheby\u2019s. Great photography was vital to sparking worldwide interest in the auction house\u2019s offerings on social media.\n\u201cI was thinking a lot about how data science and machine learning and artificial intelligence could be applied to create video and imagery,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cI was using a camera all the time to create video content and becoming increasingly frustrated with operating them.\u201d\nA Camera for Creators\nAnd, for serious content creators, a better camera than the smartphone they already carry around with them is definitely needed.\nIn part, that\u2019s because you can only capture so much light in the relatively compact sensors crammed into today\u2019s smartphones, Kumar explains. Bigger sensors soak up more light, so they can capture a high-quality image even in very dim lighting conditions, among other benefits.\nSo Alice is built around a Sony IMX294 10.7 megapixel 4/3 sensor optimized for high-quality and full-width 4K video. The sensor is eight times bigger than that of a typical smartphone.\nIn front of that big sensor is a Micro Four Third lens mount. The compact interchangeable lens system gives users access to more than 100 lens options from Olympus, Panasonic, and specialty lens makers such as Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina.\nUsers will be able to choose from 16mm-equivalent fish-eye lenses for a super-wide angle of view or 800mm-equivalent telephone zoom lenses able to get clear, undistorted pictures of objects far away, with plenty of options in between.\nLike more traditional cameras, Alice can use a wide variety of lenses.\nA Classic Deep Learning Problem\nAll of this is why professional photographers continue to keep big big, expensive cameras in their toolkit. But the masses of content creators may never get the most out of dedicated cameras, Kumar explains.\nMaking more expertise more accessible to more people is a classic deep learning problem. And the technology\u2019s roots in computer vision and image recognition make training an AI to operate a camera a natural fit.\nTo build Alice\u2019s AI, Photogram CTO Liam Donovan trained an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated convolutional neural network using millions of out-of-focus and in-focus images, teaching an AI to distinguish between good and bad photos.\nOptimized for What You Do\nThe AI is a crucial element in the end-to-end deep learning image processing pipeline Photogram\u2019s team has built.\nThe result is an AI that can control and improve focusing, change exposure and automatically adjust white balance, and even perform automatic image stabilization.\nRevealed last September and positioned by Kumar as the \u201cAI camera for creators,\u201d in February the project has raised $200,000 from more than 250 backers \u2014 7x Kumar\u2019s original goal.\nUsers will eventually make Alice better at whatever photography they do, Kumar explains.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a wedding photographer, or you like to shoot cats or clothes,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cWe want people to be able to optimize our models and retrain them so their Alice camera can be more optimized for the photography they do.\u201d\nSmartphone Synergy\nRevealed last September and positioned by Kumar as the \u201cAI camera for creators,\u201d in February the project has raised $200,000 from more than 250 backers \u2014 7x Kumar\u2019s original goal.\nTo be sure, like all early-stage crowded-funded projects, Alice is still very much a work in progress. The plan, for now, is to offer Alice to early funders on Indiegogo first and to the general public later.\nHowever Alice is received, at first, with billions around the world creating and sharing images every day, sooner or later the idea is bound to click.\nImage credits: Photogram\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But whether consumers are seeking out a home loan, car loan or credit card, there\u2019s an incredible amount of work going on behind the scenes in a bank\u2019s decision \u2014 especially if it has to say no.\nTo comply with an alphabet soup of financial regulations, banks and mortgage lenders have to keep pace with explaining the reasons for rejections to both applicants and regulators.\nBusy in this domain, Wells Fargo will present at NVIDIA GTC21 this week some of its latest development work behind this complex decision-making using AI models accelerated by GPUs.\nTo inform their decisions, lenders have historically applied linear and non-linear regression models for financial forecasting and logistic and survivability models for default risk. These simple, decades-old methods are easy to explain to customers.\nBut machine learning and deep learning models are reinventing risk forecasting and in the process requiring explainable AI, or XAI, to allow for customer and regulatory disclosures.\nMachine learning and deep learning techniques are more accurate but also more complex, which means banks need to spend extra effort to be able to explain decisions to customers and regulators.\nThese more powerful models allow banks to do a better job understanding the riskiness of loans, and may allow them to say yes to applicants that would have been rejected by a simpler model.\nAt the same time, these powerful models require more processing, so financial services firms like Wells Fargo are moving to GPU-accelerated models to improve processing, accuracy and explainability, and to provide faster results to consumers and regulators.\nWhat Is Explainable AI?\nExplainable AI is a set of tools and techniques that help understand the math inside an AI model.\nXAI maps out the data inputs with the data outputs of models in a way that people can understand.\n\u201cReLU Neural Networks can be decomposed and represented exactly into linear sub-models, and you can see which factor is the most significant \u2014 you can see it very clearly, just like traditional statistical models,\u201d said Agus Sudjianto, executive vice president and head of Corporate Model Risk at Wells Fargo, explaining his team\u2019s recent work on local linear model decomposition of Deep ReLU Networks, which leads to Linear Iterative Feature Embedding (LIFE) in a research paper.\nWells Fargo XAI Development\nThe LIFE algorithm was developed to handle high prediction accuracy, ease of interpretation and efficient computation.\nLIFE outperforms directly trained single-layer networks, according to Wells Fargo, as well as many other benchmark models in experiments.\nThe research paper \u2014 titled Linear Iterative Feature Embedding: An Ensemble Framework for Interpretable Model \u2014 authors include Sudjianto, Jinwen Qiu, Miaoqi Li and Jie Chen.\nDefault or No Default\u00a0\nUsing LIFE, the bank can generate codes that correlate to model interpretability, offering the right explanations to which variables weighed heaviest in the decision. For example, codes might be generated for high debt-to-income ratio or a FICO score that fell below a set minimum for a particular loan product.\nThere can be anywhere from 40 to 80 different variables taken into consideration for explaining rejections.\n\u201cWe assess whether the customer is able to repay the loan. And then if we decline the loan, we can give a reason from a recent code as to why it was declined,\u201d said Sudjianto.\nFuture Work at Wells Fargo\nWells Fargo is also working on Deep ReLU networks to further its efforts in model explainability. Two of the team\u2019s developers will be discussing research from their paper, Unwrapping The Black Box of Deep ReLU Networks: Interpretability, Diagnostics, and Simplification, at GTC.\nLearn more about the LIFE model work by attending the GTC talk by Jie Chen, managing director for Corporate Model Risk at Wells Fargo.

They offer more memory than their consumer GeForce counterparts and come with pro drivers with certification for a wide range of CAD/BIM and other 3D applications.\nAs with all \u2018Ampere\u2019 Nvidia RTX GPUs, the new models feature new RT Cores, Tensor Cores and CUDA cores \u2013 all of which can be used concurrently for ray tracing, shading and denoising tasks in RTX-enabled software such as Unreal Engine, Enscape, Autodesk VRED, Chaos Vantage and Nvidia Omniverse.\nNvidia RTX GPUs can also be used with non RTX software, such as 3D modelling, VR and AI. Both GPUs support PCIe Gen 4, which offers double the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 3, so data can move from CPU to GPU much quicker.\nNvidia is also addressing the mobile workstation market with four new \u2018Ampere\u2019 Nvidia RTX laptop GPUs \u2013 the Nvidia RTX A2000 laptop (4 GB), Nvidia RTX A3000 laptop (6 GB), Nvidia RTX A4000 laptop (8 GB) and Nvidia RTX A5000 laptop (16 GB).\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, Nvidia continues to cater to users of 3D CAD tools that don\u2019t necessarily need RTX ray tracing capabilities.\nIt has launched two new entry-level laptop GPUs, the Nvidia T1200 and Nvidia T600, which are based on Nvidia\u2019s previous-generation Turing architecture. Expect to find these in ultra slim mobile workstations.\nNvidia Ampere pro desktop GPUs\nThis is an important launch for Nvidia as it gives architects, engineers and product designers \u2013 some of the key target users for these types of GPUs \u2013 a much more affordable entry into the significantly enhanced Nvidia RTX \u2018Ampere\u2019 family. The estimated street price of the Nvidia RTX A4000 and RTX A5000 is $1,000 and $2,250 respectively.\nOn paper, the single slot Nvidia RTX A4000 looks to be a substantial upgrade to the Turing-based Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 it replaces, which impressed us greatly when it launched in 2019.\nWith 16 GB of GDDR6 ECC memory, twice that of the Quadro RTX 4000, it should be able to handle most datasets used for real time visualisation or GPU rendering in product development.\nIt also has more than double the number of CUDA cores, and a significant uplift in single precision performance and Tensor performance. And as it\u2019s a single slot GPU with a max power consumption of 140W, it will be available in a huge range of desktop workstation form factors, including the new HP Z2 Tower G8 also launched today.\nSimilar things can be said of the dual slot Nvidia RTX A5000, which Nvidia says offers the same levels of performance as a Turing-based Quadro RTX 6000 but is less than half the price.\nWith 24 GB of GDDR6 ECC memory it\u2019s only a 50% uplift on the Quadro RTX 5000 it replaces but the RTX A5000 is expandable to 48 GB by connecting two GPUs together using Nvidia NVLink. The RTX A5000 also supports Nvidia RTX vWS (virtual workstation software) so the GPU can deliver multiple high-performance virtual workstation instances that enable remote users to share resources.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Nvidia has not released a replacement for the CAD-focused Quadro P2200 (5 GB), which was a small improvement over the Quadro P2000, which we reviewed way back in 2017. However, we expect there to be a second wave of Nvidia RTX GPUs released later this year that cater more to entry-level users.\nNvidia Ampere pro laptop GPUs\nNvidia has launched a wider spread of professional Nvidia RTX laptop GPUs, from the entry-level to the high-end, which should be available in Q2 this year in mobile workstations from all the usual suspects including HP, Dell, and Lenovo.\nThis includes the Nvidia RTX A2000 Laptop (4 GB GDDR6), RTX A3000 Laptop (6 GB GDDR6), RTX A4000 Laptop (8 GB GDDR6), and RTX A5000 Laptop (16 GB GDDR6).\nIt\u2019s good to see Nvidia giving these new GPUs a Laptop suffix. In the past there has been some confusion as to whether or not these are the same GPUs found in desktop workstation.\nHowever, in addition to having a smaller power budget than their desktop counterparts, the new laptop GPUs also have fewer CUDA, Tensor and RT cores\nRelated articles:Sony\u2019s Spatial Reality Display boosts productivity with Echo3D CMSReview: SpaceMouse Enterprise KitMastercam 2023 update revealedWATCH // D3D LIVE 2017 - Tony Gray, Solidthinking - Where do your designs begin?Review: Scan 3XS Ultimate 2D Plus with Quadro P4000 GPURenishaw\u2019s in-house training scheme for applications engineers proves fruitfulMI:Materials Gateway to give further integrated access to materials dataXJET ramps up its AM offering with new ceramic material and R&D Centre \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the DEVELOP3D community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nControlled Permeability added to AM parts by Dyndrite and Elementum3D\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3D printing the Nozzle office chair\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSiemens PAVE360 uses AMD GPUs to run on Microsoft Azure\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhy additive manufacturing needs AI\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nELM Mobility\u2019s special delivery\n\nMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008-2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street.

The reason for this is that the A30 is something we find particularly fascinating. You can see our\u00a0NVIDIA A10 A16 A4000 and A5000 Launched piece for those. In this article, we wanted to discuss the NVIDIA A30.\nNVIDIA A30 Data Center GPU\nWhat makes the NVIDIA A30 so interesting is that it is effectively a lower-performance NVIDIA A100. The NVIDIA A100 is the company\u2019s flagship, however, not every data center can handle, nor needs, 250-500W GPUs (A100 PCIe to 80GB SXM4.) With other cards such as the NVIDIA A16, the company is targeting a largely different style of card. With the NVIDIA A30, we get a card that is more similar to a less well-featured A100.\nHere are the key specs for the NVIDIA A30 GPU:\n\n\n\nPeak FP64\n5.2TF\n\n\nPeak FP64 Tensor Core\n10.3 TF\n\n\nPeak FP32\n10.3 TF\n\n\nTF32 Tensor Core\n82 TF | 165 TF*\n\n\nBFLOAT16 Tensor Core\n165 TF | 330 TF*\n\n\nPeak FP16 Tensor Core\n165 TF | 330 TF*\n\n\nPeak INT8 Tensor Core\n330 TOPS | 661 TOPS*\n\n\nPeak INT4 Tensor Core\n661 TOPS | 1321 TOPS*\n\n\n\u00a0\nMedia engines\n1 optical flow accelerator (OFA) 1 JPEG decoder (NVJPEG)\n4 Video decoders (NVDEC)\n\n\nGPU Memory\n24GB HBM2\n\n\nGPU Memory Bandwidth\n933GB/s\n\n\n\u00a0\nInterconnect\nPCIe Gen4: 64GB/s\nThird-gen NVIDIA\u00ae NVLINK\u00ae 200GB/s**\n\n\nForm Factor\n2-slot, full height, full length (FHFL)\n\n\nMax thermal design power (TDP)\n165W\n\n\nMulti-Instance GPU (MIG)\n4 MIGs @ 6GB each 2 MIGs @ 12GB each 1 MIGs @ 24GB\n\n\nVirtual GPU (vGPU) software support\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise for VMware\nNVIDIA Virtual Compute Server\n\n\n\nUnlike the new A4000 and A5000 GPUs, this card does not have display outputs. Unlike the A10, this card is a dual-slot model. With only 165W TDP, that means that a system only needs to effectively have 82.5W TDP per slot for cooling.\nWith the A10, there is an enormous jump from the T4 to A10 in terms of single slot GPU power consumption. With the A30, we do not get the same low-profile and single slot, but we get a largely similar TDP per slot as we did in the T4 generation.\nFurthermore, this is an Ampere generation part that has HBM2 memory which makes it a higher-performing part on the spectrum. For those that want to replace T4\u2019s with a newer card, or two cards for inferencing, the other interesting feature is that we get MIG or multi-instance GPU support. Each A30 can be a single 24GB GPU, or it can present itself as four 6GB GPUs or two 12GB GPUs. We showed MIG functionality at work in our recent\u00a0ASUS RS720A-E11-RS24U review. Here is where we split an A100 into two 20GB instances.\nASUS 4x A100 Nvidia Smi Mig Instances 2\nThe lower TDP helps bring this technology as well as Ampere with HBM2 to a lower power level.\nFinal Words\nThe major impact with the NVIDIA A30 is that by providing many high-end features at a lower TDP level it can be used in more systems. Cooling a 165W TDP dual-slot PCIe card is easier on a system than a 250W TDP card. As such, this expands the potential market where the new GPUs can be used in systems opening up new use cases to bring GPU inferencing to new environments.\nFor other STH GTC coverage, you can see the main site or learn a bit more about the big NVIDIA Grace and BlueField DPU announcements.

Older hardware still dominates user systems for a wide variety of reasons, so it might not come as a surprise that Nvidia has found 85% of GeForce owners have yet to purchase a raytracing capable graphics card.\n\nA comparison chart was shown during the annual Nvidia investor presentation on Monday 12 April, dubbing RTX as 'the new standard', and stating that the 85% of users still using older hardware like the GTX 1660 need to upgrade.AMD vs Nvidia 2021: which makes the best graphics cards?These are the best graphics cards of 2021We'll show you how to build a PCFrom NVIDIA\u2019s investor presentation. pic.twitter.com/Ykm0TGnmm6April 15, 2021This mirrors information shared by the official Steam Hardware Survey, painting a picture of just how little market share raytracing GPUs currently have. The survey also shows that while some cards such as the GTX 1060 are dropping in popularity, other non-RTX options such as the GTX 1650 are still making significant gains every month.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's RTX 5000 GPUs continue to face severe supply issues, with RTX 5070 Ti reportedly being even worse for launch stock than the RTX 5080\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5090 and 5080 GPU launch was frustrating and chaotic, leaving many PC gamers disappointed \u2013 exactly as the rumors predicted\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Valve)Old, but not outdatedWhile technology like raytracing is gaining popularity, there are many games that don't include it \u2013 and nor should they have to. For folk who choose to play competitive titles such as Valorant or Apex Legends, the sacrifice of framerates required for RTX graphics isn't worth the payoff, even with AI boosting DLSS.\n\nA large part of the low GeForce RTX userbase is also likely down to stock shortages and finances, with affordability being quoted across social media as a major reason people wouldn't choose to upgrade their systems.\n\nDuring the presentation, chief financial officer for Nvidia Colette Kress made a statement regarding the low stock for the new Ampere lineup: \u201cour operations team is agile and executing fantastically. We expect our supplies to increase as the year progresses\".\n\nThis is unlikely to solve other issues any time soon however, such as scalpers who use bots to scrape sites for available inventory to then resell on online auction sites like eBay, as well as cryptominers buying up large quantities of the cards to profit from the growing Ethereum and Bitcoin boom.\u00a0Even the most affordable graphics card of the Ampere line, the GeForce RTX 3060 with an RRP of $330/\u00a3300/\u20ac330, is scarcely available despite being designed with lower mining efficiency in a bid to make more stock available to gamers.\n\nThere is a growing number of games that support RTX, and Nvidia's statements make it clear that it believes this tech, alongside DLSS, will be implemented into future games as standard. For now though, many fan-favorites survive just fine without it, and it's unlikely you'll need a serious upgrade to your system if you selectively play titles that wouldn't benefit from the software.\u00a0Today's best gaming laptop deals85 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $699 $469.93ViewLow Stock $879 $599View $1,049.99 $629.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesEven Nvidia doesn't think you'll get an RTX 3080 this yearGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best graphics cards should let you play your favorite games with stunning visual effects, including life-like reflections and shadows. Sure, ray tracing may not radically improve the look of some games, but you should be the one to decide whether or not to enable it. Getting locked out just because it doesn't run well is no fun. But which graphics cards perform best in ray tracing, and what sort of performance should you expect from Nvidia and AMD? To find out, we tested all the ray-tracing capable GPUs from the two major graphics brands.Ray Tracing Test HardwarePC:\nIntel Core i9-9900K\nMSI MEG Z390 Ace\nCorsair 2x16GB DDR4-3200 CL16\nXPG SX8200 Pro 2TB\nSeasonic Focus 850 Platinum\nCorsair Hydro H150i Pro RGB\nPhanteks Enthoo Pro MGPUs:\nNvidia RTX 3090 FE\nNvidia RTX 3080 FE\nNvidia RTX 3070 FE\nNvidia RTX 3060 Ti FE\nEVGA RTX 3060 12GB\nNvidia RTX 2080 Ti FE\nNvidia RTX 2060 FE\nAMD RX 6900 XT\nAMD RX 6800 XT\nAMD RX 6800\nAMD RX 6700 XT\u00a0We've gathered all of the latest AMD RDNA2 and Nvidia Ampere GPUs into one place and commenced benchmarking. We've also included the fastest and slowest Nvidia Turing RTX GPUs from the previous generation, to show the full spectrum of performance. You can see the complete list of GPUs we've benchmarked along with specs for our test PC, which uses a Core i9-9900K paired with 32GB of DDR4-3600 memory. All of the graphics cards are reference models from AMD and Nvidia, with the exception of the RTX 3060 12GB \u2014 Nvidia doesn't make a reference card, but the EVGA card we used does run reference clocks.The premise sounds simple enough: Run a bunch of ray tracing benchmarks on all the GPUs. Things aren't quite so simple, however, as not every ray tracing enabled game will run on every GPU. Most will, but Wolfenstein Youngblood unfortunately uses pre-VulkanRT extensions to the Vulkan API and thus requires an Nvidia RTX card. Maybe the game will get a patch to VulkanRT at some point, but probably not. There are likely other pre-existing games that supported RTX cards back before AMD's RX 6000 series launched that don't properly work, but most of the games we've tried are now working okay.We've selected ten of the current DirectX Raytracing (DXR) games that work on both AMD and Nvidia GPUs for these ray tracing benchmarks. Given Nvidia's pole position in the RT hardware world \u2014 its RTX 20-series cards launched in the fall of 2018, over two years before AMD's RX 6000-series parts \u2014 it's no surprise that most DXR games were focused on Nvidia hardware. However, we did select two of the current four AMD-promoted games with DXR, just to see how things might change. Targeted developer optimizations are certainly possible.The ten games are: Bright Memory Infinite, Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Dirt 5, Fortnite, Godfall, Metro Exodus, Minecraft, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Watch Dogs Legion. Dirt 5 and Godfall are the AMD-promoted games, while most of the others are Nvidia-promoted, the exception being Bright Memory Infinite \u2014 it's currently a standalone benchmark of the upcoming expanded version of Bright Memory. We've tested at 'reasonable' quality levels for ray tracing, which mostly means maxed out settings, though we did step down a notch or two in Cyberpunk 2077 and Fortnite.Besides DXR, eight of the games also support Nvidia's DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, which uses an AI trained network to upscale and anti-alias frames in order to boost performance while delivering similar image quality. DLSS has proven to be a critical factor in Nvidia's ray tracing push, as rendering at a lower resolution and then upscaling can result in far better framerates. Metro Exodus and Shadow of the Tomb Raider currently use DLSS 1.0, which wasn't quite as nice looking and had some other oddities (Metro is slated to get a DLSS 2.0 update in the near future), so we've confined our DLSS testing to the six remaining games that implement DLSS 2.0/2.1, and we've tested all of these with DLSS in Quality mode \u2014 the best image quality mode with 2X resolution upscaling, which tends to result in similar image fidelity as native rendering with temporal AA.Because ray tracing tends to be extremely demanding, we've opted to stick with testing at only 1080p and 1440p. Nvidia's cards may be able to manage playable framerates at 4K with DLSS in some cases, but most of the cards simply aren't cut out to handle games at 4K native with DXR. We'll start with the native benchmarks at each resolution and then move on to DLSS 2.0 Quality testing.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Ray Tracing Benchmarks at 1080pImage 1 of 11(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Running 1080p ultra with DXR enabled already pushes several of the cards well below a steady 60 fps. Only the RTX 3060 Ti (which is about the same performance as an RTX 2080 Super) and the RX 6800 and above average more than 60 fps across our test suite. Even then, there are games where performance dips well below that mark.Fortnite ends up as the most demanding ray tracing game right now, followed closely by Cyberpunk 2077 and Bright Memory Infinite. All of those use DXR for multiple effects, including shadows, lighting, reflections, and more, which is why they're so demanding. Control and Minecraft also use plenty of ray tracing effects, and Minecraft actually implements what Nvidia calls \"full path tracing\" \u2014 the simple block graphics make it easier to do more ray tracing calculations.Most of the games that only implement one ray tracing effect \u2014 Dirt 5, Godfall, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider only use RT for shadows, while Metro uses it for global illumination and Watch Dogs Legion uses it for reflections \u2014 perform better, though the RTX 2060 still struggles to hit 30 fps in several games. Godfall is an interesting case as well, as not only is it AMD promoted, but it appears to use more VRAM, which can tank performance on cards with less than 12GB VRAM at times.Overall, the 3090 and 3080 take top honors, followed by the RX 6900 XT and RX 6800 XT. The RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 3070 are effectively tied, as are the RX 6800 and RTX 3060 Ti, with the RX 6700 XT and RTX 3060 12GB also landing close together. Only the RTX 2060 really falls off the pace set by the other cards. Without the two AMD-promoted games, the RX 6900 XT would have ended up closer to the RTX 3070, though it's still interesting to see how performance varies by game \u2014 AMD's GPUs did reasonably well in Dirt 5, Fortnite, Godfall, Metro Exodus, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)As you'd expect, enabling DLSS 2x upscaling via the Quality mode changes the rankings a lot. By restricting the benchmarks to the six games with DLSS 2.0 support, suddenly AMD's best only manages to rank at about the same level as the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 \u2014 and that's before turning on DLSS! With DLSS Quality mode enabled, only the RTX 2060 falls behind AMD's 6900 XT and 6800 XT in the overall rankings. Of course, as noted earlier, all of these games are inherently more Nvidia-promoted, though the level of promotion varies quite a bit.It's also interesting to see that the RTX 2080 Ti falls a bit further behind the RTX 3070 now. That makes sense, as Ampere's Tensor cores have up to four times the throughput as the Turing Tensor cores (2X for raw throughput, and another 2X for sparsity). Even with more memory and memory bandwidth, the 2080 Ti is only moderately faster than the RTX 3060 Ti.Looking at the individual charts, even at 1080p \u2014 a resolution that tends to be more CPU limited \u2014 there's still plenty of differentiation between the various GPUs. Enabling DLSS also results in impressive performance improvements even at the top of the product stack with the RTX 3090 and 3080. Cyberpunk 2077 looks to be the most CPU-limited, topping out at just under 80 fps regardless of settings on our test system, and Watch Dogs Legion also appears to encounter a bit of CPU bottlenecking. Both have lots of NPC characters roaming around, which helps explain why they hit the CPU harder.Bright Memory Infinite and Fortnite end up as the two biggest beneficiaries of DLSS Quality mode. The 3060 Ti with DLSS nearly matches the RTX 3090 at native in BMI, while in Fortnite the 3060 Ti and above with DLSS all beat the 3090 at native. Control also shows some significant performance gains, and even the RTX 2060 manages to clear 60 fps now.Despite the lack of VRAM, the RTX 2060 with DLSS actually turns in better overall performance than the RX 6700 XT and RX 6800. It may not be significantly faster than the 6800, but that it's even mentioned in the same breath shows just how much DLSS 2.0 helps, and how badly AMD needs to get its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) into the hands of game developers.There are now over 30 shipping games with DLSS 2.0 support, and you don't need to have ray tracing enabled to see performance benefits from DLSS \u2014 there are significantly more games with DLSS support than there are games with ray tracing support right now. Sixteen shipping games have DLSS 2.0/2.1 support that don't utilize ray tracing, for example. Plus, Unreal Engine and Unity both have built-in DLSS 2.0 support, meaning developers using either of those engines can easily enable DLSS in their games.Ray Tracing Benchmarks at 1440pImage 1 of 11(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Bumping the resolution up to 1440p doesn't change the overall rankings at all at native resolution, though the margin of victory does increase quite a bit in some cases. The RTX 3080 and 3090 are the main beneficiaries of the higher resolution, while the RTX 2060 takes a pretty hard hit to performance \u2014 it's the only GPU that couldn't average 30 fps or more across our test suite.Not surprisingly, multiple games do fall below 30 fps on multiple GPUs at 1440p. Only the 3080 and 3090 break 30 fps in Bright Memory Infinite and Cyberpunk 2077, and only the 3090 manages to do so in Fortnite. Godfall meanwhile clearly punishes the 2060's lack of VRAM, where it's about one third the performance of the RTX 3060. Several GPUs also struggled in Control, Minecraft, and Watch Dogs Legion.It should be pretty obvious that, of the potential ray tracing effects, reflections tend to be the most demanding, with shadows being the least demanding. Not coincidentally, RT reflections often have the most noticeable effect on image fidelity. Ray traced shadows can be nice, but the various shadow mapping techniques have gotten quite good at 'faking' it.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Where DLSS was a potential nice extra at 1080p, it's almost required to get good performance on most GPUs at 1440p. Without DLSS, none of the GPUs we tested can break 60 fps in the overall average performance chart, but with DLSS even the RTX 3070 (barely) gets there. Memory bandwidth clearly becomes a differentiating factor as well, with the 3080 and 3090 really pulling ahead in the most demanding titles \u2014 which is actually all six games in our DLSS test suite.Again, Nvidia dominates the performance charts once DLSS Quality mode gets turned on. Only the RTX 2060 fails to beat the RX 6900 XT in our overall results, and it's basically tied with the RX 6800 XT. That applies to the individual results as well, though the RX 6900 XT does tie the RTX 3060 in Fortnite. In Minecraft, meanwhile, even the RTX 2060 comes out ahead of the RX 6900 XT \u2014 along with the non-DLSS 3070 and below.There's only so much DLSS can accomplish, of course. Bright Memory Infinite, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, and Watch Dogs Legion still fail to break 30 fps with the RTX 2060. That's probably the main reason why we're not seeing an RTX 3060 6GB card \u2014 though it exists on laptops and may eventually show up on desktops. (Sigh.) If you care about image quality enough to want ray tracing, you'd be well advised to get a card with more VRAM rather than less. It's too bad that Nvidia's cards (outside of the 3060 and 3090) generally aren't as generous with VRAM as AMD's cards.Ray Tracing Winner: Nvidia, by a lot(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Considering Nvidia was the first company to begin shipping ray tracing capable GPUs, over two years ago, it's not too surprising that it comes out ahead in the ray tracing benchmarks. Technologies like DLSS prove Nvidia wasn't just whipping something up as quickly as possible, either. It knew how demanding ray tracing would be, and looked at how movie studios were optimizing performance for inspiration. Denoising of path traced images, which is at least somewhat similar to upscaling via DLSS, can dramatically improve performance.Today, Nvidia has second-generation ray tracing hardware and third-generation Tensor cores in the RTX 30-series GPUs. AMD meanwhile has first-generation ray accelerators, and no direct equivalent of Nvidia's Tensor cores or DLSS. Perhaps AMD's FSR will eventually show up and prove that the Tensor cores aren't strictly necessary, but after nearly six months since first hearing about FidelityFX Super Resolution, we're becoming increasingly skeptical.As it stands now, even without DLSS, Nvidia clearly leads in the majority of games that use DirectX Raytracing. Look at our rasterization-only GPU benchmarks and you'll find the RX 6900 XT and RX 6800 XT in spots two and three, with the RX 6800 in fifth place. With DXR, the 3080 goes from being just barely behind the 6800 XT to leading by over 30%. The same goes for the RTX 3070 and RX 6800: Without DXR, the 6800 is about 12% faster than the 3070; with DXR, the 3070 turns the tables and leads by 15%.Turn on DLSS Quality mode and things go from bad to worse for Team Red. The RTX 3080 more than doubles the performance of the RX 6900 XT, never mind the 6800 XT. The RTX 3070 also more than doubles the performance of the RX 6800. Heck, even the RTX 3060 12GB beats the 6900 XT by 16% at 1080p and 23% at 1440p. Bottom line: AMD needs FSR, and it really should have had a working solution before the RDNA2 GPUs and consoles even launched. Better late than never, hopefully.Of course there's still a bigger question of how much ray tracing really benefits the player in most games. The best ray tracing games like Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, and Minecraft show substantial visual improvements with ray tracing, to the point where we'd much rather have it on than off. (Okay, not in Fortnite where fps matters more than visuals, though it can be nice in creative mode.) But for each of those games, there are at least five other games where ray tracing merely tanks performance without a major visual benefit.It took half a decade or more for programmable shaders to really make a difference in the way games looked, and games of the future will eventually reach that point with ray tracing. But we're not there yet. Bottom line: Nvidia reigns as the king of ray tracing GPUs for games. Now we just need more games where the visual benefits are worth the performance hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nray tracing\nDirectX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (9)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

AMD is picking up but I still think nVidia has a bit of a head start with the hardware aspect of Ray Tracing.

In January, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it was looking into the deal amid worries it could lead Arm to withdraw, raise prices or reduce the quality of its services to Nvidia's rivals.Mr Dowden has now ordered it to begin a \"phase one\" investigation, which will decide whether a full \"phase two\" investigation is needed that could lead to the deal being blocked.A spokesperson for Nvidia said: \"We do not believe that this transaction poses any material national security issues.\"We will continue to work closely with the British authorities, as we have done since the announcement of this deal.\"'Premier computing company' Last year, more than 2,000 business leaders signed an open letter calling on the prime minister to stop the merger, saying UK jobs and influence could be lost.Nvidia has promised to keep Arm based in the UK, to hire more staff, and to retain its brand.It said that the deal would create \"the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence\".Nvidia could face barriers from other regulators around the world.China, in particular, has already made clear that it is not happy about a deal which gives so much power to an American giant at a time when the US has sought to deny Chinese firms access to chip technology.The CMA will have until 30 July to submit its findings to the digital secretary. When Arm was sold to Japan's  SoftBank just after the 2016 EU referendum, the government celebrated the deal as a vote of confidence in the UK. Some had misgivings about what they saw as the jewel in the crown of 21st Century British technology falling into foreign hands, but guarantees that research and development would be strengthened in Cambridge seemed to allay ministers' concerns. Then when SoftBank sold Arm on to the American chip giant Nvidia last year, there were even louder complaints from the likes of Hermann Hauser who had been instrumental in the founding of the company more than 30 years ago. But it seemed there was even less likelihood of an intervention - what business of the Competition and Markets Authority was a deal between a Japanese and an American company? But much has changed since 2016. Arm being bought by Nvidia is, it appears, a national security concern now in a way that the Softbank deal was not. Why? Well the vital importance of the semiconductor industry has become clear in recent months, with chips at the centre of a US-China trade war and chip shortages halting production at car plants. There has also been a major shift in the UK's attitude towards industrial policy. After three decades of a laissez-faire approach from both Conservative and Labour governments there's a new willingness to intervene - witness the move to spend taxpayers' money on a controlling stake in the failing satellite business OneWeb. With other governments and regulators around the world not convinced that Nvidia owning Arm will be good for competition in the chip industry, it is far from certain that this deal will go through.Nvidia takeover of chip designer Arm investigatedUK tech firm ARM sold to America's Nvidia for $40bnUK plans tailored set of rules for each tech giantARM's sale could put tech sector 'in jeopardy'ARM: Can 'crown jewel' of UK tech be protected?ARM HoldingsNvidiaAppleRelatedUK chip designer Arm sees shares almost double13 Feb 2024BusinessUK chip designer Arm shares surge in market return14 Sep 2023BusinessUK chip giant Arm hopes for market value of $50bn6 Sep 2023BusinessMore4 days agoApple encrypted data row hearing begins in secretThe BBC - along with civil liberties groups and some US politicians - argue the case should be heard in public.4 days agoTechnology5 days agoPressure grows to hold secret Apple data privacy hearing in publicCivil liberties campaigners have joined US politicians and the BBC in saying Friday's hearing should not be secret.5 days agoTechnology6 days agoSecret hearing on Friday in Apple and UK government data rowThe BBC understands the dispute over accessing encrypted data is set to be heard at the High Court.6 days agoTechnology4 Mar 2025Apple takes legal action in UK data privacy rowThe tech giant is appealing a government order for access to customers' private data, the BBC understands.4 Mar 2025Technology27 Feb 2025US intelligence head 'not told' about UK's secret Apple data demandTulsi Gabbard said she was seeking further information from the FBI and other US agencies.27 Feb 2025TechnologyBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
