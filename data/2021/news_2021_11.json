While it\u2019s not the only driver for the stock, its role in the lidar industry has played a key part in its continued success. Thankfully, for those interested in lidar stocks, a recent move by Nvidia shows that things are starting to heat up again for the industry.\n\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn the battle for lidar dominance, chipmaker Nvidia appears to be the tie that binds the various lidar suppliers together. Its self-driving car platform, Nvidia Drive Hyperion, has become the de facto standard for carmakers. \nBut NVDA stock isn\u2019t the only name that should be on your radar if you\u2019re looking for lidar stocks to buy.\nEarlier this week, lidar darling Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) was the latest to make headlines by joining the Nvidia fold. The DRIVE platform, enabled with Luminar\u2019s technology, will be available for vehicle models starting in 2024. \nWith this latest announcement, Nvidia now has six lidar sensor vendors \u2014 including Baraja, Hesai Technology, Innoviz (NASDAQ:INVZ), Magna (NYSE:MGA) and Ouster (NYSE:OUST) \u2014 all developing lidar sensors to run on the Drive platform. Microvision\u2019s (NASDAQ:MVIS) A-Sample lidar is also rumored to have an Nvidia chip inside \u2014 although there has been no confirmation by either company.\u00a0\nAs frequent InvestorPlace readers know, lidars, or light detection and ranging systems, are laser-based sensors that detect the environment around them. Carmakers see lidar as a key technology to develop self-driving and advanced safety technology. Nvidia\u2019s products provide the computing power for autonomous vehicles. Together, the combination provides a complete package for automakers.\nNow, the question you\u2019re probably asking is why does Nvidia\u2019s platform need nine unique lidar sensors? Carmakers aren\u2019t likely to choose all nice companies for commercialization. And that means the lidar industry is ripe for consolidation.\nSo, what\u2019s going on in lidar? Here\u2019s a closer look at how Nvidia\u2019s involvement in the space might indicate great things to come for some lidar stocks moving forward.\n\nNVDA: Playing the Field\nWhen it comes to lidar, carmakers are playing the field, so to speak. Most self-driving carmakers are experimenting with different sensors. That way, they can modify how many sensors they use, where they put them and test out the different types. Carmakers also use different configurations to test new features and improve safety and self-driving capabilities. \nAs a result, no carmaker appears locked in with any single lidar supplier. That very sentiment \u2014 that decisions are still being made \u2014 has also been underscored by our recent conversations with lidar executives, including Innoviz CEO Omer Keilaf and Microvision CEO Sumit Sharma.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s clear carmakers are exploring the various lidar technologies on offer. It\u2019s also clear that the lidar players themselves are still working toward a final lidar product. So, by working with multiple lidar suppliers, Nvidia is able to provide carmakers with different plug-in technology solutions the company views as both good enough and scalable.\u00a0\nBy aggregating the best lidar solutions to its platform. Nvidia may also be setting the industry up for consolidation. Many industry observers, including the lidar CEOs themselves, have said it\u2019s too difficult for multiple lidar companies to develop technology good enough for mass commercialization. \u201cThe market will eventually consolidate. Some sensors are used for reference and ground truth measurement, some for real long term series production,\u201d said Keilaf in a statement to InvestorPlace.\u00a0\nIn fact, in our most recent conversation with Microvision, Sharma indicated that cost may ultimately be the single most important factor determining carmakers\u2019 decisions. Having an end-to-end system, instead of various individual technologies (e.g., cameras, sensors or maps), may be the most cost-effective way of making autonomous driving mainstream. This desire for integration seems to have been the motivating factor for computing giant Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) decision to acquire Mobileye back in 2017.\nWho\u2019s on What Wavelength?\nFor carmakers, one issue still undecided is which lidar offers the best recipe for performance and price. Right now, it\u2019s unclear whether 905 or 1550 nanometer lidar solutions will prevail. Case in point: Luminar and Innoviz, both of which have been selected by Nvidia. Yet, the lidars use different wavelengths (Luminar uses 1550; Innoviz uses 905).\nEach lidar camp has a story to tell for why its technology is superior. For its part, Innoviz provided a strong endorsement for its 905 nm technology. The lidar company\u2019s Q3 earnings call featured a guest appearance by Richard Rau, vice president of sensors, control units and software for BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY). Rau stated \u201cspecifically the specific IP Innoviz brings to the table clearly tells from my perspective the overall optimization towards the 905 with specifics that Innoviz can provide.\u201d\u00a0\nLuminar, Nvidia\u2019s newest partner, isn\u2019t lacking for high-profile carmaker relationships. Swedish automaker Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) has already selected the company\u2019s lidar in new vehicles capable of hands-free, eyes-off highway driving beginning in 2022. The partnership also includes Gores Guggenheim\u2019s (NASDAQ:GGPI) upcoming Polestar 3 from Volvo\u2019s new electric-car division as well as a range of Volvo-branded cars and SUVs.\n\nBased on the company\u2019s latest announcement, Nvidia\u2019s vehicle computing platform will begin production with Luminar sensors in 2024. Finally, adding more fuel to the fire, a few weeks ago, the company was the object of speculation as a potential supplier to electric vehicle (EV) upstart Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID).\u00a0\nThe Bottom Line on Lidar Stocks\nAfter years of hype, self-driving car technology is finally becoming real. And Nvidia\u00a0is moving carmakers one step closer to making these technology decisions. As an investor looking at lidar stocks, the tricky part is figuring out which companies are developing partnerships that will result in volume production contracts with carmakers. \nRight now, there are no clear answers. But, as carmakers start to demonstrate their preferences, expect to see consolidation in the lidar industry.\u00a0\nYour comments and feedback are always welcome. Let\u2019s continue the discussion.

Here\u2019s how much shares are up since the announcement.\nWhat Happened: Jim Cramer decided to take his bullish stance on chip company NVIDIA Corporation NVDA one step further back in 2017.\nOn June 20, 2017, Cramer shared a picture of his dog \u201cEverest,\u201d who was given the second name of \u201cNvidia.\u201d\n\nMr. Everest Nvidia meet the world! pic.twitter.com/5GvTecuNyz\r\n\u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) June 20, 2017\n\nCramer asked why dogs only have one name and said they should be given two names to make it more formal.\n\u201cHe has a last name and his name is Nvidia,\u201d Cramer said of his dog, Everest.\nCramer shared a picture of the dog and the new name on Twitter and said during an interview from the trading floor that he encouraged people to give their dogs a last name.\n\u201cI think that every dog deserves a last name,\" adding that people should name their dogs after \u201ca stock that\u2019s been good to you.\u201d\nRelated Link: 3 Stocks That Could Hit $1 Trillion Market Cap Next\u00a0\nInvesting $1,000 In NVDA: Investors who invested in Nividia shares after Cramer\u2019s announcement have been pleasantly rewarded. Perhaps Cramer created a fund for his dog after the name change that could be up a significant amount as well.\nNividia has been a top performer since\u00a0the dog's name update and\u00a0shares are up 145% year-to-date in 2021.\nA $1,000 investment in NVDA shares at the high price on June 20, 2017, could have bought 24.73 shares, based on a split-adjusted high price of $40.44.\nThe $1,000 investment would be worth $7,850.79 today based on a current share price of $317.46 for NVDA.\nThis marks a hypothetical return of 685% over a period of around four and a half years.\nImage (not Cramer's dog)\u00a0by\u00a0Randy Rodriguez\u00a0from\u00a0Pixabay\u00a0\nNVDANVIDIA Corp$116.14-2.84%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

It is estimated that investments in semiconductor fab would be an all-time high of around $100 billion in 2022. Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, ended fiscal 2021 on a mixed note, reporting weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter after beating estimates in the trailing five quarters.\nThe Santa Clara-based tech firm disappointed the market last week with its rather unimpressive quarterly results. The stock pulled back from the recent peak following the earnings announcement and entered a volatile phase.\nBuy AMAT?\nBut the downturn is unlikely to continue as AMAT has the potential to bounce back quickly, being part of a fast-growing industry. The company has been around for many decades and its fundamentals are quite strong. Going by analysts\u2019 bullish view, it is doubtful if there was a better time to buy the stock. The current target price points to a 14% growth in the next twelve months, a trend that should continue in the long term. \u00a0\n\nQ4 Revenue Up 31%\nIn the final three months of fiscal 2021, earnings missed estimates after beating Wall Street\u2019s forecast consistently over the past several quarters. Fourth-quarter profit, adjusted for special items, rose sharply to $1.94 per share. At $6.12 billion, revenues were up 31% year-over-year, mainly reflecting a 40% growth in the core semiconductor systems revenue. \u00a0\n\u201cFor Applied, our issues are relatively narrow, and we are proactively collaborating with our suppliers and directly with the chip companies to find solutions and work around bottlenecks. I deeply appreciate their partnership and teamwork as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances together. Looking further ahead, I believe we will see permanent changes in the way supply chains are designed and operated,\u201d said Gary Dickerson, chief executive officer of Applied Materials, during his post-earnings interaction with analysts.\nBullish View\nIt seems the company is set to begin the new fiscal year on a bright note, thanks to its massive order backlog. Enterprise spending on semiconductor equipment and materials remains elevated, continuing the pandemic-era boom. The management\u2019s long-term growth strategy underscores the encouraging market conditions.\n\nWhere is Nvidia headed after reaching $800-billion valuation?\n\nAfter withdrawing from a record high, Applied Materials\u2019 stock lost about 5% in recent weeks but stayed above its 52-week average. The value has more than doubled in the past twelve months, making AMAT one of the best-performing stocks during that period. It made modest gainst in the pre-market session on Tuesday, after closing the previous session at $150.03.\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nStocks you may like:\nApple (AAPL) Stock\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Stock\nInternational Business Machines Corp.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia is on top of the world, but its rivals are gaining steam      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor  November 11, 2021 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA       INTC       AMD       AAPL         This article was first featured in Yahoo Finance Tech, a weekly newsletter highlighting our original content on the industry. Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. Subscribe Wednesday, November 11, 2021 Nvidia is still the graphics king, but AMD, Intel, and Apple are making moves Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a sweeping array of new technologies at its GTC conference this week, ranging from an AI-powered chauffeur that can park your car to a tool to predict the paths of wildfires. All of this from a company that started out selling graphics cards for gamers. But Nvidia still makes the majority of its money from the sale of those cards. Its gaming unit accounted for 47% of total revenue in the second quarter, while the data center business accounted for 36%.  And while Nvidia dominates with roughly 83% of market share compared to AMD's (AMD) 17%, it has serious competition angling to take its crown. First, there's Apple (AAPL), which has quickly built out its own laptop chips with graphics capabilities that it says can tangle with Nvidia\u2019s best offerings. And waiting in the wings is Intel (INTC), which is set to launch its own line of graphics chips that could prove especially troublesome for Nvidia. That's because unlike Apple's chips, Intel's graphics processors will find their way into Windows laptops and desktops. Windows PCs are the go-to computers for gamers around the world, and if Intel pushes out chips that can rival Nvidia's capabilities, it could threaten the gaming titan in the long term. Intel, Apple, and AMD are looking to take own Nvidia Nvidia is a beast in the gaming market and AI business, but it\u2019s quickly gaining new rivals. While the company\u2019s RTX cards are some of the most powerful around, they aren\u2019t the only option for consumers and businesses.   Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, shows the NVIDIA Volta GPU computing platform at his keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking  \u00b7 Rick Wilking / reuters While AMD doesn\u2019t have Nvidia\u2019s market share, it\u2019s got the kind of capabilities that gamers are looking for at similar prices. Intel, meanwhile, is preparing to roll out the first real competitors to mainstream Nvidia and AMD graphics in the form of its Arc Alchemist chips for laptops and desktop cards. \u201cIntel has already got all the support for gaming in its GPUs, because Intel is actually the biggest GPU vendor in the market with its integrated GPUs,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Alan Priestley. But those chips, he says, don\u2019t offer the kind of graphics capabilities of discrete graphics chips that have their own memory. They\u2019re more in line with playing Solitaire rather than, say, \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d But Intel\u2019s new chips, based on its Xe-HPG microarchitecture, appear to have all of the features necessary to take on Nvidia.   Story Continues Intel says its chips will support technologies like DirectX Ray Tracing, variable rate shading, and mesh shading \u2014 basically all things that make games look and run well. It's taking a direct swipe at Nvidia\u2019s most important business.\u201cThe challenge for Intel is going to be whether it can gain share, because it's either got to gain share from Nvidia or AMD or grow the market,\u201d Priestley said.Intel isn\u2019t Nvidia\u2019s only new competitor. Apple has become a surprising dark horse in the graphics game with its M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Powering the company\u2019s MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch, the chips make Apple\u2019s laptops, according to the company\u2019s own numbers, every bit as capable in terms of graphics performance as those running Nvidia chips.According to Apple\u2019s testing, the M1 Max-powered MacBook Pro 16-inch with 64GB of RAM beats out Razer\u2019s Blade 15 Advanced running an Intel Core i9, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 in both performance and power efficiency. Both systems are roughly the same price.There are some caveats there, of course. Namely that Apple doesn\u2019t play much in the gaming space. Sure, there are games available through the App Store, but if you\u2019re looking for AAA titles from the world\u2019s biggest developers, you\u2019ll find them on PC.It\u2019s not just gaming where Nvidia is facing stiffer competition, though. AMD on Monday rolled out its new MI200 GPU for high performance computing and AI acceleration, with its sights set on taking on Nvidia in the data center space. Not to be left out, Intel is expected to bring out its own Ponte Vecchio GPU in 2022 for AI applications.Nvidia is still as formidable as they comeDespite staring down strong contenders, Nvidia is still a powerhouse \u2014 in large part because of its software.\u201cThey make their products very sticky by creating software infrastructure that makes it hard for customers to shift, particularly in the data center,\u201d explained Matt Bryson, SVP of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cSo I really think that that is the differentiation that they've created both in gaming and in the data center space. And that it's just really hard for competitors to replicate that.\u201dNvidia also benefits by selling full-on supercomputers for AI applications, which can go for hundreds of thousands of dollars.What\u2019s more, Nvidia benefits from largely working only with GPUs. Unlike AMD, it doesn\u2019t sell both CPUs and GPUs, and unlike Intel, it isn\u2019t reentering the discrete GPU market. The company is set to launch its own CPU code named Grace to ensure it can provide its customers with its own CPU \u2014 but so far it\u2019s been able to focus all of its efforts on GPUs.\u201cNvidia has had that part of the market to itself. It has the resources to invest into the markets, both gaming and the data center, which has helped it build its business,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIt has one product GPUs, basically.\u201dStill, Nvidia\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t sitting idly by. And while the company is the market leader for now, there\u2019s no guarantee it will stay that way forever. It needs to continue to innovate at a rapid clip if it wants to hold on to its position at the top.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Simply type a phrase like \u201csunset at a beach\u201d and AI generates the scene in real time. Add an additional adjective like \u201csunset at a rocky beach,\u201d or swap \u201csunset\u201d to \u201cafternoon\u201d or \u201crainy day\u201d and the model, based on generative adversarial networks, instantly modifies the picture.\nWith the press of a button, users can generate a segmentation map, a high-level outline that shows the location of objects in the scene. From there, they can switch to drawing, tweaking the scene with rough sketches using labels like sky, tree, rock and river, allowing the smart paintbrush to incorporate these doodles into stunning images.\nThe new GauGAN2 text-to-image feature can now be experienced on NVIDIA AI Demos, where visitors to the site can experience AI through the latest demos from NVIDIA Research. With the versatility of text prompts and sketches, GauGAN2 lets users create and customize scenes more quickly and with finer control.\n\nAn AI of Few Words\nGauGAN2 combines segmentation mapping, inpainting and text-to-image generation in a single model, making it a powerful tool to create photorealistic art with a mix of words and drawings.\nThe demo is one of the first to combine multiple modalities \u2014 text, semantic segmentation, sketch and style \u2014 within a single GAN framework. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist\u2019s vision into a high-quality AI-generated image.\nRather than needing to draw out every element of an imagined scene, users can enter a brief phrase to quickly generate the key features and theme of an image, such as a snow-capped mountain range. This starting point can then be customized with sketches to make a specific mountain taller or add a couple trees in the foreground, or clouds in the sky.\nIt doesn\u2019t just create realistic images \u2014 artists can also use the demo to depict otherworldly landscapes.\nImagine for instance, recreating a landscape from the iconic planet of Tatooine in the Star Wars franchise, which has two suns. All that\u2019s needed is the text \u201cdesert hills sun\u201d to create a starting point, after which users can quickly sketch in a second sun.\nIt\u2019s an iterative process, where every word the user types into the text box adds more to the AI-created image.\nThe AI model behind GauGAN2 was trained on 10 million high-quality landscape images using the NVIDIA Selene supercomputer, an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system that\u2019s among the world\u2019s 10 most powerful supercomputers. The researchers used a neural network that learns the connection between words and the visuals they correspond to like \u201cwinter,\u201d \u201cfoggy\u201d or \u201crainbow.\u201d\nCompared to state-of-the-art models specifically for text-to-image or segmentation map-to-image applications, the neural network behind GauGAN2 produces a greater variety and higher quality of images.\nThe GauGAN2 research demo illustrates the future possibilities for powerful image-generation tools for artists. One example is the NVIDIA Canvas app, which is based on GauGAN technology and available to download for anyone with an NVIDIA RTX GPU.\nNVIDIA Research has more than 200 scientists around the globe, focused on areas including AI, computer vision, self-driving cars, robotics and graphics.

Thousands of customers are realizing significant price performance benefits for a wide variety of workloads with Graviton2-based instances.\nToday, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 G5g instances that extend Graviton2 price-performance benefits to GPU-based workloads including graphics applications and machine learning inference. In addition to Graviton2 processors, G5g instances feature NVIDIA T4G Tensor Core GPUs to provide the best price performance for Android game streaming, with up to 25 Gbps of networking bandwidth and 19 Gbps of EBS bandwidth.\nThese instances provide up to 30 percent lower cost per stream per hour for Android game streaming than x86-based GPU instances. G5g instances are also ideal for machine learning developers who are looking for cost-effective inference, have ML models that are sensitive to CPU performance, and leverage NVIDIA\u2019s AI libraries.\nG5g instances are available in the six sizes as shown below.\n\n\n\nInstance Name\nvCPUs\nMemory (GB)\nNVIDIA T4G Tensor Core GPU\nGPU Memory (GB)\nEBS Bandwidth (Gbps)\nNetwork Bandwidth (Gbps)\n\n\ng5g.xlarge\n4\n8\n1\n16\nUp to 3.5\nUp to 10\n\n\ng5g.2xlarge\n8\n16\n1\n16\nUp to 3.5\nUp to 10\n\n\ng5g.4xlarge\n16\n32\n1\n16\nUp to 3.5\nUp to 10\n\n\ng5g.8xlarge\n32\n64\n1\n16\n9\n12\n\n\ng5g.16xlarge\n64\n128\n2\n32\n19\n25\n\n\ng5g.metal\n64\n128\n2\n32\n19\n25\n\n\n\nThese instances are a great fit for many interesting types of workloads. Here are a few examples:\n\nStreaming Android gaming\u2014With G5g instances, Android game developers can build natively on Arm-based GPU instances without the need for cross-compilation or emulation on x86-based instances. They can encode the rendered graphics and stream the game over the network to a mobile device. This helps simplify development efforts and time and lowers the cost per stream per hour by up to 30 percent.\nML Inference \u2014G5g instances are also ideal for machine learning developers who are looking for cost-effective inference, have ML models that are sensitive to CPU performance, and leverage NVIDIA\u2019s AI If you don\u2019t have any dependencies on NVIDIA software, you may use Inf1 instances, which deliver up to 70 percent lower cost-per-inference than G4dn instances.\nGraphics rendering\u2014G5g instances are the most cost-effective option for customers with rendering workloads and dependencies on NVIDIA libraries. These instances also support rendering applications and use cases that leverage industry-standard APIs such as OpenGL and Vulkan.\nAutonomous Vehicle Simulations\u2014Several of our customers are designing and simulating autonomous vehicles that include multiple real-time sensors. They can use ray tracing to simulate sensor input in real time.\n\nThe instances are compatible with a very long list of graphical and machine learning libraries on Linux, including NVENC, NVDEC, nvJPEG, OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA, CuDNN, CuBLAS, and TensorRT.\nAvailable Now The new G5g instances are available now, and you can start using them today in the US East (N.

Depending on the device at hand \u2014 a CT scanner, an endoscope or an ICU in-room camera \u2014 there\u2019s a different level of computation required at each stage of the workflow.\nNVIDIA Clara Holoscan accelerates each of these phases:\n\nHigh-speed I/O: NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA through NVIDIA ConnectX SmartNICs or third-party PCI Express cards allows for streaming data directly to the GPU memory for ultra-low-latency downstream processing.\nPhysics processing: Once the data has been transmitted to the GPU, CUDA-X and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server accelerate physics-based calculations or AI processing to transform the sensor data into the image domain \u2014 for example, through image reconstruction in X-ray and CT, or beamforming in ultrasound.\nImage processing: Image data is fed into AI models using NVIDIA Triton to detect, classify, segment or track objects.\nData processing: By combining image data streaming from the sensor with other previously acquired images using the NVIDIA cuCIM library, developers can perform registration or enhance the data with supplemental information like electronic health records.\nRendering: The device data and resulting predictions can be visualized in 3D, in real time with Clara Render Server \u2014 or as an interactive cinematic render in NVIDIA Omniverse or in augmented reality with CloudXR \u2014 for example, to give clinicians a better picture of an organ or tumor being segmented.\n\nClara Holoscan is a scalable architecture, extending from medical devices to NVIDIA-Certified edge servers, to NVIDIA DGX systems in the data center or the cloud. The platform allows developers to add as much or as little compute and input/output capability in their medical device as needed, balanced against the demands of latency, cost, space, power and bandwidth.\nAccelerating the Medical Device Ecosystem\nMany medical device companies are innovating with AI and robotics and using NVIDIA accelerated computing platforms to develop applications for robotic surgery, mobile CT scans, bronchoscopy and more.\n\nNVIDIA Clara Holoscan was developed to better support applications like these by helping device makers scale up from device to data center \u2014 and scale out by accessing the breadth of NVIDIA AI solutions.\nTo accelerate the development of real-time medical devices with a range of sensor inputs, the Clara Holoscan platform supports I/O cards from members of the NVIDIA Inception accelerator program for AI and data science startups including:\n\nAJA Video Systems \u2013 video capture cards for endoscopy and surgical visualization applications\nKAYA Instruments \u2013 video capture cards commonly used in microscopy and scientific imaging instruments.\nus4us \u2013 research front-end devices enabling development of software-defined ultrasound solutions\n\nVerasonics, a leader in ultrasound research front-end hardware, will enable support for Clara Holoscan to stream data directly to NVIDIA GPUs for processing using high-speed networking technologies.\nClara Holoscan SDK: Develop Once, Deploy Anywhere\n\nWith Clara Holoscan, developers can customize their applications to run as a series of modular microservices on the device as well as the server. Because it\u2019s software-defined, medical device companies can continue to upgrade and improve their solutions over time.\nThe Clara Holoscan SDK supports this work with acceleration libraries, AI models and reference applications in ultrasound, digital pathology, endoscopy and more to help developers take advantage of embedded and scalable hybrid-cloud compute. With an end-to-end platform for deployment, it\u2019s easier for companies to upgrade their install base, bringing new research breakthroughs to the day-to-day practice of medicine.\nTo get started, visit the NVIDIA Clara Holoscan site.

The new low-end member of the Ampere-based A-series accelerator family is designed for entry-level inference tasks, and thanks to its relatively small size and low power consumption, is also being aimed at edge computing scenarios as well.\nAlong with serving as the low-end entry point into NVIDIA\u2019s GPU accelerator product stack, the A2 seems intended to largely replace what was the last remaining member of NVIDIA\u2019s previous generation cards, the T4. Though a bit of a higher-end card, the T4 was designed for many of the same inference workloads, and came in the same HHHL single-slot form factor. So the release of the A2 finishes the Ampere-ficiation of NVIDIA accelerator lineup, giving NVIDIA\u2019s server customers a fresh entry-level card.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ML Accelerator Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA100\nA30\nA2\n\n\nFP32 CUDA Cores\n6912\n3584\n1280\n\n\nTensor Cores\n432\n224\n40\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1.41GHz\n1.44GHz\n1.77GHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n3.2Gbps HBM2e\n2.4Gbps HBM2\n12.5Gbps GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n5120-bit\n3072-bit\n128-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth\n2.0TB/sec\n933GB/sec\n200GB/sec\n\n\nVRAM\n80GB\n24GB\n16GB\n\n\nSingle Precision\n19.5 TFLOPS\n10.3 TFLOPS\n4.5 TFLOPS\n\n\nDouble Precision\n9.7 TFLOPS\n5.2 TFLOPS\n0.14 TFLOPS\n\n\nINT8 Tensor\n624 TOPS\n330 TOPS\n36 TOPS\n\n\nFP16 Tensor\n312 TFLOPS\n165 TFLOPS\n18 TFLOPS\n\n\nTF32 Tensor\n156 TFLOPS\n82 TFLOPS\n9 TFLOPS\n\n\nInterconnect\nNVLink 3\r\n\t\t\t12 Links\nPCIe 4.0 x16 +\r\n\t\t\tNVLink 3 (4 Links)\nPCIe 4.0 x8\n\n\nGPU\nGA100\nGA100\nGA107\n\n\nTransistor Count\n54.2B\n54.2B\n?\n\n\nTDP\n400W\n165W\n40W-60W\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nTSMC 7N\nTSMC 7N\nSamsung 8nm\n\n\nForm Factor\nSXM4\nSXM4\nHHHL-SS PCIe\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nAmpere\nAmpere\n\n\n\nGoing by NVIDIA\u2019s official specifications, the A2 appears to be using a heavily cut-down version of their low-end GA107 GPU. With only 1280 CUDA cores (and 40 tensor cores), the A2 is only using about half of GA107\u2019s capacity. But this is consistent with the size and power-optimized goal of the card. A2 only draws 60W out of the box, and can be configured to drop down even further, to 42W.\nCompared to its compute cores, NVIDIA is keeping GA107\u2019s full memory bus for the A2 card. The 128-bit memory bus is paired with 16GB of GDDR6, which is clocked at a slightly unusual 12.5Gbps. This works out to a flat 200GB/second of memory bandwidth, so it would seem someone really wanted to have a nice, round number there.\n\nOtherwise, as previously mentioned, this is a PCIe card in a half height, half-length, single-slot (HHHL-SS) form factor. And like all of NVIDIA\u2019s server cards, A2 is passively cooled, relying on airflow from the host chassis. Speaking of the host, GA107 only offers 8 PCIe lanes, so the card gets a PCIe 4.0 x8 connection back to its host CPU.\nWrapping things up, according to NVIDIA the A2 is available immediately. NVIDIA does not provide public pricing for its server cards, but the new accelerator should be available through NVIDIA\u2019s regular OEM partners.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n16 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nsabot00 - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nCan this play games if one virtualizes the card (to get around no display out).\n\n\n\nRU482 - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nI doubt you'd be blown away by the performance if it could\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nYes, quite likely.  Given that it's based on a GA107, performance would be similar to a RTX 3050.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Wednesday, November 10, 2021 - link\nAbout 2/3 of an RTX 3050 when you balance out the clock speed and core count differences.\n\n\n\ncatavalon21 - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nI'm trying to figure out the purpose of this card.  With a 1/32 Double Precision ratio and a core count not seen so small in accelerators since Maxwell - what niche is this filling?  As a T4 successor it falls a bit short in comparison.  Less memory bandwidth.  Fewer cores.  Less compute capability.  Just...why?\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nAs they say, its niche is inference.  For that, you mostly need int8 and BF16.Compared to their other Tesla products, what it gives you is a GPU that can run with no aux power and has the same CUDA capability as the rest of their Ampere line.  That includes tensor cores with BF16, which I think T4 is lacking.\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\n>  Less compute capability.Uh, those words have a very specific meaning, in Nvidia/CUDA context.

The move is a continued follow-on from Nvidia's earnings report last week which set the latest rally in motion. Semiconductor stocks have been having a strong year as global shortages mean demand and prices are strong. While the semiconductor sector has outperformed the main benchmarks, Nvidia is in a league of its own this year. The stock is up 153% year to date and nearly 50% in the last month. NVDA stock has seen a huge growth in both gaming revenues and chip revenues but its proposed takeover of UK chip manufacturer ARM is facing regulatory headwinds. However, that is obviously not enough to dent investor enthusiasm with Friday seeing more record highs set.\u00a0\n\nNVDA graph, 15 minute\nNvidia\u00a0stock news\nIt was really the earnings report on Wednesday that set things in motion for the latest push higher. While revenue growth is slowing it is slowing from very high level\u00a0and NVDA forecast Q4 revenue to be ahead of analyst estimates. This led to a string of price target changes from virtually all of the major Wall Street banks that cover Nvidia. Certainly, the company is in the sweet spot right now. Rising revenues and margins also remain strong at nearly 67% for gross margin. That is an exceptionally high margin number and sees revenue comfortably trickle down to strong earnings. The only headwind is the potential purchase of ARM. The UK\u00a0has cited national security concerns and now the US is also going to examine the proposed deal. But with revenue growing between 50 and 60% and a pivot into the omniverse as well as strong gaming and AI revenues, the revenue stream looks strong going forward.\u00a0Earnings per share were $1.17 versus $1.10 estimated. Revenue was $7.1 billion ahead of the $6.83 billion estimate. Nvidia also forecast Q4 revenue to increase to $7.4 billion at the mid-range.\u00a0There were strong growth signs with data centre revenue up over 55% YoY. Gaming revenue grew to $3.22 billion, up 42% YoY.\nNVDA stock forecast\nWe were slightly concerned with a potential double top formation after the impressive earnings report but this has been put behind us now with the strong performance on Friday. The short-term supports are at $313.49 and then $305 from the 9-day moving average. The only slight concern is the bearish divergence from the relative strength index (RSI). The record high on Friday is not matched by a new high in the RSI. However, divergences are not as powerful when one high was in overbought or oversold territory as was the case here. Momentum is strong so we feel the trend should continue to be used to your advantage. Breaking $313.49 would be a sign of slowing momentum and a sign to up your defence.\u00a0\n\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This confidential data \u2014 provided only to VC Alliance members \u2014 helps VCs and other backers quickly identify startups that match their investment thesis, such as industry, investment stage, region and lead.\nOnce a startup is identified, with a single click inside the VC portal, both parties are directly connected and can discuss an investment opportunity.\nEngaging Across the Startup Ecosystem\nLaunched in April, the VC Alliance offers venture capital firms and investors insights to the startup landscape, a closer relationship with NVIDIA, direct portfolio support and exposure to promising startups.\nThe types of investors who have joined the alliance as members have broadened as well, and now includes private equity, family offices and sovereign wealth funds.\nInvestment in startups is on pace this year to exceed all previous records, and valuations are at all-time highs. Meanwhile, exits since the third quarter of 2020 have more than doubled, as U.S. venture-backed startups that went public or got acquired totalled $582 billion in value, according to a PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor report.\nInception Membership Jumping\nNVIDIA Inception members, which have grown 29 percent since the start of the calendar year and more than 8 percent in the last quarter, account for roughly two-thirds of AI startups worldwide, based on industry estimates from Pitchbook.\nThese numbers continue to grow. Inception members now represent more than 100 countries, notching upwards of $65 billion in funding, making it a leading indicator of the global AI startup ecosystem.\u00a0VCs and investors can apply to access our ecosystem. If you\u2019re a startup, apply to become an Inception member.\n\n\n\nCategories: SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | GTC 2021 | Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The potential is great, but so are the challenges.\nToday\u2019s quantum computers may be too small and error-prone to solve useful problems, and it\u2019s not yet clear which quantum algorithms will provide advantages over today\u2019s classical computers.\nTo help advance research in quantum computing, NVIDIA announced at GTC 2021 the cuQuantum software development kit to speed up simulations of quantum computers on classical systems.\nSimulations help researchers rapidly design and test new quantum algorithms at a scale and performance not possible on current quantum hardware. They\u2019re also critical for helping to validate and benchmark the next generation of quantum hardware.\nWe\u2019re helping accelerate this work. Starting today, the first library from cuQuantum is in public beta, available to download.\nCalled cuStateVec, it\u2019s an accelerator for the state vector simulation method. That approach tracks the full state of the system in memory and can scale to tens of qubits.\nA second library coming in December, cuTensorNet, is an accelerator using the tensor network method. It can handle up to thousands of qubits on some promising near-term algorithms.\nAvailable on Leading Frameworks\nWe\u2019ve also integrated cuStateVec into qsim, Google Quantum AI\u2019s state vector simulator that can be used through Cirq, an open-source framework for programming quantum computers. Users can download cuQuantum and start using it today wherever they use Cirq.\n\u201cQuantum computing promises to solve tough challenges in computing that are beyond the reach of traditional systems,\u201d said Catherine Vollgraff Heidweiller at Google Quantum AI. \u201cThis high-performance simulation stack will accelerate the work of researchers around the world who are developing algorithms and applications for quantum computers.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve additionally announced a forthcoming cuQuantum integration. In December, cuStateVec will be ready for use with Qiskit Aer, a high-performance simulator framework for quantum circuits from IBM.\nBig Community Behind cuQuantum\nOur cuQuantum SDK is being adopted by many other leading players in the quantum computing industry.\nNational labs including Oak Ridge, Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, university research groups at Caltech, Oxford and MIT, and companies including IonQ are all integrating cuQuantum into their workflows.\nPasqal, a Paris-based quantum computing startup, purchased an NVIDIA DGX POD to perform massive simulations with cuQuantum. The startup\u2019s innovations will be applied to accelerating work in areas such as drug design and smart mobility.\n\u201cThe ability to perform powerful, large-scale simulations of quantum systems is vital to our work,\u201d said Loic Henriet, CTO at Pasqal. \u201cThe combination of cuQuantum software with DGX A100 hardware will dramatically accelerate our progress.\u201d\nPlug Into Quantum Simulations\nTo help developers get started, we\u2019re putting our simulation software in a container optimized to run on our NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, creating a cuQuantum Appliance.\nIt includes Google Quantum AI\u2019s Cirq framework and qsim simulator, along with cuQuantum and the NVIDIA HPC SDK. The software will be available early next year on our NGC catalog.\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated best-in-class performance using the appliance software on key problems in quantum computing such as Shor\u2019s algorithm, random quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver.\nTry cuQuantum to accelerate your quantum research today.\nLearn more about cuQuantum during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

These instances were designed to give you cost-effective GPU power for machine learning inference and graphics-intensive applications.\nToday I am happy to tell you about the new G5 instances, which feature up to eight NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs. Powered by second generation AMD EPYC processors, these instances deliver up to 40% better price-performance for inferencing and graphics-intensive operations in comparison to their predecessors.\nOn the GPU side, the A10G GPUs deliver to to 3.3x better ML training performance, up to 3x better ML inferencing performance, and up to 3x better graphics performance, in comparison to the T4 GPUs in the G4dn instances. Each A10G GPU has 24 GB of memory, 80 RT (ray tracing) cores, 320 third-generation NVIDIA Tensor Cores, and can deliver up to 250 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) of compute power for your AI workloads.\nHere are the specs:\n\n\n\nInstance Name \nNVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs\nvCPUs\nMemory\nLocal Storage\nEBS Bandwidth\nNetwork Bandwidth\n\n\ng5.xlarge\n1\n4\n16 GiB\n250 GB\nUp to 3.5 Gbps\nUp to 10 Gbps\n\n\ng5.2xlarge\n1\n8\n32 GiB\n450 GB\nUp to 3.5 Gbps\nUp to 10 Gbps\n\n\ng5.4xlarge\n1\n16\n64 GiB\n600 GB\n8 Gbps\nUp to 25 Gbps\n\n\ng5.8xlarge\n1\n32\n128 GiB\n900 GB\n16 Gbps\n25 Gbps\n\n\ng5.12xlarge\n4\n48\n192 GiB\n3800 GB\n16 Gbps\n40 Gbps\n\n\ng5.16xlarge\n1\n64\n256 GiB\n1900 GB\n16 Gbps\n25 Gbps\n\n\ng5.24xlarge\n4\n96\n384 GiB\n3800 GB\n19 Gbps\n50 Gbps\n\n\ng5.48xlarge\n8\n192\n768 GiB\n7600 GB\n19 Gbps\n100 Gbps\n\n\n\nLike their predecessors, these instances are a great fit for many interesting types of workloads. Here are a few examples:\nMedia and Entertainment \u2013 Customers can use G5 instances to support finishing and color grading tasks, generally with the aid of high-end pro-grade tools. These tasks can also support real-time playback, aided by the plentiful amount of EBS bandwidth allocated to each instance. Customers can also use the increased ray-tracing power of G5 instances to support game development tools.\nRemote Workstations \u2013 Customers in many different industries including Media and Entertainment, Gaming, Education, Architecture, Engineering and Construction want to run high-end graphical workstations in the cloud, and are looking for instances that come in a broad array of sizes.\nMachine & Deep Learning \u2013 G5 instances deliver high performance and significant value for training and inferencing workloads. They also offer access to NVIDIA CuDNN, NVIDIA TensorRT, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, and other ML/DL software from the NVIDIA NGC catalog, which have all been optimized for use with NVIDIA GPUs.\nAutonomous Vehicles \u2013 Several of our customers are designing and simulating autonomous vehicles that include multiple real-time sensors. The customers make use of ray tracing to simulate sensor input in real time, and also gather data from real-world tests using tools that benefit from powerful networking and large amounts of memory.\nThe instances support Linux and Windows, and are compatible with a very long list of graphical and machine learning libraries including CUDA, CuDNN, CuBLAS, NVENC, TensorRT, OpenCL, DirectX, Vulkan, and OpenGL.\nAvailable Now The new G5 instances are available now and you can start using them today in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and Europe (Ireland) Regions in On-Demand, Spot, Savings Plan, and Reserved Instance form.

Her scores on a national entrance exam opened the door to Tsinghua University, home to China\u2019s most prestigious engineering school.\nAlong the way, someone told her computers would be big, so she signed up for computer science before she had ever seen a computer. She learned soon enough.\n\u201cWe were building hardware from the ground up, designing microinstructions and logic circuits, so I got to understand computers from the inside out,\u201d she said.\nEasing Access to Supercomputers\nSkip forward a few years to grad school at the University of Illinois when another big door opened.\nWhile working in distributed systems, she was hired as one of the first programmers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, \u00a0one of the first sites in a U.S. program funding supercomputers that researchers shared.\nTo make the systems more accessible, she helped develop alternatives to the crude editing tools of the day that displayed one line of a program at a time. And she helped pioneering researchers like Michael Norman create visualizations of their work.\nGPUs Add AI to HPC\nIn 2005, she joined Purdue, where she has helped manage nearly three dozen research projects representing more than $60 million in grants as a senior research scientist in the university\u2019s supercomputing center.\n\u201cAll that helped when we started defining Anvil. I see researchers\u2019 pain points when they are getting on a new system,\u201d said Song.\nAnvil links 1,000 Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 server nodes with 2,000 of the latest AMD x86 CPUs and 64 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on a NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand network to handle traditional HPC and new AI workloads.\nThe system, built by Dell Technologies, will deliver 5.3 petaflops and half a million GPU cycles per year to tens of thousands of researchers across the U.S. working on the National Science Foundation\u2019s XSEDE network.\nAnvil Forges Desktop, Cloud Links\nTo harness that power, Anvil supports interactive user interfaces as well as the batch jobs that are traditional in high performance computing.\n\u201cResearchers can use their favorite tools like Jupyter notebooks and remote desktop interfaces so the cluster can look just like in their daily work environment,\u201d she said.\nAnvil will also support links to Microsoft Azure, so researchers can access its large datasets and commercial cloud-computing muscle. \u201cIt\u2019s an innovative part of this system that will let researchers experiment with creating workflows that span research and commercial environments,\u201d Song said.\nFighting COVID, Exploring AI\nMore than 30 research teams have already signed up to be early users of Anvil.\nOne team will apply deep learning to medical images to improve diagnosis of respiratory diseases including COVID-19. Another will build causal and logical check points into neural networks to explore why deep learning delivers excellent results.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll support a lot of GPU-specific tools like NGC containers for accelerated applications, and as with every new system, users can ask for additional toolkits and libraries they want,\u201d she said.\nThe Anvil team aims to invite industry collaborations to test new ideas using up to 10 percent of the system\u2019s capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s a discretionary use we want to apply strategically to enable projects that wouldn\u2019t happen without such resources,\u201d she said.\nOpening Doors for Science and Inclusion\nEarly users are working on Anvil today and the system will be available for all users in about a month.\nAnvil\u2019s opening day has a special significance for Song, one of the few women to act as a lead manager for a national supercomputer site.\nCarol Song and Purdue\u2019s Anvil supercomputer\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to be in environments where I\u2019ve always been encouraged to do my best and given opportunities,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAround the industry and the research computing community there still aren\u2019t a lot of women in leadership roles, so it\u2019s an ongoing effort and there\u2019s a lot of room to do better, but I\u2019m also very enthusiastic about mentoring women to help them get into this field,\u201d she added.\nPurdue\u2019s research computing group shares Song\u2019s enthusiasm about getting women into supercomputing. It\u2019s home to one of the first chapters of the international Women in High-Performance Computing organization.\nPurdue\u2019s Women in HPC chapter sent an all-female team to a student cluster competition at SC18. It also hosts outside speakers, provides travel support to attend conferences and connects students and early career professionals to experienced mentors like Song.\nPictured at top: Carol Song, Anvil\u2019s principal investigator (PI) and project director along with Anvil co-PIs (from left) Rajesh Kalyanam, Xiao Zhu and Preston Smith.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | COVID-19 | Customer Stories | Data Science | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | Parallel Computing | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s A Platform Company.ByKarl FreundFollowShareSaveInnovationEnterprise TechNVIDIA Is Not A Chip Company. It\u2019s A Platform Company.ByKarl Freund, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorNov 09, 2021, 04:30am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA extends its lead in accelerated computing, announcing platforms for the metaverse, healthcare, enterprise AI, autonomous vehicles, and data center security at the GTC Conference.\nNVIDIA, probably on its way to becoming a trillion dollar company, has been building platforms tailored to specific markets, while its competition is still just trying to get competitive silicon to market. Yes, startups and giants alike are bringing out some pretty competitive chips, such as the recently previewed AMD Instinct MI200 and Intel Ponte Vecchio. However, NVIDIA is far ahead of all competitors in terms of its solution portfolio and ecosystem. Consequently, none of these impending competitive threats will materially take business away from NVIDIA AI until competitors\u2019 software ecosystems emerge to turns cool silicon into real solutions. And that will be a difficult and expensive undertaking. (HPC, on the other hand, is a different story, where HPC applications can be ported by ISV\u2019s seeking to sell to supercomputing centers.)\n\n\nWhat did NVIDIA announce?\nCEO Jensen Huang kicked off the event, as usual, with a slew of announcements, but this time the solutions were the star of the show, not a shiny new chip. (But, there were new chips as well!) We cannot possibly cover all the announcements made at GTC in a blog, but here\u2019s a few worth noting.\n\nOmniverse Enterprise\nOne area Jensen has been highlighting for a while is NVIDIA Omniverse, the multi-media 3D collaboration platform that enables companies to collaborate in a metaverse using physically accurate \u201cdigital twins\u201d of the product being developed or problem being simulated. It could be a car, a factory, the planet Earth, or a new Hollywood blockbuster. Jensen announced that Omniverse Enterprise, previously in beta, is now available from global system vendors, starting at just $9K per year.\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse digital twinsNVIDIA\nSo, consider this: Facebook just became Meta, in name only for now, while NVIDIA has been creating and testing a metaverse platform (hardware, software, AI models and services) that increases productivity, collaboration, and accuracy of content creators, designers, and engineers. Real jobs, not future socializing. Why do robbers rob banks? Because thats where the money is. Same situation here. Not to be left out, Microsoft recently announced their own Metaverse platform, Mesh for Teams, to enable an immersive collaboration environment, but that is not really comparable to Omniverse. In the emerging market for the metaverse, NVIDIA is unquestionably the leader.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nNVIDIA Omniverse is connecting collaborative engineers, artists, and data professionals, and is ... [+] enabling Digital Twins.NVIDIA\n\nJensen\u2019s goal is to reach 40 million 3D developers with Omniverse. NVIDIA has worked with partners to include content and applications from third parties, including ESRI, PTC, Reallusion and Pixar for the Universal Scene Description. As for hardware, 10\u2019s of millions of NVIDIA RTX GPU users will be able to use Omniverse. (Hololens and Oculus headsets not required.)\n\n Omniverse EnterpriseNVIDIA\nNVIDIA also announced a new Avatar Creator, part of Omniverse Enterprise, and provided this shot of Jensen and his toys in an Omniverse. Nice Jacket.NVIDIA Avatar Creator, part of the Omniverse platform.NVIDIA\nWe believe Omniverse is the poster child for the dozens of platforms coming from NVIDIA, and is already integrating with other NVIDIA platforms such as the updated Maxine virtual avatar platform, which uses the NVIDIA Unified Compute Framework that unites NVIDIA platforms.MaxineNVIDIA\nAutonomous Vehicles\nPervasive, end to end support for vehicle manufacturers is another, yes, platform that provides data collection, mapping, training, simulation, driving, and an AV world model. This has now been extended with a synthetic replicator to alleviate the data labelling burden required for training AVs. A new Drive Concierge supports Automatic parking, Summoning, Digital assistant, and Confidence view in the vehicle. And of course, there is new hardware covered below.NVIDIA has been developing an end-to-end platform for AVs for several years now. Nobody comes close, ... [+] except Tesla, which comes in the form of a vehicle, not a computational and data platform.NVIDIA\nNew Hardware\nOk, there was some hardware announced as well. Jetson is getting an upgrade to the Orin SOC that is in the Drive platform for AVs, and boasts 200 Int8 TOPS with an Ampere GPU, the Deep Learning Accelerator, and 12 Arm cores. NVIDIA Jetson has had a great reception in the robotics market, and is now used by over 850K developers in over 6000 companies.Jetson Orin available Q1NVIDIA\nNVIDIA announced the new Drive Hyperion 8, combining 2 Orin SoCs with qualified sensors from four leaders, with support for 12 cameras, 9 radars, 1 lidar, and a dozen ultrasonic sensors. While Teslas gets a lot of limelight, NVIDIA boasts a full end-to-end platform (there\u2019s that word again!) for autonomy and over 16 vehicle design wins, now including Lotus.Hyperion 8NVIDIA\nFor the healthcare market, NVIDIA launched a new Clara Holoscan platform with an Arm / RTX A6000 GPU and a ConectX DPU. NVIDIA made several other announcements for Healthcare as well.Holoscan NVIDIA\nSpeaking of DPU\u2019s, NVIDIA announced another platform (Morpheus) that uses the smart network interfaces and software to create Zero-Trust Data center protection with BlueField. In a modern data center, each server can be considered a threat. So the firewall protection concept must be taken from the perimeter to each and every server.Zero Trust with DPU Bluefield and DOCANVIDIA \nConclusions\nNVIDIA, whose stock was up some 24% last week before losing a little ground on Friday, and up over 300% in the last 12 months, is already transitioning to a platform company just when competitors are vying for attention with chips. We believe these platforms will further strengthen NVIDIA in the heterogeneous compute landscape and broaden their reach considerably.\nI saw a company last week tout their advantages for edge AI. They have decent performance/watt, to be sure. But comparing to Jetson AGX is like comparing oranges to orangutans: AGX is a platform, with GPUs, DLAs, CPUs, and a rich software stack. The competition has a chip. Platforms are easier to deploy, reduce development time and expense, and enable a carrier-grade solution.

Today that\u2019s served up by advanced risk algorithms running on the fastest parallel computing systems.\nBoosting the state of the art for risk platforms, NVIDIA DGX A100 systems running Red Hat software can offer financial services firms performance and operational gains. These systems used a fraction of the energy and space of rival servers in recent benchmark tests.\nThe latest NVIDIA DGX systems, with 640GB of GPU memory each, landed eight performance records on the financial industry\u2019s widely watched STAC-A2 benchmark of financial risk models, including taking top honors for energy and space efficiency.\nSome of the largest firms on Wall Street and the broader global financial industry rely on the STAC-A2 as a key risk model benchmark to measure compute platform performance.\nThese were also the first publicly released STAC-A2 results for a solution using containers that have been audited. Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration platform, has become the de facto standard for managing containerized workloads, which are instrumental in deploying complex multi-stage workflows.\u00a0Red Hat OpenShift software\u00a0is the industry\u2019s leading enterprise Kubernetes platform.\nThe STAC-A2 results highlight the flexibility of DGX A100 systems for integrating with the latest deployment models and Red Hat as a provider of a Kubernetes environment that can meet the most demanding enterprise performance requirements.\nNearly 15x More Throughput\nThe latest NVIDIA DGX A100 systems with 640GB of GPU memory deliver 14.8x greater throughput (number of options priced per second)1 than a recently tested solution based on a single, standard CPU server \u2014 a dual-socket CPU-based system2 \u2014 as measured by the STAC-A2 benchmark. It also outperforms previously tested systems based on 10 CPU-only cloud nodes3 and 8x dual-socket CPU-based servers4.\n\u00a0\n\nThe record results from NVIDIA have been audited by the Securities Technology Analysis Center (STAC). Members of the STAC Benchmark Council include over 450 of the world\u2019s leading banks, hedge funds and financial services technology companies, which contribute to the benchmark\u2019s makeup. The STAC Report is available here.\nEfficiency for Reduced Operating Expenses\nBig banks, hedge funds and risk managers across financial institutions stand to benefit from not only data throughput advances but also improved operational efficiencies.\nReduced energy and square footage expenses for systems in data centers can make a big difference in operating expenses. That\u2019s especially important as IT organizations make the case for budgetary outlays to cover new systems.\nThe latest\u00a0 DGX A100 system with 640GB of GPU memory5 offers lower operating expenses:\n\n2.6x the energy efficiency6\n2x the space efficiency of a CPU-based cluster system tested in 2018 and 4x the space efficiency of a recently tested CPU-based system7.\n\n\nUnderstanding STAC-A2: Meet the Greeks\nThe STAC-A2 market risk benchmark simulates fluctuations in interest rates and other security price factors over time, evaluating their impacts on options prices. One important step is the simulation of underlying security prices paths, which is depicted in figure 1. The STAC benchmark involves computing the evolution of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these security price paths grouped by security.\nThese simulated results are used in sensitivity calculations that make up risk scores known in the finance industry as \u201cthe Greeks.\u201d\nSTAC-A2 simulates these option-price sensitivities (the Greeks) for multiple assets by applying a financial analytics technique called Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo.\nUsing a Monte Carlo simulation (randomly sampling a probability distribution much like in figure 1) with the Longstaff-Schwartz method (a backward iteration algorithm, which steps back in time from a maturity date) solves for option-price steps over time.\nThe technique enables financial services firms to calculate the risk of current holdings in the future and of potential trades.\nDGX Devours STAC-A2\n\nDGX A100 with 640GB of GPU memory8 didn\u2019t just move the bar a little bit. Compared with the best previous numbers from non-NVIDIA accelerated systems, it opened a wide gap: 3x the throughput9, and 2.6x the speed in the warm baseline Greeks benchmark10\n\nNVIDIA set new time-to-solution records for the large problem size as well \u2014 2.3x the speed in the warm large Greeks benchmark compared with the fastest non-NVIDIA system (an eight-node CPU-based cluster)11.\nDGX systems have always been about performance at scale, so it\u2019s no surprise that it set new records for the maximum number of assets and paths that can be simulated12. The latest DGX systems can handle more than 2x the assets of the best non-NVIDIA system tested13 (despite the fact that the workload increases quadratically with the number of assets), and 20x more paths than a recently tested CPU-based server14.\nNVIDIA DGX was designed to address the world\u2019s most challenging compute problems efficiently and at scale. These latest STAC-A2 results show its strength in delivering on that vision.\nLearn more about NVIDIA DGX systems.\n\u00a0\n1 STAC-A2.\u03b22.HPORTFOLIO.SPEED\n2 SUT ID 210315\n3 SUT ID INTC210331\n4 SUT ID INTC181012\n5 SUT ID NVDA210914\n6 STAC-A2.\u03b22.HPORTFOLIO.ENERGY_EFF vs. the Ice Lake based server SUT ID INTC210315\n7 STAC-A2.\u03b22.HPORTFOLIO.SPACE_EFF vs. SkyLake cluster SUT ID INTC181012, Ice Lake SUT ID INTC210315\n8 SUT ID NVDA210914\n9 STAC-A2.\u03b22.HPORTFOLIO.SPEED vs. the 10 node cloud cluster SUT ID INTC210331\n10 STAC-A2.\u03b22.GREEKS.WARM vs. an 8x NEC Vector Engine SUT ID NEC210422\n11 STAC-A2.\u03b22.GREEKS.10-100k-1260.TIME.WARM vs.Skylake cluster SUT ID INTC181012\n12 STAC-A2.\u03b22.GREEKS.MAX_PATHS and STAC-A2.\u03b22.GREEKS.MAX_ASSETS\n13 STAC-A2.\u03b22.GREEKS.MAX_ASSETS vs. the 8 way Skylake cluster SUT ID INTC181012\n14 STAC-A2.\u03b22.GREEKS.MAX_PATHS vs. the Ice Lake based server SUT ID INTC210315\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | HardwareTags: Financial Services | GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However, ML models that have specific latency or high throughput requirements can become prohibitively expensive to run at scale on generic computing infrastructure. To achieve performance and deliver inference at the lowest cost, ML models require inference accelerators such as GPUs to meet the stringent throughput, scale, and latency requirements businesses and customers expect.\nThe deployment of trained models and accompanying code in the data center, public cloud, or at the edge is called inference serving. We are proud to announce the integration of NVIDIA Triton Inference Server in Amazon SageMaker. Triton Inference Server containers in SageMaker help deploy models from multiple frameworks on CPUs or GPUs with high performance.\nIn this post, we give an overview of the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and SageMaker, the benefits of using Triton Inference Server containers, and showcase how easy it is to deploy your own ML models. If you\u2019d like to work from a sample notebook that supports this blog post,\u00a0download it here.\nNVIDIA Triton Inference Server overview\nThe NVIDIA Triton Inference Server was developed specifically to enable scalable, rapid, and easy deployment of models in production. Triton is open-source inference serving software that simplifies the inference serving process and provides high inference performance. Triton is widely deployed in industries across all major verticals, ranging from FSI, telco, retail, manufacturing, public, healthcare, and more.\nThe following are some of the key features of Triton:\n\nSupport for multiple frameworks \u2013 You can use Triton to deploy models from all major frameworks. Triton supports TensorFlow GraphDef and SavedModel, ONNX, PyTorch TorchScript, TensorRT, RAPIDS FIL for tree-based models, OpenVINO, and custom Python/C++ model formats.\nModel pipelines \u2013 The Triton model ensemble represents a pipeline of one or more models or pre- and postprocessing logic and the connection of input and output tensors between them. A single inference request to an ensemble triggers the entire pipeline.\nConcurrent model runs \u2013 Multiple models (support for concurrent runs of different models will be added soon) or multiple instances of the same model can run simultaneously on the same GPU or on multiple GPUs for different model management needs.\nDynamic batching \u2013 For models that support batching, Triton has multiple built-in scheduling and batching algorithms that combine individual inference requests to improve inference throughput. These scheduling and batching decisions are transparent to the client requesting inference.\nDiverse CPU and GPU support \u2013 You can run the models on CPUs or GPUs for maximum flexibility and to support heterogeneous computing requirements.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server architecture.\n\nSageMaker is a fully managed service for data science and ML workflows. It helps data scientists and developers prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality ML models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML.\nSageMaker has now integrated NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to serve models for inference in SageMaker. Thanks to the new Triton Inference Server containers, you can easily serve models and benefit from the performance optimizations, dynamic batching, and multi-framework support provided by Triton. Triton helps maximize the utilization of GPUs and CPUs, lowering the cost of inference.\nThis combination of SageMaker and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server enables developers across all industry verticals to rapidly deploy their models into production at scale.\nIn the following sections, we detail the steps needed to package your model, create a SageMaker endpoint, and benchmark performance. Note that the initial release of Triton Inference Server containers will only support one or more instances of a single model. Future releases will have multi-model support as well.\nPrepare your model\nTo prepare your model for Triton deployment, you should arrange your Triton serving directory in the following format:\n\ntriton_serve\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 model\n \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 config.pbtxt\n \t\u2514\u2500\u2500 1\n     \t         \u2514\u2500\u2500 model.plan\n\nIn this format, triton_serve is the directory containing all of your models, model is the model name, and 1 is the version number.\nIn addition to the default configuration like input and output definitions, we recommend using an optimal configuration based on the actual workload that users need for the config.pbtxt file.\nFor example, you only need four lines of code to enable the built-in server-side dynamic batching:\n\ndynamic_batching {\n   preferred_batch_size: 16\n   max_queue_delay_microseconds: 1000\n }\n\nHere, the preferred_batch_size option means the preferred batch size that you want to combine your input requests into. The max_queue_delay_microseconds option is how long the NVIDIA Triton server waits when the preferred size can\u2019t be created from the available requests.\nFor concurrent model runs, directly specifying the model concurrency per GPU by changing the count number in the instance_group allows you to easily run multiple copies of the same model to better utilize your compute resources:\n\ninstance_group {\n   count: 1\n   kind: KIND_GPU\n }\n\nFor more information about the configuration files, see Model Configuration.\nAfter you create the model directory, you may use the following command to compress it into a .tar file for your later Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket uploads.\n\ntar -C triton-serve/ -czf model.tar.gz model\n\nCreate a SageMaker endpoint\nTo create a SageMaker endpoint with the model repository just created, you have several different options, including using the SageMaker endpoint creation UI, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and the SageMaker Python SDK.\nIn this notebook example, we use the SageMaker Python SDK.\n\nCreate the container definition with both the Triton server container and the uploaded model artifact on the S3 bucket: \n         \ncontainer = {\n    'Image': triton_image_uri,\n    'ModelDataUrl': model_uri,\n    'Environment': {\n        'SAGEMAKER_TRITON_DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME': 'resnet'\n    }\n}\n \nCreate a SageMaker model definition with the container definition in the last step: \n         \ncreate_model_response = sm.create_model(\n    ModelName         = sm_model_name,\n    ExecutionRoleArn  = role,\n    PrimaryContainer  = container)\nprint(\"Model Arn: \" + create_model_response['ModelArn'])\n \nCreate an endpoint configuration by specifying the instance type and number of instances you want in the endpoint: \n         \nendpoint_config_name = 'triton-resnet-pt-' + time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\", time.gmtime())\n\ncreate_endpoint_config_response = sm.create_endpoint_config(\n    EndpointConfigName = endpoint_config_name,\n    ProductionVariants = [{\n        'InstanceType'        : 'ml.g4dn.4xlarge',\n        'InitialVariantWeight': 1,\n        'InitialInstanceCount': 1,\n        'ModelName'           : sm_model_name,\n        'VariantName'         : 'AllTraffic'}])\n\nprint(\"Endpoint Config Arn: \" + create_endpoint_config_response['EndpointConfigArn'])\n \nCreate the endpoint by running the following commands: \n         \nendpoint_name = 'triton-resnet-pt-' + time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\", time.gmtime())\n\ncreate_endpoint_response = sm.create_endpoint(\n    EndpointName         = endpoint_name,\n    EndpointConfigName   = endpoint_config_name)\n \n\nConclusion\nSageMaker helps developers and organizations across all industries easily adopt and deploy AI models in applications by providing an easy-to-use, fully managed development and deployment platform. With Triton Inference Server containers, organizations can further streamline their model deployment in SageMaker by having a single inference serving solution for multiple frameworks on GPUs and CPUs with high performance.\nWe invite you to try Triton Inference Server containers in SageMaker, and share your feedback and questions in the comments.\n\nAbout the Authors\nSantosh Bhavani\u00a0is a Senior Technical Product Manager with the Amazon SageMaker Elastic Inference team.

More than 20 partners offer over 100 certified systems of all types, from the highest end servers built for high performance computing to lean, yet powerful laptops and desktops that can run high-quality visualization and state-of-the-art data science algorithms.\nNow the program has expanded to include edge systems \u2014 one of the biggest areas of growth, with computing tied to devices for applications such as video analytics, robotics and 5G communication.\nEdge computing is driven by the requirement for low-latency, real-time results as well as the desire to contain data transit costs without resorting to compromises such as reducing image resolution. Edge systems run in locations physically close to where data is collected or processed, in settings such as retail stores, factory floors and cell phone base stations.\nNVIDIA-Certified edge servers are validated to run a range of accelerated workloads with the best performance, and must also meet specific requirements\u00a0due to their deployment location.\nSecurity in Edge Systems\nNVIDIA certification includes tests to ensure that key technologies, such as the Trusted Platform Module, function properly in systems. Because edge systems are often in easily accessible locations, such as a retail store\u2019s IT closet, malicious actors could take them off site and try to extract data or install malware.\nTPM counters physical threats like these by ensuring that the system can only boot with firmware and software that has been digitally signed and unaltered. Additional security checks such as signed containers ensure that applications haven\u2019t been tampered with, and disk volumes can be encrypted with keys that are securely stored in the TPM.\nOther features that improve zero-trust security at the edge, such as network encryption acceleration offload, can be leveraged in certified systems deployed with NVIDIA ConnectX-6 network adapters or NVIDIA BlueField-2 data processing units.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nNVIDIA certification also includes a specific industrial edge category for systems deployed in places where environmental conditions are more extreme.\nSystems on a factory floor for automation control or in an enclosure next to a telecommunications antenna tower must perform well under potentially harsh conditions. They must pass all tests while running within the environment for which they were designed, such as elevated temperatures.\nAdvantech is the first NVIDIA partner to certify a system in this category, with its USM-501 system, a medical-grade computer for diverse hospital applications. NVIDIA-Certified Systems for the industrial edge will be available soon from other system providers, including Dynics, Lenovo, Mercury Systems and Prodrive Technologies.\nFor systems deployed in more controlled edge environments, such as retail stores, the enterprise edge category would apply. These would be tested in data-center-like conditions and will be available soon from system providers including GIGABYTE and Lenovo.\nEfficient Performance\nNVIDIA-Certified edge systems provide the acceleration needed by intelligent edge applications, such as video analytics and robotics, where total system power is often limited.\nThe primary workload run on most edge servers is AI inferencing, and NVIDIA-Certified Systems equipped with the NVIDIA A30 Tensor Core GPU deliver leading inference performance for edge. These systems allow AI applications to be deployed with fewer servers and less power, resulting in faster insights with dramatically lower costs.\nThis was conclusively demonstrated by the latest results of the MLPerf benchmark, in which NVIDIA-Certified Systems set records for both performance and energy efficiency.\nWith its Multi-Instance GPU, or MIG, technology, the A30 also allows up to four workloads to be run simultaneously with their own guaranteed quality of service. This helps maximize mainstream compute utilization and efficiency.\nThe recently announced NVIDIA A2 Tensor Core GPU delivers entry-level, low-power, compact acceleration for edge AI and inference, and offers the smallest footprint of the NVIDIA enterprise GPU portfolio.\u00a0 Systems with this GPU are expected to become NVIDIA-Certified in the near future.\nBuild and Deploy Edge AI Models\nNVIDIA has developed a whole set of software for managing NVIDIA-Certified Systems for the edge, as well as frameworks for developing and supporting edge applications.\nThe NVIDIA Metropolis video analytics framework gives organizations the tools needed to build complete, unique computer vision solutions without having to start from scratch. Metropolis provides pretrained models and transfer learning, as well as a full software development kit to help developers get started. Its rich ecosystem of computer vision partners provides organizations with Metropolis-certified applications that are ready to be deployed in edge environments with little to no configuration needed.\nFor deploying applications at the edge, organizations can rely on NVIDIA Fleet Command, a cloud service that securely deploys, manages and scales AI applications across distributed edge infrastructure. Purpose-built for AI, Fleet Command offers streamlined deployments, layered security and detailed monitoring so organizations can go from zero to AI in minutes.\nA Comprehensive Certified Portfolio\n\nThe NVIDIA-Certified Systems portfolio also now includes a category for high-density virtualization, which will feature systems optimized for virtual desktop and virtual workstation using the NVIDIA A16 GPU. With the addition of edge systems, enterprises have a full range of choices when it comes to hardware-accelerated infrastructure.\nCustomers can also take advantage of enterprise software that runs most optimally on certified systems, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise and Cloudera Data Platform.\nWhatever the use case, customers can confidently choose to power their accelerated workloads.\nDiscover more about NVIDIA-Certified Systems:\n\nWhitepaper: Accelerate Compute-Intensive Workloads With NVIDIA-Certified Systems\nFind an NVIDIA-Certified System\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems Configuration Guide\n\nTo learn more about NVIDIA edge computing solutions, check out Deploying and Accelerating AI at the Edge With the NVIDIA EGX Platform.\nWatch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote:\n\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2021 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Noyce award, their highest honor, on the founder and CEO of NVIDIA.\n\u201cBefore we begin, I want to say it\u2019s so nice to be back in person,\u201d said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, to applause from a socially distanced audience.\nThe group heard comments on video from U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, of New York, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about pending legislation supporting the industry.\nRecognizing \u2018an Icon\u2019\nTurning to the Noyce award, Neuffer introduced Huang as \u201can icon in our industry. From starting NVIDIA in a rented townhouse in Fremont, California, in 1993, he has become one of the industry\u2019s longest-serving and most successful CEOs of what is today by market cap the world\u2019s eighth most valuable company,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI accept this on behalf of all NVIDIA\u2019s employees because it reflects their body of work,\u201d Huang said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019d like to keep this at my house,\u201d he quipped.\nSince 1991, the annual Noyce award has recognized tech and business leaders including Jack Kilby (1995), an inventor of the integrated circuit that paved the way for today\u2019s chips.\nTwo of Huang\u2019s mentors won Noyce awards \u2014 Morris Chang, the founder and former CEO of TSMC, the world\u2019s first and largest chip foundry in 2008, and, in 2018, John Hennessy, the Alphabet chairman and former Stanford president. Huang, his former student, interviewed Hennessy on stage at the 2018 event.\nProgramming on an Apple II\nIn an on-stage interview with John Markoff, author and former senior technology writer for The New York Times, Huang shared some of his story and his observations on technology and the industry.\nHe recalled high school days programming on an Apple II computer, getting his first job as a microprocessor designer at AMD and starting NVIDIA with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem.\n\u201cChris and Curtis are the two brightest engineers I have met \u2026 and all of us loved building computers. Success has a lot to do with luck, and part of my luck was meeting them,\u201d he said.\nMaking Million-x Leaps\nFast-forwarding to today, he shared his vision for accelerated computing with AI in projects like Earth-2, a supercomputer for climate science.\n\u201cWe will build a digital twin of Earth and put some of the brightest computer scientists on the planet to work on it\u201d to explore and mitigate impacts of climate change, he said. \u201cWe could solve some of the problems in climate science in our generation.\u201d\nHe also expressed optimism about Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of innovation.\n\u201cThe concept of Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t have to be geographic, we can carry this sensibility all over the world, but we have to be mindful of being humble and recognize we\u2019re not here alone, so we need to be in service to others,\u201d he said.\nA Pivotal Role in AI\nThe Noyce award came two months after TIME Magazine named Huang one of the 100 most influential people of 2021. He was one of seven honored on the iconic weekly magazine\u2019s cover along with U.S. President Joe Biden, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and singer Billie Eilish.\nA who\u2019s who of tech luminaries including executives from Adobe, IBM and Zoom shared stories of Huang and NVIDIA\u2019s impact in a video, included below, screened at the event. In it, Andrew Ng, a machine-learning pioneer and entrepreneur described the pivotal role NVIDIA\u2019s CEO has played in AI.\n\u201cA lot of the progress in AI over the last decade would not have been possible if not for Jensen\u2019s visionary leadership,\u201d said Ng, founder and CEO of DeepLearning.AI and Landing AI. \u201cHis impact on the semiconductor industry, AI and the world is almost incalculable.\u201d\n\nFeature image credit: Nora Stratton/SFFoto\n\n\nCategories: Corporate \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its installed base numbers tens of thousands of Siemens gas turbines, steam turbines, generators, gas and diesel engines, a staggering number of moving parts to manage.\nAdding to the complexity, an increased mix of renewables on the grid is pressuring power plants everywhere to operate more flexibly and efficiently with the help of AI.\n\u201cNowadays, a lot of these combined power plants are needed for grid stability, so some are offline for quite a while and then brought online when you need stability on the grid,\u201d said Arik Ott, product manager at Siemens Energy AG.\nAutonomous Power Plants\nTo boost efficiency for its energy partners, Siemens Energy is tapping NVIDIA Triton for AI to deliver a path to autonomous power plants, reducing costs along the way.\nThis is no easy task. Today, hundreds of inspection types are performed by human walk-throughs, requiring domain expertise. And many power plants are no longer in always-on mode and don\u2019t need full staffing at all times, creating concerns over the costs of operating them and the need for remote management.\nAlso, Europe has an aging workforce, and it\u2019s expected that many will retire over the next decade and it will be difficult to backfill those with the right skills, says Ott.\nThe Center for Global Development estimates there will be 95 million fewer working-age people in Europe in 2050 compared with in 2015.\n\u201cWe want technology to bridge the know-how gap for whenever we don\u2019t have access to all of the people we need,\u201d Ott said.\nSiemens Energy supports a wide variety of machine learning from images of scenarios taken with onsite cameras and other sensors for data used in analytics. As a result, it requires a highly scalable inference solution \u2014 for handling millions of sensors \u2014 able to work with multiple frameworks and massive input streams.\nSiemens Energy selected Triton for inferencing because of its ability to meet the multi-framework and multi-model requirements. Data scientists can now choose their framework of choice \u2014 such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX and others \u2014 for different models and inputs like images, videos and sounds. \u200b\nSiemens Energy runs NVIDIA Triton on AWS for scale and multi-tenancy with plans to run at the edge where data cannot be moved out of the powerplants.\n\u201cThe flexibility of NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is enabling highly complicated power plants, often equipped with cameras and sensors but with legacy software systems, to join the autonomous industrial revolution taking place,\u201d said Ott.\nAI for Industrial Efficiencies\nAI for any kind of power generating unit improves business continuity \u2014 it keeps things running \u2014 and can lower costs.\nThat\u2019s important for energy providers, as an influx of renewable energy sources on the grid means that power plants not operating full time to supply power are creating over-staffing issues. If sites aren\u2019t online, remote management and centralized dispatch of service employees to them can rein in costs.\nToday, however, onsite personnel conduct over 360 unique activities during walkthrough inspections of power plants. Meanwhile, workforce shortages are a concern and are expected to increase for geographies with declining populations and aging workforces, affecting these mission-critical operations. Also, COVID-19 has revealed the need in preparation by power plants on worker shortages for such black swan events.\nIt\u2019s an ideal fit for sensors with AI to fill in or augment physical inspections by providing around-the-clock remote monitoring. Also, the provided analytics offer automated real-time monitoring as well as the ability for power plants to assign levels of autonomy in controlling facilities with AI.\n\u201cWe needed a solution where we are able to host the models for the different kinds of analytics with the ability to scale without changing the hosting solution,\u201d said Sanjukta Ghosh, a solutions architect for automatic visual inspections at Siemens AG.\nAI to Reduce Problems\nPower plants currently require extensive monitoring for both efficiency and safety. Liquid, steam or oil leakages left unnoticed can be catastrophic and cost millions of dollars.\nSiemens Energy trained models with thousands of images for each of its various scenarios. Different locations and different lighting conditions required minor transfer learning to enable the models to work.\nNoises can be monitored as well. Siemens Energy is beginning development on models to handle audio data.\nModel ensembles enabled by Triton allow for additional pre-processing, such as person anonymization, of the images\u200b.\nTriton Inference Server Flexibility\nTriton offers the flexibility to handle these scenarios and many others. For example, it enables the use of multiple models that could apply to different situations.\nA steam leakage model trained on indoor photos can run while another is tuned for outdoor images of steam leaks, according to the company.\nTriton makes it easy to deploy on the cloud or the edge. That\u2019s helpful for instances where data can\u2019t be moved out of the power plants and on-premises or edge analytics is required.\nTo learn more, Siemens Energy is scheduled to speak on a panel at NVIDIA GTC.\u00a0\n\nDiscover how AI is powering the future of clean energy.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Energy | GPU | GTC 2021 | NVIDIA Triton | Open Source \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nThe global pandemic has created a supply chain crisis affecting just about every person and business on the planet.\nFor consumers, supply-and-demand imbalances might be written off as one less present under the Christmas tree. Businesses, however, tally the toll as millions of dollars in profits.\nTo help the $9 trillion logistics industry efficiently route goods from factories to stores and homes, NVIDIA today debuted NVIDIA cuOpt AI software.\nCombining NVIDIA RAPIDS software with local search heuristics algorithms and metaheuristics such as Tabu search, NVIDIA cuOpt is an accelerated solver for big data that optimizes vehicle route planning and logistics in real time.\nNVIDIA cuOpt delivers new tools for dynamic logistics and supply chain management to a wide range of industries, including transportation, warehousing, manufacturing, retail and quick-service restaurants.\n\nA demonstration of cuOpt at NVIDIA GTC used NVIDIA Isaac Sim, powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for simulating and collaborating within virtual worlds and 3D workflows, to first create a scalable robotics simulation application showing dynamic re-optimization in a photorealistic environment.\nAt a time when the global supply chain faces massive disruption, NVIDIA cuOpt provides the AI software required for everything from vehicle routing for last-mile delivery to efficiently picking and packing of warehoused goods bound for homes and offices.\nFrom Oven to Door\nLeveraging big data quickly is crucial to Domino\u2019s Pizza. The company says there are 34 million ways to build a pizza \u2014 based on the potential combinations of toppings, crust, cheese, sauce and size. Delivering all those possible pizza combinations as efficiently as possible is important to hungry customers. Working with the NVIDIA cuOpt team, the company implemented a real-time predictive system that helps it meet important delivery standards for customers eager for dinner.\n\u201cThe results we achieved working with NVIDIA showed great promise in delivering real-time and actionable insights that help us better serve our customers each day,\u201d said Andrew Birch, vice president of data science at Domino\u2019s.\nDomino\u2019s pizza delivery route optimization using NVIDIA cuOpt\nPlanning for a Post-Pandemic Economy\nThe logistics industry is a highly integrated supply chain network that links producers and consumers through multiple transportation modes, including air and express delivery services, freight rail, maritime transport and truck transport.\nDelivering goods directly to a customer\u2019s door, called last-mile delivery, has been a costly challenge even before the pandemic disrupted logistics just as millions more people switched to shopping online.\nIt\u2019s estimated that over half of total shipping costs result from last-mile deliveries, impacting profitability, according to ABI Research. Companies typically eat about 25 percent of that cost themselves \u2014 a number that is increasing because of supply chain inefficiencies, according to logistics company Onfleet.\ncuOpt, now available for early access, offers software-driven process changes, including:\n\nRoute optimization. Dynamic route optimization uses advanced algorithms that provide dispatchers and drivers with routing that can dramatically reduce miles, fuel cost, CO2 emissions and idle time. Companies gain real-time feedback on road conditions, traffic data and route suggestions to create more accurate arrival windows.\nAdvanced constraints. Modeling movements of vehicles that have finite capacities and different costs. That includes factoring in such items as fresh produce that must be carried by refrigerated trucks, or that customers are only available during specific windows in time.\nWarehouse picking. Companies can create better human-machine interaction for automated storage and retrieval in picking and packing that dynamically routes and re-routes robots for efficient truck loading as new orders arrive.\nFleet mix optimization. Tracks routing across the supply chain with locations and fleet statistics for airplanes, trains, trucking and container fleets. The software can take into account the number of available pilots, drivers or ships to operate these vehicles on a given day and factor in maintenance costs.\n\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing Powers World-Leading Accuracy\nNVIDIA GPUs offer the computational power needed to fuel the most ambitious heuristics while supporting the most challenging constraints. cuOpt takes advantage of NVIDIA\u2019s massively parallel architecture to generate thousands of solution candidates and refine them to select only the best one at the end.\nAs a result, cuOpt can scale to the largest problems in seconds with world-class accuracy. The software showed a 2.96 percent accuracy average gap, compared to the world\u2019s best known solution for the number of vehicles, in early tests on the Gehring & Homberger benchmark.\nTry out NVIDIA CuOpt AI Software and CuOpt Launchpad.\nWatch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote address below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2021 | NVIDIA cuOpt | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In addition, a supercomputer in the U.K. has upgraded its InfiniBand network.\nTexas Lassos a SuperPOD\n\u201cWe\u2019re the second university in America to get a DGX SuperPOD and that will put this community ahead in AI capabilities to fuel our degree programs and corporate partnerships,\u201d said Michael Hites, chief information officer of SMU, referring to a system installed earlier this year at the University of Florida.\nA September report called the Dallas area \u201chobbled\u201d by a lack of major AI research. Ironically, the story hit the local newspaper just as SMU was buttoning up its plans for its DGX SuperPOD.\nPreviewing its initiative, an SMU report in March said AI is \u201cat the heart of digital transformation \u2026 and no sector of society will remain untouched\u201d by the technology. \u201cThe potential for dramatic improvements in K-12 education and workforce development is enormous and will contribute to the sustained economic growth of the region,\u201d it added.\nSMU Ignite, a $1.5 billion fundraiser kicked off in September, will fuel the AI initiative, helping propel Southern Methodist into the top ranks of university research nationally. The university is hiring a chief innovation officer to help guide the effort.\nCrafting a Computational Crucible\nIt\u2019s all about the people, says Jason Warner, who manages the IT teams that support SMU\u2019s researchers. So, he hired a seminal group of data science specialists to staff a new center at SMU\u2019s Ford Hall for Research and Innovation, a hub Warner calls SMU\u2019s \u201ccomputational crucible.\u201d\nEric Godat leads that team. He earned his Ph.D. in particle physics at SMU modeling nuclear structure using data from the Large Hadron Collider.\nNow he\u2019s helping fire up SMU\u2019s students about opportunities on the DGX SuperPOD. As a first step, he asked two SMU students to build a miniature model of a DGX SuperPOD using NVIDIA Jetson modules.\n\u201cWe wanted to give people \u2014 especially those in nontechnical fields who haven\u2019t done AI \u2014 a sense of what\u2019s coming,\u201d Godat said.\nSMU undergrad Connor Ozenne helped build a miniature DGX SuperPOD that was featured in SMU\u2019s annual report. It uses 16 Jetson modules in a cluster students will benchmark as if it were a TOP500 system.\nThe full-sized supercomputer, made up of 20 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems on an NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand network, could be up and running as early as January thanks to its Lego-like, modular architecture. It will deliver a whopping 100 petaflops of computing power, enough to give it a respectable slot on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\nAggies Tap NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand for ACES\nAbout 200 miles south, the high performance computing center at Texas A&M will be among the first to plug into the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform. Its ACES supercomputer, built by Dell Technologies, will use the 400G InfiniBand network to connect researchers to a mix of five accelerators from four vendors.\nNVIDIA Quantum-2 ensures \u201cthat a single job on ACES can scale up using all the computing cores and accelerators.\u00a0 Besides the obvious 2x jump in throughput from NVIDIA Quantum-1 InfiniBand at 200G, it will provide improved total cost of ownership, beefed up in-network computing features and increased scaling,\u201d said Honggao Liu, ACES\u2019s principal investigator and project director.\nTexas A&M already gives researchers access to accelerated computing in four systems that include more than 600 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core and prior-generation GPUs. Two of the four systems use an earlier version of NVIDIA\u2019s InfiniBand technology.\nMSU Rides a 400G Train\nMississippi State University will also tap the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform. It\u2019s the network of choice for a new system that supplements Orion, the largest of four clusters MSU manages, all using earlier versions of InfiniBand.\nBoth Orion and the new system are funded by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and built by Dell.

Tursa delivers 10 teraflops/node using 90 percent of the network\u2019s bandwidth at a significant improvement in performance per kilowatt over Tesseract.\nIt\u2019s another example of why most of the world\u2019s TOP500 systems are using NVIDIA technologies.\nFor more, watch our special address at SC21 either live on Monday, Nov. 15 at 3 pm PST or later on demand.

By simulating tomorrow\u2019s quantum computers on today\u2019s classical systems, researchers can develop and test quantum algorithms more quickly and at scales not otherwise possible.\nDriving toward that future, NVIDIA created the largest ever simulation of a quantum algorithm for solving the MaxCut problem using cuQuantum, our SDK for accelerating quantum circuit simulations on a GPU.\nIn the math world, MaxCut is often cited as an example of an optimization problem no known computer can solve efficiently. MaxCut algorithms are used to design large computer networks, find the optimal layout of chips with billions of silicon pathways and explore the field of statistical physics.\nMaxCut is a key problem in the quantum community because it\u2019s one of the leading candidates for demonstrating an advantage from using a quantum algorithm.\nWe used the cuTensorNet library in cuQuantum running on NVIDIA\u2019s in-house supercomputer, Selene, to simulate a quantum algorithm to solve the MaxCut problem. Using 896 GPUs to simulate 1,688 qubits, we were able to solve a graph with a whopping 3,375 vertices.\u00a0That\u2019s 8x more qubits than the previous largest quantum simulation.\nOur solution was also highly accurate, reaching 96% of the best known answer. We set this new record with an algorithm developed by NVIDIA researchers and an open source framework. (Editor\u2019s note: Since publishing this post, we\u2019ve announced larger simulations up to 10,000 vertices with 5,000 qubits, using 20 NVIDIA DGX A100 nodes, and achieving 93% accuracy.)\nThe previous world record for a tensor network MaxCut simulation on a supercomputer (left) and the results using the cuTensorNet library running on Selene (right).\nOur breakthrough opens the door for using cuQuantum on NVIDIA DGX systems to research quantum algorithms at a previously impossible scale, accelerating the path to tomorrow\u2019s quantum computers.\nKeys to the Quantum World\nYou can test drive the same software that set this world record.\nStarting today, the first library from cuQuantum, cuStateVec, is in public beta, available to download. It uses state vectors to accelerate simulations with tens of qubits.\nThe cuTensorNet library that helped us set the world record uses tensor networks to simulate up to hundreds or even thousands of qubits on some promising near-term algorithms. It will be available in December.\nGet the Latest News at GTC\nWe invite you to try cuQuantum, get dramatically accelerated performance on your simulations and go break some big records.\nLearn more about cuQuantum\u2019s partner ecosystem here.\nTo get the big picture, attend NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

That\u2019s the principle San Diego-based startup Entos is applying to revolutionize drug design with an AI-powered approach that enables a thousandfold acceleration in molecular properties prediction.\nDrug discovery is a notoriously time-consuming and data-intensive process, but Entos\u2019 OrbNet architecture changes that. It requires 30x less data to train a model for molecular drug discovery with quantum accuracy and 100x fewer experiments to find promising drug compounds \u2014 cutting through the waiting time and complexities associated with traditional therapeutic drug discovery methods.\nThe company, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups revolutionizing industries with advancements in AI, data science and high performance computing, is advancing its work with NVIDIA Clara Discovery \u2014 a collection of state-of-the-art frameworks, applications and pretrained models built to unlock insights about how billions of potential drug molecules interact inside our bodies.\n\u201cOur physics-based approach means we include more qualities about the underlying quantum mechanics into the machine learning model,\u201d said Tom Miller, CEO of Entos. \u201cThis enables us to make better predictions, even while using less data.\u201d\nEntos is focusing on identifying drug molecules that could deactivate proteins linked to certain forms of cancer. By including quantum mechanics calculations into its machine learning workflow, the startup can more quickly narrow the pool of potential compounds that bind with these target proteins.\nBringing AI Into the Drug Discovery Process\nMachine learning is transforming the way scientists approach everything from climate science to drug discovery. Now the combination of AI and machine learning is leading to a new way of doing science, creating a hybrid of deep learning and physics-based simulation to transform the way drugs are discovered.\nDrug discovery is a data-intensive process where researchers perform computationally dense calculations to simulate how molecules and proteins interact to identify the right therapeutics. Traditionally, these forms of quantum calculations are extremely expensive to perform and take weeks or months to complete.\nThese computational experiments benefit from the incorporation of AI and accelerated computing by allowing researchers to simulate the interaction of a drug with a protein at quantum accuracy. The simulations are far too computationally expensive to perform using traditional quantum mechanical calculations.\nEntos optimizes its OrbNet drug discovery software on NVIDIA DGX A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The OrbNet AI model \u2014 developed jointly at Caltech by Entos CEO Tom Miller and Anima Anandkumar, director of machine learning research at NVIDIA \u2014 enables robotic synthesis and high-throughput experimentation to speed up therapeutic design.\n\u201cOrbNet uses a graph neural network built on domain-specific features that account for interactions between atoms. Further, we account for symmetries such as three-dimensional rotations,\u201d said Anandkumar. \u201cThese design considerations make it possible to train OrbNet only on small molecules \u2014 those with less than 40 atoms \u2014 and directly apply the model on large protein molecules with a high degree of accuracy.\u201d\nBy collaborating with NVIDIA experts, Miller\u2019s team of scientists is able to perform high-throughput experimentation and \u201copen new doors to what we can go after,\u201d he said.\nUnlocking the Potential of Covalent Bonds\nRecent developments in machine learning are transforming the size and scale of chemical databases that researchers can trawl for promising drug compounds. AI models also allow scientists to study the innumerable chemical reactions of enzymes within the body in a new way.\nTogether, these advancements are enabling the study of entirely new classes of drugs that researchers were unable to investigate with previous methods.\nOne promising technique involves the creation of drug molecules that form covalent bonds with the target protein. If therapeutics can form these bonds with only the target protein, patients could be prescribed smaller doses and experience fewer side effects. Entos researchers plan to apply this method to disease areas including cancer, diabetes and cystic fibrosis.\n\nEntos has forged partnerships with leaders in the pharmaceuticals, materials and chemical industries and raised $53 million in July to support its efforts to create meaningful therapies with high accuracy. The company credits active collaborations with the NVIDIA healthcare team as an asset in getting connected to technical resources and assistance in optimizing its applications on NVIDIA hardware architecture.\nHear from Entos and additional Inception startups at NVIDIA GTC, running online through Nov. 11.

But with the higher memory capacity offered by NVIDIA AI Enterprise, its researchers could instead use high-resolution images for training. This improvement helps clinicians better target the size and location of a tumor every time a patient receives treatment.\nThe NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite that NKI deployed is designed to optimize the development and deployment of AI. It\u2019s certified and supported by NVIDIA to enable hospitals, researchers and IT professionals to run AI workloads on mainstream servers with VMware vSphere in their on-prem data centers and private clouds.\nDelivering treatments on virtualized infrastructure means hospitals and research institutions can use the same tools they already work with on existing applications. This helps maximize their investments while making innovations in care more affordable and accessible.\nNKI used an AI model to better reconstruct a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) thoracic image, resulting in clearer image quality compared to conventional methods.\nSpeeding Breakthroughs in Healthcare Research\u00a0\nNKI had gotten off to a quick start with its project on NVIDIA AI Enterprise by using NVIDIA LaunchPad.\nThe LaunchPad program provides immediate access to optimized software running on accelerated infrastructure to help customers prototype and test data science and AI workloads. This month, the program was extended to nine Equinix locations worldwide.\nThe NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, available in LaunchPad, makes it possible to run advanced AI workloads on mainstream accelerated servers with VMware vSphere, including systems from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and many others.\nRhino Health, a federated learning platform powered by NVIDIA FLARE, is available today through NVIDIA AI Enterprise, making it easy for any hospital to leverage Federated learning for AI development and validation. Other organizations, like The American College of Radiology\u2019s AI LAB, are also planning to use the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.\nResearchers at NKI used NVIDIA AI Enterprise, running on the HPE Synergy, a composable software system from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, to build deep learning models by combining the massive 2D and 3D data sources and AI to pinpoint the location of tumors before each radiotherapy treatment session.\u00a0\n\u201cDoctors could use this solution as an alternative to CT scans on day of treatment to optimize the treatment plan to validate the radiotherapy plan,\u201d said Jonas Teuwen, group leader at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.\nUsing NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Teuwen\u2019s team in Amsterdam ran their workloads on NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs in a server hosted in Silicon Valley. Their convolutional neural network was built in less than three months and was trained on less than 300 clinical lung CT scans that were then reconstructed and generalized to head and neck data.\nIn the future, NKI researchers also hope to translate this work to potential use cases in interventional radiology to repair arteries in cardiac surgeries and dental surgery implants.\nAccelerating Hospital AI Deployment With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise simplifies the AI rollout experience for organizations who host a variety of healthcare and operations applications on virtualized infrastructure. It enables IT administrators to run AI applications like Vyasa and iCAD alongside core hospital applications, streamlining the workflow in an environment they\u2019re already familiar with.\nCompute resources can be adjusted with just a few clicks, giving hospitals the ability to transform care for both patients and healthcare providers.\n\nVyasa, a provider of deep learning analysis tools for healthcare and life sciences, uses NVIDIA AI Enterprise to build applications that can search unstructured content such as patient care records. With the software, Vyasa can develop their deep learning applications faster and help dive through unstructured data and PDFs to assess which patients are at a higher risk. It identifies those who haven\u2019t been in for a check-up in more than a year, and can refine for additional risk factors like age and race.\n\u201cNVIDIA AI Enterprise has reduced our deployment times by half thanks to rapid provisioning of platform requirements that eliminate the need to manually download and integrate software packages,\u201d said Frans Lawaetz, CIO at Vyasa.\u00a0\nRadiologists use iCAD\u2019s innovative ProFound AI software to assist with reading mammograms. These AI solutions help identify cancer earlier, categorize breast density, and accurately assess short-term personalized breast cancer risk based on each woman\u2019s screening mammogram. Running advanced workloads with VMware vSphere is important for iCAD\u2019s healthcare customers as they can easily integrate their data intensive applications into any hospital infrastructure.\nA host of other software makers, like the American College of Radiology\u2019s AI LAB and Rhino Health, with its federated learning platform, have begun validating their software on NVIDIA AI Enterprise to ease deployment by integrating into a common healthcare IT infrastructure.\nThe ability for NVIDIA AI Enterprise to unify the data center for healthcare organizations has sparked the creation of an ecosystem with NVIDIA technology at its heart. The common NVIDIA and VMware infrastructure benefits software vendors and healthcare organizations alike by making the deployment and management of these solutions much easier.\nFor many healthcare IT and software companies, integrating AI into hospital environments is a top priority. Many NVIDIA Inception partners will be testing the ease of deploying their offerings on NVIDIA AI Enterprise in these types of environments. They include \u200b\u200bAidence, Arterys, contextflow, ImageBiopsy Lab, InformAI, MD.ai, methinks.ai, RADLogics, Sciberia, Subtle Medical and VUNO.\nNVIDIA Inception is a program that offers go-to-market support, expertise and technology for AI, data science and HPC startups.\nQualified enterprises can apply to experience NVIDIA AI Enterprise in curated, no-cost labs offered on NVIDIA LaunchPad.\nHear more about NVIDIA\u2019s work in healthcare by tuning in to my special address on Nov. 29 at RSNA, the Radiological Society of North America\u2019s annual meeting. \nMain image shows how NVIDIA AI Enterprise allows hospital IT administrators to run AI applications alongside core hospital applications, like iCAD Profound AI Software for mammograms.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Among them, BMW Group, which has 31 factories around the world, is building multiple industrial digital twins of its operations; and Ericsson is adopting Omniverse to build digital twins of urban areas to help determine how to construct 5G networks.\nIndeed, the worldwide market for digital twin platforms is forecast to reach $86 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s open platforms along with physics-infused neural networks bring great value to Siemens Energy,\u201d said Stefan Lichtenberger, technical portfolio manager at Siemens Energy.\nSiemens Energy builds and services combined cycle power plants, which include large gas turbines and steam turbines. Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) use the exhaust heat from the gas turbine to create steam used to drive the steam turbine. This improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the power plant by more than 60 percent, according to Siemens Energy.\nAt some sections of an HRSG, a steam and water mixture can cause corrosion that might impact the lifetime of the HRSG\u2019s parts. Downtime for maintenance and repairs leads to lost revenue opportunities for utility companies.\nSiemens Energy estimates that a 10 percent reduction in the industry\u2019s average planned downtime of 5.5 days for HRSGs \u2014 required among others to check wall loss thickness of pipes due to corrosion \u2014\u00a0 would save $1.7 billion a year.\nSimulations for Industrial Applications\nSiemens Energy is enlisting NVIDIA technology to develop a new workflow to reduce the frequency of planned shutdowns while maintaining safety. Real-time data \u2014 water inlet temperature, pressure, pH, gas turbine power and temperature \u2014 is preprocessed to compute pressure, temperature and velocity of both water and steam. The pressure, temperature and velocity are fed into a physics-ML model created with the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework to simulate precisely how steam and water flow through the pipes in real time.\nThe flow conditions in the pipes are then visualized with NVIDIA Omniverse, a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows. Omniverse scales across multi-GPUs to help Siemens Energy understand and predict the aggregated effects of corrosion in real time.\nAccelerating Digital Twin Development\nUsing NVIDIA software frameworks, running on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, Siemens Energy is simulating the corrosive effects of heat, water and other conditions on metal over time to fine-tune maintenance needs. Predicting maintenance more accurately with machine learning models can help reduce the frequency of maintenance checks without running the risk of failure. The scaled NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo PINN model was run on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) backed by P4d EC2 instances with A100 GPUs.\nBuilding computational fluid dynamics models for each HRSG, takes as long as eight weeks each to estimate corrosion within pipes at HRSGs plants. This process is required for a portfolio of more than 600 units.

Along with that come heightened cybersecurity threats.\nTo help them stay ahead of ever more sophisticated threats, NVIDIA has announced a\u00a0zero-trust cybersecurity platform with a suite of capabilities that allows the cybersecurity industry to build solutions that defend customer data centers in real time.\nThe zero-trust platform combines three technologies \u2014 NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, NVIDIA DOCA and the NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity AI framework. Doing so enables development partners to bring a new level of security to data centers \u2014 by isolating applications from infrastructure, by supercharging next-generation firewalls and by bringing the power of accelerated computing and deep learning to continuously monitor and detect threats \u2014 at speeds up to 600x faster than servers without NVIDIA acceleration.\n\u201cThe rise of transformative innovations such as AI, 5G and smart devices has dramatically expanded traffic moving through the modern data center, making it more difficult to identify potential breaches and attacks,\u201d said Kevin Deierling, senior vice president of Networking at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s three-pillar zero-trust security platform allows developers to create fully secure environments that protect virtually every aspect of the cloud-native data center, in real time.\u201d\nBlueField and DOCA 1.2\u00a0\nNVIDIA BlueField offloads the CPU burden of running security software and empowers developers using the new cybersecurity capabilities of NVIDIA DOCA 1.2 to build metered cloud services that control resource access, validate each application and user, isolate potentially compromised machines and help protect data from breaches and theft.\nOther DOCA 1.2 advanced zero-trust features \u2014 available as libraries and containerized services \u2013\u2013 include software and hardware authentication, hardware-accelerated line-rate data cryptography, support for distributed firewalls and smart telemetry, as well as policy enforcement, such as role-based access control and security isolation between microservices or tenants.\nMorpheus: Accelerated Cybersecurity AI on a Massive Scale\nDOCA 1.2 complements NVIDIA Morpheus, a deep learning cybersecurity framework supercharged by accelerated computing. The latest release of NVIDIA Morpheus includes a new workflow that creates digital fingerprints using unsupervised learning to detect when cyber adversaries have taken over a user account or machine.\n\nNVIDIA Morpheus is built on NVIDIA RAPIDS to speed data science pipelines and NVIDIA AI along with pretrained models that enable enterprises to simultaneously inspect all telemetry across their data center fabric.\nTo recognize potential threats before they become disruptive, Morpheus monitors streaming telemetry from diverse sources, including the BlueField DPU, and network traffic, application and cloud logs. It analyzes deviations in subtle data center characteristics generated by every user, machine and service \u2014\u00a0 in real time \u2014 and then immediately alerts security operations teams of issues.\nPartners Build Software-Defined, Hardware-Accelerated Applications\nThe DOCA 1.2 zero-trust security platform is the foundational software that powers the NVIDIA BlueField DPU, which offloads, accelerates and isolates data center infrastructure tasks. Similar to NVIDIA CUDA enabling developers to build applications that take advantage of NVIDIA GPUs, DOCA lets developers build software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking, security, storage and management applications for BlueField DPUs.\nJuniper Networks is among the first cybersecurity industry leaders taking advantage of BlueField and DOCA.\n\u201cZero-trust security should be a fundamental pillar of any security strategy. Introducing new ways to operationalize the technology will make it more pervasive across the industry,\u201d said Raj Yavatkar, CTO of Juniper Networks. \u201cJuniper has long advocated for open architectures to ensure customers have a choice. With DOCA, each individual organization will be well aligned to meet their digital transformation needs. The application of such approaches will help customers better secure their cloud workloads and adopt zero-trust principles.\u201d\nAvailability\nEarly access for NVIDIA DOCA 1.2 begins Nov. 30. NVIDIA Morpheus is available now.\nBlueField DPUs are available soon in systems from ASUS, Atos, Cisco, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, New H3C Information Technologies, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo, Nettrix, Quanta/QCT and Supermicro, with more than a dozen infrastructure partners lending their support, including Canonical, OVHcloud, Red Hat, UCloud, StackPath and VMware. More partners supporting BlueField include Aria Cybersecurity Solutions, Check Point Software, Cloudflare, DataDirect Networks (DDN), Excelero, F5, Fortinet, Guardicore, Juniper Networks, Nebulon, NetApp, Nutanix, VAST Data and WekaIO.\nRegister for free to learn more about DOCA during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

CUDA is Nvidia's proprietary programming platform and interface for applications to harness the computing power of the company's GPUs. CUDA is helping Nvidia sell more of these accelerators into enterprises.\nThe company has no plans to open-source its CUDA development environment, though if companies want to build or optimize their own chips for CUDA-built applications, the company is not necessarily against that effort, Huang told us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Underneath CUDA is Nvidia's hardware,\" Huang said. \"There's really nothing to open source. If somebody would like to build an application for CUDA or to build another chip for CUDA, we're not not fundamentally against it, and nobody has ever asked.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative would be for Nvidia to open-source its GPUs for others to use in their system-on-chips with CUDA-built applications running on top, which just isn't going to happen, Huang said. CUDA is often considered light-years ahead of similar frameworks for other architectures, and Nvidia isn't going to open up the software, nor the underlying hardware, to rivals.\nTo successfully produce a CUDA-compatible accelerator that can take full advantage of the framework, you will likely need Nvidia's input, and that's only going to happen if it makes commercial sense all round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a large player with lots of money to spend wants to develop custom silicon for the programming framework, that would grab Nvidia's interest, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.\n\"If it's a huge customer like Facebook, [Nvidia] will do whatever they need to,\" McGregor said. Top cloud providers like Amazon and Google are customizing chips for specific workloads, and Nvidia may lose out if it chooses not to collaborate in this area, plus CUDA's relevance could be diluted, he opined.\nGoogle has its family of homegrown TPUs to accelerate machine-learning software, for instance, we note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is positioning itself as a software company around CUDA, which is more of a means to sell more GPUs. The company sees itself as the software and hardware provider for the metaverse, a parallel 3D universe championed by Facebook (now Meta) as a borderless digital world in which avatars can work, play, and interact.\nCUDA is central to Nvidia's metaverse hardware and software platform called Omniverse. Meanwhile, companies are using CUDA to bring their applications to virtual worlds.\nNvidia has 150 software development kits available for building tools and whatnot on CUDA, with some new applications being ReOpt for supply chain optimization and cuQuantum for simulation of quantum computing on a GPU. CUDA is also being used to write software for autonomous cars equipped with Nvidia hardware.\n\nIt started at Pixar. Now it's the Apple-backed 3D file format viewed as HTML of metaverse\nNvidia declares that it is a full-stack platform\nNvidia anoints itself a creator of the metaverse\nAMD tries to spoil Nvidia's week by teasing high-end accelerators, Epyc chips with 3D L3 cache, and more\nChip makers aren't all-in on metaverse hardware yet \u2013 we should know, we asked them\n\nNvidia is balancing on a tightrope of projecting itself as an \"open\" company, while also recruiting organizations into its closed hardware and software ecosystem.\n\"Our strategy is not to be a bespoke, not to be a proprietary computer, but be an open computer,\" Huang said during the press conference, \"but be an open computer that allows the world to build software upon it. And whenever the software doesn't exist, we go and create it.\"\nWhile Nvidia holds on tight to CUDA, its crown jewels, rival tools are trying to fill the gap. Nvidia's GPUs are compliant with OpenCL, a parallel programming framework backed by AMD and Intel. AMD offers a hardware-acceleration software suite and CUDA wannabe called ROCm, and Intel has its whole oneAPI offering.\nOpenAI in July announced an AI-specific framework called Triton, which provides a Python-like programming environment in which researchers with no CUDA experience can write efficient code for execution on Nvidia GPUs.\nA project called Vortex is looking to bring the execution of CUDA applications to GPUs within RISC-V devices.\nBack in 2013, Nvidia said it would license its GPU IP to third parties. The company did not respond when we asked if it is still doing so. AMD has licensed its GPU architecture to Samsung, which the company plans to use in its mobile chips. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nData deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI\nHarnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCash torrent pouring into Nvidia slows \u2013 despite booming Blackwell adoption\nMay we all have problems like annual revenue growth dropping from 126 to 114 percent\n\nNvidia GTC27 Feb 2025 | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRunning hot?

These detectors help experts identify and analyze synthetic images to combat visual misinformation.\nAt this week\u2019s NVIDIA GTC, this work was shared in a session titled \u201cAlias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks,\u201d which provided an overview of StyleGAN3. To watch on demand,\u00a0 register free for GTC.\n\u201cThis has been a unique situation in that people doing image generation detection have worked closely with the people at NVIDIA doing image generation,\u201d said Edward Delp, a professor at Purdue University and principal investigator of one of the research teams. \u201cThis collaboration with NVIDIA has allowed us to build even better and more robust detectors. The \u2018early access\u2019 approach used by NVIDIA is an excellent way to further forensics research.\u201d\nAdvancing Media Forensics With StyleGAN3 Images\nWhen researchers know the underlying code or neural network of an image-generation technique, developing a detector that can identify images created by that AI model is a comparatively straightforward task.\nIt\u2019s more challenging \u2014 and useful \u2014 to build a detector that can spot images generated by brand-new AI models.\nStyleGAN3, a model developed by NVIDIA Research that will be presented at the NeurIPS 2021 AI conference in December, advances the state of the art in generative adversarial networks used to synthesize images. The breakthrough brings graphics principles in signal processing and image processing to GANs to avoid aliasing: a kind of image corruption often visible when images are rotated, scaled or translated.\nNVIDIA researchers developed StyleGAN3 using a publicly released dataset of 70,000 images. Another 27,000 unreleased images from that collection, alongside AI-generated images from StyleGAN3, were shared with forensic research collaborators as a test dataset.\nThe collaboration with researchers enabled the community to assess how a diversity of different detector approaches performs in identifying images synthesized by StyleGAN3 \u2014 before the generator\u2019s code was publicly released.\nThese detectors work in many different ways: Some may look for telltale correlations among groups of pixels produced by the neural network, while others might look for inconsistencies or asymmetries that give away synthetic images. Yet others attempt to reverse engineer the synthesis approach to estimate if a particular neural network could have created the image.\nOne of these detectors, GAN-Scanner, reaches up to 95 percent accuracy in identifying synthetic images generated with StyleGAN3, despite never having seen an image created by that model during training. Another detector, created by Politecnico di Milano, achieves an area under the curve of .999 (where a perfect classifier would achieve an AUC of 1.0).\nOur work with researchers on StyleGAN3 showcases and supports the important, cutting-edge research done by media forensics groups. We hope it inspires others in the image-synthesis research community to participate in forensics research as well.\nSource code for NVIDIA StyleGAN3 is available on GitHub, as well as results and links for the detector collaboration discussed here. The paper behind the research can be found on arXiv.\nThe GAN detector collaboration is part of Semantic Forensics (SemaFor), a program focused on forensic analysis of media organized by DARPA, the U.S. federal agency for technology research and development.\nTo learn more about the latest in AI research, watch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote presentation at GTC below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2021 | NVIDIA Research | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With advanced intelligent summon capabilities, the platform delivers seamless drop-off and pick-up experiences, unlocking a world of dazzling prospects.\nThe technology of NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar makes DRIVE Concierge everyone\u2019s digital assistant, making recommendations, helping book reservations, make phone calls and provide alerts. It\u2019s personalized to give every vehicle occupant their own personal concierge and valet.\nParking is an incredibly complex task. Just consider all the signs and markings required to determine whether it\u2019s legal to park, whether it\u2019s an accessible space or loading zone, if a fire hydrant is nearby or there are street-sweeping time restrictions.\nAdd to that the boundaries of a spot, demarcated by lines and curbs, as well as common obstacles in parking lots such as concrete pillars and shopping carts.\nDRIVE Concierge uses various diverse sensors, high-performance AI compute and flexible, modular software to handle all of these conditions and more, picking up and dropping off drivers, and finding parking spots to wait in the meantime.\nAn Intelligent Architecture\nA reliable parking solution begins with a hardware setup architected with diversity and redundancy for safe operation.\nDRIVE Concierge is built on NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion 8, which includes the high-performance, centralized NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip and complete sensor architecture.\u200b\nThe Orin SoC achieves 254 trillion operations per second and is designed to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles, while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.\nThe DRIVE Hyperion 8 sensor suite consists of high-fidelity surround cameras, radars, ultrasonics and front lidar to provide 360-degree surround scene interpretation. This diverse sensor set delivers the redundancy required for safe and robust parking capabilities, especially in complex urban scenarios.\nHow It Works: Redundant and Diverse DNNs\n\nDRIVE Concierge software runs on top of DRIVE Orin and the NVIDIA DRIVE SDK, which consists of the DriveWorks middleware compute graph framework and DRIVE OS safe operating system, enabling a wide range of deep neural networks to run simultaneously with improved runtime latency.\n\nTraditionally, automated parking functions have used high-level features from ultrasonic sensors to develop a sparse representation of the environment around the vehicle. However, this method is difficult to employ in an environment with dynamic actors, such as pedestrians, or obstacles around the vehicle.\nDRIVE Concierge fuses the data from ultrasonic sensors and fish-eye cameras. Its Evidence Grid Map DNN uses data from the sensors to generate a real-time dense grid map in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle.\nDense fusion generates information about whether the space surrounding the vehicle is free and the likelihood of whether any space is likely to be occupied by a dynamic obstacle or a stationary obstacle. Then the ParkNet DNN fuses images from multiple cameras and provides a list of potential parking spaces to choose from. Finally, parking spot perception fuses data from multiple cameras to associate parking spaces and parking signs to determine which parking space to use.\nIn addition to the dense perception, the parking function includes sparse perception, which perceives far-range objects using both camera and radar data.\nThe dense-perception and sparse-perception modules use redundant sensor data, complementing each other to build an accurate 4D world model for the downstream path and trajectory planner module. \u200b\nLastly, the vehicle\u2019s path and trajectory planner module takes this data to plan the vehicle\u2019s maneuvers for parking, avoiding collisions with immediate close objects and high-speed far-range obstacles.\nAltogether, DRIVE Concierge leverages a comprehensive sensor suite and safety-certified compute architecture from the DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform, and Omniverse Avatar inside the vehicle, to deliver a robust, stress-free parking experience.\nCatch up on the full GTC keynote:\n\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In a demo, Huang showed the power of Omniverse Replicator when applied to autonomous vehicle development using DRIVE Sim.\n\nDRIVE Sim is a simulation tool built on Omniverse that takes advantage of the many capabilities of the platform. Data generated by DRIVE Sim is used to train deep neural networks that make up the perception systems in autonomous vehicles. For the NVIDIA DRIVE team, synthetic data has been an effective, critical component of its AV development workflow.\nThe deep neural networks powering an autonomous vehicle\u2019s perception are composed of two parts: an algorithmic model, and the data used to train that model. Engineers have dedicated significant time to refining algorithms. However, the data side of the equation is still underdeveloped due to the limitations of real-world data, which is incomplete and time consuming and costly to collect.\nThis imbalance often leads to a plateau in DNN development, hindering progress where the data cannot meet the demands of the model. With synthetic data generation, developers have more control over data development, tailoring it to the specific needs of the model.\nWhile real-world data is a critical component for AV training, testing and validation, it presents significant challenges. The data used to train these networks is collected by sensors on a vehicle fleet during real-world drives. Once captured, the data must be labeled with the ground truth. Annotation is done by hand by thousands of labelers \u2014 a process that is time consuming, costly and can be inaccurate.\nAugmenting real-world data collection with synthetic data removes these bottlenecks while allowing engineers to take a data-driven approach to DNN development, significantly accelerating AV development and improving real-world results.\nThe Sim-Real Domain Gap Problem\nSynthetic data generation is a well-known tool for AI training \u2014 researchers have been experimenting with video games such as Grand Theft Auto to create data as early as 2016.\nUnlike video games, however, the quality of perception DNNs is heavily influenced by the fidelity of the data to the real world \u2014 training on datasets that don\u2019t translate to the physical world can actually degrade a network\u2019s performance.\nThis sim-to-real gap presents itself in two ways primarily. An appearance gap corresponds to pixel-level differences between the simulated image and the real image, which is caused by how the simulator generates the data. The renderer, sensor model, fidelity of 3D assets and material properties can all contribute to this.\nA content gap can be caused by the lack of real-world content diversity and by differences between sim and real-world contexts. These inconsistencies occur when the context of a scene doesn\u2019t match reality. For example, the real world contains dirty roads, dented cars, and emergency vehicles on roadsides, which all must be reproduced in simulation. Another important factor is the behavior of actors, such as traffic and pedestrians \u2014 realistic interactions are key to realistic data output.\nApplying Omniverse Replicator to Narrow the Sim-Real Domain Gap\nOmniverse Replicator is designed to narrow the appearance and content gaps.\nTo narrow the appearance gap, DRIVE Sim takes advantage of Omniverse\u2019s RTX path-tracing renderer to generate physically based sensor data for cameras, radars and lidars and ultrasonics sensors. Real-world effects are captured in the sensor data, including phenomena such as LED flicker, motion blur, rolling shutter, lidar beam divergence and doppler effect. These details even include high-fidelity vehicle dynamics, which are important because, for example, the movement of a vehicle during a lidar scan impacts the resulting point cloud.\nThe other half of this sensor equation is materials. Materials in DRIVE Sim are physically simulated for accurate beam reflections. DRIVE Sim includes a built-in lidar materials library and a forthcoming radar and ultrasonics materials library.\nDRIVE Sim\u2019s sensor capabilities include path-traced camera, radar and lidar models that capture real-world effects such as motion blur, LED flicker, rolling shutter and doppler effect.\nAn early morning scene rendered with NVIDIA DRIVE Sim RTX path-tracer.\nDRIVE Sim uses the RTX path-tracer to render these early morning and night time scenes with incredible fidelity.\nOne of the primary ways to address the content gap is with more diverse assets at the highest levels of fidelity. DRIVE Sim leverages Omniverse\u2019s capabilities to connect to a wide range of content creation tools. However, generating proper scenes also requires that the context is correct.\nUnder the hood, Omniverse Replicator organizes data for rapid scene manipulation using a capability called domain randomization. DRIVE Sim includes tools for this and scene construction that create a large amount of diverse data while maintaining real-world context. Since Omniverse Replicator is also time accurate and deterministic, the dataset can be created in repeatable way.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3d_cuboids_camera_front_wide_120fov_cpuonly-4s-1920x1080-2.mp4\nDRIVE Sim provides tools for generating randomized scenes in a controlled and repeatable way that adds variety and diversity to the data generated.\nReal Results\nDRIVE Sim has already produced significant results in accelerating perception development with synthetic data at NVIDIA.\nOne example is the migration to the latest NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion sensor set. The NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform includes sensors for complete production AV development. However, before these sensors were even available, the NVIDIA DRIVE team was able to bring up DNNs for the platform using synthetic data. DRIVE Sim generated millions of images and ground-truth data for training. As a result, the networks were ready to deploy as soon as the sensors were installed, saving valuable months of development time.\nIn another instance, the PathNet DNN, which detects drivable lane space, had difficulty determining a path when the vehicle was not centered in the lane. Collecting such data is difficult because driving partially out of a lane is dangerous (and against NVIDIA\u2019s data collection policy). By training the network on millions of synthetic images of off-centered driving paths, DRIVE Sim significantly improved PathNet\u2019s accuracy.\nThe same proved true for both LightNet, which detects traffic lights, and SignNet, which detects and classifies road signs. These networks were struggling to identify lights at extreme angles and misclassifying signs in certain conditions due to a lack of data. Engineers were able to design data to augment the real-world datasets and improve performance.\nBy training both DNNs on synthetic data that covered these problem areas, performance quickly improved, removing bottlenecks from the development process.\nSeeing What Humans Can\u2019t\u00a0\nSynthetic data changes the nature of DNN development. It\u2019s time- and cost-effective, and provides engineers the freedom to generate a tailored dataset on demand.\nDevelopers can specify elements such as weather, lighting, pedestrians, road debris, and more. They can also control the distribution of elements, such as specifying a particular mix of trucks, busses, cars and motorcycles in a given set of data.\nSynthetic data provides ground truth that humans can\u2019t label. Examples are depth information, velocity and multisensor tracking. This ground truth information can significantly enhance perception capabilities.\nIt also facilitates labeling for components that are difficult, sometimes impossible, to label. For example, a pedestrian that walks behind a car is impossible for a human to label properly while occluded. However with simulation, the ground truth is available automatically and accurate at a pixel level, even if the information isn\u2019t visible to humans.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3d_cuboids_camera_front_tele_30fov-4s-1920x1080-1.mp4\nA key feature of synthetic data is precise ground-truth labels for scenes that are difficult or impossible in the real world, such as this scene with the pedestrian who is occluded as the car passes.\nClearing the Path Ahead\nAs a modular, open and extensible platform for synthetic data generation, Omniverse Replicator brings powerful new capabilities to deep-learning engineers. DRIVE Sim uses these new features to provide AV developers the ultimate flexibility and efficiency in simulation testing.\nIt allows engineers to create the datasets they need to accelerate their work.\nThe results are DNNs that are more accurate and developed on a shorter timeline, bringing safer, more efficient autonomous driving technology to roads sooner.\nLearn more about DRIVE Sim and accelerate the development of safer, more efficient transportation today.\nCatch up on the full GTC keynote:\n\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA DRIVE Sim | Synthetic Data Generation | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This latest generation technology is designed for the highest levels of functional safety and cybersecurity, and is supported by sensors from a wide range of leading suppliers including Continental, Hella, Luminar, Sony and Valeo. DRIVE Hyperion is available today for 2024 vehicle models, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced at GTC.\nThe production platform is designed to be open and modular, so customers can easily use what they need \u2014 from core compute and middleware all the way to NCAP, level 3 driving, level 4 parking and AI cockpit capabilities.\nDuring the GTC keynote, Huang showed a DRIVE Hyperion 8 vehicle drive autonomously from the NVIDIA headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., to Rivermark Plaza in San Jose.\n\nDRIVE Hyperion is also scalable, with the current standard DRIVE Orin platform designed to be upgradeable with NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan and DriveWorks APIs that are compatible across generations.\nArchitected for Safety\nWith a functionally safe AI compute platform at its core, DRIVE Hyperion provides a secure base for autonomous vehicle development.\nTwo NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip provide redundancy and fail-over safety, as well as ample compute for level 4 self-driving and intelligent cockpit capabilities.\nThe DRIVE Hyperion 8 developer kit also includes NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs. This high-performance compute delivers ample headroom for developers to test and validate new software capabilities.\nThe NVIDIA DriveWorks Sensor Abstraction Layer streamlines sensor setup with easy-to-use plugins, while DRIVE AV Software contains the deep neural networks for perception, mapping, planning and control.\nSensing New Possibilities\nBy including a complete sensor setup on top of centralized compute and AI software, DRIVE Hyperion provides everything needed to validate an intelligent vehicle\u2019s hardware on the road.\nIts sensor suite encompasses 12 cameras, nine radars, 12 ultrasonics and one front-facing lidar sensor. And with the adoption of best-in-class sensor suppliers coupled with sensor abstraction tools, autonomous vehicle manufacturers can customize the platform to their individual self-driving solutions.\nThis open, flexible ecosystem ensures developers can test and validate their technology on the exact hardware that will be on the vehicle.\nThe long-range Luminar Iris sensor will perform front-facing lidar capabilities, using a custom architecture to meet the most stringent performance, safety and automotive-grade requirements.\n\u201cNVIDIA has led the modern compute revolution, and the industry sees them as doing the same with autonomous driving,\u201d said Austin Russell, Founder and CEO of Luminar. \u201cThe common thread between our two companies is that our technologies are becoming the de facto solution for major automakers to enable next-generation safety and autonomy. By taking advantage of our respective strengths, automakers have access to the most advanced autonomous vehicle development platform.\u201d\nThe radar suite includes Hella short-range and Continental long-range and imaging radars for redundant sensing. Sony and Valeo cameras provide the cutting edge in visual sensing, in addition to ultrasonic sensors from Valeo for measuring object distance.\n\u201cNVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion is a complete platform for developing autonomous vehicles, which is why Sony has integrated its sensors to give our customers the most effective transition from prototype to production vehicles,\u201d said Marius Evensen, Head of Automotive Marketing at Sony.\nDRIVE Hyperion is open and can accelerate the AV industry\u2019s time to market by giving manufacturers the ability to leverage NVIDIA\u2019s own development work. It includes all the tools NVIDIA engineers use to record, capture and process all the data from these sensors in real time.\nAnd this entire toolset is synchronized and calibrated precisely for 4D data collection, giving developers valuable time back in deploying safe and robust autonomous vehicles.

We are excited to partner with NVIDIA and for the future.\u201d\n\nPing An, one of the world\u2019s largest financial services companies, is improving customer experiences by reducing wait times through its virtual agents. Using Riva allows it to build real-time speech applications that are constantly improving in accuracy.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPing An addresses millions of customer queries per day using chatbot agents,\u201d said Jing Xiao, chief scientist at Ping An. \u201cUsing NVIDIA\u2019s pretrained models for automatic speech recognition, further fine-tuned on our data, our system has achieved a 5 percent improvement in accuracy, enabling us to provide more engaging and authentic services.\u201d\n\nDozens of software-makers are also using NVIDIA conversational AI in production. Gosoft Contact Center is working with CP All, which has 20+ business domains. Its retail domain serves more than 10,000 7-11 convenience stores in Thailand. In total, 240,000 calls are handled per day through the help of highly accurate AI voicebots trained on the Thai language.\u00a0\n\nAnd Plabook Education and Data Monsters are working with school districts across the U.S. to help children learn to read through its AI-powered digital avatar reading assistant that helps identify mispronounced words and measure their reading accuracy.\n\n\nAvailability and Pricing\nFor small-scale research and development, NVIDIA Riva is available at no cost on the NVIDIA NGC\u00a0 container registry. Developers can join the Riva open beta program to try the software today and receive notifications about upcoming features.\n\nFor customers with large-scale deployments and looking for technical support from NVIDIA experts, NVIDIA also announced the NVIDIA Riva Enterprise program, which is expected to be available early next year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRiva at GTC\n\nIn his GTC keynote, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang showcased Riva\u2019s speech AI capabilities, including in a demo with Riva Custom Voice that highlighted how new, human-like voices can be created with just 30 minutes of data.\u00a0\n\nRiva was also shown in Omniverse Avatar \u2014 a platform for creating interactive avatars \u2014 through Project Tokkio, DRIVE Concierge and Project Maxine. Project Tokkio and DRIVE Concierge showcased avatars in customer service and in-vehicle environments, while Project Maxine highlighted real-time translation and transcription into multiple languages.\n\nAt GTC, there are more than two dozen talks focused on conversational AI, including ones by Hugging Face, Snap, T-Mobile and more. Topics include state-of-the-art algorithms, tools, challenges and impact of developing and integrating GPU-accelerated speech and language AI applications.\nRegister for free to learn more about NVIDIA Riva during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

Everything from the locations of trees to the height and composition of buildings is crucial because they impact 5G wireless signals in networks serving smartphones, tablets and millions of other internet-connected devices.\nThe Stockholm-based maker of telecommunications equipment is combining decades of radio network simulation expertise with NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, a real-time virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows. In NVIDIA Omniverse, Ericsson is building city-scale digital twins to help accurately simulate the interplay between 5G cells and the environment for maximum performance and coverage.\nThe rollout of 5G networks is creating new challenges, and with over 15 million microcells and towers to be deployed globally by network operators over the next five years, it\u2019s no small undertaking.\n\nThe 5G Challenge\u00a0\n5G enables a multitude of new use cases ranging from IoT and manufacturing to self-driving cars and telehealth. Networks serving these use cases operate in vastly different environments. New types of devices will enter the networks, and the number of devices will grow by orders of magnitude in the next few years. These factors make the design and development of 5G products and networks very complex.\nWithout a digital-twin approach, the interaction between radio transmitters, the environment, and humans and devices that are on the move had to be understood with less detail. And many features had to be field tested only after the networks were already built.\n\u201cBefore Omniverse, coverage and capacity of networks was analyzed by simplifying many aspects of the complex interactions, such as the physical phenomena and mobility aspects,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Ceballos, a researcher at Ericsson. \u201cNow we\u2019ll be able to simulate network deployments and features in a highly detailed scale using Omniverse.\u201d\nCreating an end-to-end city-scale digital twin results in faster development cycles, better network optimization and ultimately better, swifter networks because it delivers fast insights into what products to install where, Ceballos says.\nGPU-Powered Insights\nEricsson and NVIDIA entered a strategic partnership in 2019 with the goal of cross-pollinating technologies and challenges between their respective domains.\nThe 3D community has historically been fragmented along several proprietary and competing formats and tool chains. This creates unacceptable degrees of lock-in and limited abilities to extend to new simulation use cases.\nThe NVIDIA Omniverse platform provides key technologies that allow Ericsson to accurately model network performance across dynamic environmental elements. NVIDIA RTX-accelerated real-time ray tracing allows researchers to see precise representations of signal quality at every point in the city, in real time, which wasn\u2019t possible before. This means Ericsson can experiment with its telecom products such as beam-forming and explore their impact interactively and instantaneously.\nEricsson\u2019s city-scale digital twin, made in NVIDIA Omniverse, simulates proper placement of 5G microcells and towers to help maximum performance and coverage.\nPlus, with emerging Omniverse platform capabilities such as Omniverse VR, network engineers could soon put on a virtual-reality headset and explore any part of any model, at 1:1 scale, tuning the parameters, antenna and literally \u201cseeing\u201d the effects \u2013 things that aren\u2019t visible in real life.\nFor Ericsson, the Omniverse digital twin offers universal telecoms insights, faster development cycles and the ability to achieve a cutting-edge network at lower costs.\nNVIDIA GTC is taking place online through Nov. 11.

At the same time, the world\u2019s cloud service providers are beginning to offer more supercomputing services to their millions of customers.\nNVIDIA Quantum-2 includes key features required for demanding workloads running in either arena. Supercharged by cloud-native technologies, it provides high performance with 400 gigabits per second of throughput and advanced multi-tenancy to accommodate many users.\n\u201cThe requirements of today\u2019s supercomputing centers and public clouds are converging,\u201d said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of Networking at NVIDIA. \u201cThey must provide the greatest performance possible for next-generation HPC, AI and data analytics challenges, while also securely isolating workloads and responding to varying demands of user traffic. This vision of the modern data center is now real with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand.\u201d\nNVIDIA Quantum-2 Performance and Cloud-Native Capabilities\r\nWith 400Gbps, NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand doubles the network speed and triples the number of network ports. It accelerates performance by 3x and reduces the need for data center fabric switches by 6x, while cutting data center power consumption and reducing data center space by 7 percent each.\nThe multi-tenant performance isolation of NVIDIA Quantum-2 keeps the activity of one tenant from disturbing others, utilizing an advanced telemetry-based congestion control system with cloud-native capabilities that ensure reliable throughput, regardless of spikes in users or workload demands.\nNVIDIA Quantum-2 SHARPv3\u2122 In-Network Computing technology provides 32x more acceleration engines for AI applications compared with the previous generation. Advanced InfiniBand fabric management for data centers, including predictive maintenance, is enabled with the NVIDIA UFM\u00ae Cyber-AI platform.\nA nanosecond-precision timing system integrated into NVIDIA Quantum-2 can synchronize distributed applications, like database processing, helping to reduce the overhead of wait and idle times. This new capability allows cloud data centers to become part of the telecommunications network and host software-defined 5G radio services.\nNVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand Switch\r\nAt the heart of the NVIDIA Quantum-2 platform is the new Quantum-2 InfiniBand switch. With 57 billion transistors on 7-nanometer silicon, it is slightly bigger than the NVIDIA A100 GPU with 54 billion transistors.\nIt features 64 ports at 400Gbps or 128 ports at 200Gbps and will be offered in a variety of switch systems up to 2,048 ports at 400Gbps or 4,096 ports at 200Gbps \u2014 more than 5x the switching capability over the previous generation, Quantum-1.\nThe combined networking speed, switching capability and scalability is ideal for building the next-generation of giant HPC systems.\nThe NVIDIA Quantum-2 switch is now available from a wide range of leading infrastructure and system vendors around the world, including Atos, DataDirect Networks (DDN), Dell Technologies, Excelero, GIGABYTE, HPE, IBM, Inspur, Lenovo, NEC, Penguin Computing, QCT, Supermicro, VAST Data and WekaIO.\nNVIDIA Quantum-2, ConnectX-7 and BlueField-3\r\nThe NVIDIA Quantum-2 platform provides two networking end-point options, the NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NIC and NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU InfiniBand.\nConnectX-7, with 8 billion transistors in a 7-nanometer design, doubles the data rate of the world\u2019s current leading HPC networking chip, the NVIDIA ConnectX-6. It also doubles the performance of RDMA, GPUDirect\u00ae Storage, GPUDirect RDMA and In-Networking Computing. The ConnectX-7 will sample in January.\nBlueField-3 InfiniBand, with 22 billion transistors in a 7-nanometer design, offers sixteen 64-bit Arm CPUs to offload and isolate the data center infrastructure stack. BlueField-3 samples in May.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.

LaunchPad features NVIDIA-Certified Systems and NVIDIA DGX systems, running the entire NVIDIA AI software stack.\n\u201cIndustries are adopting AI to achieve more accurate diagnoses in healthcare, improved safety in manufacturing, greater efficiency in agriculture, and many more critical use cases,\u201d said Manuvir Das, head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThe NVIDIA LaunchPad program helps enterprises worldwide quickly determine their AI requirements on the same stack they can purchase and deploy, giving them a running start with support from NVIDIA before a single server even ships.\u201d\nNKI Tests AI for Cancer Research Breakthroughs\nAmong the first to test AI workloads on LaunchPad is the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), an internationally acclaimed cancer center for treatment and research.\n\u201cAI can improve the precision of 3D cancer scans, which helps healthcare professionals target the exact site of a tumor for radiotherapy on each day the patient receives treatment,\u201d said Jonas Teuwen, group leader, AI for Oncology at NKI. \u201cOur NVIDIA LaunchPad experience showed that advanced AI workloads can run virtualized on mainstream, accelerated servers with NVIDIA AI Enterprise and VMware vSphere, which means that AI-powered breakthroughs in cancer treatment can be more accessible to a broader range of healthcare providers.\u201d\nWorldwide AI Access with LaunchPad at Equinix\nDigital infrastructure leader Equinix is the first NVIDIA LaunchPad program partner. NVIDIA-Certified Systems are now deployed at Equinix International Business Exchange data centers globally. The LaunchPad program is supported by Equinix services including its data center, connectivity and bare-metal offerings.\n\u201cAI is becoming ubiquitous, and as enterprises race to integrate it into their products and services, NVIDIA\u2019s LaunchPad program at Equinix helps companies get going faster than ever before,\u201d said Steve Steinhilber, vice president of Business Development at Equinix. \u201cAfter a LaunchPad experience, businesses can run their NVIDIA-accelerated AI workloads at Equinix locations globally to take advantage of close proximity to our extensive ecosystem of cloud, network and technology partners.\u201d\nImmediate Access to Full Portfolio of NVIDIA AI Software and Infrastructure\nLaunchPad allows for quick testing and prototyping of AI workflows with cloud-based interfaces into private compute, storage and network infrastructure. It includes development tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as application frameworks focused on vision AI, medical imaging, cybersecurity and more.\nNVIDIA Base Command coordinates AI development, running workloads across powerful accelerated computing infrastructure wherever data resides. NVIDIA Fleet Command securely deploys, manages and scales AI on NVIDIA-Certified servers in the data center or at the network edge, enabling enterprises to control their AI deployments from a single screen.\nLaunchPad also features the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite running on NVIDIA-Certified Systems to power enterprise AI workloads in VMware vSphere environments.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA LaunchPad program provides an ideal way for customers to experience how simple it is to add enterprise AI workloads to VMware vSphere-based clouds with NVIDIA AI Enterprise,\u201d said Krish Prasad, senior vice president and GM, Cloud Infrastructure Business Group at VMware. \u201cWhen customers are ready to take the next step in AI, they can quickly leverage the preconfigured and optimized NVIDIA LaunchPad for prototyping their workloads and significantly speed up their adoption of the AI-Ready solution from VMware and NVIDIA.\u201d\nCurated labs in LaunchPad help enterprises grow their skills and evaluate the requirements needed for a number of common AI applications. The NVIDIA-developed labs include training a model using TensorFlow, performing sentiment analysis with NVIDIA RAPIDS, deploying an AI support chatbot using Fleet Command and more.\nQualified enterprises can evaluate AI workloads on NVIDIA LaunchPad at no charge. Apply now for NVIDIA LaunchPad access.\nFollowing their LaunchPad experience, customers can choose how to accelerate their AI initiatives:\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise: Customers can purchase licenses to run NVIDIA AI Enterprise software on mainstream, NVIDIA-Certified Systems available from leading server manufacturers, including ASUS, Atos, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Inspur Electronic Information, Lenovo and Supermicro, at data centers and edge locations, or deploy their AI infrastructure at Equinix. NVIDIA AI Enterprise solutions are also available from NVIDIA channel partners worldwide, including Atea, Axians, Carahsoft Technology Corp., Computacenter, Insight Enterprises, Presidio, Sirius, SoftServe, SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH, TD SYNNEX, Trace3 and World Wide Technology.\nNVIDIA Base Command: Base Command is available as a managed service that also includes NVIDIA DGX systems and NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription.\nNVIDIA Fleet Command: Customers can purchase licenses for Fleet Command to run on NVIDIA-Certified Systems or hybrid clouds.\n\nRegister for free to learn more about NVIDIA LaunchPad during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

Thanks to its terrific rally, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of just over $766 billion.\nApple, on the other hand, has a market cap of $2.5 trillion, making it a much bigger entity than Nvidia despite the iPhone maker's underperformance on the stock market in 2021. However, it is worth noting that Nvidia's market cap has increased at a much faster pace than Apple's over the past five years. Let's see why this has been the case.\n\nNVDA Market Cap data by YCharts\nNvidia's faster growth gives it an edge over Apple\nThe growing demand for graphics cards used in data centers and gaming personal computers (PCs) has supercharged Nvidia's top and bottom lines over the past couple of years. Meanwhile, Apple is benefiting big time from the rapid adoption of 5G smartphones. This is evident from the massive growth in Nvidia and Apple's revenue in fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nFY 2020\n\n\nFY 2021\n\n\nFY 2022 (Estimate)\n\n\nFY 2023 (Estimate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\n\n\n$274.5 billion\n\n\n$365.8 billion\n\n\n$381.3 billion\n\n\n$401.8 billion\n\n\n\n\nYear-over-year growth\u00a0\n\n\n5.5%\n\n\n33%\n\n\n4.2%\n\n\n5.4%\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n$10.9 billion\n\n\n$16.7 billion\n\n\n$25.8 billion\n\n\n$29.1 billion\n\n\n\n\nYear-over-year growth\u00a0\n\n\n(7)%\n\n\n53%\n\n\n55%\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\nSource: Annual earnings reports and Yahoo! Finance. FY = Fiscal Year\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as noted in the table, Nvidia is expected to maintain stronger growth levels over the next couple of fiscal years. Analysts expect the chipmaker's earnings to clock\u00a0a compound annual growth rate of more than 32% for the next five years, while Apple's earnings are expected to grow at a slower annual rate\u00a0of 15%.\nWhy Nvidia could keep growing at a faster pace than Apple\nNvidia dominates the graphics card market. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that its share of the discrete GPU (graphics processing unit) market stood at 83% in the second quarter of 2021. Market research firm Omdia points\u00a0out that Nvidia's share of the cloud and data center GPU market was over 80% in 2020.\nThis puts Nvidia in a solid position to grow its revenue and earnings at a quick pace in the future. That's because the discrete GPU market is expected to hit $54 billion in revenue by 2025, compared to $23.6 billion in 2020. Other third-party research points out that the data center GPU market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 43.5% through 2026, and hit $26.2 billion in revenue.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's dominance in both these markets means that the company could add billions of dollars to its revenue in the coming years. Apple is also sitting on a nice catalyst in the form of 5G smartphones. The company saw a nice spike in iPhone unit volumes in the third quarter of 2021. Market research firm IDC says that Apple shipped\u00a050.4 million iPhones in the third quarter, up from 41.7 million units in the year-ago period. The company stood second in the global smartphone rankings in Q3 with a market share of 15.2%.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple is making more money per iPhone in the 5G era -- its average selling price (ASP) increased sharply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended on Sept. 25, 2021. Based on IDC's shipment data and Apple's iPhone revenue figures from its quarterly reports, the iPhone ASP increased 21.6% year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter to $771.\nHowever, cheaper offerings from Chinese competitors are expected to bring down the ASP of a 5G smartphone. IDC forecasts that the ASP of a 5G smartphone could drop to just $404 by 2025 from this year's estimate of $634. This could dent the improved pricing power that Apple is currently enjoying in 5G smartphones. Additionally, Apple isn't as dominant as Nvidia in the smartphone space, as it competes\u00a0with the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, and other Chinese companies that have cornered much bigger shares of the market.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia enjoys strong pricing power in the lucrative GPU market since it has an iron grip over this space, which is allowing the company to command a premium over rival AMD's offerings.\nCould Nvidia become more valuable than Apple by 2026?\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia outpace Apple's growth. Apart from the video game and data center markets that are driving impressive growth for Nvidia, it also stands to gain from other areas such as self-driving cars, the metaverse, and cloud gaming, among others. But Apple is likely to face resistance from competitors and its growth may not be as great as Nvidia's.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if Nvidia's earnings grow at more than 32% a year for the next five years, it could generate $16.93\u00a0in earnings per share at the end of the forecast period based on this year's estimated earnings of $4.13 per share. Nvidia is trading at 106 times\u00a0earnings right now. Assuming the same price-to-earnings ratio after five years, Nvidia's stock price would be closer\u00a0to $1,800 -- a six-fold jump over its current stock price of nearly $300 -- which points toward $4.5 trillion in market cap in 2026.\nApple's projected annual earnings growth of 15.4% for the next five years would send its earnings to $11.74 per share at the end of the forecast period. Apple is trading at 26 times earnings now, and a similar multiple in 2026 would translate into a stock price of $305. So its stock is expected to double\u00a0in the next five years, which means that it could have a market cap of nearly $5 trillion at the end of 2026.\nIt's probable that Apple could remain more valuable than Nvidia in 2026. But Nvidia's market capitalization is likely to increase by a much bigger margin, which makes it a more attractive option for investors in the hunt for a growth stock.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It delivers 200 trillion operations per second, similar to that of a GPU-enabled server but in a size that fits in the palm of your hand.\nThe new Jetson computer accelerates the full NVIDIA AI software stack, allowing developers to deploy the largest, most complex models needed to solve edge AI and robotics challenges in natural language understanding, 3D perception, multisensor fusion and more.\n\u201cAs robotics and embedded computing transform manufacturing, healthcare, retail, transportation, smart cities and other essential sectors of the economy, the demand for processing continues to surge,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of embedded and edge computing at NVIDIA. \u201cJetson AGX Orin addresses this need, enabling the 850,000 Jetson developers and over 6,000 companies building commercial products on it to create and deploy autonomous machines and edge AI applications that once seemed impossible.\u201d\nJetson AGX Orin features an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU and Arm Cortex-A78AE CPUs, along with next-generation deep learning and vision accelerators. High-speed interfaces, faster memory bandwidth and multimodal sensor support provide the ability to feed multiple concurrent AI application pipelines.\nComprehensive Software and Ecosystem Support\r\nCustomers using the Jetson AGX Orin can leverage the NVIDIA CUDA-X\u2122 accelerated computing stack, NVIDIA JetPack\u2122 SDK and the latest NVIDIA tools for application development and optimization, including cloud-native development workflows. Pretrained models from the NVIDIA NGC\u2122 catalog are optimized and ready for fine-tuning with the NVIDIA TAO toolkit and customer datasets. This reduces time and cost for production-quality AI deployments, while cloud-native technologies allow seamless updates throughout a product\u2019s lifetime.\nThe Jetson embedded computing partner ecosystem encompasses a broad range of services and products, including cameras and other multimodal sensors, carrier boards, hardware design services, AI and system software, developer tools and custom software development.\n\u201cDriven by the advancements in AI, the robotics market is growing exponentially,\u201d said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research. \u201cNVIDIA is the recognized leader in AI and continues to leverage this expertise to advance robotics through a robust ecosystem and complete end-to-end solutions, including a range of hardware platforms that leverage common tools and neural network models. The new Jetson platform brings the performance and versatility of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture to enable even further advancements in autonomous mobile robots for a wide range of applications ranging from agriculture and manufacturing to healthcare and smart cities.\u201d\nFor specific use cases, software frameworks include NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122 on Omniverse for robotics, NVIDIA Clara Holoscan\u2122 SDK for healthcare, and NVIDIA DRIVE\u2122 for autonomous driving. The latest Isaac release includes significant support for the Robot Operating System (ROS) developer community. NVIDIA has also released the new Omniverse Replicator for synthetic data generation and Isaac GEMs, hardware-accelerated software packages that make it easier for ROS developers to build high-performance AI-enabled robots on the Jetson platform.\nComputing Platform for Real-Time Sensing Medical Instruments, Devices \r\nNVIDIA AGX Orin powers NVIDIA Clara Holoscan, a new computing platform for the healthcare industry that allows developers to build software-defined medical devices which run low-latency streaming applications on the edge. This processing power is needed for devices such as robotic surgery, endoscopy and diagnostic imaging systems to process physics, imaging and visualization and enable real-time AI-decision support for doctors. Clara Holoscan gives developers a flexible platform to create AI microservices that run low-latency streaming applications on devices while passing more complex tasks to the data center.\nNew Era of Transportation Built on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin \r\nDRIVE AGX Orin, also powered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture like Jetson AGX Orin, is the platform of choice for the transportation industry. It is the advanced processor behind the newly announced NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur \u2014 two AI platforms dedicated to redefining the passenger experience inside the car through AI assistants, and to powering safe, autonomous driving, respectively.

These intelligent technologies transform the digital experience inside the car.\nSoftware-defined vehicles will incorporate two key computers built with NVIDIA DRIVE Orin: one for AI assistants, the DRIVE Concierge, and one for autonomous driving, the DRIVE Chauffeur. DRIVE Concierge uses NVIDIA DRIVE IX technology and NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar, and works directly with DRIVE Chauffeur, based on NVIDIA DRIVE AV technology, to redefine the experience inside the car.\nAs cities have reopened, traffic is returning to \u2014 and in some states, exceeding \u2014 pre-pandemic levels. Experts expect to see an ongoing increase in vehicle travel, while a new work-from-home hybrid future could lead to less frequent rush hour traffic jams.\nThese trends are coinciding with the rapid progress of autonomous vehicle technology, meaning more drivers on the road doesn\u2019t have to translate to more highway headaches. With the centralized, high-performance compute architecture of NVIDIA DRIVE, AI can now enhance almost every part of the vehicle journey for a safer, more convenient experience.\nA Truly Intelligent Assistant\nSometimes, the demands of work and life can make you wish you had an extra set of hands \u2014 or AIs.\nWith DRIVE Concierge, vehicle occupants have access to intelligent services that are always on, using NVIDIA DRIVE IX and NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar for real-time conversational AI.\nOmniverse Avatar connects speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation. Avatars created on the platform are interactive characters with ray-traced 3D graphics that can see, speak, converse on a wide range of subjects, and understand naturally spoken intent.\nThe technology of\u00a0 Omniverse Avatar enables DRIVE Concierge to serve as everyone\u2019s digital assistant, helping them make recommendations, book reservations, make phone calls and provide alerts, like if a purse is left behind in the vehicle. It\u2019s personalized to each driver and passenger, giving every vehicle occupant their own personal concierge. And with Omniverse Avatar technology, these assistants will have incredible intelligence.\nWith an Omniverse avatar, you\u2019ll be able to have a natural conversation with the vehicle and use voice to control many functions that previously required physical controls or touch screens.\nIn a demo of the DRIVE Concierge AI platform during the GTC keynote, a digital assistant on the center dashboard screen helps a driver select the best driving mode to reach his destination on time.\n\nDRIVE Concierge is also an on-demand valet, parking the car so drivers can easily continue on their way. It\u2019s also a guardian, using interior cameras and multimodal interaction to ensure that driver attention is on the road when necessary.\nDrivers and passengers can also see what\u2019s in the mind of the vehicle\u2019s AI with Omniverse Avatar\u2019s 3D graphics. DRIVE Concierge is tightly integrated with DRIVE Chauffeur to provide high-quality, 360-degree, 4D visualization with low latency, so the driver can comfortably sit back and trust the Chauffeur to safely drive.\nThis cooperation between systems also enables DRIVE Concierge to perform functions such as summoning the vehicle, searching for a parking spot and reconstructing a 3D surround view of the vehicle using neural graphics.\nAI, Take the Wheel\nThe freedom of the open road isn\u2019t always the reality of everyday driving \u2014 elements such as heavy traffic can quickly turn a trip into a chore.\nDRIVE Chauffeur is an AI-assisted driving platform based on the NVIDIA DRIVE AV SDK that can handle both highway and urban traffic with the utmost safety. It relieves the human driver from the burden of controlling the vehicle and monitoring the surrounding environment at all times, giving back valuable time and energy.\n\nUsing the high-performance compute architecture and sensor set of DRIVE Hyperion 8, DRIVE Chauffeur can drive from address to address. For those who want to drive, the system provides active safety features, intervening in dangerous scenarios.\nThe entire DRIVE Chauffeur pipeline has been architected to perceive the world in 4D for robust and efficient autonomous operation.\nDRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur are revolutionizing the driving experience, working together to make every commute safer, more convenient and more enjoyable than ever.\nCatch up on the full GTC keynote: \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The lab will use NVIDIA AI infrastructure and the NVIDIA Omniverse advanced visualization and virtual world simulation platform to process a fire\u2019s magnitude and forecast its progress. By recreating the fire in a physically accurate digital twin, the system will be able to suggest actions to best suppress the blaze.\nWhile wildfires have torn through more than 6.5 million acres in the U.S. so far this year, the problem is far broader than that. Vastly more land has been scorched in Siberia, and epic blazes have swept through the Mediterranean region and Australia.\nNew Silicon Valley Lab\nThe AI development lab, to be based in Silicon Valley, will include Lockheed Martin\u2019s Cognitive Mission Manager (CMM) system, an end-to-end AI-driven planning and orchestration platform, that combines real-time sensor data about the fire with other data sources on fuel vegetation, topography, wind and more to predict the fire\u2019s spread. The CMM provides course-of-action recommendations to the incident command teams to decrease response time and increase effectiveness of wildfire suppression and humanitarian actions.\nThe lab will serve as an open collaboration space for industry and users to concentrate talent and resources for CMM design and rapidly develop prototypes in NVIDIA Omniverse. Lockheed Martin is providing domain expertise in applied AI, platform integration, planning and oversight as well as several dozen application engineers and data scientists. NVIDIA is contributing data analysis and simulation expertise to help develop, model, test and deploy in the lab.\nTo crunch the data and train AI models, Lockheed Martin uses NVIDIA DGX systems. To visualize the fires and predict how they might spread, Lockheed Martin uses NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise.\n\u201cThe combination of Lockheed Martin and NVIDIA technology has the potential to help crews respond more quickly and effectively to wildfires while reducing risk to fire crews and residents,\u201d said Shashi Bhushan, Principal AI Architect at Lockheed Martin.\nVisualizing the Flames Using a Digital Twin\nNVIDIA Omniverse allows fire behavior analysts to see the predictions in a digital twin of the environment. Using the real-time, multi-GPU scalable simulation platform, Lockheed Martin creates visualizations of the predicted fire movements and studies their flow dynamics across a digital replica of the landscape. This enables its team to utilize NVIDIA Omniverse in multiple areas.\n\nThe fire control industry primarily relies on tools derived from the Rothermel surface fire spread model to predict fire progression. The team at Lockheed Martin is working with the group that created this model, the Forestry Service Missoula Fire Sciences Lab, to examine how AI can improve upon existing methods of fire front prediction with speed and accuracy.\nWith NVIDIA Omniverse, the team at Lockheed Martin can accelerate training, development, and evaluation of new AI models by recreating historical fires using real data, in addition to representing how the Rothermel model and the CMM algorithms would predict the fire. This enables the engineers to simultaneously compare how historical fire progressed relative to both models\u2019 predictions.\nNVIDIA Omniverse also provides an immersive digital twin environment for emergency responders, operators, and engineers to evaluate the impact of their suppression activities.\n\u201cIn Omniverse, you\u2019ve got a virtual world that represents a photorealistic digital environment. In it, we can visualize the fires and aspects that affect them, like the terrain, slope, wind and more,\u201d said Bhushan. \u201cIn the near future, we could generate synthetic data by flying virtual assets through the Omniverse scene. Additionally, the Omniverse simulation becomes the foundation to create additional AI based models to explore response behaviors.\u201d\nUsing historic data from the Cameron Peak Fire captured through infrared cameras, CMM\u2019s AI model predicted how the fire would evolve \u2014 considering aspects like elevation, slope, terrain and wind. Then, the data was put into the NVIDIA Omniverse visualization and simulation platform, where the above digital replica of the fire was created.\nThe Lockheed Martin engineers working on CMM aim to integrate the technology into aircraft cockpits to display fire predictions and suggest a course of action for suppression in real time.\nWorking With U.S. and Colorado Fire Management Agencies\u00a0\nThe USDA Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory, in Montana, which conducts cutting-edge work in wildland fire research, has been providing applications, data, software and products to aid in fire analysis and simulation. The lab has developed the FARSITE wildfire growth and behavior prediction tool using the Rothermel surface fire spread model. The lab has provided the Lockheed Martin team with critical expertise on fire behavior and historical data.\nThe Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control (DFPC) is a partner and early adopter of CMM AI technologies being developed by Lockheed Martin and NVIDIA. DFPC provides expertise, user experience and feedback, and platform integration with real time data collection. The Lockheed Martin team is embedded with the Multi-Mission Aircraft program team to participate in operations and collect data on Colorado fires directly from the Multi-Mission Aircraft mapping them. Colorado Fire is also providing historical fire data for modeling visualizations in NVIDIA Omniverse. Through this continued partnership Lockheed Martin engineers will be able to process data and make predictions through the CMM from an active wildfire observed by the aircraft in real time to assist the onboard fire responders.\nLockheed Martin and NVIDIA will continue to collaborate, both physically and within the digital twin environment, to develop and mature CMM. One day, uncrewed aerial vehicles will rapidly respond to and suppress emerging wildfires.\nAt NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11, the CMM team will talk about how NVIDIA Omniverse is being used to showcase fire movement predictions based on traditional methods versus the CMM system\u2019s algorithm.

The past seven years are on track to be the seven warmest on record. The emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are responsible for approximately 1.1\u00b0C of average warming since the period 1850-1900.\nWhat we\u2019re experiencing is very different from the global average. We experience extreme weather \u2014 historic droughts, unprecedented heatwaves, intense hurricanes, violent storms and catastrophic floods. Climate disasters are the new norm.\nWe need to confront climate change now. Yet, we won\u2019t feel the impact of our efforts for decades. It\u2019s hard to mobilize action for something so far in the future. But we must know our future today \u2014 see it and feel it \u2014 so we can act with urgency.\nTo make our future a reality today, simulation is the answer.\nTo develop the best strategies for mitigation and adaptation, we need climate models that can predict the climate in different regions of the globe over decades.\nUnlike predicting the weather, which primarily models atmospheric physics, climate models are multidecade simulations that model the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, waters, ice, land and human activities.\nClimate simulations are configured today at 10- to 100-kilometer resolutions.\nBut greater resolution is needed to model changes in the global water cycle \u2014 water movement from the ocean, sea ice, land surface and groundwater through the atmosphere and clouds. Changes in this system lead to intensifying storms and droughts.\nMeter-scale resolution is needed to simulate clouds that reflect sunlight back to space. Scientists estimate that these resolutions will demand millions to billions of times more computing power than what\u2019s currently available. It would take decades to achieve that through the ordinary course of computing advances, which accelerate 10x every five years.\nFor the first time, we have the technology to do ultra-high-resolution climate modeling, to jump to lightspeed and predict changes in regional extreme weather decades out.\nWe can achieve million-x speedups by combining three technologies: GPU-accelerated computing; deep learning and breakthroughs in physics-informed neural networks; and AI supercomputers, along with vast quantities of observed and model data to learn from.\nAnd with super-resolution techniques, we may have within our grasp the billion-x leap needed to do ultra-high-resolution climate modeling. Countries, cities and towns can get early warnings to adapt and make infrastructures more resilient. And with more accurate predictions, people and nations will act with more urgency.\nSo, we will dedicate ourselves and our significant resources to direct NVIDIA\u2019s scale and expertise in computational sciences, to join with the world\u2019s climate science community.\nNVIDIA this week revealed plans to build the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting climate change. Named Earth-2, or E-2, the system would create a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse.\nThe system would be the climate change counterpart to Cambridge-1, the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer for healthcare research. We unveiled Cambridge-1 earlier this year in the U.K. and it\u2019s being used by a number of leading healthcare companies.\nAll the technologies we\u2019ve invented up to this moment are needed to make Earth-2 possible.

But it\u2019s also useful for large datasets, which can be biased by an organization\u2019s data collection methods, or by patient or customer demographics.\nNVIDIA FLARE \u2014 short for Federated Learning Application Runtime Environment \u2014 is the engine underlying NVIDIA Clara Train\u2019s federated learning software, which has been used for AI applications in medical imaging, genetic analysis, oncology and COVID-19 research. The SDK allows researchers and data scientists to adapt their existing machine learning and deep learning workflows to a distributed paradigm.\nMaking NVIDIA FLARE open source will better empower cutting-edge AI in almost any industry by giving researchers and platform developers more tools to customize their federated learning solutions.\nWith the SDK, researchers can choose among different federated learning architectures, tailoring their approach for domain-specific applications. And platform developers can use NVIDIA FLARE to provide customers with the distributed infrastructure required to build a multi-party collaboration application.\nFlexible Federated Learning Workflows for Multiple Industries\u00a0\nFederated learning participants work together to train or evaluate AI models without having to pool or exchange each group\u2019s proprietary datasets. NVIDIA FLARE provides different distributed architectures that accomplish this, including peer-to-peer, cyclic and server-client approaches, among others.\nUsing the server-client technique, where learned model parameters from each participant are sent to a common server and aggregated into a global model, NVIDIA has led federated learning projects that help segment pancreatic tumors, classify breast density in mammograms to inform breast cancer risk, and predict oxygen needs for COVID patients.\nThe server-client architecture was also used for two federated learning collaborations using NVIDIA FLARE: NVIDIA worked with Roche Digital Pathology researchers to run a successful internal simulation using whole slide images for classification, and with Netherlands-based \u00a0Erasmus Medical Center for an AI application that identifies genetic variants associated with schizophrenia cases.\nBut not every federated learning application is suited to the server-client approach. By supporting additional architectures, NVIDIA FLARE will make federated learning accessible to a wider range of applications. Potential use cases include helping energy companies analyze seismic and wellbore data, manufacturers optimize factory operations and financial firms improve fraud detection models.\nNVIDIA FLARE Integrates With Healthcare AI Platforms\nNVIDIA FLARE can integrate with existing AI initiatives, including the open-source MONAI framework for medical imaging.\n\u201cOpen-sourcing NVIDIA FLARE to accelerate federated learning research is especially important in the healthcare sector, where access to multi-institutional datasets is crucial, yet concerns around patient privacy can limit the ability to share data,\u201d said Dr. Jayashree Kalapathy, associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and leader of the MONAI community\u2019s federated learning working group. \u201cWe are excited to contribute to NVIDIA FLARE and continue the integration with MONAI to push the frontiers of medical imaging research.\u201d\nNVIDIA FLARE will also be used to power federated learning solutions at:\u00a0\n\nAmerican College of Radiology (ACR): The medical society has worked with NVIDIA on federated learning studies that apply AI to radiology images for breast cancer and COVID-19 applications. It plans to distribute NVIDIA FLARE in the ACR AI-LAB, a software platform that is available to the society\u2019s tens of thousands of members.\nFlywheel: The company\u2019s Flywheel Exchange platform enables users to access and share data and algorithms for biomedical research, manage federated projects for analysis and training, and choose their preferred federated learning solution \u2014 including NVIDIA FLARE.\nTaiwan Web Service Corporation: The company offers a GPU-powered MLOps platform that enables customers to run federated learning based on NVIDIA FLARE. Five medical imaging projects are currently being conducted on the company\u2019s private cluster, each with several participating hospitals.\nRhino Health: The partner and member of the NVIDIA Inception program has integrated NVIDIA FLARE into its federated learning solution, which is helping researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital develop an AI model that more accurately diagnoses brain aneurysms, and experts at the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Early Detection Research Network develop and validate medical imaging AI models that identify early signs of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\u201cTo collaborate effectively and efficiently, healthcare researchers need a common platform for AI development without the risk of breaching patient privacy,\u201d said Dr. Ittai Dayan, founder of Rhino Health. \u201cRhino Health\u2019s \u2018Federated Learning as a Platform\u2019 solution, built with NVIDIA FLARE, will be a useful tool to help accelerate the impact of healthcare AI.\u201d\n\nGet started with federated learning by downloading NVIDIA FLARE.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dave Altavilla is a Tech Analyst covering chips, compute and AI.Follow AuthorNov 09, 2021, 04:30am ESTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator DRIVE SimNVIDIA\nSure, you probably heard that Facebook is changing its name to Meta, in a hard pivot toward a new trend in tech that\u2019s coming in hot. However, the metaverse \u201cin the real\u201d is being built by many powerful players that are enabling fascinating new technologies that will advance not only the human experience, but also cross-team collaboration and simulation for various industries that could benefit greatly from cutting-edge development tools and rich environments. The emerging enterprise metaverse will allow us a better visualization of the future, and what could be mankind\u2019s next greatest achievement.\n\n\nOne of the heaviest hitters in AI, autonomous machines, and what the company calls the \u201cOmniverse,\u201d is NVIDIA. The Silicon Valley GPU powerhouse has transformed over the years into a full stack hardware, software and platforms company maniacally focused on AI, simulation and the metaverse. In fact, some say the metaverse will be realized as perhaps the next \u201cZoom meeting\u201d platform, or a rebirth of the Internet itself; a place where a digital presence is more than just telepresence and where we can interact with our own powerful native tools, removing the boundaries of time zones, office spaces and other limitations of the physical world. If that sounds fascinating, then yes, when lofty goals become a reality, it really is the stuff of science fiction. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of stuff that NVIDIA just rolled out in its Fall GTC keynote this morning.\n\nNVIDIA Omniverse Gets Personal With AI Avatars And Digital TwinsNVIDIA Omniverse Avatar - CEO Jensen HuangNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse platform is essentially a simulation environment for connecting native software tools and team-based collaboration in physically-accurate virtual worlds. Think of mainstream software suites like Blender, Cinema 4D, Wacom and the 3D printing app SketchUp, but connected in an environment for designers such that teams can visualize their creation in real-time and across physical boundaries. That\u2019s the big iron incarnation anyway, but NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse also offers applicability across a myriad of mainstream consumer use cases like restaurants, banking, hospitality and more, and for these markets a relatable avatar can really come in handy. In that regard, NVIDIA just announced that the \u201cdawn of intelligent virtual assistants has arrived.\u201d \u201cOmniverse Avatar combines NVIDIA\u2019s foundational graphics, simulation and AI technologies to make some of the most complex real-time applications ever created,\u201d noted NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang in the company\u2019s Fall GTC keynote. Huang then demonstrated a number of examples of Omniverse Avatar, from customer support applications to video conferencing and a restaurant kiosk, where customers were able to interact with an avatar that understood an order request of a burger, fries and drinks. The demo was powered by NVIDIA AI software and its Megatron 530B natural language model, which the company claims is the world\u2019s largest of its kind. In addition, Omniverse Avatar incorporates NVIDIA\u2019s Riva speech recognition SDK that can process speech across multiple languages like English, German, French and Spanish, as well as its Merlin recommendation engine, Metropolis computer vision analytics and Audio2Face, a 2D and 3D AI rendered facial animation engine. All told, the demo was an impressive, dare I say cute and a fascinating, forward-looking vision of what a real metaverse construct will some day bring, to not only the company\u2019s enterprise early adopter customers but to mainstream consumers as well, who will also be able to experience it some day in the not-so distant future.\nEricsson's 5G Network Digital Twin Simulation In NVIDIA OmniverseNVIDIA\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nIn yet another application example of Omniverse, Huang highlighted how the platform can also produce \u201cdigital twins\u201d of factories, warehouses, robots, and even things like 5G edge telecom networks. Ericsson in fact announced its digital twin 5G radio and antenna network simulation, in-which the location of buildings, trees and other structures affects network performance and can be simulated for optimal results before actually deployment in the real world.\n\n\nDrive Replicator Sim, Concierge And Chauffer Aim To Make Self Driving Cars Even More ConvenientNVIDIA DRIVE Concierge Parking AnimationNVIDIA\n\n\nAnother natural application for NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse is its DRIVE Sim for autonomous vehicle training. Self-driving models need to be trained with millions of miles of real-world roads and traffic conditions, which of course is time-consuming and expensive. In fact, road training tends to stymie autonomous vehicle AI network model development. Augmenting real world data collection with synthetic data helps autonomous vehicle system engineers accelerate development and produce more accurate results. However, the synthetic data that self-driving car systems train on needs to be accurate to what\u2019s experienced in the real world, otherwise things can get a Grand Theft Auto kind of ugly, obviously.\nA good example of this would be NVIDIA\u2019s PathNet DNN for its DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform that detects lane spacing between cars, which can be tricky when a vehicle is not centered in its lane. Training for this model can also be dangerous and actually against self-driving car data collection policies in some jurisdictions, because driving uncentered in a lane is not good for other human drivers on the road. However, as NVIDIA notes, Omniverse DRIVE Replicator allows its AI models to \u201csee what humans can\u2019t,\u201d by training the PathNet neural network on millions of synthetic scenarios of off-centered driving paths, just like us flawed humans can occasionally try to traverse when we\u2019re not paying attention.\nFinally, NVIDIA\u2019s vision for autonomous vehicle experiences now also includes AI assistants and for interaction and to aid in autonomous driving optimization itself. Today, the company has announced DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffer, built on its Omniverse Avatar platform, in an effort to evolve the experience inside self-driving vehicles. You can think of Concierge as an Omniverse Avatar-powered digital assistant (pictured above) that helps with hands-off guidance for anything from phone calls and dinner reservations, to infotainment services, and alerts for safety and security. NVIDIA notes you\u2019ll be able to have a natural conversation with the Concierge avatar and it will be personalized to the driver and all occupants as well, recognizing anyone in the vehicle. The Concierge also provides valet parking services and a guardian feature using in-vehicle cameras to make sure driver attention is at the ready when required. Couple the Concierge with NVIDIA\u2019s Chauffer \u2014 an AI-powered driving platform based on the company\u2019s DRIVE SDK for full level 4 autonomy of both highway and city driving \u2014 and NVIDIA\u2019s autonomous vehicle technologies are shaping up to be some of the most powerful tools for the self-drive cars and robotaxi services of the future. In fact, the company also announced that its DRIVE Orin platform has chalked up numerous new design wins beyond just names like Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, but also bus and truck manufacturers and even high-end sports cars like Lotus.\nJetson AGX Orin Advances AI Robotics And Autonomous MachinesNVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin Processor Module And Dev KitNVIDIA\nBeyond metaverse simulation environments and autonomous vehicles, however, lives the intelligent edge and AI-powered robotics. NVIDIA also announced its next-gen Jetson AGX Orin platform that the company claims is \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for robotics, autonomous machines, medical devices and other forms of embedded computing at the edge.\u201d  Jetson AGX Orin is an evolution of its Jetson platform powered by the company\u2019s Ampere GPU architecture, along with a 12-core Arm Cortex-A78 CPU complex and 32GB of LPDDR5 memory for up to 200 TOPS (Tera OPS or trillion operations per second) of INT8 precision AI compute power. NVIDIA claims Jetson AGX Orin offers six times the processing power of its previous gen Jetson AGX Xavier platform for robotics and equates it to having a GPU-powered AI server in the palm of your hand.\nApplications for the Jetson AGX Orin platform range from manufacturing, to warehousing, healthcare, agriculture, autonomous vehicles, smart cities and more - basically any number of device types and industries that need machine vision and robotic assistance with connected intelligence on board.\nNVIDIA expects to ship DRIVE AGX Orin in the first quarter of 2022 and it will eventually power the new DRIVE Concierge and Chauffer features in future autonomous vehicles as well. NVIDIA didn\u2019t offer a time frame for when Concierge-enabled vehicles will hit the market, though Chauffer technology is expected to arrive in 2024. Further, the company\u2019s various new Omniverse products and services are already available to developers in an early access program, along with an Omniverse Enterprise subscription service that has moved to general availability today, starting at $9K per year.\nMy high-level take-away from this dizzying array of announcements from NVIDIA is that this company is advancing machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicle technologies at a rate currently unmatched in the markets it serves. And in fact it\u2019s creating new market opportunities, as it pioneers innovative use cases that previously weren\u2019t possible before these enabling advancements were brought to fruition, not only by its powerful hardware solutions, but its full stack software and services portfolio as well.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

So we saw AMD come along with FidelityFX Super Resolution that worked across both vendors and now NVIDIA has something of an answer with their own open source Image Scaler.\nThe announcement came as part of their release of DLSS 2.3 today, which has numerous rendering improvements to give an even clearer picture.\nYouTube videos require cookies, you must accept their cookies to view. View cookie preferences.Accept Cookies & Show  \u00a0 Direct Link\nOn Windows, the NVIDIA control panel has an option for a driver-based spatial upscaler which sadly Linux lacks and this has been upgraded. Thankfully, we won't entirely miss out on it as the newer Image Scaling is now open source, so any developer can add it into their game with the NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK v1.0 now available on GitHub under the MIT license. Hopefully it can then end up fully cross-platform then too.\n\nNVIDIA say it offers \"best-in-class\" image quality when compared with other tech. They also showed off a comparison with this explanation:\n\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison from Necromunda: Hired Gun, comparing three scaling techniques against the game\u2019s native rendering at 4K. On the left, with the game\u2019s built-in temporal anti-aliasing, the monitor\u2019s text is somewhat legible. Using NVIDIA Image Scaling and other spatial upscalers, the resolution is decreased to 2955x1622 and the text becomes illegible, though performance does increase to far more playable levels.\nIn contrast, NVIDIA DLSS renders at 1920x1080, but through the magic of AI and GeForce RTX Tensor Cores, image quality is better than native 4K, the monitor\u2019s text is clearer, and performance is more than doubled, giving players the definitive experience in Necromunda: Hired Gun.\n\n\n\nArticle taken from GamingOnLinux.com.\n\n\n\tTags: Misc, NVIDIA, Open Source\n\n\n13 Likes\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author - Liam Dawe\n\n\n\n\nI am the owner of GamingOnLinux.

This month 10 new games get DLSS, and a number of others, including Cyberpunk 2077, get upgraded to the new NVIDIA DLSS 2.3 SDK for even better image quality. With an AI model that continuously improves through training on NVIDIA\u2019s supercomputer, NVIDIA DLSS offers the best image quality and performance for over 130 games and applications.\nAlongside our DLSS updates, we\u2019ve today released our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, which includes an update to the NVIDIA Image Scaling feature, improving our spatial upscaling and sharpening algorithm that supports all GeForce GPUs and games. \nThe same sharpening and scaling algorithm in the Game Ready Driver is now also available as an open-source SDK, so developers have a full-stack solution, offering NVIDIA DLSS for the best image quality, and NVIDIA Image Scaling for cross-platform support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS Is Always Learning, Check Out The Latest Improvements\nTo deliver a level of performance and image quality far above that of traditional upscaling technologies, NVIDIA DLSS utilizes an AI model trained on supercomputers, deep game integrations, and GeForce RTX Tensor Cores (for a full breakdown, head here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur DLSS AI model is always learning, and our newest update, NVIDIA DLSS 2.3, is available now. It makes smarter use of a game\u2019s motion vectors to improve object detail in motion, particle reconstruction, ghosting, and temporal stability.\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, which updates to NVIDIA DLSS 2.3 today, it more smartly uses motion vectors to reduce ghosting on fine detail in motion. Take a look at an example below, on the car\u2019s side mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOOM Eternal, id Software\u2019s much-loved first-person shooter, recently updated to NVIDIA DLSS 2.3, bringing improvements to particle rendering, which reduces streaking that obfuscated the appearance of embers and other small particle effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the video\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.3 is available now in 16 titles, including:\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\nBright Memory: Infinite\nCrysis 2 Remastered\nCrysis 3 Remastered\nCyberpunk 2077\nDeathloop\nDOOM Eternal\nGrand Theft Auto III - Definitive Edition\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Definitive Edition\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City - Definitive Edition\nJurassic World Evolution 2\nMarvel's Guardians of the Galaxy\nRise of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nSword & Fairy 7\n\nAnd DLSS 2.3 comes to Farming Simulator 22 on November 22nd when the game launches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Upscaling For All Games With Updated NVIDIA Image Scaling\nFor the past two years, NVIDIA has offered a driver-based spatial upscaler called NVIDIA Image Scaling and Sharpening, for all your games, that didn\u2019t require game or SDK integrations to work.\nWith the new November GeForce Game Ready Driver, we have improved the scaling and sharpening algorithm to now use a 6-tap filter with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters to boost performance. And we have also added an in-game sharpness slider, accessible via GeForce Experience, so you can do real-time customizations to sharpness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating NVIDIA Image Scaling Through The NVIDIA Control Panel\n1. To activate the newly updated feature, simply open the NVIDIA Control Panel, click onto \u201cManage 3D Settings\u201d, and activate the \u201cImage Scaling\u201d setting as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. When you enable Image Scaling, the driver generates 5 additional scaling resolutions based on your native monitor resolution that you can select from in-game settings menus to use with NVIDIA Image Scaling. We recommend doing a quick reboot to ensure your games recognize these new resolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling %\nInput Resolution for 4K Output\nInput Resolution for 1440p Output\nInput Resolution for 1080p Output\n\n\n85%\n3264 x 1836\n2176 x 1224\n1632 x 918\n\n\n77%\n2954 x 1662\n1970 x 1108\n1477 x 831\n\n\n67%\n2560 x 1440\n1706 x 960\n1280 x 720\n\n\n59%\n2259 x 1271\n1506 x 847\n1129 x 635\n\n\n50%\n1920 x 1080\n1280 x 720\nNot Supported by Windows\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. You can set global sharpness settings for all your games at once, or manage per-game tuning through the Program Settings tab of \u201cManage 3D Settings.\nNow that you have enabled NVIDIA Image Scaling in the driver, the next step is to set the render resolution for your game.\n4. For each game, go into the in-game settings and select Fullscreen mode* \n5. Set the desired render resolution. NVIDIA Image Scaling will automatically upscale the lower render resolution to your display's native resolution and sharpen (e.g. 2880x1620 upscaled to 3840x2160)\n6. If you enable the overlay indicator, a \u201cNIS\u201d text label will appear in the upper left corner of the screen. A green text color indicates that NVIDIA Image Scaling is scaling and sharpening the game. If the text is colored blue, then NVIDIA Image Scaling is sharpening but not scaling\n*For games that don\u2019t offer Full Screen mode, you can lower the render resolution of your desktop, which will enable NVIDIA Image Scaling. To do so, head to \u201cChange resolution\u201d in the NVIDIA Control Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating NVIDIA Image Scaling Through GeForce Experience\nGeForce Experience automates the manual process of changing resolutions for each game, and also offers an in-game sharpness slider for real-time customization. \n1. To get early access to these features, you will first need to \u201cEnable experimental features\u201d by opening GeForce Experience\u2019s Settings via the top right cog icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. In the \u201cAbout\u201d box, click \u201cEnable experimental features\u201d. After a few moments, a new version of GeForce Experience will be downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Once the new version is downloaded, restart GeForce Experience and reenter the Settings screen. You should now see a new \u201cImage Scaling\u201d option further down the page. Enable it and the \u201cIn-Game Overlay\u201d. The Image Scaling options selected here will be the defaults for your games, though you can quickly and easily change them on a per game basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. With NVIDIA Image Scaling activated, click the pop up that appears on the bottom left when you enable Image Scaling:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will instantly optimize your settings using Image Scaling in the 1000+ games supported by GeForce Experience that are installed on your system. Note that if you have a RTX GPU, GeForce Experience will enable NVIDIA DLSS in supported games instead of NVIDIA Image Scaling to provide the best image quality and performance.  Alternatively, you can select one of the new NVIDIA Image Scaling resolutions via the game\u2019s specific Optimal Playable Settings, or in-game in the options menu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen playing a game, press Alt+F3 and you can manually adjust the degree of sharpening during gameplay, enabling you to instantly see its impact on image clarity. And in the same screen you can apply other filters to change the look and feel of each game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Capture Video and Screenshots From NVIDIA Image Scaling\nBecause the upscaling in NVIDIA Image Scaling is performed by the GPU, and not within the game, software-based video capture methods will not record the upscaled gameplay at the target (native) resolution, but instead at the lower pre-upscaled resolution.\nScreenshot and video capture of NVIDIA Image Scaling will therefore require special driver-level support; screenshots captured through GeForce Experience using Alt+F1 are supported now, and video capture support is coming soon. In the meantime, gamers can use a dedicated capture card such as Elgato 4K60 PRO MK.2 and Avermedia Live Gamer 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Image Scaling SDK For Cross-Platform Support\nWe\u2019re also releasing NVIDIA Image Scaling as a free, open source Software Development Kit (SDK), so developers can add native support for a spatial upscaler that can run on any modern GPU.\nIn contrast to NVIDIA DLSS, the algorithm is non-AI and non-temporal, using only information from the current low resolution image rendered by the game as an input. While the resulting image quality is best-in-class in comparison to scaling offered by monitors or other in-game scaling techniques, it lacks the temporal data and AI smarts of DLSS, which are required to deliver native resolution detail and robust frame-to-frame stability.\nBy combining both NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Image Scaling, the developer gets the best of both worlds: NVIDIA DLSS for the best image quality, and NVIDIA Image Scaling for cross-platform support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers can download the NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK from our public GitHub repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling Technologies Compared\nHere\u2019s a comparison from Necromunda: Hired Gun, comparing three scaling techniques against the game\u2019s native rendering at 4K. On the left, with the game\u2019s built-in temporal anti-aliasing, the monitor\u2019s text is somewhat legible. Using NVIDIA Image Scaling and other spatial upscalers, the resolution is decreased to 2955x1622 and the text becomes illegible, though performance does increase to far more playable levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the full-resolution images here and open in our new Image Comparison and Analysis Tool to compare\nIn contrast, NVIDIA DLSS renders at 1920x1080, but through the magic of AI and GeForce RTX Tensor Cores, image quality is better than native 4K, the monitor\u2019s text is clearer, and performance is more than doubled, giving players the definitive experience in Necromunda: Hired Gun.\nUsing spatial scaling, players may also observe shimmering and other artifacts on game elements, which we refer to as a \u201ctemporal instability\u201d. NVIDIA DLSS avoids these issues by capturing information from multiple frames every second during gameplay, feeding that into our AI model, and leveraging motion vectors in-game to track moving game elements and avoid ghosting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the video\nLet\u2019s take a look at a 1440p example from Deathloop above. NVIDIA DLSS running at 2560x1440 in Quality Mode is rendering 3.5 million pixels on your display, but by capturing multiple frames of data, has over 6 million pixels of information to work with. Combining that with the NVIDIA DLSS AI neural network, the resulting image is substantially better, on par with the 3.5M pixels of native 1440p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, a spatial upscaler captures 2.2 million pixels of information from a single frame, feeding it into a fixed, non-AI algorithm, before enlarging the result to 2560x1440. While the image quality can\u2019t match DLSS or native resolution, spatial upscalers still provide a nice boost in performance for users who lack a GeForce RTX GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Image Comparison & Analysis Tool (ICAT): Image Quality Analysis Made Easy\nThrough NVIDIA\u2019s development of DLSS, we\u2019ve found the best way to evaluate image quality is by comparing videos - it really shows off the true experience of what gamers experience. But video image quality analysis is time consuming and tedious.\nSo we built an Image Comparison & Analysis Tool that we call ICAT, to make life easier for our testers and engineers. Our teams found the tool so useful that we\u2019ve decided to make it available to everyone, making accurate and fast assessments of image quality between multiple images or videos far, far easier.\nNVIDIA ICAT allows users to easily compare up to 4 screenshots or videos with sliders, side-by-sides, and pixel peeping zoom-ins. Align comparisons spatially and temporally, examine the differences, and draw your conclusions. It\u2019s that simple!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compare different scaling technologies, we encourage you to first use ICAT to find the most comparable image quality modes, and then look at the performance gains. Note that just because two quality modes are named the same, doesn\u2019t mean they are equivalent. While this varies by game and resolution, we\u2019ve found that DLSS Performance mode is best compared to the Ultra Quality mode of spatial upscalers. We call this approach \u201cISO-Quality\u201d, as performance is compared at equivalent image quality levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the NVIDIA Image Comparison and Analysis Tool here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 New Games Add NVIDIA DLSS This Month\nAs of today, there are over 130 games and apps with support for NVIDIA DLSS, and that number continues to grow each and every month. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll major engines are supported, and NVIDIA DLSS is now available in many of the most popular and highest-rated games around.\nThis November, 10 games are adding support, and you\u2019ll find all the details below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssetto Corsa Competizione Adds NVIDIA DLSS\nKunos Simulazioni and 505 Games' Assetto Corsa Competizione is a hyper-realistic racing sim used in the Fanatec GT World Challenge professional racing series that\u2019s backed by the best car brands.

Avatars created in the platform are interactive characters with ray-traced 3D graphics that can see, speak, converse on a wide range of subjects, and understand naturally spoken intent.\nOmniverse Avatar opens the door to the creation of AI assistants that are easily customizable for virtually any industry. These could help with the billions of daily customer service interactions \u2014 restaurant orders, banking transactions, making personal appointments and reservations, and more \u2014 leading to greater business opportunities and improved customer satisfaction.\n\u201cThe dawn of intelligent virtual assistants has arrived,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cOmniverse Avatar combines NVIDIA\u2019s foundational graphics, simulation and AI technologies to make some of the most complex real-time applications ever created. The use cases of collaborative robots and virtual assistants are incredible and far reaching.\u201d\nOmniverse Avatar is part of NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows currently in open beta with over 70,000 users.\nIn his keynote address at NVIDIA GTC, Huang shared various examples of Omniverse Avatar: Project Tokkio for customer support, NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge for always-on, intelligent services in vehicles, and Project Maxine for video conferencing.\nIn the first demonstration of Project Tokkio, Huang showed colleagues engaging in a real-time conversation with an avatar crafted as a toy replica of himself \u2014 conversing on such topics as biology and climate science. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a second Project Tokkio demo, he highlighted a customer-service avatar in a restaurant kiosk, able to see, converse with and understand two customers as they ordered veggie burgers, fries and drinks. The demonstrations were powered by NVIDIA AI software and Megatron 530B, which is currently the world\u2019s largest customizable language model.\nIn a demo of the DRIVE Concierge AI platform, a digital assistant on the center dashboard screen helps a driver select the best driving mode to reach his destination on time, and then follows his request to set a reminder once the car\u2019s range drops below 100 miles.\nSeparately, Huang showed Project Maxine\u2019s ability to add state-of-the-art video and audio features to virtual collaboration and content creation applications. An English-language speaker is shown on a video call in a noisy cafe, but can be heard clearly without background noise. As she speaks, her words are both transcribed and translated in real time into German, French and Spanish with her same voice and intonation. \u00a0\nOmniverse Avatar Key Elements\r\nOmniverse Avatar uses elements from speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines, facial animation, and graphics delivered through the following technologies:\u00a0\n\nIts speech recognition is based on NVIDIA Riva, a software development kit that recognizes speech across multiple languages. Riva is also used to generate human-like speech responses using text-to-speech capabilities.\nIts natural language understanding is based on the Megatron 530B large language model that can recognize, understand and generate human language. Megatron 530B is a pretrained model that can, with little or no training, complete sentences, answer questions of a large domain of subjects, summarize long, complex stories, translate to other languages, and handle many domains that it is not trained specifically to do.\nIts recommendation engine is provided by NVIDIA Merlin\u2122, a framework that allows businesses to build deep learning recommender systems capable of handling large amounts of data to make smarter suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0\nIts perception capabilities are enabled by NVIDIA Metropolis, a computer vision framework for video analytics.\nIts avatar animation is powered by NVIDIA Video2Face and Audio2Face\u2122, 2D and 3D AI-driven facial animation and rendering technologies.\n\nThese technologies are composed into an application and processed in real time using the NVIDIA Unified Compute Framework. Packaged as scalable, customizable microservices, the skills can be securely deployed, managed and orchestrated across multiple locations by NVIDIA Fleet Command\u2122.\nLearn more about Omniverse Avatar.\nRegister for free to learn more about NVIDIA Omniverse during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

Data generated in these virtual worlds can cover a broad range of diverse scenarios, including rare or dangerous conditions that can\u2019t regularly or safely be experienced in the real world.\nAutonomous vehicles and robots built using this data can master skills across an array of virtual environments before applying them in the physical world.\n\u201cOmniverse Replicator allows us to create diverse, massive, accurate datasets to build high-quality, high-performing and safe datasets, which is essential for AI,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation technology and Omniverse engineering at NVIDIA. \u201cWhile we have built two domain-specific data-generation engines ourselves, we can imagine many companies building their own with Omniverse Replicator.\u201d\nOmniverse Replicator augments costly, laborious human-labeled real-world data, which can be error prone and incomplete, with the ability to create large and diverse physically accurate data tailored to the needs of AV and robotics developers. It also enables the generation of ground truth data that is difficult or impossible for humans to label, such as velocity, depth, occluded objects, adverse weather conditions or tracking the movement of objects across sensors.\nAlready an invaluable data-generation engine for NVIDIA\u2019s DRIVE autonomous vehicle and Isaac robotics teams, Omniverse Replicator will be made available next year to developers to build domain-specific data-generation engines.\nOmniverse Replicator is part of NVIDIA Omniverse, a virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows.

The company\u2019s quarterly report was stellar with products like NVIDIA AI and RTX GPUs out the door, for which demand is astronomically high in both areas. If NVIDIA is having issues with semiconductor resources, it also didn\u2019t show up here. The company is booming and it lead to the report that it had achieved record revenue and a solid earnings-per-share (EPS) this last quarter, beating consensus estimates on both.\nThe NVIDIA (NVDA) company released its Q3 2022 earnings report on its investor relations website on November 17, 2021. According to the report, NVIDIA pulled in $7.1 billion USD in Non-GAAP revenue - reportedly a record quarter for the company. This was also a win versus the consensus estimate of $6.83 billion, and a pretty hefty win at that. Its non-GAAP EPS was also a winning stat. The company achieved a non-GAAP EPS of $1.17 per share versus consensus estimate of $1.1. Both numbers made for a pretty stellar Q3 report for NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA)'s stock price took an upturn in trading value after hours amid the successful stats of its recent Q3 2022 reporting\n\nCompany CEO and founder Jensen Huang attributed NVIDIA\u2019s massively strong quarter towards its currently running and high-demand products, including NVIDIA\u2019s latest RTX graphics products and its AI services, as described in the accompanying press release.\n\n\u201cDemand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.\u201d ~ Jensen Huang\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s powerful performance is unique in Q3 in a world affected by issues of supply in terms of the semiconductor famine and shipping ports being congested, as noted by Tesla. With the absolute difficulty of obtaining an NVIDIA RTX GPU right now, it at least looks like demand is in NVIDIA\u2019s favor for the foreseeable future. Stay tuned to Shacknews as we cover further Q3 earnings reporting from throughout the gaming and tech industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer\nSenior News Editor\n\n\n\nTJ Denzer is a player and writer with a passion for games that has dominated a lifetime.

We Compare It to Nearby HDB Flats and Condos     PropertyGuru   Fri, 5 Nov 2021, 1:29 am 12 min read                Pinnacle @ Duxton is perhaps the most talked-about HDB project of all time, but does it really live up to the hype? If we\u2019ve piqued your interest, read on. You may have thought that amid the COVID-19 crisis, property prices would drop\u2026 but no, it\u2019s been the exact opposite, thanks to pent-up demand and other factors.   In fact, did you know that as of 31 October 2021, a record-breaking 192 HDB flats were sold for at least $1 million this year? Among these prime district flats are, of course, the famous units at Pinnacle @ Duxton, which broke the million-dollar mark way back in 2015, shortly after the development reached its Minimum Occupancy Period (MOP). How Much Do Pinnacle @ Duxton HDB Flats Cost? A quick check on Pinnacle @ Duxton units for sale on PropertyGuru yields over 50 results, of which the lowest is priced at close to $900k (4-room, unfurnished), and the most expensive is an eye-popping $1.35 million, a 5A-room unit on a high floor. Looking at the HDB database, a total of 29 4-room flats and 27 5-room flats at Pinnacle@Duxton were sold at $1 million and above from Jan to Oct 2021. That\u2019s a total of 56 units out of 192 transactions, or about a third of all million-dollar HDB flat transactions that happened this year so far.   This phenomenon has not gone unnoticed by the Government, which is clearly worried that these sky-high prices will lead to gentrification, such that only the wealthy can afford to live in centrally-located HDB flats. These concerns have led to HDB's new Prime Location Housing (PLH) Model, which imposes tighter restrictions to dampen the investment returns of upcoming HDB flats in central locations, such as the upcoming Rochor BTO flats. Notably, though, these new rules do not apply to The Pinnacle @ Duxton. You can breathe a sigh of relief now. Related article: HDB Prime Location Housing (PLH) Model: Additional Subsidies, 10-Year MOP and More So, what makes the flats at this particular HDB development so \u201chot\u201d and expensive? Are these units really worth over $1 million Singapore dollars? We look at the various reasons and compare this development to nearby HDB flats and condominiums to find out. Pinnacle @ Duxton HDB Flats: 7 Reasons Why They Fetch Over $1M There must be something special about the units at Pinnacle @ Duxton if people are willing to shell out over a million bucks for an HDB flat. After all, it\u2019s the HDB project with the greatest number of $1M and above resale flats\u2026 Ah, the pride and joy of Tanjong Pagar constituency. Here are some reasons why we think someone with a healthy bank account (or CPF balance) would want to plonk down a million dollars just to snag a unit here:   Story continues   1. Pinnacle @ Duxton Is in the CBD & CCR It\u2019s all about location. Tanjong Pagar is right smack in the busy central business district, alongside all the swanky offices and banks. Not to mention, it\u2019s also part of the core central region of Singapore, which means residential and commercial rents are up, even if staffers in the area don\u2019t have the salary to match. The assumption is, if you can afford to work/live in the area, you\u2019re probably able to afford whatever\u2019s there as well \u2013 from daily $10 lunches to costlier parking, and expensive workwear to higher property prices.   In addition, this is an area where room rents can go as high as $2,800 a month (master bedroom with attached bathroom), and the lease for an entire apartment can hit $40k/month (private penthouse duplex with 4 rooms, private lift and private jacuzzi). With all these factors in mind, you can just imagine the demand for a rare HDB property in this area. 2. The Views from Pinnacle @ Duxton Are Amazing Ever wonder why HDB units get more expensive with every storey? For anyone without a fear of heights, it\u2019s because of how the view gets better the higher you are.       For example, the HDB flats at Boon Tiong Road command unblocked views of the Tiong Bahru area, up to 40 storeys high. And these flats easily fetch over $1M, even if it\u2019s just for a 4-room flat. There\u2019s also City View at Boon Keng, which has seven listings for sale over $1M on PropertyGuru, and the similar-sounding 40-storey City Vue at Henderson \u2014 which only reaches MOP in 2023 \u2014 that boasts a panorama of both Sentosa and the upcoming Greater Southern Waterfront. In any case, Pinnacle @ Duxton wins with its 50-storey height. The development also features two gorgeous sky gardens that are each a whopping 500m long. It\u2019s even open to the public, but there\u2019s an admission charge if you\u2019re not a resident and want to visit.

Pinnacle @ Duxton Is Award-winning (and Record-breaking) These days, HDB flats are clinching major design awards, and the Pinnacle @ Duxton is one of them trendsetters. In 2010, it won the Best Tall Building Asia & Australasia award from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, which is a US-based international authority on tall buildings and urban design. It also snagged the President's Design Award \u2013 Design Of The Year. It also won the 2011 Urban Land Institute's Global Awards for Excellence. Later in 2019, it again was lauded for long-term and extraordinary contributions to the urban environment by the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, where it got the top spot in the 10-year category.   The buildings\u2019 design, a collaborative effort by ARC Studio Architecture + Urbanism and RSP Architects Planners and Engineers, was also a world first. Previously, there weren\u2019t any 50-storey public housing projects comprising two sky bridges that linked seven towers. In addition, the idea was chosen out of a pool of over 200 designs through a 2001 International Architectural Design Competition, organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Earlier we mentioned the 500m sky gardens. Located on the 26th and 50th floor of the building, these are also the longest sky gardens in the world and feature jogging tracks, playgrounds and viewing/rest areas. 4. Pinnacle @ Duxton Is Part of Singapore\u2019s History Firstly, Pinnacle @ Duxton is built on a 2.5ha site where one of the oldest public estates in Singapore originally stood. This was where the first two blocks of public housing in Tanjong Pagar were. There\u2019s also a viewing gallery on the 52nd storey, which caters for VIP state visitors and special events. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong utilised this area on 8 Aug 2010 to deliver his annual National Day message. Pinnacle @ Duxton has also been covered extensively in international media. Related article: Why Is Pinnacle@Duxton Such an Attractive HDB Development?       5. Pinnacle @ Duxton Is One of a Kind It\u2019s obvious that Pinnacle @ Duxton isn\u2019t your run of the mill HDB flat. As HDB\u2019s one-off special residential development, Pinnacle @ Duxton units were more fully furnished than typical HDB flats and featured design elements that could rival that of many private developments. Even the more expensive fully precast methods were used during construction, which could be 10% to 15% pricier than the usual pumping of wet concrete to the top. 6. Pinnacle @ Duxton's 'Starting Prices' Were Also High Launched in May 2004, the starting prices of the units at Pinnacle @ Duxton were pricey, much more than a typical HDB BTO, especially at that time. Smaller flats measuring 93 to 97 sqm (about 4-room) were priced from $289,200 to $380,900, while bigger ones measuring 105 to 108 sqm (about 5-room) were priced between $345,100 and $439,400. The remaining 111 units were relaunched in September 2008, with higher prices of $545,000 to $645,800. For comparison's sake, the most expensive HDB BTO flats today start from about $500,000 (for a 4-room flat in the Kallang/Whampoa district, August 2021 BTO launch). This is still quite comparable to Pinnacle @ Duxton's original prices, even almost two decades later! Naturally, the occupants would want to buy high and sell high(er) to turn a tidy profit, right? 7. The New PLH Model Does Not Apply to Pinnacle @ Duxton We mentioned earlier that HDB's new Prime Location Housing (PLH) Model imposes additional restrictions on buying and selling flats in central, prime locations \u2013 which describes Pinnacle @ Duxton to a T. The Prime Location Housing (PLH) Model restrictions have minimal impact on genuine owner-occupiers, but they will discourage property 'flippers' from treating such HDB flats as pure investments. However, the new PLH rules only apply to upcoming HDB flats only and do not apply retroactively to existing flats such as Pinnacle @ Duxton! What HDB Flats and Condos Are Near Pinnacle @ Duxton? A large part of Pinnacle @ Duxton\u2019s appeal is its prime location in the CBD. But is Pinnacle @ Duxton really the only 'unicorn' in Tanjong Pagar? Or is it just the most famous one? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the various HDB clusters and condos nearby to suss out if it\u2019s really worth getting a much sought-after unit at Pinnacle @ Duxton. Pinnacle @ Duxton vs HDB Flats in the Area   Development  Type  TOP  Price  Price per square foot (psf)   Pinnacle @ Duxton  HDB  2009  $899,888 to $1,350,000  $858 to $1,284   Tanjong Pagar Plaza  HDB  1976/1979  $448,000 to $919,800  $662 to $803   Everton Park  HDB  1980  $486,000 to $1,000,000  $581 to $732   Cantonment Close  HDB  2000/2002  $690,000 to $948,000  $701 to $980    It\u2019s a bit of an 'apples versus oranges' comparison because half of the HDB flats near Pinnacle @ Duxton were built in the 1970s/1980s. The prices and psf values seem to trend according to age, with Pinnacle @ Duxton leading the pack as it\u2019s the most recent HDB project in the area. Nevertheless, the million-dollar effect may have had an effect on some of the older HDB flats, as some of their listings are pushing $1 million too.

If Pinnacle @ Duxton could be considered condominium level, it\u2019s definitely value for money when looking at its price and psf value versus the other private properties in the area. One thing Pinnacle @ Duxton may lose out on as compared to its condo counterparts are the amenities (although there are plenty at Pinnacle), tighter building security, and maybe height (Skysuites @ Anson towers at 71 storeys). But all of this is moot, considering the expansive views you\u2019ll get at the sky garden, the amenities of the area, the never-ending food options, and if you work in the CBD, it\u2019s yet another bonus.

RHB Group Research analyst Shekhar Jaiswal has kept \u201cbuy\u201d on Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering) with a target price of $4.85, as he deems the group as preparing for its \u201cnext leg of growth\u201d. To Jaiswal, the group\u2019s defensive business model has enabled it to deliver \u201ccredible earnings\u201d in the FY2020 even though the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the achievement of its growth targets that were set in 2018.  To this end, ST Engineering has identified new 2026 targets for its reorganised business. The group has indicated that it intends to grow its annual revenue at two to three times the global GDP growth, to over $11 billion by 2026. \u201cAssuming it manages to sustain its current and pre-pandemic net margin of 7.3%, it would imply a profit of $800 million in 2026 and a 2023-2026 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6%,\u201d writes Jaiswal in a Nov 26 report. \u201cIf it delivers the planned revenue and profit growth, ST Engineering could sustain our forecasted profit CAGR of 8% beyond 2023 as well,\u201d he adds. In addition, ST Engineering has estimated that domestic travel will recover to the levels seen in 2019 by 2013. International travel, as well as the global aircraft fleet are also expected to recover to pre-Covid-19 levels by 2024. \u201cTo leverage on the longer-term growth in aircraft fleet, ST Engineering is investing in passenger to freighter (P2F) conversion business. It has delivered five narrowbody P2F since 2020 and 12 medium widebody P2F since 2018,\u201d says Jaiswal. \u201cIt has more than 60 and 80 aircraft of each type on order for deliveries. ST Engineering will double its annual P2F conversion capacity to 30 by 2022 and increase it to 60 by 2026. It expects the P2F business to generate SGD700m of annual revenue by 2026\u201d.  There are also opportunities for the counter in smart city solutions, notes the analyst, as the group sees the relevant smart city market to grow at a CAGR of 8% to reach US$500 billion ($685.37 billion) in 2026. \u201cGrowth will be driven by demand for urbanisation, digitalisation, and sustainability. Its announced acquisition of Transcore for US$2.68 billion, which is expected to be completed by 1QFY2022, will help it achieve the targeted 2026 smart city revenue of $3.5 billion, from current revenue of $1.7 billion,\u201d says Jaiswal. \u201cST Engineering has identified international defence business as growth vector with an addressable market of US$5 billion over [the] next five years. This growth will be driven by adoption of digital technologies in military and legacy platforms being upgraded,\u201d he adds.

Despite being a non-mature estate, BTO launches in Hougang tend to be popular among balloters. The recent Hougang BTO launch in Aug was the most popular launch by far, receiving one of the largest applications in recent years. Similarly, the previous BTO launch in Hougang five years ago was also the most popular BTO launch.  With its locational attributes and low supply of new flats, the Nov 2021 Hougang BTO launch will likely be among the most popular BTO projects. So let\u2019s find out what Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang have to offer.

Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang is bounded by Hougang Street 13, while Hougang Olive will be right across the road, bounded by Hougang Avenue 3, Hougang Street 12, and Hougang Street 13. In fact, the former is just right next to August\u2019s Hougang Citrine BTO flats.  The main difference between both BTO launches in Nov 2021 is the number of flats available. Hougang Olive will offer 206 4-room units and 184 5-room units; Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang will offer 172 4-room units and 128 5-room units.   Story continues There will also be a proposed health and medical care next to the Hougang Ave 3 flats. Apart from that, both flats offer access to the same amenities. Schools in the area include Paya Lebar Methodist Girls\u2019 School (Primary and Secondary), Yuying Secondary School, Xinghua Primary School, and Maris Stella High. They are either within walking distance or are within a 5-minute bus ride. Furthermore, Holy Innocents' Primary School and Holy Innocents' Secondary School are about 15 minutes away by bus. Kovan MRT and Hougang MRT are the closest MRT stations, and both are just a short bus ride away. Kovan MRT in particular, is next to Heartland Mall as well as several eateries and retail stores. Hougang MRT is also about a 15 minutes\u2019 bus ride away where there\u2019s also Hougang Central Bus Interchange, Hougang Mall, The Midtown, and Hougang Town Centre. In addition, the future Defu MRT station on the Cross-Island Line (CRL) won\u2019t be too far away. Residents will have access to areas like Ang Mo Kio, Tampines North, Pasir Ris, Loyang, and Aviation Park in just a few stops. For those who believe in feng shui, do take note that the flats will be close to a Chinese temple. Hougang BTO Price (Nov 2021 HDB BTO Launch): Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang Unit typeHougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang BTO price (November 2021)Kovan Wellspring and Hougang Citrine BTO prices (August 2021) (excluding grants)Resale flat prices in the area (Hougang Avenue 3 and Hougang Avenue 1)  4-roomFrom $308,000 for Hougang Olive; from $318,000 for Tanjong Tree Residences @ HougangFrom $324,000 for Hougang Citrine; from $413,000 for Kovan Wellspring$390,000 to $990,000 5-roomFrom $416,000 for Hougang Olive; from $419,000 for Tanjong Tree Residences @ HougangFrom $392,000 (Hougang Citrine only)$520,000 to $988,000 Prices for the November 2021 Hougang BTOs are comparable to Hougang Citrine's in the August 2021 release. This is likely because Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang are both in the same neighbourhood, near the Paya Lebar Airbase.A 4-room at Hougang Olive is priced from $308,000 while a 5-room starts at $416,000. Whereas for Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang, a 4-room starts at $318,000 and a 5-room at $419,000.Although considered a non-mature estate, resale flats in Hougang typically have good resale values thanks to their good surrounding amenities and wide range of rare HDB flat types such as executive apartments and maisonettes. Notably, it remains the only non-mature estate that has seen a million-dollar flat transaction. Over the past year (and excluding DBSS flats, executive apartments, and maisonette flats), the most expensive 5-room flat sold in Hougang was for S$810,000, while the most expensive 4-room flat was S$628,000.Considering that both 5-room and 4-room BTO flats for Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang are priced at less than half of that, it would seem that future residents can expect significant returns if they choose to sell after the 5-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP). Hougang BTO Amenities (Nov 2021 HDB BTO Launch): Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ HougangGood Range of MRT Stations NearbyThe closest MRT station is Kovan MRT. Although both Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang aren\u2019t within close walking distance to the MRT station (about 20 minutes\u2019 walk), the station is within 17 minutes by bus. Apart from that, Bartley MRT, Hougang MRT (a future interchange station on the CRL), and the future Defu MRT station are nearby stations that are accessible by public transport.Good Schooling OptionsParents with schooling children will be glad to know that there are four schools in the area, including popular schools, Maris Stella High and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls\u2019. The last of which can be reached within 12 minutes by foot.15 Minutes Away from Heartland Mall and Hougang MallHougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang will be 15 minutes away by bus from Heartland Mall, where there is the Kovan MRT and Kovan Market and Food Centre. Similarly, the flats will also be 15 minutes by bus to Hougang Mall, which is within walking distance to Hougang MRT, The Midtown, Hougang Town Centre, and Hougang Bus Interchange.Conclusion: Are Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang Nov 2021 Hougang BTO Flats Worth Balloting for?The November 2021 Hougang BTO flats are likely to be among the most popular flats, if not the most popular, in no small part due to their location and amenities nearby. Additionally, Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang will also likely be among the most affordable among other BTO launches in November 2021, based on the prices of the recent August 2021 Hougang BTO flats.Pros of the Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang November 2021 Hougang BTOGood schools in the area 15 minutes away to malls and MRT stations 4-room and 5-room options suitable for bigger families Value for money considering the location and amenities available Cons of the Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang November 2021 Hougang BTO Not within close walking distance to MRT stations Not within close walking distance to schools in the area either Only 4-room and 5-room flats available With good access to amenities like public transportation, malls, food, and schools, Hougang Olive and Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang will appeal to those who want convenient access to amenities. They\u2019re also the only projects besides Tengah BTO that will offer 5-room units, but arguably have better amenities, accessibility, and connectivity.There are only a few schools in the area (Paya Lebar Methodist Girls\u2019 School (Primary), Paya Lebar Methodist Girls\u2019 Secondary School, Yuying Secondary School, Xinghua Primary School, Maris Stella High School), but two (Paya Lebar Methodist Girls\u2019 School (Primary), Paya Lebar Methodist Girls\u2019 Secondary School, and Maris Stella High School) are popular. The close proximity of these schools will give your children priority admission. Holy Innocents' Primary School and Holy Innocents' Secondary School are close to Hougang MRT station, but it will take about a 15-minute bus journey.If living close to schools is a priority, the Jurong West BTO flats are probably better for you since there are more schools in the area. However, keep in mind that it\u2019s a small project, with only 220 units up for grabs. Not sure if you should ballot for the November 2021 Hougang BTO flats?

Potential homeowners looking to live in a car-lite town surrounded by lush greenery rejoice! You have more options. Both Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah are located in the same land plot. 2-room Flexi, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room BTO flats will be available. Parc Clover @ Tengah will offer 1,124 units and Parc Glen @ Tengah will offer 1,008 units. Parc Clover @ Tengah will have some blocks housing rental flats. Singapore\u2019s first \u201cForest Town\u201d will be serviced by MRT stations on the upcoming Jurong Region Line (JRL). Additionally, these Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah Tengah BTO flats are set to be among the most affordable of the Nov 2021 launches.

Though the Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah November 2021 Tengah BTO flats are perceived as somewhat inaccessible, this is expected to change when the JRL is completed. The apartments are a short walk from the upcoming Tengah Plantation station and a bus interchange.   Story continues Those who want to live more sustainably will appreciate how Tengah town employs smart technology and has green spaces making up 20% of the estate. Being away from the city centre means you\u2019ll likely enjoy a slower pace of life and the quiet afforded by the surrounding nature parks.The flipside to this tranquillity is that residents of the Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah Nov 2021 Tengah BTO flats are still not within walking distance of major malls. But you will be within walking distance of two proposed health and medical care facilities.Tengah BTO Price (Nov 2021 HDB BTO Launch): Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah Unit typeTengah BTO Price (Nov 2021): Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ TengahPrevious Tengah BTO Price (May 2021), excluding grantsPrevious Tengah BTO Price (Feb 2021), excluding grants 2-Room FlexiFrom $119,000From $113,000From $110,000 3-RoomFrom $194,000-From $209,000 4-RoomFrom $312,000From $299,000From $298,000 5-RoomFrom $428,000From $404,000- If you\u2019re looking for an affordable option, the November 2021 Tengah BTO flats are your best bet. For example, if you're a young couple looking to start a family, you will likely go for a 4-room flat. A 4-room at Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah start at $312,000 and $319,000 respectively.This is a reasonable sum, considering the Kallang/Whampoa prices, which starts at $511,000 for a 4-room flat. The low prices can be attributed to how Singapore's first new town in more than 20 years is far away from the city centre and lacks many amenities that make other more mature estates popular.However, there is much potential for price appreciation in the long term. After the major developments such as the JRL (set to be fully operational in 2028), Jurong Lake District (set for completion in 2040 and beyond), and Jurong Innovation District are completed, Tengah will be an incredibly attractive place for those who favour living in the west. There are no resale HDB flats in Tengah to benchmark prices against as none of the flats in the neighbourhood have MOP-ed.Tengah BTO Amenities (Nov 2021 HDB BTO Launch): Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ TengahIf you prefer living in a quieter neighbourhood, removed from the hustle and bustle, applying for Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah could be a good move. You\u2019ll live in a \u201cForest Town\u201d and be surrounded by nature.And when the plans to transform Jurong into a second CBD is realised, you\u2019ll be in an ideal location for work and play. Live in Green SpacesIf you love hiking or want to reap the benefits of living near nature, making your home in the Tengah neighbourhood might be suitable for you. Aside from a large central park, residents of the estate can take strolls through the community gardens, play areas, and farms. Additionally, the entire town will be bordered by trees, creating a forest fringe.Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah residents with green fingers are also encouraged to grow plants and other edibles in the communal neighbourhood spaces.Biking enthusiasts will appreciate how the roads in Tengah are lined with dedicated walking and cycling paths. This gesture is part of Singapore\u2019s efforts to reduce the number of cars on the road and encourage better connectivity. Access to Surrounding Health and Sports Amenities within Tengah and Nearby EstatesIn the future, a polyclinic and health and medical care centre will be constructed within a 10-minute walk away from the Nov 2021 Tengah BTO flats. More will also be built a short car ride away.To fulfil their sporting and recreational needs, potential residents will have to travel to nearby estates. The nearest sports and recreation facilities include Bukit Batok Swimming Complex, Jurong East Sports Centre, and Civil Service Club @ Bukit Batok. However, there are plans in motion for a sports and recreation centre to be put up nearby the BTO flats.Minutes\u2019 Walk to Tengah Plantation MRT (JRL)While residents of Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah may be inconvenienced in the first few years of moving in, this will change when the full JRL is ready in 2028. Once the JRL is functional, they\u2019ll enjoy improved connectivity to the city centre and other major landmarks and developments.The best part is Tengah Plantation MRT is likely to be under a 10-minute walk from the property. Furthermore, a bus interchange is currently being proposed to be built within the vicinity.After the estate reaches its MOP and JRL is functional, the estate will likely be a popular place to rent among Nanyang Technological University (NTU) students. Adults who work at the Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Innovation District might also eye the flats.Proximity to Shopping Centres in Surrounding EstatesThere aren\u2019t any shopping malls in the Tengah neighbourhood, only a neighbourhood centre a couple of minutes away from the BTO flats selling basic necessities. Another neighbourhood centre with designs for a polyclinic has also been proposed for construction.To fulfil your dining and shopping needs, head to West Mall in Bukit Batok, Boon Lay Shopping Centre in Boon Lay, and Keat Hong Shopping Centre in Choa Chu Kang. If you don\u2019t mind travelling slightly further, you can head to Westgate, JCube, IMM or JEM at Jurong East.Good Selection of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Schools NearbyHealth and sports facilities and schools within Tengah have not been completely developed yet. But if you\u2019re a young couple planning to have kids, don\u2019t worry. You can send them to one of the nearby primary schools:St Anthony\u2019s Primary Princess Elizabeth Primary Concord Primary School Choa Chu Kang Primary School Shuqun Primary Corporation Primary Dazhong Primary Jurong Primary Huiling Primary Once more residents move in, the Government will likely build more schools.Conclusion: Are the Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah Tengah BTO Flats Worth Balloting For? Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah are best suited for those who wish to live in a quiet neighbourhood, appreciate green designs, and have a modest housing budget.Pros of the Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ Tengah November 2021 Tengah BTOClose to a future MRT station and bus interchange Close to several proposed neighbourhood centres and healthcare facilities  Short drive to major developments such as Jurong Lake District and Jurong Innovation District Has lush nature spaces, sustainable features, and other green amenities Cons of the Parc Clover @ Tengah and Parc Glen @ TengahNovember 2021 Tengah BTOFaraway from CBD Public transport is currently relatively inaccessible (JRL line only fully operational in 2028) Have to travel out of Tengah estate for most amenities  Set to be one of the more affordable BTO launches in November 2021, the Tengah flats are great for young couples with tight purse strings or families who want more space for less. If your workplace is in the west or your career is in the advanced manufacturing and research industries, the Tengah neighbourhood might be ideal for you too.Another upside is residents are surrounded by beautiful green amenities. However, the green comes at the cost of being far from the concrete jungle of the CBD. MRT access will only be readily available in 2028 when the JRL is completed.If you are looking to buy a car, the far-flung location will be less of a dealbreaker. You\u2019ll be able to more conveniently shop at malls, send your kids to school, and use the sports and recreational facilities in the surrounding neighbourhoods.Not sure if you should ballot for the November 2021 Tengah BTO flats?

In an interview earlier this year, Zhao said he didn\u2019t own a house or car, considering such things \u201cilliquid.\u201d While he will be spending more time in the Middle Eastern business hub, Zhao, 44, said he remains committed to Singapore, where a local affiliate has applied for an official license to operate. His choice of residence may provide a clue on the location of Binance\u2019s headquarters. Founded in China in 2017, Binance Holdings Ltd. hasn\u2019t set up a global base yet. Instead, Zhao has incorporated firms in locations where Binance operates, including in Singapore, where he\u2019s been based for two years. HQ Decision In a separate interview at the Bloomberg forum, he told Erik Schatzker that Binance has decided on a location for its global headquarters and will announce it after he communicates with regulators. \u201cI am not saying this is where we will definitely base our headquarters,\u201d Zhao added. \u201cBut for example, if you look at the U.A.E., if you look at France and Singapore, these regions are all very pro-crypto.\u201d READ: Binance US unit may raise \u2018couple hundred\u2019 million in funding Dubai is vying with Singapore, Switzerland and other countries to become a global hub by setting up a so-called free zone to support the trading of crypto assets.

Worries about the new Omicron coronavirus variant also kept a bid in these safe-haven currencies. The dollar, on the other hand, retreated on Tuesday after rising when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of inflation had increased and suggested retiring the term \"transitory\" to describe the surge in prices. He also pushed for accelerating the tapering of Fed asset purchases. His comments suggested an urgency to undertake quick monetary policy action that financial markets may not be prepared for, analysts said. \"Overall, the risks to the short-term outlook keep on growing. Investors have always viewed the Fed as the safety net, but the Fed looks like its panicking here,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at OANDA in New York. \"The Fed was wrong on inflation. And now it appears they're going to rush tapering and quickly deliver rate hikes. And if the inflationary pressure remains, you could see an accelerated rate hike cycle that could threaten financial conditions.\"  In late trading, the dollar fell 0.4% against the yen to 113.065 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar dropped 0.4% to 0.9185 francs. The dollar index fell 0.3% to 95.90. It rallied earlier, while U.S. stocks fell, after Powell's hawkish remarks. \"Traders are in 'sell first and ask questions later' mode,\" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. Earlier, the yen and Swiss franc rose against the dollar, after Moderna's CEO said the coronavirus vaccines will likely be less effective against the Omicron variant as they have been against other variants. Adding to the fears, drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Tuesday its COVID-19 antibody treatment could be less effective against Omicron. The warnings reinforced a view that the global economy could take longer to return to pre-pandemic levels than many had been expecting. Against the U.S. dollar, the euro rose 0.4% to$1.1335, posting its biggest three-day rising streak since December 2020. Prior to Omicron's arrival, the main driver of currency moves was how traders perceived the different speeds at which global central banks would end pandemic-era stimulus and raise interest rates as they looked to combat rising inflation without choking off growth.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

(PHOTO: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach)  \u00b7 Beck Diefenbach / reuters SINGAPORE \u2014 Mark Twain once famously remarked, \"I have never let my schooling interfere with my education\", and in the 21st century, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Larry Page and other wealthy self-made billionaires reinforced that sentiment by dropping out of college and founding billion-dollar companies.  Life is a process of learning, and organised education is imperative to an individual's overall growth and progress. Educational qualifications give individuals credibility in the real world and open up doors of employment and means to earn money. But it's probably not for everyone. The world's richest self-made billionaires are in fact college dropouts. This doesn't endorse the idea that everyone must follow the same path, because these individuals dropped out of Ivy League colleges. While their success cannot directly be attributed to their dropping out of school or college, it cannot also be attributed to their enrolment in these institutions. Nonetheless, it's interesting to check out the 'ultimate drop-out list' based on their current estimated net worth.   10 richest invididuals who did not complete this education. (Source: edubirdie.com)  1. Bill Gates - Estimated Net Worth: US$149 billion  Gates didn't drop out of Harvard on a whim. The world's most successful dropout took a calculated decision to drop out, not once but twice, from the same university to focus on his flourishing software company Microsoft. The dropping-out was certainly worth it with Microsoft growing to become one of the world's most valuable companies - currently worth more than US$300 billion. 2. Mark Zuckerberg - Estimated Net Worth: US$129 billion Zuckerberg quit Harvard in 2005 to focus on growing Facebook, which was at the time not yet known as Facebook (As of 29 October, 2021 Facebook has been rebranded as Meta). He started the social media platform while studying at the esteemed college. 3. Larry Page - Estimated Net Worth: US$117 billion While Google co-founder Larry Page actually graduated university, he failed to complete his studies for a PhD, which earns him a spot on the 'dropouts' list. Alphabet Inc is estimated to be worth more than US$220 billion, so he's definitely not regretting skipping out on that PhD. 4. Larry Ellison - Estimated Net Worth: US$101 billion Oracle founder Ellison dropped out of the University of Illinois. He withdrew without attending the final exams of his sophomore year due to the death of his adoptive mother. Ellison later attended University of Chicago but didn't graduate from there either. However, this is where he first encountered computer design through which he went on to make billions.   Story continues 5. Amancio Ortega - Estimated Net Worth: US$74.7 billionSpanish retail magnate Amancio Ortega dropped out of school at age 14. Destiny had bigger plans for him. Thirteen years after he dropped out of school he opened his first Zara store. The fashion company grew exponentially making Ortega Spain's richest man.6. Michael Dell - Estimated Net Worth: US$49 billion  Michael Dell initially enrolled in medical school. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)  \u00b7 Shannon Stapleton / reutersMichael Dell was 19 when he dropped out of the University of Texas and founded the technology company Dell in the 1980s. An inherent businessman, Dell only enrolled in pre-med at the university at the behest of his parents. But once he realised he had the knack of making money, there was no point wasting any more time trying to be a doctor.7. Li Ka-shing - Estimated Net Worth: US$34 billion  Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing was forced to leave school early at fifteen following his father\u2019s death. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Bobby Yip)  \u00b7 Bobby Yip / ReutersWhile living as refugees from the Sino-Japanese war, Hong Kong business magnate and founder of Cheung Kong Group, Li Ka-shing, was forced to leave school at 15 after his father\u2019s untimely death.He found a job in a plastics-trading company and later went on to start his own company, Cheung Kong Industries in 1950. He then branched out into real estate investment and his company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. A true beacon of hope for the less fortunate.8. Dustin Moskovitz - Estimated Net Worth: US$20.9 billionA second co-founder of Facebook, Dustin Moskovitz, also dropped out of Harvard along with roommate Zuckerberg. While Moskowitz quit Facebook and founded Asana in 2008, he still owns a 2.34 per cent stake in the company. He was declared the youngest billionaire in history by Forbes in In 2011.9. Jack Dorsey - Estimated Net Worth: US$13.7 billion  Jack Dorsey dropped out of the Missouri University of Science and Technology to pursue building Twitter. (PHOTO: MARCO BELLO/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 MARCO BELLO via Getty ImagesTwitter founder Dorsey dropped out of the Missouri University of Science and Technology to give his burgeoning social media platform his full attention. More than 330 million active users turned him into a multi-billionaire.10. Jan Koum - Estimated Net Worth: US$13.2 billionThe founder and CEO of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, dropped out of San Jose University at the age of 21 in 1997 when he started working for Yahoo. He then went on to create WhatsApp which would later be acquired by Facebook for US$19 billion in 2014. He personally earned US$6.8 billion from this sale.Top 10 universities with the most valuable dropoutsFurther interesting findings of this report reveal that three universities \u2014 Harvard, University of Michigan, and University of Illinois - account for the most valuable dropouts.At a glance, here are the top 10 universities with the world's most valuable dropouts in the world.

(PHOTO: VCGG)  \u00b7 VCG via Getty Images By Zheping Huang (Bloomberg) \u2014 ByteDance Ltd. ordered its employees to end their day by 7 p.m., becoming one of the first tech companies in China to officially mandate shorter working hours. Staff in China should only work from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays and will need to seek permission to stay beyond those hours at least one day in advance, according to an internal document on Monday that was seen by Bloomberg News. A representative for the TikTok and Douyin owner declined to comment.  The country\u2019s gruelling work pace \u2014 known as \u201c996\u201d because employees often labor from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week \u2014 was long celebrated by tech billionaires from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Jack Ma to JD.com Inc. founder Richard Liu. But it\u2019s come under renewed scrutiny this year, fuelled by deaths associated with overwork and a growing chorus of social media complaints. With President Xi Jinping calling on the country to work toward \u201ccommon prosperity,\u201d authorities have stepped up warnings against employers to refrain from unreasonable overtime and other violations. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: China\u2019s \u201c996\u201d work ethic \u2014 implying working hours of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week \u2014 suggests 72-hour weeks have been typical at some companies. Courts are skeptical, and \u201c996\u201d may be at odds with labor laws in addition to being out of sync with President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d push. High turnover at Baidu and Bilibili may signal discontent with workaholic employers \u2014 Matthew Kanterman and Tiffany Tam, analysts. Under the new policy, employees can apply to work overtime no more than 3 hours on a weekday or 8 hours on a weekend, according to the document. They will receive extra compensation of up to three times their normal wage for the overtime. The new policy is the latest effort by ByteDance to improve worker welfare. Earlier this year, the social media giant, along with rival Kuaishou Technology, canceled an alternating system where employees just take one day off per week every two weeks. A short-lived campaign last month saw some private sector workers, including those from ByteDance, come together to share their working hours in protest against the country\u2019s excessive working culture. \u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Are these stocks a buy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR) recently announced a deal with tech giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). It's been agreed that Luminar will supply laser sensors for Nvidia's self-driving car platform. It's good news for the smaller company, and the LAZR share price shot up 32%, settling at a 15% rise by the end of the day.#Is Luminar Technologies stock a buy?Luminar is a manufacturer of Lidar sensors, with its laser-focused sights set on autonomous driving.The deal marks an inspiring achievement for Luminar, which went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) a year ago. At the time, SPAC listings were all the rage and, coupled with Luminar's ambitious plans, made it an attractive proposition.This led Luminar's share price to soar over 300% within a month of going public.However, the excitement was soon replaced with extreme volatility, and the stock price was brought back to earth with a bump. In recent months it's been consolidating around the mid-teens. But the Nvidia news has brought it back above $20 a share.Whether LAZR is a good stock to buy remains highly speculative. The Nvidia news undoubtedly gives it clout but its profitability that matters long term. And the reality is self-driving cars are still many years away.#Read: Growth Opportunities in Advanced Semiconductor Tech\n\n\n\nSign up for Investing Intel Newsletter\nGet the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nEmail address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to the privacy policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#How is Nvidia involved in self-driving cars?The Luminar deal is one of several exciting announcements made at Nvidia's virtual GPU Technology Conference (GTC).Nvidia has been championing autonomous driving for some time now and is rolling out three technologies to support its ambitions. These are Nvidia Drive Hyperion 8, Drive Chauffeur, and Drive Concierge.Luminar's lidar vehicle navigation solution has been selected for the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion Autonomous Vehicle Reference Platform.In addition to these consumer offerings, Nvidia has announced its new Omniverse Replicator for Drive Sim. This is a type of simulator where AI models of cars can practice driving in various weather conditions, parking, crashing etc. This all takes place in a virtual world, which is essentially a digital twin of the real world. It all sounds very futuristic, but it should help fast-track the process to ensure autonomous vehicles become a safer alternative to manual driving.This virtual Omniverse platform is already being tested by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). The American aerospace and defense corporation is using Nvidia's Omniverseto simulate and manage wildfires. And other companies are using it to create \"digital twins\" of buildings and factories.Nvidia's ambitions are even grander, as its CEO Jensen Huang outlined at GTC: \u201cWe will build a digital twin to simulate and predict climate change. This new supercomputer will be E2, Earth 2, the digital twin of Earth, running Modulus-created AI physics at a million times speeds in the Omniverse. All the technologies we\u2019ve invented up to this moment are needed to make E2 possible. I can\u2019t imagine greater and more important news.\u201d#Will Nvidia stock continue to rise?The Nvidia share price has soared nearly 500% over the past two years, and the company now has a $766 billion market cap. This was in part driven by an increase in demand for semiconductors, while supply simultaneously fell.Semiconductors are the beating heart of so many current and future technologies. They are found in so many electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. And have become a crucial part of the operating system of tech, from smartphones to TVs, bank ATMs, military systems, transportation and now EVs.Their prominence in keeping the world moving has been highlighted since the pandemic hit supply chains. Thus maintaining control of semiconductor supplies has become a matter for national security. That's why interest in Nvidia stock soared as investors speculate US-based manufacture in chips will ramp up in the coming years.But the big question is, will Nvidia stock continue to rise? It's hard to give a definitive answer because there are several reasons to be equally bullish and bearish. #Bullish reasons to invest in Nvidia stockNvidia showcased a myriad of pipeline projects at the GTC, including metaverse-like plans to drastically expand its virtual offerings.The metaverse is where virtual and physical worlds collide to become one. Revenue from the global metaverse market is projected to reach $828 billion in 2028, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.3% between now and then.With Nvidia taking its part in this very seriously, it gives metaverse believers firm conviction in the likelihood of Nvidia's star continuing to rise. Along with rising demand for semiconductors, a solid reputation for top-quality graphics cards and high-end tech, the company remains a favorite of many investors. It also doesn't have much institutional weight going against it as short interest is only around 1%.#Bearish reasons to avoid Nvidia stockNevertheless, the metaverse is a highly speculative arena, and Nvidia is already sporting an extremely high share price with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 109. Its price-to-book value is 36x, and its dividend yield is a tiny 0.05%. Competition is fierce. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)) is a strong competitor of Nvidia but has a more attractive share price. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) has plans to expand into America.Then there\u2019s the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to impact the semiconductor business posing a threat to Nvidia\u2019s profitability.Nvidia addresses four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards.The bulls believe Nvidia could easily become the next trillion-dollar company.  Whether that's achievable in the short term remains to be seen.#What you should read next:Investing in the Digital Revolution in EntertainmentWhat is a Stock?India and Tesla Close in on Deal for EV Exports and Local FactoryQYOU Launches New Revenue Stream With In-App PurchasesNVDA Stock: Nvidia Surpasses Estimates, Faces Investor Hurdles\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\u2022\n\n                        Alibaba (NYSE: BABA): Advancements in AI Technology and Market Implications\n                    \n\n\n\u2022\n\n                        Snowflake (SNOW): Leveraging AI Innovations for Growth\n                    \n\n\n\u2022\n\n                        Asbury Automotive (ABG): Strategic Acquisition of Herb Chambers\n                    \n\n\n\u2022\n\n                        Stellantis (STLA) CEO Resigns Amid Crisis\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nExplore more on these topics:\n\n\n\n        information-technology\n    \n\n\n\n        Automobiles\n    \n\n\n\n\n        Luminar Technologies Inc\n    \n\n\n\n\n        Information Technology\n    \n\n\n\n\nImportant Notice And Disclaimer\n\n\nThis article does not provide any financial advice and is not a recommendation to deal in any securities or product.

Upgrade Now          Nvidia promises fully self-driving cars with new Nvidia Drive tech      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor  November 9, 2021 4 min read        91   In This Article:  NVDA       TSLA         Nvidia (NVDA) is well-known for its autonomous vehicle efforts, and at the company\u2019s GTC 2021 conference, it\u2019s rolling out three technologies to support its future self-driving capabilities: Nvidia Drive Hyperion 8, Drive Chauffeur, and Drive Concierge. Taken together, the technologies help Nvidia push deeper into the autonomous car space. What\u2019s more, the technologies provide drivers and passengers with their own personal AI assistant while their car drives them down the street. Drive Hyperion 8 combines a series of sensors including 12 cameras, nine radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and one front-facing lidar. The whole setup is meant to be modular so automakers can take and leave what they want.   Nidia's is using its Omniverse and AI technologies to build out self-driving car capabilities. (Image: Nvidia)  \u00b7 Nvidia Nivida says the system uses two Nvidia Drive Orin systems on a chip to offer redundancy and fail-over safety, as well as the potential for level four self-driving tech. Self driving capabilities are rated on a scale with level 0 being you controlling every aspect of the drive and level 5 meaning the car completely drives itself.  Nvidia\u2019s Drive Chauffeur, for its part, is the company\u2019s AI-assisted driving platform. It uses the sensors from Hyperion 8 and allows vehicles to drive from address to address on their own in both highways and urban environments. In addition to driving itself, Chauffeur can act as a high-end emergency intervention system for those who\u2019d still rather drive on their own.   Then there\u2019s Drive Concierge, Nvidia\u2019s in-car AI assistant. Think of it as a high-powered Siri in your car. It\u2019s designed to recognize each passenger and respond to them individually. So you\u2019ll use your voice to control parts of your car that currently require you to twist knobs or tap touchscreens. Concierge also acts as a virtual valet with the ability to find parking spaces and park without you inside. So you can jump out at the entrance to a fancy restaurant, like Wendy\u2019s, and your car will take care of itself. When you\u2019re finished with your spicy nugs, you can call your car back and it\u2019ll come pick you up.  That\u2019s not too far out of the realm of possibility now, either. I\u2019ve demoed self-parking cars at the Consumer Electronics Show in past years, and they worked incredibly well. But real-world environments where everyone is racing to get the spot closest to the entrance are a completely different story. Concierge will also work with Chauffeur to provide drivers with a view of what the AI driver is doing on the road, so you can sit back and watch as it works its magic.   Nvidia's Drive Concierge is being designed to not only serve as an in-car intelligent assistant, but park your vehicle and allow you to summon it as well. (Image: Nvidia)  \u00b7 Howley Outside of Hyperion 8, Chauffeur, and Concierge, Nvidia has announced its new Omniverse Replicator for Drive Sim. That\u2019s a lot of high-tech sounding words to say that Nvidia has created a virtual world using its Omniverse technology to help train AI models on potential driving situations that would otherwise require a lot of physical manpower or put humans in dangerous situations. The idea is to help AI models that could eventually be used in self-driving cars better understand how to drive through various scenarios.   Story Continues To ensure that the synthetic data it gets out of Drive Sim Replicator is accurate, Nvidia uses its RTX path-tracing renderer to add real-world effects to its virtual vehicle sensors including LED flicker, motion blur, rolling shutter, and lidar beam divergence. This ensures that what the AI is seeing in the virtual Omniverse world, is as close to what it would see in the real world as possible.While Nvidia\u2019s progress in self-driving is certainly impressive, true self-driving cars are still years away from hitting the road. There are massive hurdles to overcome including how AI can safely navigate inclimate weather, random construction zones, things like deer, and even reading the road in snow and rainstorms.  Nvidia's Hyperion8 platform features a host of sensors including lidar, radar, cameras, and sonar. (Image: Nvidia)  \u00b7 NvidiaEven automakers that offer semi-autonomous features have been criticized for overselling their capabilities. Tesla (TSLA) in particular has been caught in the crossfire over its marketing of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving modes, both of which require drivers to pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the wheel while on the road.On Monday The Washington Post reported that a November over-the-air update for Tesla\u2019s self-driving software made cars malfunction, causing them to slam their brakes while driving at highway speeds, forcing a recall.The software has also been involved in investigations related to crashes while drivers were using self-driving mode.Still, the advances that Nvidia and companies like it are making are proof that while self-driving isn\u2019t a reality yet, it will be in the not-too-distant future.Sign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter More from DanGoogle hits $2 trillion market cap, joining ranks of Microsoft and Apple Apple SharePlay: How to watch movies and TV shows with up to 33 people at once Facebook's metaverse will still track your every move Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and redditGot a tip?

I was accused of saying \u201cValuation doesn\u2019t matter\u201d when making the case that some stocks are (and have always been) deservedly expensive over the last five to ten years. Of course, this is indisputable and obvious.\nAnd to say it doesn\u2019t mean you are saying that \u201cvaluation doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d You\u2019re just pointing out a readily observable fact. The best performing stocks in the current era have never given you an opportunity to own them at parity with the market\u2019s multiple or below. And why would they have? Shouldn\u2019t the highest quality, fastest growing, best positioned companies have stocks that sell at a premium to the stocks of lesser firms? Should 2016 Amazon have sold for the same multiple as The Sports Authority? Was The Sports Authority a \u201cless expensive\u201d stock because it\u2019s valuation was lower? Go ask someone who owned The Sports Authority versus Amazon. Prior to the bankruptcy, I mean.\nIf this sounds obvious, it is. But on television, in the heat of the moment, we often aren\u2019t arguing facts. We\u2019re arguing feelings. And then there\u2019s always some degree of personal animosity that can creep in from the edges. I understand why I might personally attract my share of it. I have a big, loud mouth and I talk a lot and use a lot of ten dollar words and some people might resent me for any one of those things or all of them. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on\u2026 \nDon\u2019t worry, there are whole days and weeks where I don\u2019t much care for myself either.\nAnyway, here\u2019s what I should have said during that segment, which would have really triggered some people out there: There is absolutely no reason why a person should expect that the valuation paid for a security will either help them or harm them in timeframes from 1 to 5 years. This is also true (and has always been true). There is no evidence that starting valuation is either a proven helper or hindrance to an investor in and of itself. Why? Because there are too many other factors that traders and investors give more weight to in the real, non-academic stock market that exists in the physical world and away from the spreadsheet. You don\u2019t have to like it, but you have no choice other than to accept it or find a different game to play.\nThe charts I am going to show you are from the recent history of the stock market. It\u2019s not a hundred-year sample size. The charts are also not meant to suggest that valuation shouldn\u2019t play a part in portfolio construction for long-term investors. Rather, they are here to remind you that over 1, 3 or 5 year periods, anything can happen. Additionally, it might be possible that investors more highly prize other attributes about the stocks they choose to buy more highly than a trailing earnings multiple. These attributes could include anything under the sun, from revenue growth to dividend payout. From patents and intellectual property to brand value or other intangibles. From the likability of a CEO to the quality and prevalence of memes about a company\u2019s products. From short seller interest to message board chatter. From innovation to asset sales. From index inclusion to sell-side analyst support. From hedge fund ownership to, well, you get the idea. Just because you have a metric that you find to be all-encompassing or crucial to an equity\u2019s future outlook, that doesn\u2019t mean everybody else has to actually give a f*** and march to your drum.\nBehold, the S&P 500\u2019s components during the modern era\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe ranked all the index\u2019s stocks on a trailing 12 months PE ratio at the starting point for each period. Then we split it in half. The black lines below represent the more expensive 250 stocks in the SPX while the blue lines represent the least expensive 250 stocks. As you can see, ranking stocks by starting valuations on backward-looking measures like PE ratio did not do anything to increase performance in any of these three periods \u2013 in order: 1 year, 3 year, 5 year:\n\n\n\nIn fact, the further you go back, the more an orientation toward \u201cinexpensive\u201d stocks has actually hurt your performance relative to either a growth-tilted portfolio or a regular market-cap weighted one. Which, paradoxically and only with the benefit of hindsight, makes the allegedly inexpensive stocks look to have been quite expensive after all.\nI asked Nick Maggiulli to take this way of thinking about recent markets to more of an extreme. Let\u2019s see what happens if we compare the cheapest 20% of stocks on that same trailing twelve months PE ratio at the starting point versus the most expensive 20%\u2026\nThe bottom quintile in terms of PE ratio did actually add a slight outperformance benefit this year, likely owing to the resurgence of oil and bank stocks that began over the summer. Unfortunately, as you go back and look at the 3 year or the 5 year chart, this year\u2019s slight benefit dissolves like a teaspoon of sugar. By the time you go back to the view from 2016, you\u2019re looking at a greater than 50% performance deficit for the bottom quintile by PE versus the most expensive stocks in the index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe takeaway here is not to ignore valuation or pretend that any price you pay for a security is as good as any other. I don\u2019t believe that and I don\u2019t ever say things that sound anything like that.\nBut I don\u2019t have a problem saying the following:\nGuessing in advance which characteristics of stocks people will select for is every bit as hard as reading people\u2019s minds about anything else. The crowd will do what the crowd wants to do, and buy what the crowd wants to buy, and for whatever mercurial reason the crowd coalesces around. And, despite what all your text books and screens and \u201cdiscipline\u201d tell you, it will be unpredictable. It will change from one season to the next, without warning or logic or reason. And just when you think you\u2019ve got the key to the market, they change the locks. Get used to it.\nI would also point out that there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, which should ease your mind a bit and take some of the pressure off.\nAnd if 2022\u2019s market happens to favor your particular discipline as opposed to the highly favored growth trade of today, then congratulations. The wheel of fortune turned and your team got their time on the top of the ride while others were submerged beneath the water line. Stick around long enough and these regime shifts will almost feel comforting, even the ones that unceremoniously plunge your strategy into the icy depths. Because you\u2019ll remember how quickly that wheel can turn once again.\nIn the modern era, not only does value not matter \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s actually been one of the worst possible things you could have selected for (lower market cap size is probably running neck and neck for this honor). Temper tantrums won\u2019t change that. It\u2019s just the environment we\u2019ve been given. Let\u2019s see what happens from here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n\nThis content, which contains security-related opinions and/or information, is provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon in any manner as professional advice, or an endorsement of any practices, products or services.

Megatron 530B is the world\u2019s largest customizable language model.\nThe NeMo Megatron framework enables enterprises to overcome the challenges of training sophisticated natural language processing models. It is optimized to scale out across the large-scale accelerated computing infrastructure of NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122.\nNeMo Megatron automates the complexity of LLM training with data processing libraries that ingest, curate, organize and clean data. Using advanced technologies for data, tensor and pipeline parallelization, it enables the training of large language models to be distributed efficiently across thousands of GPUs. Enterprises can use the NeMo Megatron framework to train LLMs for their specific domains and languages.\nNVIDIA Triton Inference Server Powers Real-Time LLM Inference\r\nNew multi-GPU, multinode features in the latest NVIDIA Triton Inference Server \u2014 announced separately today \u2014 enable LLM inference workloads to scale across multiple GPUs and nodes with real-time performance. The models require more memory than is available in a single GPU or even a large server with multiple GPUs, and inference must run quickly to be useful in applications.\nWith Triton Inference Server, Megatron 530B can run on two NVIDIA DGX systems to shorten the processing time from over a minute on a CPU server to half a second, making it possible to deploy LLMs for real-time applications.\nMassive Custom Language Models Developed Worldwide\r\nAmong early adopters building large language models with NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD are SiDi, JD Explore Academy and VinBrain.\nSiDi, one of Brazil\u2019s largest AI research and development institutes, has adapted the Samsung virtual assistant for use by the nation\u2019s 200 million Brazilian Portuguese speakers.\n\u201cThe SiDi team has extensive experience developing AI virtual assistants and chatbots, which require both powerful AI performance and specialized software that is trained and adapted to the changing nuances of human language,\u201d said John Yi, CEO of SiDi. \u201cNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD is ideal for powering the advanced work of our team to help us bring world-leading AI services to Portuguese speakers in Brazil.\u201d\nJD Explore Academy, the research and development division of JD.com, a leading supply chain-based technology and service provider, is utilizing NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD to develop NLP for the application of smart customer service, smart retail, smart logistics, IoT, healthcare and more.\nVinBrain, a Vietnam-based healthcare AI company, has used a DGX SuperPOD to develop and deploy a clinical language model for radiologists and telehealth in 100 hospitals, where it is used by over 600 healthcare practitioners.\nAvailability \r\nEnterprises can experience developing and deploying large language models at no charge in curated labs with NVIDIA LaunchPad, announced separately today.\nOrganizations can apply to join the early access program for the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron accelerated framework for training large language models.\nNVIDIA Triton is available from the NVIDIA NGC\u2122 catalog, a hub for GPU-optimized AI software that includes frameworks, toolkits, pretrained models and Jupyter Notebooks, and as open source code from the Triton GitHub repository.\nTriton is also included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA. Enterprises can use the software suite to run language model inference on mainstream accelerated servers in on-prem data centers and private clouds.\nNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and NVIDIA DGX systems are available from NVIDIA\u2019s global resellers, which can provide pricing to qualified customers upon request.\nRegister for free to learn more during NVIDIA GTC, taking place online through Nov. 11.

GPUs are now important for machine learning, design and visualization, and data analytics. One of the challenges for many organizations is accessibility to GPU-enabled systems because the initial cost can be quite high and many organizations do not have the technical skill to deploy the hardware and software necessary to take full advantage of the technology.Also, due to the pandemic, there has been a trend to remote work that has now evolved to many businesses having employees permanently work from home. This is fairly simple for knowledge workers, call center agents, salespeople, and others who work with software. But for data scientists, graphic designers, engineers, and others who need access to GPU-enabled systems, working remotely means no access to the systems they will need to do their jobs.\u00a0Featured \n          The next big TV panel leap was just unveiled by Sony - and it makes OLED look outdated\n        \n          That weird CAPTCHA could be a malware trap - here's how to protect yourself\n        \n          The best smart rings you can buy: Expert tested\n        \n          I've tried nearly every browser out there and these are my top 6 (none are Chrome)\n        To help organizations obtain remote access to GPU-enabled systems, at a lower cost, with less complexity, NVIDIA has partnered with the major cloud providers to offer cloud-based virtual workstations. This has become particularly important since the start of the pandemic because IT professionals, data scientists, and others who need access to GPU systems are now working from home and can't easily connect to the systems located on company premises. NVIDIA has assisted customers in making this transition by offering free virtual GPU (vGPU) software trial licenses to get started. Virtual workstations have been works in progressHistorically, virtual workstations have not performed as well as the physical ones, but that was because GPUs were not part of the mix. Customers deploying VDI in on-premises data centers can access GPU-accelerated performance with NVIDIA's vGPU technology. NVIDIA vGPU includes both an NVIDIA GPU and an NVIDIA vGPU software license. The NVIDIA A40 GPU has 48 GB of frame buffer and supports NVIDIA RTX technology \u2013 one of NVIDIA's most important advances in computer graphics \u2013 making it possible for creative and technical professionals to simulate the physical world at unprecedented speeds.\u00a0With the A40 combined with NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software, remote workers can experience performance indistinguishable from a physical workstation one might find on an engineer's desk. For knowledge workers accessing office productivity applications, NVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC) software paired with NVIDIA A16 GPUs is designed to maximize user density per GPU as well as deliver the highest quality user experience. By pairing NVIDIA's vGPU software, such as NVIDIA vWS or vPC with NVIDIA GPUs, we create vGPUs that can be shared across multiple users.\u00a0To get an idea of how effective vGPUs are, I recently conducted several scenarios to test the vGPU and compared them to CPU-only systems. The system I tested was the NVIDIA A16 Ampere card with NVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC) software; then the A40 paired with NVIDIA RTX vWS software. Finally, I compared identical workloads on CPU-only systems.\u00a0Following are the results:\u00a0Use case No. 1: OpenGL with NVIDIA vPCOpen Graphics Library, more commonly known as OpenGL, is a processor-intensive API to render 2D and 3D vector graphics. To test how this worked GPU accelerated, I went to an OpenGL website and noticed it loaded very fast and smoothly. The site had a number of animations built into it, and when I clicked to start one, they started almost immediately and continued to run smoothly. As I added more animations, there was more movement across the screen with no degradation in quality. When I ran the animations with CPUs only, the more animations I added the poorer the quality to the point where the graphics were barely moving. Instead of being smooth like the vGPU, the animation was painfully slow.\u00a0Use case No. 2: YouTube in a virtual desktop accelerated by NVIDIA vPCI then proceeded to run a YouTube video on a virtual desktop to see if the playing of the video would impact the processing capability, and it did not. Another notable point is that the sound and video remained in sync with the video with no blurring. When a CPU-only processor is taxed, the voice and video would quickly get out of sync and then start to buffer.\u00a0 The performance difference wasn't as dramatic as the OpenGL use case, but it was noticeably worse on the non-GPU system.\u00a0Use case No. 3: Large Microsoft Excel manipulation on NVIDIA vPCThe next test was to open a large Excel file, insert a 3D chart, and then rotate it to view the data in a graphical format. I could rotate the chart back and forth and visualize the data from a number of different views. With a CPU-only system, the 3D chart wasn't nearly as nimble to move around. After a few minutes, the time it took to have the graphic catch up made chart manipulation unusable.\u00a0Use case No. 4: SolidWorks Visualize accelerated by NVIDIA RTX vWSTo give the new A40 a good test drive, I loaded a SolidWorks file. I loaded the image of a motorcycle. I then performed a number of tasks, such as rotating the image and zooming in and out. SolidWorks uses ray tracing with quick set rendering to redraw the image. I then proceeded to change paint colors, textures, and other attributes of the bike and saw no degradation in performance. Finally, I changed the background scenes from being predominantly black to mountains, an old warehouse, and other graphically intensive images. Again, performance remained constant. What was most impressive is the image was very lifelike and one could see a reflection of the bike on the wet floor and other things to make it photo-realistic. One of the benefits of using SolidWorks is the tool provides some data on time to re-render the image. For the vGPU, this time was barely a second or two.I ran the same simulations with a CPU-only system and the time to render jumped to 30 seconds or more. It was very difficult to pan, zoom or rotate the image because it took so long to redraw the bike. The same was true for any color change, texture, or background.\u00a0NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstations in the cloud are a great way for businesses to get started with accelerated computing because the cost of entry is nominal compared to having to purchase individual physical workstations. Once utilization hits a certain volume, it may make sense to purchase NVIDIA virtual GPU software licenses and run them on-premises in GPU-accelerated servers.\u00a0With the world moving to remote work, vGPUs may become the norm.

It\u2019s a combination that Nvidia says will enable far superior network throughput plus advanced multi-tenancy to accommodate multiple users at once.\nNvidia\u2019s InfiniBand is a computer networking communications standard used in high-performance computing for data flow between processors and input/output devices, known for its high throughput and very low latency.\nThe latest generation of InfiniBand, Quantum-2, introduces new features that will accelerate the most demanding workloads in both supercomputing centers and public cloud platforms that offer high-performance computing services.\n\u201cThe requirements of today\u2019s supercomputing centers and public clouds are converging,\u201d said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia. \u201cThey must provide the greatest performance possible for next-generation HPC, AI and data analytics challenges, while also securely isolating workloads and responding to varying demands of user traffic. This vision of the modern data center is now real with Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand.\u201d\nTo deliver that needed performance, Quantum-2 InfiniBand doubles network speed while tripling the number of network ports available with the previous generation standard, Nvidia said. It means Quantum-2 accelerates performance by up to three times while reducing the need for data center fabric switches by six times. It also ensures a welcome cut in data center power consumption and reduces data center space by 7%, the company said.\nThis is all thanks to the latest Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand Switch (pictured below) that contains 57 billion transistors on seven-nanometer silicon, offering up to 64 ports at 400Gbps or 128 ports at 200Gbps. The company said the switch will be offered in a variety of switch systems, with up to 2,048 ports in the largest configuration. That\u2019s more than five times the switching capability over the previous generation, Quantum-1.\n\nMeanwhile, Quantum-2 also provides multitenant performance isolation benefits that ensure the activity of one tenant, or user, does not affect the performance of others. That\u2019s achieved through an advanced telemetry-based congestion control system that ensures sufficient throughput is available, regardless of spikes in demand or users, Nvidia said.\nAnother key ingredient in Quantum-2 is a unique technology called SHARPv3 In-Network Computing, which enables a whopping 32-times more acceleration engines for artificial intelligence applications compared with the previous iteration of InfiniBand. There\u2019s also an entirely new nanosecond precision timing system that helps boost performance by synchronizing distributed applications such as database processing to reduce the overheads of wait and idle times.\nNanosecond timing, the company explained, is a new capability that allows cloud data centers to become part of the telecommunications network and host software-defined 5G radio services.\nQuantum-2 InfiniBand is designed to work with two networking endpoints at launch, the new Nvidia ConnectX-7 networking interface card (below), and the upcoming BlueField-3 DPU. ConnectX-7 will sample in January 2022 and is said to consist of 8 billion transistors in a seven-nanometer design, doubling the amount of data that can be handled compared with the previous-generation ConnectX-6. The BlueField-3 DPU, which will sample in May, has 22 billion transistors in a seven-nanommeter design and provides 16 64-bit Arm central processing units for offloading and isolating data center infrastructure tasks.\n\nNvidia said the Quantum-2 InfiniBand Switch is available now from infrastructure and systems partners, including Atos Computing Inc., DataDirect Networks Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Excelero Inc., Gigabyte Technology Co.

It focuses on germline analysis for whole genome and whole exome applications using GPU accelerated bwa-mem and GATK\u2019s HaplotypeCaller.\nIntroduction\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) platforms have outperformed Moore\u2019s Law when it comes to cost per genome, and short-read sequencing platforms can now readily sequence 96 to 384 whole human genomes in 1-2 days, generating terabytes of data per instrument run [1]. With this increased throughput, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of human genomes is now common as seen in many national programs to sequence their local populations [2].\nFurthermore, WGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) are becoming very important to healthcare systems in addressing undiagnosed issues in the neonatal intensive care units, monitoring cancer treatments, and diagnosing and identifying risk factors for complex disorders like autism or cardiovascular disease. As NGS throughput is increasing, further bringing down the cost per sample, data volumes are increasing exponentially. As a result, data storage, management, and analysis are causing a major bottleneck in the overall workflow and increasing the underlying cost. As state-of-the-art methods allow users to extract more information from their NGS data, making the analytical pipelines more computationally intensive, this bottleneck is getting worse.\nTo address these computational challenges, the NVIDIA Clara healthcare team has started accelerating and optimizing these genomic analysis pipelines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Traditionally, these chips were used for video-based applications, and as the GPU became more computationally powerful, compute oriented general-purpose workloads started taking advantage of these platforms. GPUs are now the main workhorse of majority of supercomputers and data centers to accelerate key applications.\nClara Parabricks overview\nNVIDIA introduced the Clara Parabricks software suite of accelerated genomic analysis to support the three major NGS applications \u2013 germline variant analysis, somatic variant detection, and RNA-Seq analysis. The overall goal for the Clara Parabricks software is to provide at least an order of magnitude acceleration in compute time while generating identical outputs and reducing analysis costs. This powerful suite of genomic analysis tools called Clara Parabricks is now available on AWS as an AWS Marketplace AMI. It provides optimal performance for multiple instance types and can be used out of the box for essential bioinformatics needs. Currently, the Clara Parabricks accelerated analysis tools start with a FASTQ file to perform alignment through variant calling and expression analysis, including QC tools for both types of outputs. The suite of 33 tools can be used to support end-to-end workflows for germline, somatic and RNA-Seq pipelines, providing the flexibility to meet the individual needs of most projects.\nThe figure below shows most of the accelerated tools within the Clara Parabricks software package. Due to the accelerations of the pipelines, users can implement multiple variant callers to extract the most information from their data, and still generate the results in less time and at lower cost than using standard baseline software solutions. For example, GATK\u2019s HaplotypeCaller and Google\u2019s DeepVariant can be used to generate two VCF\u2019s for the same dataset. This enables researchers to either perform a union of both callers to minimize their false negative rates or use the intersection to improve the false positive rates. A standard 30x WGS sample can be processed in less than an hour using both variant callers using p4d.24xlarge instance on AWS. Currently, the Clara Parabricks Pipelines software suite supports Amazon EC2 G4dn, P3 and P4d instances on AWS.\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview of Clara Parabricks software suite\n\nGermline analysis\nIn this blog, we will focus on germline variant detection and associated applications. These are the genetic variants an organism derives from its parents, the inherited variants. This is one of the most popular analyses for DNA sequencing data and is a prerequisite to population scale Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). With Clara Parabricks software, a user can go from a 30x human WGS FASTQ to generating a VCF using om using comparable GATK best practices germline analysis (shown below) in as quick as 25 minutes (actual time depends on instance type chosen). The same analysis on one CPU instance with out-of-the-box software can take close to 30 hours. While Clara Parabricks germline analysis also supports Google\u2019s DeepVariant, in this blog, we will focus on the GATK4 best practices pipeline. Similar runtimes can be expected for Google\u2019s DeepVariant as well.\n\n\nFigure 2: GATK best practices pipeline for germline variant detection.\n\nRunning Parabricks Germline Pipeline on AWS\nPrerequisites \nThe prerequisites for running Parabricks on AWS are:\n\nAn AWS account with permission to provision Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and access AWS Marketplace.\nA VPC with at least a public subnet and a private subnet routed to a NAT Gateway.\n\nGetting Started with the AMI\nStep 1: Subscribe to NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines AMI in AWS Marketplace \nNVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines are available as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in AWS Marketplace. An AMI provides the necessary information to launch an Amazon EC2 instance. It can also be used to launch multiple instances of the same configuration. To subscribe to this AMI:\n\nLog in to your AWS account.\nGo to AWS Marketplace and search for \u201cNVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines\u201d.\nClick on Continue to Subscribe.\nRead and accept the terms and conditions.\n\nStep 2: Launch an EC2 instance \nOnce the subscription is complete, the AMI will appear on your list of AWS Marketplace Subscriptions, as shown in Figure 3. To launch an EC2 instance using this AMI:\n\nClick on Launch new instance.\n \n\n\nFigure 3: Launch new EC2 instance from the NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines AMI.\n\nUse the pre-set values for Delivery method and Software version and select the Region in which you want to launch the instance.\nChoose an EC2 instance type. The recommended instance type is g4dn.12xlarge, which is selected by default.\nConfigure instance detail. For the purpose of this demonstration, you can select the default setting and click on Review and Launch. This will launch a g4dn.12xlarge instance in a default VPC and subnet.\n\nOnce the instance is launched and ready to be used, use SSH to log in it.\nssh -i <access-key.pem> user-id@<public-DNS>\nStep 3: Download data \ncd /mnt/disks/local\n\naws s3 cp s3://genomics-benchmark-datasets/google-brain/fastq/novaseq/wgs_pcr_free/30x/HG001.novaseq.pcr-free.30x.R1.fastq.gz .\n\naws s3 cp s3://genomics-benchmark-datasets/google-brain/fastq/novaseq/wgs_pcr_free/30x/HG001.novaseq.pcr-free.30x.R2.fastq.gz .\n\naws s3 cp s3://parabricks.sample/parabricks_sample.tar.gz .\ntar -xvzf parabricks_sample.tar.gz\n\nStep 4: Run Parabricks \nTo run Parabricks germline pipeline on the above-mentioned dataset, you can use the following command:\ncd /mnt/disks/local\n\npbrun germline \u2013ref parabricks_sample/Ref/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta \\\n  --in-fq HG001.novaseq.pcr-free.30x.R1.fastq.gz HG001.novaseq.pcr-free.30x.R2.fastq.gz \\\n  --out-bam 30x.bam \\\n  --out-variants 30x.vcf \\\n  --knownSites parabricks_sample/Ref/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf.gz \\\n  --out-recal-file 30x_recal.txt\n\n\nBenchmark analysis\nWe use the 30x HG001 hosted on Amazon S3 here for thorough analysis across instance types: s3://genomics-benchmark-datasets/google-brain/fastq/novaseq/wgs_pcr_free/30x/\nWe use 50x, 75x, and 100x WES data for HG001 found here: s3://genomics-benchmark-datasets/google-brain/fastq/novaseq/wes_agilent/\nWe also use 50x WGS data for HG001 found here: s3://genomics-benchmark-datasets/google-brain/fastq/novaseq/wgs_pcr_free/50x/\nWe run the Parabricks software across the following instance types: g4dn.12xlarge, g4dn.metal, p3dn.24xlarge and p4dn.24xlarge.\nResults\nComparison of cost and runtime on different instance types\nThe Clara Parabricks software can run on Amazon EC2 G4, P3, and P4d EC2 instance families at different price and performance points. Figure 4 presents the time incurred for running the germline pipeline on the above dataset across different GPU instances on AWS. As reported, the analysis of a 30x genome can be completed in 80 minutes using a g4dn.12xlarge instance at an approximate cost of $1.62 using Spot Instances, while the price is $5.2 for On-Demand Instances. For faster runtimes, the same analysis can be done in 28 minutes using eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in p4d.24xlarge at $4.6 with Spot Instances, and for $15 with On-Demand Instances. The choice of the instance type is dependent upon the end user\u2019s needs, and the Clara Parabricks software is ready-to-run using the AWS Marketplace AMI.\n\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of execution time (minutes) for running Parabricks germline pipeline on the given dataset on G4, P3, and P4 EC2 instance types.\n\nThe fq2bam step includes bwa-mem and parts of co-ordinate sorting, post-processing includes parts of co-ordinate sorting, marking duplicates followed by bqsr. haplotypecaller the applybqsr step applied on the input bam, which is then fed to the variant calling step.\n\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of On-Demand and Spot Instance costs for running Parabricks germline pipeline on the given dataset on g4, p3, and p4 EC2 instance types.\n\nConcordance analysis\nThe data used above is the Precision FDA HG001 dataset downsampled to 30x coverage [3]. By using the hap.py tool on the output vcf of Clara Parabricks analysis, and the baseline GATK4, we found the concordance (F1-score) to be 0.9999. The major differences are not systematic differences, but related to a few changes between the Clara Parabricks and GATK4 code that are related to random number generation and non-determinism when running GATK4. Clara Parabricks focused on being deterministic on every hardware platform and hence did not replicate the parts of GATK4 that result in non-deterministic output.\nPerformance and scaling\nThe Clara Parabricks germline pipeline has been used in several scientific projects and has shown over 0.9999 F1 concordance with baseline GATK [4]. The software scales to meet the demands of any NGS project and has been run on thousands of whole human genome and more than a million exomes. Figure 6 shows the runtimes and associated costs when tested on the given WGS and WES samples with varying coverage. It is based On-Demand Instance pricing with the less expensive g4dn.12xlarge instance. A 50x whole exome can be analyzed in 10 minutes for under 25 cents with Spot Instance costs and under 70 cents with On-Demand Instance pricing. The results show how the runtimes and costs scale proportionally with the amount of data. While this blog focuses on HaplotypeCaller for variant calling, similar levels of speedup and accuracy with baseline version can be achieved for the germline pipeline by using Clara Parabricks DeepVariant.\n\n\nFigure 6: Comparison of runtime (minutes) and cost ($) for running the Clara Parabricks germline pipeline on the given dataset with varying coverage.\n\nCustomer success stories\nClara Parabricks Pipelines is now the trusted software of choice for several key large-scale genomics projects such as:\n\nRegeneron Genetics Center: Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) is using the Clara Parabricks accelerated compute framework as the foundation for generating scalable, high-quality germline data that can be reproduced across the genomics community. RGC has implemented DeepVariant with Parabricks to maximize the value of this combined, enterprise-level resource. This supports applications from target discovery pipelines through public-industry collaborations, including the UK Biobank and Geisinger Health. To date, more than 1.2 million exomes have been processed with this analytical pipeline.\nJapan projectl: \u00a0The Human Genome Center (HGC) at University of Tokyo uses Clara Parabricks to accelerate genomic analysis by 40X compared to a CPU-based environment.\nThailand project: Clara Parabricks is used as the sequencing analysis software at the National Biobank of Thailand (NBT) to accelerate genomic sequencing as part of the government\u2019s plan to promote genomic medicine in Thailand.\nTGEN: TGen is using NVIDIA GPUs and Clara Parabricks Pipelines to power a highly integrated high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure that delivers sequence analysis results to collaborative teams of researchers and physicians. The system accelerates whole genome sequencing analysis of both healthy and diseased cells, which helps determine the most effective therapy for each patient.\n\nConclusion\nClara Parabricks software suite provides multifold acceleration for major genomic analysis pipelines. This not only leads to faster analysis times, but also provides significant cost reduction on AWS. Traditional analysis that takes hours can be done in few minutes and can be scaled to processing large number of samples using AWS.

Leveraging the second-generation RTX architecture, NVIDIA claims that the A4000 is the most powerful single-slot GPU available on the market for professionals.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A4000 is part of the company\u2019s latest desktop professional GPU lineup meant for desktop workstations that need high-performance for real-time ray tracing, AI-accelerated compute, and high-performance graphics. Leveraging the second-generation RTX architecture, NVIDIA claims that the A4000 is the most powerful single-slot GPU available on the market for professionals.\n\nThe A4000 sits right behind the RTX A5000 and RTX A6000 in NVIDIA\u2019s new line of professional RTX cards, featuring 48 RT Cores (2nd gen), 192 third-generation Tensor Cores, and 6,144 CUDA cores with 16 GB of graphics memory. While NVIDIA dropped the Quadro name to distinguish their professional line, the RTX A4000 still features the same professional features, hardware and software certifications, certified drivers as the Quadro line was known for.\n\nFor connectivity, the 4.4\u201d height x 9.5\u201d\u00a0 length\u00a0 A4000 features four DisplayPort 1.4a ports and the usual 1x 6-pin PCIe power port. Ventilation runs along the top of each of the DisplayPorts and on the front side of the card, while a smaller fan resides on the opposite side.\n\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 vs Quadro RTX 4000\nNVIDIA considers the RTX A4000 as a successor to the Quadro RTX 4000, an aging card that\u2019s a few years old at the time of this review. \u00a0In our review from 2019, the RTX 4000 posted some very impressive performance for an entry-level card, making it a great addition to the company\u2019s impressive portfolio while carrying a price tag of roughly just $900 when it was released. That said, with the advancements NVIDIA has recently made in their GPU architecture, we\u2019re always excited to see what they have in store for their workstation-class cards.\n\nRight away you will see that the A4000 doubles the GPU memory of the Quadro card to 16GB and while almost tripling the CUDA core count. Coupling this with a slight increase in memory bandwidth (448GB/s), the new A4000 is already looking significantly better. These specs make it more in line with the RTX 3070, NVIDIA\u2019s high-performance desktop consumer card.\nNVIDIA Ampere\nAs we mentioned in our RTX A6000 review, the most significant upgrade to the company\u2019s next-gen professional graphics cards is\u00a0NVIDIA Ampere. This is where the true jump in performance lies. Highlights of this new architecture that leverages Samsung\u2019s 8nm NVIDIA custom process with 28 billion transistors. It also features an improved streaming multiprocessor and second-generation Ray Tracing cores (which improve ray tracing hardware acceleration) and third-generation Tensor Cores, the latter of which improves AI inference performance and DLSS resulting in better performance in higher resolutions.\n\nThe Ampere architecture also increases CUDA cores by up to double the single-precision floating-point compared to last-gen models. This means noticeable performance improvements in areas such as 3D model development and tasks like desktop simulation for computer-aided engineering.\nBacked by a 3-year warranty, the NVIDIA RTX A4000 goes for roughly $2,000 depending on the branding.\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 Specifications\n\n\n\nGPU memory\n16 GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory interface\n256-bit\n\n\nMemory bandwidth\n448 GB/s\n\n\nError-correcting code (ECC)\nYes\n\n\nNVIDIA Ampere architecture-based CUDA Cores\n6,144\n\n\nNVIDIA third-generation Tensor Cores\n192\n\n\nNVIDIA second- generation RT Cores\n48\n\n\nSingle-precision performance\n19.2\u00a0TFLOPS3\n\n\nRT Core performance\n37.4 TFLOPS3\n\n\nTensor performance\n153.4 TFLOPS4\n\n\nSystem interface\nPCI Express 4.0 x16\n\n\nPower consumption\nTotal board power: 140 W\n\n\nThermal solution\nActive\n\n\nForm factor\n4.4\u201d H x 9.5\u201d L,\nsingle slot\n\n\nDisplay connectors\n4x DisplayPort 1.4a\n\n\nMax simultaneous displays\n4x\u00a04096\u00a0x\u00a02160\u00a0@ 120 Hz,\n4x 5120 x 2880 @ 60 Hz,\n2x 7680 x 4320 @ 60 Hz\n\n\nPower connector\n1x 6-pin PCIe\n\n\nEncode/decode engines\n1x encode, 1x decode (+AV1 decode)\n\n\nVR ready\nYes\n\n\nGraphics APIs\nDirectX\u00a012.075,\u00a0Shader\u00a0Model\u00a05.175,\nOpenGL 4.686, Vulkan 1.26\n\n\nCompute APIs\nCUDA, DirectCompute, OpenCL\u2122\n\n\n\n NVIDIA RTX A4000\u00a0Performance\nTo gauge its performance, we put the RTX A4000 through a series of resource-intensive tests and compared it to the higher-classed RTX A6000 to show you the differences between the two ends of the second-generation RTX architecture spectrum. We installed both the A4000 and A6000 inside a Lenovo ThinkStation P620 and HP ZCentral 4R for testing.\nHP ZCentral 4R:\n\nIntel Xeon 2295 (3.0 GHz base frequency, up to 4.6 GHz with Intel vPro Technology)\n64GB of DDR4-2933 ECC SDRAM\n1TB M.2 SSD\n\n\nLenovo ThinkStation P620:\n\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX Processor (2.70 GHz, up to 4.20 GHz Max Boost, 64 Cores, 128 Threads, 32 MB Cache)\n64GB of DDR4 RAM\n1TB PM981 SSD\n\nSPECviewperf 2020\nFirst up is the SPECviewperf 2020 benchmark, the worldwide standard for measuring graphics performance of professional applications running under the OpenGL and Direct X application programming interfaces. The viewsets (or benchmarks) represent graphics content and behavior from actual applications, without having to install the applications themselves. These viewsets include 3D Max, CATIA, Creo, Energy, Maya, Medical, Siemens NX, and Solidworks.\n\n\n\nViewsets\nNVIDIA\nRTX 4000\u00a0Lenovo ThinkStation P620\nNVIDIA RTX A4000\nHP ZCentral 4R\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\u00a0Lenovo ThinkStation P620\nNVIDIA RTX\nA6000\nHP ZCentral 4R\n\n\n3dsmax-07\n90.29\n90.8\n131.96\n127.89\n\n\nCatia-06\n67.54\n58.75\n90.99\n75.32\n\n\nCreo-03\n103.84\n90.65\n125.88\n99.54\n\n\nEnergy-03\n21.97\n22.16\n42.22\n38.83\n\n\nMaya-06\n224.81\n215.15\n314.82\n273.01\n\n\nMedical-03\n22.55\n21.53\n34.87\n30.58\n\n\nSnx-04\n322.7\n328.37\n450.72\n422.01\n\n\nSw-05\n107.06\n108.76\n161.4\n152.19\n\n\n\nFor this benchmark, the RTX A4000 showed great performance in both the Lenovo and HP systems (which showed very similar results) due to the new Ampere architecture. You will notice the same trend in the rest of our benchmarks.\nThough the performance differential of the higher-end model (A6000) is sometimes significant, the A4000 still offers plenty of performance for most intensive use cases.\nNext, we ran SPECworkstation3, a test that specializes in benchmarks designed for testing all key aspects of workstation performance; it uses over 30 workloads to test CPU, graphics, I/O, and memory bandwidth. The workloads fall into broader categories such as Media and Entertainment, Financial Services, Product Development, Energy, Life Sciences, and General Operations. We are going to list the broad-category results for each, as opposed to the individual workloads. The results are an average of all the individual workloads in each category.\nSPECworkstation3\n\n\n\nCategory\nNVIDIA RTX A4000\u00a0Lenovo ThinkStation P620\nNVIDIA RTX\nA4000\nHP ZCentral 4R\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\u00a0Lenovo ThinkStation P620\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\u00a0HP ZCentral 4R\n\n\nM&E\n5.87\n3.37\n6.04\n3.49\n\n\nProdDev\n5.01\n3.35\n5.49\n3.63\n\n\nLifeSci\n3.99\n3.51\n4.61\n3.76\n\n\nEnergy\n4.68\n2.58\n5.58\n2.79\n\n\nFSI\n9.46\n3.96\n9.49\n3.38\n\n\nGeneralOps\n2.2\n1.59\n2.14\n1.63\n\n\nGPU Compute\n5.25\n5.19\n7.44\n7.22\n\n\n\nOverall, we saw more impressive performance with the A4000 when installed inside the P620, sometimes even offering similar or even better results compared to the A6000 (specifically the general operations and financial services categories). When populated inside the HP ZCentral workstation, the A4000 showed noticeably lower numbers with the exception of the GPU compute category.\nEnvironmental Systems Research Institute (Esri)\nNext up is the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) benchmark. Esri is a supplier of Geographic Information System (GIS) software while their Performance Team designed their PerfTool add-in scripts to automatically launch the ArcGIS Pro.\nThis application uses a \u201cZoomToBookmarks\u201d function to browse various predefined bookmarks and create a log file with all the key data points required to predict the user experience. The script automatically loops the bookmarks three times to account for caching (memory and disk cache). In other words, this benchmark simulates heavy graphical use that one might see through Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Pro software.\nThe tests consist of three main datasets. Two are 3-D city views of Philadelphia, PA, and Montreal, QC. These city views contain textured 3-D multipatch buildings draped on a terrain model and draped aerial images. The third dataset is a 2-D map view of the Portland OR region. This data contains detailed information for roads, land use parcels, parks and schools, rivers, lakes, and hill shaded terrain.\nFirst up is Montreal. Here, the RTX A4000 hit an average FPS of 471.31 and a minimum FPS of 194.66 inside the P620. The HP ZCentral 4R configuration showed an average FPS of 349.32 and a minimum FPS of 167.86.\n\n\n\nESRI ArcGIS Pro 2.3 Montreal\n\n\n\n\nAverage FPS\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 (ThinkStation P620)\n471.31\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 (HP ZCentral 4R)\n349.32\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\n614.03\n\n\n\nMinimum FPS\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 (ThinkStation P620)\n194.66\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 (HP ZCentral 4R)\n167.86\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX A6000\n238.18\n\n\n\nNext up is Philly.

This benchmark was run using the Blender Benchmark utility. NVIDIA OptiX was the chosen render method, as opposed to CUDA, as the A4000 (like higher-end A6000) can utilize RTX. In this benchmark measured in seconds, lower is better.\n\nThough the A6000 was almost twice as fast when installed inside the P620 and HP ZCentral 4R, this was expected and the A4000 still showed next-gen results for its class.\nLuxMark\nLuxMark is an OpenCL cross-platform benchmarking tool from those who maintain the open-source 3D rending engine, LuxRender. This tool looks at GPU performance in the areas of 3D modeling, lighting, and video work. For this review, we used the newest version, v4alpha0. In LuxMark, higher is better when it comes to the score.\nInside the Lenovo P620, the RTX A4000 scored 4,627 In the food rendering category while Hallbench showed 12,314. These were behind most of the tested drives, but again, the results were still good, as the other tested GPUs are equipped with higher-performing components.\n\nInside an HP ZCentral 4R, the RTX A4000 posted a score of 12,117 and 4,540 for the food and Hallbench categories, respectively.\nOctaneBench\nLastly, we look at OctaneBench. This is a benchmarking utility for OctaneRender and another 3D renderer with RTX support (similar to V-Ray).\n\n\n\nRTX A4000 Total Score: 392.47\n\n\nLenovo ThinkStation P620\n\n\n\u00a0Scene\nKernel\nMs/\u00a0s\nRatio\n\u00a0Weight\n\u00a0Score\n\n\nInterior (by Julia Lynen)\ninfo channels\n239.64\n4.651\n10\n11.63\n\n\nInterior (by Julia Lynen)\ndirect lighting\n71.47\n4.015\n40\n40.15\n\n\nInterior (by Julia Lynen)\npath tracing\n35.13\n4.113\n50\n51.41\n\n\nIdea (by Julio Cayetano)\ninfo channels\n247.17\n2.874\n10\n7.19\n\n\nIdea (by Julio Cayetano)\ndirect lighting\n66.43\n3.156\n40\n31.56\n\n\nIdea (by Julio Cayetano)\npath tracing\n60.06\n3.099\n50\n38.74\n\n\nATV (by Jurgen Aleksejev)\ninfo channels\n223.54\n7.121\n10\n17.80\n\n\nATV (by Jurgen Aleksejev)\ndirect lighting\n67.25\n4.421\n40\n44.21\n\n\nATV (by Jurgen Aleksejev)\npath tracing\n57.24\n4.430\n50\n55.38\n\n\nBox (by Enrico Cerica)\ninfo channels\n259.13\n3.941\n10\n9.85\n\n\nBox (by Enrico Cerica)\ndirect lighting\n55.13\n3.983\n40\n39.83\n\n\nBox (by Enrico Cerica)\npath tracing\n48.12\n3.578\n50\n44.72\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nRTX A4000 Total Score: 391.72\n\n\nHP ZCentral 4R\n\n\nScene\n\u00a0Kernel\nMs/ s\nRatio\n\u00a0Weight\n\u00a0Score\n\n\nInterior (by Julia Lynen)\ninfo channels\n238.19\n4.623\n10\n11.56\n\n\nInterior (by Julia Lynen)\ndirect lighting\n71.49\n4.017\n40\n40.17\n\n\nInterior (by Julia Lynen)\npath tracing\n35.14\n4.114\n50\n51.43\n\n\nIdea (by Julio Cayetano)\ninfo channels\n244.42\n2.842\n10\n7.11\n\n\nIdea (by Julio Cayetano)\ndirect lighting\n66.26\n3.148\n40\n31.48\n\n\nIdea (by Julio Cayetano)\npath tracing\n59.98\n3.095\n50\n38.68\n\n\nATV (by Jurgen Aleksejev)\ninfo channels\n222.32\n7.083\n10\n17.71\n\n\nATV (by Jurgen Aleksejev)\ndirect lighting\n67.12\n4.413\n40\n44.13\n\n\nATV (by Jurgen Aleksejev)\npath tracing\n57.19\n4.426\n50\n55.33\n\n\nBox (by Enrico Cerica)\ninfo channels\n257.61\n3.918\n10\n9.80\n\n\nBox (by Enrico Cerica)\ndirect lighting\n54.97\n3.971\n40\n39.71\n\n\nBox (by Enrico Cerica)\npath tracing\n48.02\n3.570\n50\n44.63\n\n\n\nHere, we see an overall score of 392.47 and 391.72 when populated inside the HP and Lenovo workstations, respectively. This is roughly half of what the A8000 is capable of; however, it is an impressive result for an entry-level card and certainly leaps and bounds over its predecessor.\nIn comparison to higher-end consumer-grade cards, the official OctaneBench website scored the powerful RTX 3070 and 3060 TI and RTX 3080 (laptop model) with 400 and 376, respectively, while the Quadro RTX 4000 showed just 228 in their charts.\nConclusion\nThe RTX A4000 is NVIDIA\u2019s latest midrange release from its portfolio of professional GPUs based on the second-generation RTX architecture. While the A6000 is an ultimate performer with a premium price tag, the new A4000 is the most affordable card of the line, featuring 6,144 CUDA processing cores, 48 next-generation RT cores, HDCP 2.2 support, and the PCI Express 4.0 x16 interface. \u00a0It also can connect to a maximum of four 4096 x 2160 displays at 120Hz. This card is meant for professionals who have more modest needs and a smaller budget, though it can still handle a wide range of resource-intensive professional workloads.\n\nNVIDIA indicates that this is essentially a replacement of the Quadro RTX 4000; but that\u2019s certainly an understatement, as the new A4000 blows it out of the water in every way. Performance is more in line with the desktop version of the well sought-after and powerful RTX 3070. That said, the new NVIDIA card doubles the GPU memory size of the RTX 4000 to 16GB GDDR6, which allows it to perform at a much higher level when dealing with complex 3D datasets.\nAs we mentioned earlier, this significant boost in performance is primarily due to NVIDIA Ampere, a next-gen architecture that uses Samsung\u2019s 8nm NVIDIA custom process. It\u2019s also highlighted by an improved streaming multiprocessor, 2nd-gen Ray Tracing cores, and considerably better ray-tracing hardware acceleration.\n\nMoreover, Ampere uses 3rd-generation Tensor Cores to which improve AI inference performance while DLSS results in noticeably better performance at higher resolutions. There\u2019s a lot more to Ampere and but all of this simply means the RTX A4000 (like the A8000) is a huge leap forward in GPU technology and even entry cards like this are able to show some huge gains in performance compared to the previous generation. With this release, NVIDIA is giving those who can\u2019t afford high-end workstation GPUs the opportunity access to this impressive architecture.\nSo, who is the RTX A4000 for? Engineers and architects who use advanced professional applications and don\u2019t need a top-end workstation GPU will certainly find the A4000 an ideal choice for their workloads. Those who need the best performance possible out of their workstation (with a much larger budget to boot) might opt for NVIDIA\u2019s flagship RTX A6000 and A5000 that sits between the two.\nNVIDIA RTX A4000 Product page\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \nFacebookTwitterPinterestEmail \n\n\n\n \n\nLyle Smith\nLyle is a long-time staff writer for StorageReview, covering a broad set of end user and enterprise IT topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious post\n\n\n\nSynology DiskStation DS920+ Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext post\n\n\n\nDell UltraSharp Webcam Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUSTED VENDORS\nProducts and solutions from our affiliate partners:\n\n\n\n\n        Ubiquiti\n      \n\n\n\n\n        Newegg\n      \n\n\n\n Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletterSubscribe to the StorageReview newsletter to stay up to date on the latest news and reviews.

On PC, Nvidia's DLSS technology arrived as a key feature for RTX GPUs, while earlier this year AMD released FidelityFX SuperResolution (FSR). Today we back with Team Green, as Nvidia has announced a new driver-level image scaling feature designed to work in all games, with GPUs as old as the Maxwell architecture.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 Start\n00:15 Introduction \u2013 what is Nvidia Image Scaling?\n02:14 It\u2019s a driver level feature\n04:19 Test setup\n05:37 Meet ICAT \u2013 Image Comparison & Analysis Tool\n10:29 Necromunda: Hired Gun Image Comparisons\n27:20 Deathloop Image Comparisons\n34:02 F1 2021 Image Comparisons\n40:00 Performance Benchmarks\n42:38 Closing thoughts\nFor clarity's sake, Nvidia has already offered an image scaling feature for a couple of years now, accessible within its control panel. I'm not sure how many people knew about this however, and today the upscaling algorithm itself has been updated. Nvidia Image Scaling (NIS) can now be enabled from within GeForce Experience, too, making it easier than ever to boost frame rates.\n \nThe technology itself is not dissimilar to AMD FSR. Both are spatial upscalers which render your game at a lower internal resolution before upscaling and sharpening, with the final output displayed at your monitor's native resolution. The key difference is that FSR requires specific integration within a game, whereas NIS is a driver-level feature, so it is enabled from within the Nvidia control panel or GeForce Experience.\nThat does have a couple of implications for when you open your games. The first is that absolutely\u00a0everything on screen is going to be rendered at a lower resolution, upscaled and sharpened \u2013 including the HUD, subtitles and other UI elements. A game with DLSS or FSR, features that require integration, doesn't upscale these elements, giving a slightly sharper presentation for the in-game UI.\nSecondly, for NIS to work, your in-game display settings\u00a0must show a resolution lower than your monitor's native resolution \u2013 else NIS won't be upscaling anything. For example, to achieve a 67% render scale on my 4K monitor, the in-game resolution must be set at 2560\u00d71440. It is possible to have this done automatically if you enable NIS via GeForce Experience and set your desired render scale \u2013 you then have to click the \u2018optimise' button which changes the in-game resolution to match your render scale.\nHowever, if you enable NIS from within the Nvidia control panel, you will need to manually set your in-game resolution to lower than native. It is definitely a bit more fiddly, with more potential for things to go wrong than specific game integration as we see with FSR, but for peace of mind Nvidia does give you option to enable an overlay in the top left corner, with the acronym \u2018NIS' appearing in green text to let you know everything is being upscaled and sharpened correctly.\n \nNvidia is also launching an open-source cross-platform SDK for NIS today, available on GitHub, so developers can integrate NIS directly within a game if they choose, but for all of our testing today we have assessed NIS as a driver-level feature. AMD GPUs will be compatible with games that implement the NIS SDK, but you need a Nvidia GPU (Maxwell or newer) to access NIS from within the control panel or GeForce Experience.\nFor our testing today, we are looking at the image quality of NIS versus native resolution, FSR and DLSS in three games \u2013 Necromunda: Hired Gun, Deathloop, and F1 2021. For all of the comparisons shown in the video, we are using a new tool from Nvidia known as ICAT, the Image Comparison & Analysis Tool. This is a great piece of software, available free of charge, that lets you compare different screenshots or game capture side by side.\nThat\u2019s it for this brief explainer though, and be sure to watch the video above for all the side-by-side image quality comparisons and the performance numbers!\nDiscuss on our Facebook page HERE.\nKitGuru says: Let us know if you would be happy to enable NIS in-game, and what render scale you would opt for.\nBecome a Patron!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n Google +\n Stumbleupon\n Whatsapp\n Reddit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTags AMD DLSS FSR NIS nvidia nvidia image scaling spatial upscaler\n \n\nPrevious New COD anti-cheat will ban cheaters from \u2018past, present and future\u2019 games in the series\nNext Kolink launches Big Chungus Shredded and Hench cases\n\n\n\n\nCheck Also\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTeam Ninja investigates disappearing save files in Rise of the Ronin\nRise of Ronin finally arrived on PC after many months of PS5 exclusivity.

This doesn't mean it's impossible to get a new graphics card for cheaper than its regular price - it's just that it requires some digging. That's what we're here for. Below you'll find the best discounts on Nvidia and AMD GPUs that we've snuffled out.\nPersonally, I think you should wait until the current price inflation (an inevitable consequence of the stock scarcity) has calmed down before buying one of today's best graphics cards, but if you absolutely need a new GPU this instant, then Black Friday and Cyber Monday are perhaps the best times to try and get one. To that end: any halfway decent Cyber Monday graphics card deals that exist, you\u2019ll find below. \n\nGet the best Cyber Monday graphics card deals right now:\n\nBest Nvidia GPU deals (UK)\nBest AMD GPU deals (UK)\nBest Nvidia GPU deals (US)\nBest AMD GPU deals (US)\n\n\nClick the links on the right to jump to UK or US deals, and be sure to check back if there\u2019s nothing that fits the bill right now \u2013 we\u2019ll be updating this list until the end of Cyber Monday.\nLuckily, for those who want to upgrade other components or build a whole new PC, offers on other kinds of PC hardware are far more bountiful. You can browse our main Black Friday deals hub for everything in one place, or visit any of our product-specific deals hubs below.\n\nCyber Monday gaming monitor deals\nCyber Monday SSD deals\nCyber Monday gaming mouse and keyboard deals\nCyber Monday VR headset deals\nCyber Monday gaming laptop deals\nCyber Monday CPU deals\nCyber Monday RAM deals\nCyber Monday Logitech deals\nCyber Monday Razer deals\nCyber Monday PC game deals\n\n\nCyber Monday graphics card deals (UK)\nBest Nvidia GPU deals:\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti deals:\n\nRNY GeForce RTX 3060 Ti XLR8 Gaming REVEL Edition - \u00a3700 from Currys PC World\n\nWhile not technically discounted for Black Friday, this is one of the few RTX 3060 Ti cards we've seen that's actually in stock right now. You can also get free next day delivery with the promo code FNDDGAMING, and there's also a flexible payment scheme available too.\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti deals:\n\nPNY GeForce RTX 3080 Ti XLR8 Gaming REVEL Edition - \u00a31700 from Currys PC World (was \u00a31900)\n\nIt's the most expensive graphics card 'deal' on this list, but if 4K 60fps performance on max settings is what you're after, the RTX 3080 Ti can definitely deliver the goods. \nBest AMD GPU deals:\nAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT deals:\n\nMSI Radeon RX 6700 XT Mech 2X OC - \u00a3750 from Currys PC World\n\nNot a deal as such, but it is at least in stock. AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT is a superb graphics card for 1440p gaming at high quality settings, and arguably much more suitable to your typical gaming PC than the RX 6900 XTs listed below. \n\n\n\n \n\nCyber Monday graphics card deals (US)\nBest Nvidia GPU deals:\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1650 deals:\nRead our full Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 review\n\nZotac Gaming GeForce GTX 1650 OC - $325 from Newegg (was $370)\nThe GTX 1650 was once the quintessential entry-level card for 1080p, and now even in a GPU market gone bananas, it's still more or less the cheapest non-ancient card to buy new. Fitting or tragic? Maybe a bit of both, but if you're brand new to PC gaming and can't budget for something stronger, go ahead. And welcome, by the way. It isn't always this expensive.\nBest AMD GPU deals:\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT deals:\n\nASRock Radeon RX 6900 XT OC Formula - $1550 from Newegg (was $1600)\n\nNot an awful price for the Radeon RX 6900 XT in the current climate, screwed up as it is. You also get free copies of Far Cry 6 and Resident Evil 8, plus a month\u2019s free access to Xbox Game Pass.\n\nHow to get the best Cyber Monday graphics card deal\nAs you can tell from the, uh, sparseness of the above list, your options will be sadly limited by both stock availability and the fact that pretty much all GPUs are much pricier than they should be. That being said, when buying a new graphics card at any time, you'll want to consider two key factors: the resolution of your monitor, and what kind of quality setting you'd like to aim for when playing games.\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 and AMD Radeon RX 6600 are both designed to run games at 1080p on high settings, though it's worth paying a little extra to get their respective upgrades: the RTX 3060 Ti and the Radeon RX 6600 XT. You can go the cheaper route, though: Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1660 Super and AMD's older Radeon RX 5500 XT are also excellent budget options that will get you smooth frame rates on Medium to High settings.\nAs for 1440p, the RTX 3060 Ti will still perform well, though for the slickest frame rates you could take the next step up with an RTX 3070 or Radeon RX 6700 XT. These can even cope with 4K on lowered settings, though if you really want the best out such a high resolution, check out the RTX 3080 and Radeon RX 6800 XT.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

MLPerf HPC addresses a style of computing that speeds and augments simulations on supercomputers with AI.\nRecent advances in molecular dynamics, astronomy and climate simulation all used HPC+AI to make scientific breakthroughs. It\u2019s a trend driving the adoption of exascale AI for users in both science and industry.\nWhat the Benchmarks Measure\nMLPerf HPC 1.0 measured training of AI models in three typical workloads for HPC centers.\n\nCosmoFlow estimates details of objects in images from telescopes.\nDeepCAM tests detection of hurricanes and atmospheric rivers in climate data.\nOpenCatalyst tracks how well systems predict forces among atoms in molecules.\n\nEach test has two parts. A measure of how fast a system trains a model is called strong scaling. Its counterpart, weak scaling, is a measure of maximum system throughput, that is, how many models a system can train in a given time.\nCompared to the best results in strong scaling from last year\u2019s MLPerf 0.7 round, NVIDIA delivered 5x better results for CosmoFlow. In DeepCAM, we delivered nearly 7x more performance.\nThe Perlmutter Phase 1 system at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab led in strong scaling in the OpenCatalyst benchmark using 512 of its 6,144 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nIn the weak-scaling category, we led DeepCAM using 16 nodes per job and 256 simultaneous jobs. All our tests ran on NVIDIA Selene (pictured above), our in-house system and the world\u2019s largest industrial supercomputer.\nNVIDIA delivered leadership results in both the speed of training a model and per-chip efficiency.\nThe latest results demonstrate another dimension of the NVIDIA AI platform and its performance leadership. It marks the eighth straight time NVIDIA delivered top scores in MLPerf benchmarks that span AI training and inference in the data center, the cloud and the network\u2019s edge.\nA Broad Ecosystem\nSeven of the eight participants in this round submitted results using NVIDIA GPUs.\nThey include the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in Germany, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and, in the U.S., the Argonne and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the Texas Advanced Computing Center.\n\u201cWith the benchmark test, we have shown that our machine can unfold its potential in practice and contribute to keeping Europe on the ball when it comes to AI,\u201d said Thomas Lippert, director of the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in a blog.\nThe MLPerf benchmarks are backed by MLCommons, an industry group led by Alibaba, Google, Intel, Meta, NVIDIA and others.\nHow We Did It\nThe strong showing is the result of a mature NVIDIA AI platform that includes a full stack of software.\nIn this round, we tuned our code with tools available to everyone, such as NVIDIA DALI to accelerate data processing and CUDA Graphs to reduce small-batch latency for efficiently scaling up to 1,024 or more GPUs.\nWe also applied NVIDIA SHARP, a key component within NVIDIA MagnumIO. It provides in-network computing to accelerate communications and offload data operations to the NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand switch.\nFor a deeper dive into how we used these tools see our developer blog.\nAll the software we used for our submissions is available from the MLPerf repository. We regularly add such code to the NGC catalog, our software hub for pretrained AI models, industry application frameworks, GPU applications and other software resources.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA in Europe | Parallel Computing | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It uses a streamlined, AI-powered toolset to remove background noise, add virtual effects, auto-frame shots and more. Now, Logitech has announced that it's incorporating some of those features directly into certain headsets and Blue microphones via a new beta, with no need to run any NVIDIA apps.Thanks to a partnership between Logitech and NVIDIA, some of the Broadcast tools will be available through the G Hub drivers for the following products: Logitech G733 Gaming Headset, Logitech PRO X Gaming Headset, Logitech PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset, Blue Yeti X Microphone, Blue Yeti Classic Microphone and Blue Yeti Nano Microphone.Here's the full list of compatible Logitech G and @BlueMicrophones devices: G733 Gaming Headset PRO X Gaming HeadsetPRO X Wireless Gaming HeadsetYeti X MicrophoneYeti Classic MicrophoneYeti Nano Microphone\u2014 Logitech G (@LogitechG) November 2, 2021The drivers will make it possible for users to eliminate unwanted background noises and/or echo in a single click and clean up their mic signal. \"You can even test your mic signal to find the perfect settings for your set up,\" Logitech wrote. NVIDIA previously showed that it was possible to completely remove the sound of a hair dryer running in the background from your mic, so it's not just some minor noise reduction. It can also remove noise on the listener's end, like someone's clattering keyboard.The feature is now available to everyone via an open beta with the latest version of Logitech G Hub. You can also, of course, run NVIDIA Broadcast as a separate app that works with all of Logitech's audio products (or any other audio products, for that matter). The feature is supported on GeForce RTX 2060 and up GPUs, along with Quadro RTX 3000 and Titan RTX or higher.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

According to a post on the EVGA forums, someone lifted the graphics cards on October 29 as they were en-route to a distribution center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease take notice that on October 29, 2021,a shipment of EVGA GeForce RTX 30-Series Graphics Cards was stolen from a truck en route from San Francisco to our Southern California distribution center,\u201d the post said. \u201cThese graphics cards are in high demand and each has an estimated retail value starting at $329.99 up to $1959.99 MSRP.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\tVideos by VICE\t\t\n\nThe post didn\u2019t detail which specific models of cards were in the theft or how many cards were stolen, but $329 to $1959 covers a wide range. The lowest would be an RTX 3060 and the highest a RTX 3090. It is almost impossible to purchase a graphics card at its suggested retail price right now. NVIDIA\u2019s 3000 series of cards sold out instantly when they were released in 2020, crashing several websites.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s cards were hard to obtain before the full scale of the chip shortage we\u2019re currently in became obvious, and demand hasn\u2019t slowed down almost a year later. The reasons for the shortage are complicated. Demand is high because the pandemic forced people to work from home and people took up gaming as a hobby. NVIDIA can\u2019t keep up with manufacturing because of the demand for silicon chips. And graphics cards are a key component in cryptocurrency mining.\nThe high demand has created incentives for bots and criminals to acquire every card they can and sell them at incredible markups. RTX 3060s are selling around $700 on eBay, roughly double what EVGA sells them for. In its post, EVGA noted it\u2019s against the law to buy and sell stolen goods. \u201cIt is also a criminal and civil offense to \u2018conceal, sell, withhold, or aid in concealing selling or withholding\u2019 any such property,\u201d the post said.\n\n\nEVGA also implied that it knows the serial number of every graphics card that was part of the shipment. \u201cIf you are able to successfully register your product and see it under My Products, then your product is NOT affected by this notice, you can also check the serial number at the EVGA Warranty Check page to see if it is affected,\u201d the post said. \u201cEVGA will NOT REGISTER or HONOR ANY WARRANTY or UPGRADE claims on these products.\u201d\nEVGA did not immediately respond to Waypont\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nTagged:Crime, GAMES, gpu\nShare:\nX\nFacebook\nShareCopied to clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\nOne email.

Nvidia device plugin for Kubernetes bridges the gap between the GPU and the container orchestrator. Finally, Kubernetes is installed, which will interact with the chosen container runtime to manage the lifecycle of workloads.\nThe Nvidia GPU Operator dramatically simplifies the process without manually installing the drivers, CUDA runtime, cuDNN libraries, or the Nvidia Container Toolkit. It can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster that meets specific hardware and software requirements.\nWhen compared to the installation on the upstream Kubernetes distribution, the installation on RKE2 is slightly different. The key difference is that RKE2 comes with an embedded containerd that needs to be tweaked a bit to support the Nvidia Container Toolkit.\nOnce RKE2 is configured with the GPU Operator, you can run workloads such as Kubeflow and Triton Inference Server that can exploit the GPU for AI acceleration.\nIn this tutorial, I will walk you through all the steps of installing the Nvidia GPU Operator on Rancher\u2019s RKE2 Kubernetes distribution.\nFor this setup, I am using an Ubuntu 20.04 Server running on Google Compute Engine. The VM is of type a2-highgpu-1g powered by an Nvidia Tesla A100 GPU. It has been tested with v1.21.5+rke2r2 version of RKE2 distribution. But you can use this guide on bare metal or IaaS environments that have access to an Nvidia GPU.\nStep 1: Install RKE2\nSSH into the instance and create the file /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml with the below contents:\nView the code on Gist.\nThis file contains the configuration required by RKE2 Server. Don\u2019t forget to replace the tls-san section with the hostname, internal IP, and the external IP address of the GCE instance.\nDownload and run the install script for RKE2. Once it\u2019s done, activate and enable the service to start at boot time.\nView the code on Gist.\nAdd the directory containing the Kubernetes binaries to the path, and run the kubectl command to check the status of the server.\nView the code on Gist.\n\nStep 2: Install Helm and Patch Containerd Configuration\nSince we will deploy the GPU operator through the Helm Chart, let\u2019s first install Helm 3.\nView the code on Gist.\nThe next step is most crucial for deploying Nvidia GPU Operator. We will patch the configuration file to enable v2 support without which the Nvidia Container Toolkit will not run.\nView the code on Gist.\nRestart RKE2 Server to make sure everything is intact.\nsystemctl restart rke2-server\n\nStep 3: Deploy Nvidia GPU Operator on RKE2\nWe have everything in place to deploy the GPU operator.\nLet\u2019s add the Nvidia Helm Chart Repo, refresh Helm and install the GPU operator.\nView the code on Gist.\nRefer to the Nvidia GPU Operator documentation for details on customizing the Helm chart values. In this case, we are essentially pointing the GPU operator to the custom container runtime class, configuration, and endpoint.\n\nThe complete installation of the GPU operator will take a few minutes. Be patient!\nStep 4: Verifying and Testing the Installation of Nvidia GPU Operator\nThe Helm chart has created a new namespace called gpu-operator-resources\n\nWait for the pods in the gpu-operator-resources namespace to become ready.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s run the famous nvidia-smi command to check if a Kubernetes pod can access the GPU.\nView the code on Gist.\n\nAs we can see from the output, the GPU operator has successfully installed and configured the Nvidia driver, CUDA runtime, and the Container Toolkit without any manual intervention.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTRENDING STORIES\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nCreated with Sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanakiram MSV is the principal analyst at Janakiram & Associates and an adjunct faculty member at the International Institute of Information Technology.

While at the high-end we have seen replacements for the data center GPUs, along with the workstation, and even consumer markets, the one area that we have not seen get an update is the AI inference space. More specifically, the low-profile AI inference card space. The NVIDIA A2 finally updates the segment held by the NVIDIA T4.\nNVIDIA A2 and Market Perspective\nThe NVIDIA A2 is a low power and low profile PCIe card. Specifically the TDP is only 40-60W. The interface is also PCIe Gen4 x8. While one may immediately question why anyone would want a GPU without an x16 connector and such low TDP in the data center, the reason is simply that these are easy to put into severs and both to power and cool.\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of the NVIDIA T4 that we reviewed was that it was a low-profile entry into the NVIDIA line-up. It could therefore be physically slotted into places normally reserved for NICs and other typically low-profile devices. The NVIDIA T4 also had a double-digit TDP. Like the NVIDIA A2, it is designed to be powered off of the PCIe bus instead of requiring external power connections. This helps to improve airflow in a chassis and reduces the system requirements for being able to integrate the A2. With lower power, it also means that the A2 can be placed into servers at the edge where there may be tighter power envelopes to adhere to.\nNVIDIA A2\nWe are going to put a full set of key specs below, but the card also has 16GB of GDDR6 memory. One feature we did not see listed is we did not see MIG (many-instance GPU) support listed. Previously, NVIDIA\u2019s position was that one would be more likely to use a larger GPU with MIG to get AI inference in edge servers. While that may work for density, it does not work for those cases where there is only 40-120W available and one needs 1-3 inference cards. That seems to be the market that NVIDIA is targeting here.\nFinal Words\nOverall, this is a good step for NVIDIA. It also feels very late in the cycle. PCIe Gen4 is going to be replaced by PCIe Gen5 in the data center starting in Q2 2022. NVIDIA says the cards are available today, but there is only a short window until we see Gen5 devices at this point. Indeed, we already have been looking at PCIe Gen5 on the desktop. In the meantime, the market has had to use the NVIDIA T4 or use MIG with larger GPUs. This is Ampere coming to a popular and established market segment around six quarters after the\u00a0NVIDIA A100 launched.\nStill, we are excited to see more NVIDIA A2 servers, as the T4 has been extremely popular.\nNVIDIA A2 Key Specs\nHere are the NVIDIA A2 key specs from NVIDIA\u2019s website as of launch:\n\n\n\nPeak FP32\n4.5 TF\n\n\nTF32 Tensor Core\n9 TF | 18 TF\u00b9\n\n\nBFLOAT16 Tensor Core\n18 TF | 36 TF\u00b9\n\n\nPeak FP16 Tensor Core\n18 TF | 36 TF\u00b9\n\n\nPeak INT8 Tensor Core\n36 TOPS | 72 TOPS\u00b9\n\n\nPeak INT4 Tensor Core\n72 TOPS | 144 TOPS\u00b9\n\n\nRT Cores\n10\n\n\nMedia engines\n1 video encoder\n2 video decoders (includes AV1 decode)\n\n\nGPU memory\n16GB GDDR6\n\n\nGPU memory bandwidth\n200GB/s\n\n\nInterconnect\nPCIe Gen4 x8\n\n\nForm factor\n1-slot, low-profile PCIe\n\n\nMax thermal design power (TDP)\n40\u201360W (configurable)\n\n\nVirtual GPU (vGPU) software support\u00b2\nNVIDIA Virtual PC (vPC), NVIDIA Virtual Applications (vApps), NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS), NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Virtual Compute Server (vCS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAmpereNVIDIA \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleNVIDIA Quantum-2 400G Switches and ConnectX-7 at GTC Fall 2021Next articleSamsung Shows Intel Sapphire Rapids PCIe Gen5 Server at OCP Summit 2021 Cliff RobinsonThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreker\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            November 10, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:23 am                                            \n\n\n\nRather strange product.

New investments coming online at MD Anderson will give researchers access to thousands of additional GPU cores to support AI projects across the institution.\nApplying AI to Diagnostic Imaging\u00a0\nThe first step in oncology is detecting tumors \u2014 the earlier the better. MD Anderson is developing early detection AI applications to help diagnose patients with pancreatic cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of just 10 percent.\n\u201cPancreatic cancer is often diagnosed after it\u2019s already metastasized, meaning it\u2019s spread to other organs,\u201d said Dr. Eugene Koay, co-director of Gastrointestinal Radiation Oncology at MD Anderson. \u201cWe\u2019re working on AI models to analyze the pancreas anytime we see it in a CT scan, MRI study or endoscopic ultrasound, whether or not the patient\u2019s appointment is related to the pancreas.\u201d\nNot all pancreatic tumors are the same. Some are slow moving, others are aggressive. Some originate from cysts in the pancreas, others don\u2019t.\nIn collaboration with the Early Detection Research Network, Koay and his team are working on convolutional neural networks that identify which cases are most likely to develop into malignant cancer, so clinicians can better support patients at risk.\nImaging Insights Inform Treatment Planning\u00a0\nWhen preparing for radiation therapy to treat cancerous cells, oncologists rely on a process known as contouring to trace the tumors that will be targeted by radiation treatment.\nIt\u2019s a time-consuming process, and oncologists often have a backlog of radiotherapy treatment plans to create for patients. Dr. Laurence Court, associate professor of Radiation Physics at MD Anderson, hopes to reduce the burden of manual contouring with AI tools, enabling hospitals to treat thousands more cancer patients each year.\nHe\u2019s especially interested in the impact these AI clinical tools could have in low-resource settings, where a shortage of radiologists and oncologists makes it harder to access lifesaving radiotherapy treatments.\nContouring is also used to plan for MRI-assisted radiosurgery, an advanced form of brachytherapy in which a radiation dose is delivered to cancerous tissue through implanted seeds. MD Anderson radiation oncologist Dr. Steven Frank uses this therapy to treat prostate cancer.\nPrecise contouring of the prostate and surrounding organs on MRI ensures that radioactive seeds are delivered to the right areas to treat the cancer without harming neighboring tissues.\nBy adopting an AI model that uses advances in GPU technologies, MD Anderson oncologists have improved the quality of contours for brachytherapy treatment planning and treatment quality assessment, said Dr. Jeremiah Sanders, a medical imaging physics fellow at MD Anderson who\u2019s developing translational AI in Frank\u2019s lab.\nSanders and Frank are also working on a model for use after a brachytherapy procedure \u2014 an AI application that analyzes MRI studies of the prostate to determine the quality of the radiation delivery. Insights from this model can help clinicians determine if additional treatment is needed and how to manage patients after their treatments.\nKeeping a Watchful AI on Model Accuracy\nFor an AI model to succeed in a clinical setting, medical researchers need to catch the cases where the neural network struggles and retrain it to improve the application\u2019s performance.\nDr. Kristy Brock, professor of Imaging Physics and Radiation Physics at MD Anderson, is working on an anomaly detection project to determine the cases where an AI model that contours liver tumors from CT scans fails \u2014 such as unusual images where a patient has a stent in the liver or fluid around the organ.\nBy identifying these rare failures, researchers can introduce additional training examples that are similar to cases the neural network previously stumbled on. This continuous training method selectively bolsters training data to improve model performance more efficiently.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep collecting data that looks the same as our first 150 scans,\u201d Brock said. \u201cWe want to identify cases that will increase the variability of our sample dataset, which in turn boosts the model\u2019s accuracy and generalizability.\u201d\nMD Anderson is one of several leading healthcare institutions adopting AI to improve medical research and patient care.

The lab\u2019s first research projects will focus on five key areas enabled by advances in high performance computing and AI: climate research, healthcare and genomics, hybridization with quantum computing, edge AI/computer vision and cybersecurity. Atos will develop an exascale-class BullSequana X supercomputer with NVIDIA\u2019s Arm-based Grace CPU, NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation GPU, Atos BXI Exascale Interconnect and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform.\nPredicting and Addressing Climate Change\nIn an effort to more accurately predict climate change, researchers from Atos and NVIDIA will run new AI and deep learning models on Europe\u2019s fastest supercomputer at the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Center. Such giant-scale models can be used to predict the evolution of extreme weather events and their changing behavior due to global warming, and they will benefit greatly from exascale-class computing.\nThe JUWELS Booster system, based on Atos\u2019 BullSequana XH2000 platform, with nearly 2.5 exaflops of AI\u00a0 and 3,744 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking, will help provide deeper understanding of climate change and more accurate long-term predictions of events, such as hurricanes, extreme precipitation, and heat and cold waves.\n\u201cAtos is strongly committed to its decarbonization objectives, which are to offset all of our residual emissions by 2028 to reach \u2018net zero,\u2019 and to reach the SBTi target to reduce our global carbon emissions under our control and influence by 50 percent by 2025,\u201d said Andy Grant, vice president of global sales for HPC, AI and Quantum at Atos. \u201cMany leading climate modeling centers, such as Meteo France, DKRZ, KNMI and AEMet, are using our BullSequana supercomputers to run their large weather and climate models, and the current EXAIL announcement is a clear demonstration of our commitment, one year after the creation of our Center of Excellence in Weather and Climate Modelling with ECMWF.\u201d\n\u201cClimate change intensifies and increases the frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt entire regions, costing governments and economies hundreds of billions each year,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Accelerated Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThe goal for EXAIL is to advance vital research to address pressing global challenges surrounding climate change.\u201d\nAccelerating Medical Research With HPC, Quantum and AI\nSupercharging medical breakthroughs with computational genomics is revolutionizing drug discovery and healthcare. Atos\u2019 Life Sciences Center of Excellence has partnered with 40 leading institutions to leverage HPC, quantum computing and AI to advance medical imaging, genomics and pharmaceuticals. The NVIDIA Clara\u2122\u00a0 healthcare application framework provides supercomputing performance for genomics, healthcare imaging and computational chemistry applications. EXAIL will harness Atos\u2019 advanced computing solutions and NVIDIA Clara to help healthcare researchers and providers accelerate drug discovery and design advanced diagnostic solutions using embedded, edge, data center and cloud platforms.\nAdvancing Quantum Research\nQuantum computing holds the potential to solve complex problems in fields like drug discovery, climate research, machine learning, logistics and finance. But much research remains before quantum computers become viable. Atos\u2019 Quantum Learning Machine, a quantum software development and simulation appliance for the coming quantum computer era, enables researchers and engineers to develop and experiment with quantum software. It will use NVIDIA GPUs to help dramatically increase the speed and scale of quantum simulations. This will speed the research in quantum algorithms, quantum information science, new quantum processor architectures and hybrid quantum-GPU system architectures.\nAccelerating Computer Vision\nUsing Atos\u2019 edge appliances, such as its BullSequana Edge which runs on NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae DPUs, the research teams at EXAIL will work together to accelerate computer vision and 5G wireless infrastructure. Six Atos labs around the world dedicated to computer vision will be equipped with the latest NVIDIA Fleet Command\u2122 technology for secure deployment and management of AI applications across distributed edge infrastructure.\nAdvancing Zero-Trust Cybersecurity\nFurthermore, the EXAIL research teams will develop a new data-center-to-edge, zero-trust cybersecurity platform leveraging the NVIDIA Morpheus open AI framework, as well as new AI models to instantly detect new cybersecurity threats.\n# # #\nAbout Atos\nAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 107,000 employees and annual revenue of over \u20ac 11 billion.

It sounds counterintuitive, but think about it: A GPU often has an extreme amount of processing power sitting idle, so why not use that redundant hardware for other things?Fortunately, NVIDIA is way ahead of us, and has already harnessed the potential of its own GPUs to do things beyond, well, graphics. For example, you might remember RTX Voice, which as the name implies, is a tool for upping your microphone game. Then, it quietly released Broadcast \u2014 a more comprehensive tool aimed squarely at streamers and content creators. Both offer great audio enhancement features, but we\u2019ll focus on Broadcast here as that has effectively (though not entirely) replaced RTX Voice.Right up the top, I should set some expectations. While Broadcast offers some helpful tools for all streamers, the real benefit is for those with more entry-level gear. For example, if you have something like a Blue Yeti and an older webcam you\u2019re going to get more out of this tool than someone with a Shure SM7B and a Sony A7.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementBroadcast specifically \u201cuses Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX GPUs to accelerate AI calculations so you can game, livestream and run AI networks at the same time.\u201d It\u2019s compatible with any RTX GPU \u2014 \u201cGeForce RTX 2060, Quadro RTX 3000, or higher\u201d \u2014 according to a company spokesperson.If you don\u2019t already own a compatible GPU, now isn\u2019t exactly the best time to be looking for one, thanks to the ongoing chip shortage, but things do seem to be slowly easing up. If you do have a supported card then you can simply download the Broadcast app and get cracking. The better news is, if you have a Logitech headset or Blue mic, as of today, Broadcast is natively supported so you won\u2019t even need to dive into the app.Supported models at launch are Logitech's G733, Pro X and Pro X Wireless headsets, and Blue's Yeti X, Yeti Classic and Yeti Nano microphones. While that\u2019s only a fraction of the companies\u2019 offerings, it still represents a lot of headsets and microphones that today have new, untapped potential. NVIDIA / James TrewThe Logitech partnership, to date, only works with some products and only with some of the features on offer in NVIDIA Broadcast. Those looking for the full audio-visual featureset will still need to download the standalone app. Once you\u2019re in Broadcast you\u2019ll see three main tabs: Microphone, Speaker and Camera. We\u2019ll focus mainly on the microphone section, but the other two are just as useful and it all combines into one hub for tweaking your stream, be it video, audio or both.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementUnder the Microphone tab you\u2019ll find a drop down on the left to select your input source and a space below for adding effects. The area on the right is given over to a tool for testing these effects before you commit to them.Right now, there are only two effects to choose from. But both are useful and there\u2019s no novelty chaffe (get your robot voices elsewhere!). Broadcast is focused on shaping up your stream, not bending it into something else. And importantly, all in realtime, unlike something like iZotope RX which is incredibly good at repairing sound, but aimed at post production.Audio toolsThe first effect is Room echo removal. For anyone who has a space with less than favorable acoustics, this is going to help you dial down that dreaded \u201ccave\u201d sound you have probably been battling with. Reverb reduction is actually quite a science, given that you\u2019re trying to remove elements of a sound that are\u2026 well, very very similar to the source. So you can\u2019t just hack out the errant frequencies and be done with it, you need to leave the original signal intact.NVIDIA kept things nice and simple. Other pro tools (like iZotope\u2019s RX) give you an bevvy of settings and controls. Broadcast? Just two: on/off and \u201cstrength\u201d (amount of reverb to be removed). To test this, I used a condenser microphone as those are most prone to picking up reverb. In the recording below, I start with no effect applied before dialling in about 50 percent and then finally with strength set to maximum.Engadget \u00b7 NVIDIA Broadcast Room noise removal testsADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAs you can hear, the effect is, well, effective. The acoustics in the room I recorded the samples in aren\u2019t terrible, but they\u2019re definitely not optimal. But the difference between the raw recording and then with the reverb removed is stark. The effect is most obvious in the first recording with the condenser mic. The raw signal is\u2026 fine, but things are much improved with the echo removal tool set to around half way. The recording feels much more present and there\u2019s no distracting room echo. More, isn\u2019t always better though. Once I dial the effect up to 100 percent, reverb might be eliminated, but at the expense of the original signal. In short, play around with the settings to find the best balance for your tastes and recording space.You\u2019ll notice in the second recording that there\u2019s not really all that much reverb to remove. This is thanks to the dynamic microphone which does a pretty good job of that itself. You can hear a difference once I start adding the effect, but it might not be worth the risk of degrading your source audio for such a minor benefit.Perhaps more impressive than the echo removal is the second effect on offer: Noise reduction. While reverb tends to be a constant, outside noises are unpredictable. Things might be quiet when you sit down to record, only for a loud motorbike or barking dog to invade your stream moments later. Not with noise removal applied though.This effect is impressively adept at removing anything but your voice from your stream. Be that a jackhammer, a crying baby next door or even a song played loudly on a speaker right by your microphone. Honestly, listen to the below.Notice how you can\u2019t hear the song when the effect is applied? That\u2019s coming from a speaker barely a foot behind the microphone. When I recorded it, it\u2019s fully audible to my ears, but almost entirely inaudible on the recording. I say almost as those with sharp ears might notice the odd fragment popping through, but you really have to listen closely. I actually asked NVIDIA about this and was given this response:ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisement\u201cThe AI networks are trained to recognize some patterns, and as such there will be gray areas where the AI can have doubts. [...] As such we wanted to give our users flexibility to run the effects in a comfortable range, or dial things up in case they needed help in extreme situations. For example, for audio effects we recommend running them at 75-90 percent, depending on how much background noise or room echo there is.\u201dAs mentioned, Broadcast largely replaced RTX Voice, but NVIDIA decided to patch it with support for NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPUs meaning you can still get the noise reduction tools even if your GPU doesn\u2019t support Broadcast. Though, the company says, experiences will vary on older cards.As with the reverb removal, the strength setting will ultimately impact the quality of the output so trial and error is needed to find the sweet spot. You might also want to consider time of day. If, for example, you live near a noisy road, you could dial in a second pair of settings for when you have to record around rush hour.The noise removal filter is impressive, but it\u2019s not without limitations. For one, the \u201cstrength\u201d slider doesn\u2019t seem to fade out sounds like music, instead it falls off only once you apply the maximum amount. At least in my testing. I doubt you\u2019re intentionally streaming with music only you want to hear, so that\u2019s a minor thing to be aware of, but if you do need to keep the strength at maximum, be aware of that degradation in signal which will get worse the more noise Broadcast is eliminating.As a companion to the vocal effects, the middle tab in Broadcast is \u201cSpeakers.\u201d We can sum this section in one shot: It\u2019s the same as Microphone, just for incoming audio. That\u2019s to say, you can go ahead and remove room echo or background noise from people you are speaking with. If you\u2019ve ever been on a Zoom call during these pandemic times and someone\u2019s baby starts crying or has a really loud road nearby, then you can selfishly spare your ears here.Camera toolsConceptually, the effects for your camera work in a similar way to the ones for your microphone. NVIDIA\u2019s AI cores are \u201clooking\u201d out for noise or, depending, your entire background. Yup, with Broadcast you can achieve a green screen effect without the actual screen. You might be thinking \u201cwell, Zoom/Meet/TikTok does that\u201d and you\u2019d be right, but those don't do it nearly as well. Below is an example of what background removal/replacement looks like in Broadcast James Trew / EngadgetYou can definitely see where the effect isn\u2019t perfect around my hair, but in general it works really well. I did notice that it struggled with the headrest on my chair, with the image flickering around that area as I moved around, but again, it\u2019s leagues above what you might hope for from a free chat app.In total, there are five effects for cameras. Three for your background: Blur, removal and replace (images or videos work!). Then there is Auto Frame, which crops in and then keeps your face in the center. Last, but not least, is Video noise removal \u2014 this is apt for recording in low light and your camera starts to go all grainy. You can see some examples in the picture below. Two were taken using a GoPro and the other pair are from an old DSLR repurposed as a webcam.If you have good lighting, you probably won\u2019t need the noise removal tool. But if your camera struggles with anything other than an abundance of photons, this filter can help. Again, as with the audio tools, be aware that more is not always better. I found with the effect applied at 100 percent you get the tell-tale \u201csmoothing\u201d that will tell your viewers that you\u2019re papering over the cracks. James Trew / EngadgetThe background tools, on the other hand, are a little more forgiving. The blur tool does a good job at obscuring the items behind you, but there\u2019s a very unnatural contrast between you, in focus, and literally anything else in shot. This is similar to how iPhone \u201cportrait\u201d mode photos often appear. The background is blurred, but the subject looks unnatural as there\u2019s almost no transition between foreground and background.This is, of course, a benefit when you want to remove the background completely. With this filter, NVIDIA does a surprisingly good job of isolating you and deleting everything else. If you want to stream via OBS (or similar) with a game or video on screen while you play in the corner, this is the effect you want and no green screen required. James Trew / EngadgetAs seen above, NVIDIA does a much better job of removing the background than, say, Zoom or Google Meet does. There\u2019s almost no bleed around hair or hands meaning your background rarely pokes through and spoils the green-screen illusion. Background replacement is essentially an extension of this effect with the option of choosing your own image or video to replace whatever happens to be behind you.The last of the video effects is Auto-Frame which, as the name suggests, keeps you locked into the center of your shot. To do this, the video crops in a little bit and it uses the extra space to gently shift the video from left to right or vice versa as you move around. The movement isn\u2019t jarring, it looks pretty smooth, and is a good way to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally drift off to the side if you are a fidgeter (like me) and don\u2019t keep still.You can also combine these effects if you want. Auto-Frame can be stacked with either noise removal or one of the background effects for example, or you could use remove background with noise removal applied. Right now you can only stack two though, but that\u2019s probably a good thing as all three at the same time might be a bit much.The camera suite of effects is currently in beta, and NVIDIA has been adding new features and improving performance at a rapid pace. Version 1.2 in May integrated Broadcast into popular streaming apps like OBS, while the latest 1.3 version released in September added support for many virtual camera apps and made combining video effects much more viable by reducing their VRAM usage by 40 percent.While performance and memory usage is never going to be an issue for those using Broadcast for their chats, one-PC streamers who are using the app while gaming will be grateful for the additional frames. Perhaps, one day, we can dare to dream about many other features such as multi-mic support (with different effects) live transcribing for closed captions and even smart detection of licensed music so your streams don\u2019t flag a DMCA violation.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.Latest StoriesEngadgetNVIDIA GTC 2025 live: News and announcements from CEO Jensen Huang's annual keynoteHuang is kicking off the company's AI conference with a two-hour-long keynote later today.

See our ethics statement.Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeSean Hollister is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Nvidia wants you to know that AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is a mere pretender, nothing like the Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technique its GPUs can use to boost the framerate and/or image quality of your games. To prove it, Nvidia is trying an interesting new tactic by releasing a remarkably powerful image comparison tool called Nvidia ICAT, for free, so that anyone can see for themselves.ICAT, short for \u201cImage Comparison And Analysis,\u201d is a very simple program that lets you view a stack of gameplay screenshots and even recorded videos side-by-side, automatically lining up the frames, and allowing you to fluidly pan across each scene, zoom in and out, on all of those images or videos simultaneously. It\u2019s got a drag-and-drop interface that makes pixel peeping child\u2019s play, and as known pixel peepers, you\u2019d better believe The Verge is going to be using it for more than just gaming graphics!Nvidia\u2019s new ICAT tool in action. There\u2019s also an image slider mode. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeBut Nvidia\u2019s hope, again, is to show how poor AMD\u2019s FSR is compared to DLSS \u2014 or even Nvidia\u2019s own, separate spatial upscaling technique.In case you need a brief primer: Spatial upscaling techniques, like AMD FSR, run each of your game\u2019s video frames one at a time through a fixed algorithm \u2014 and they don\u2019t require a special GPU to run. Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, on the other hand, is a temporal upscaling technique that compares multiple frames and takes account of how things are moving in a video game scene, and processes all that using a neural network that runs exclusively on the Tensor cores you can only find in an Nvidia RTX GPU.Nvidia illustrates how temporal and spatial upscaling differ.But before you say \u201cthat\u2019s great Nvidia, but I can\u2019t actually buy your new GPUs!\u201d you should probably know that Nvidia has its own spatial upscaler as well, dubbed Nvidia Image Scaling. It\u2019s apparently been buried in the Nvidia Control Panel for some time now, and today Nvidia is open-sourcing it on GitHub with its own SDK and support for every brand of GPU. Developers can natively integrate it into their games if they want, just like AMD\u2019s FSR.And, the company\u2019s baking Nvidia Image Scaling into its GeForce Experience app so you can turn it on for any game, and adjust an in-game sharpness slider (so you can see the difference) using Nvidia\u2019s overlay.Is it as good as Nvidia\u2019s DLSS? Not even close, and Nvidia\u2019s the first to admit it. In a briefing with The Verge, product manager Henry Lin hammered us with example after example of how DLSS (particularly the new DLSS 2.3, which suffers from less ghosting around moving objects) not only beats the pants off of Nvidia\u2019s own spatial upscaler, but sometimes performs better than a native image. Particularly when you\u2019re looking at thin objects with lots of edges that tend to flicker:The pictured communications dish is one place DLSS has an advantage. Image: NvidiaPersonally, I\u2019ve sworn by native resolution all the way \u2014 but Nvidia\u2019s ICAT made me curious enough to put it to the test. So I fired up Deathloop and Back 4 Blood, two games that offer both AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS, on a 4K screen at their highest quality modes.In Back 4 Blood, I felt vindicated. Every part of the image looked fuller, crisper, and higher resolution at native 4K, up to and including the roof-mounted antenna:You\u2019ll want to tap to zoom and/or download, this is a 4K image. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeThere were even parts of the scene where AMD FSR clearly beat Nvidia DLSS, like all of these wooden textures:Maybe Nvidia\u2019s neural network needs more experience with wood. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeBut when I tried out Deathloop, it was the opposite story: almost everywhere I looked, DLSS was resolving and preserving details I couldn\u2019t even see at native resolution, and with far, far less flicker from distant aliased objects.In Deathloop, the VW bus in the background looks decidedly less cartoony with DLSS, and you can see far more detail in distant textures.  Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The VergeNative 4K, blown up to show detail. GIF by Sean Hollister / The VergeDLSS Quality, at the same size. Less flicker, more detail. GIF by Sean Hollister / The VergeThat said, I still saw moments in Deathloop where DLSS does weird things, too. Scroll up to the top of this post for one example: you can see how DLSS totally changed the sparkly finish of the Strelak Verso pistols and muddies the texture of the dirt ground in the exact same scene as my other screenshots and GIFs.I\u2019m not a believer in DLSS quite yet, but I\u2019m intrigued. Nvidia\u2019s promise is that, with enough learning, games can actually look better and run faster than native with DLSS turned on. For now, it\u2019s something developers have to enable on a per-game basis, and not all games have the same version to offer, but that could change down the road. Nvidia\u2019s Lin tells me that Cyberpunk 2077 already features over-the-air DLSS updates \u2014 when you open the game, it can check with the Nvidia driver to see if there\u2019s a new version and hot swap it at launch.\u201cWherever you see DLSS not match native, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working on,\u201d says Lin.In the meanwhile, here\u2019s a new video from Nvidia showing what DLSS can look like at its best.Update, 12:34PM ET: Added Nvidia\u2019s video.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingReportTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to a new update to Lossless Scaling, Nvidia's Spatial Image Scaler can now be used on both Intel and AMD GPUs. This will allow gamers to play at lower resolutions to improve frame rates without sacrificing too much in the way of image quality.\u00a0Lossless Scaling is a third party application that allows anyone with any GPU to run image upscaling in their video games without the nasty side effect of blurring. Lossless Scaling uses integer scaling to accomplish this task.\u00a0However, Lossless Scaling has become much more than just an integer scaler; the application has recently introduced AMD FSR to its feature set, and is now adding Nvidia's image scaler as well. This means you can try multiple upscaling techniques directly from one application on a GPU.Nvidia's image scaler has been around for a few years already, but it received a big update in the latest GeForce Game Ready driver. The scaler now features a 6-tap filter with four directional scaling and updated scaling and sharpening algorithms. This means the scaler can reduce the negative effects of image upscaling like staircase effects and artifacting even more so than it used to.Nvidia also announced an SDK for its image scaler, allowing any developer to implement the image upscale in their game or app.According to Nvidia's testing, its new updated image scaler is effectively on par with AMD's own FSR technology. In the test image below, you can see the loss in detail between FSR ultra quality mode, and the highest resolution of Nvidia's Image Scaler is effectively equal.For a high-resolution image click here.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia - GeForce.com)Lossless Scaling is available right now on Steam with the Nvidia upscaler.

NVIDIA has had an image sharpening feature in the driver set for years now. At some point (or maybe it was added at the same time), it also included a non-DLSS upscaler. If you have an AMD GPU, AMD has their own upscaler in the driver utilities.\n\nSo I'm not even sure why this app exists unless there's some restriction on the driver based upscalers that I'm missing. Or why driver based upscalers aren't just using FSR or whatever by default.\n\npierrebai said:In the high-res image, the DLSS 4K scaling is cleaner than native 4K, which seems quite a bit suspicious?DLSS in some cases can produce results that may look better than the native 4K resolution:\ngpzFX4P1Jow:683\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrluker5\n\n\npierrebai said:In the high-res image, the DLSS 4K scaling is cleaner than native 4K, which seems quite a bit suspicious?Only parts look cleaner.

But now I'm supposed to believe that DLSS took an even lower res version of that picture, which squished the text down to even more poo, and then AI magicky upscaled it to have even cleaner text than the native image???\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlacksad999\n\n\nVforV said:I really, really don't think nvidia did this from the \"goodness\" of their hearts.... ;)\n\nThanks AMD for FSR, making it open for everyone.

The result is a high-definition solution that enables crowdsourced maps for robust autonomous vehicle mapping and localization.\nMapping is a fundamental pillar for self-driving, serving as the collective memory of AVs. HD maps provide a baseline understanding of the driving environment and are continuously updated as the car drives. NVIDIA recently acquired leading mapping company DeepMap \u2014 together, these teams are accelerating, improving and extending high-performance mapping solutions worldwide.\nThese maps must be accurate within centimeters and reflect current road conditions, such as a work zone or a lane closure, and efficiently scale across AV fleets, with fast processing and minimal data storage. They must also be able to function worldwide.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Mapping enables both AV fleets and individual vehicles to build and update maps in real time, creating a scalable solution for autonomous driving around the world.\nA Continuous Cycle\nDRIVE Mapping is built to be safe, scaleable and fresh.\nThe system leverages perception results from vehicles running NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion 8, which includes the compute, sensors and software necessary for production autonomous vehicles. And, it covers a vehicle\u2019s entire drive to support door-to-door autonomy at scale.\nDRIVE Mapping includes both camera and radar localization layers in every region that is mapped for AI-assisted driving capabilities. Radar provides a layer of redundancy for localizing and driving in poor weather and lighting conditions where cameras may be blinded. To improve reliability and accuracy, the mapping networks are trained on ground-truth maps.\nDRIVE Mapping DNN creation process using ground-truth maps\nDRIVE Hyperion sensor data is fed into the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX AI compute platform inside the vehicle. Mapping networks use this data for perception, identifying intersection details, traffic lights, parking spots, and road and lane boundaries, and then determining safe driveable paths. These networks operate in a broad range of environments, lighting conditions, weather and geographies.\nAs a crowdsourced platform, DRIVE Mapping coverage grows along with the number of automakers that use NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion. These automakers are on track to have fleets of vehicles distributed throughout the world, starting in 2024, and will continue to grow.\nDRIVE Mapping leverages NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD infrastructure to maintain these maps at a global scale. These AI systems ingest terabytes of perception data from the DRIVE Hyperion vehicles to create and update maps.\nThe broad base of DRIVE Hyperion vehicles on the road, combined with robust perception, allows vehicles to detect road changes and keep maps fresh.\nDeveloping with DeepMap\nBy leveraging the longstanding mapping expertise of DeepMap, which NVIDIA acquired earlier this year, DRIVE Mapping can scale worldwide, bringing safer, more efficient autonomous transportation to more roads.\nEquipped with this extensive experience, NVIDIA is developing a dedicated fleet to build survey maps of the most populated areas of the world. These maps will prime future generations of AVs for real-time map creation.\nWith DRIVE Mapping, autonomous vehicles won\u2019t just see the 3D world, but build it for continuous development and improvement.\nCatch up on the full GTC keynote:\n\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: GTC 2021 | NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He never imagined he\u2019d wind up in a concert hall in Bonn listening to the premier of Beethoven\u2019s Tenth, a symphony he helped finish with AI.\n\u201cAs a boy in Alexandria, I had a passion for art, but I was good at math. When it came time to pick a major in college, people said if I chose a career in art I\u2019d have no money, so I went into computer science,\u201d said Elgammal, now a professor at Rutgers and head of its Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\u201cI never gave up my passion for art,\u201d he said, noting his two-year-old startup, Playform, has already helped 25,000 visual artists wade into deep learning.\nGetting a Classical Call\nAbout 15 years into his work in computer vision, Elgammal founded the Rutgers lab at the nexus of AI and art.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to work on some amazing research over the last 10 years doing what I really like \u2014 working with art historians, artists and musicians,\u201d he said.\nHearing of Elgammal\u2019s work, the director of a music technology institute in Salzburg asked him in early 2019 to help complete two movements of Beethoven\u2019s Tenth, also known as his Unfinished Symphony, for a celebration of the composer\u2019s 250th birthday.\nAI Hears a Symphony\nThe challenge was enormous. The composer had only sketched out a few brief themes for the work before he died in 1827.\nFor more than two years, Elgammal worked with musicologists and composers, taking AI in new directions.\nUltimately, machine learning would add harmony to Beethoven\u2019s themes, develop them as the composer would have, bridge one theme to the next, and then help orchestrate the work, assigning parts to different instruments.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard all this done before. Some AIs had helped create a few minutes of a string quartet but not a full symphony,\u201d he said.\nLanguage Models Help Beethoven Sing\nGiven the sequential nature of music, the team adapted transformer models used for natural-language processing.\nUltimately, they created four neural networks. Two models used in language translation proved best for adding harmony and orchestration, another transformer served to develop themes and a BERT model helped bridge between themes.\nSince music can be represented as mathematical symbols, the lab\u2019s servers, outfitted with a range of NVIDIA GPUs including a TITAN RTX, could easily handle the task.\n\u201cTo watch AI learn from a genius like Beethoven was an amazing experience,\u201d said Elgammal, whose training data included many hours of music from the German master.\nDoubters and Devotees\nThe work was released and premiered on Oct. 9 by the Bonn Beethoven Orchestra in the composer\u2019s hometown. (You can hear a recording online.)\n\u201cAfter listening to this music for two years on my laptop, it was amazing to be in the event and hear it played live,\u201d he said.\nElgammal attended the premier and visited Beethoven\u2019s home in Bonn.\nResponses spanned the spectrum. Skeptics disliked the mix of art and technology, others felt inspired.\n\u201cSome were very enthusiastic with tears in their eyes and goosebumps, and one friend listened to it the whole day, over and over,\u201d he recalled.\nTaking Music AI Mainstream\nWhatever the response, it was a historic moment in what Elgammal calls computational creativity.\n\u201cWe imagine in the future we could offer various tools. We worked in classical music, but this could also be relevant to today\u2019s music,\u201d he said.\nEarly in its work, the team rendered one of Beethoven\u2019s themes in a pop style, just for fun.\nLending Artists a GAN\nMuch of Elgammal\u2019s work these days is in visual arts. His startup Playform makes the generative adversarial networks (GANs) used in computer vision available as tools for a painter\u2019s palette.\nPlayform uses data augmentation so artists can train their own AI models with as few as 30 images rather than the tens of thousands that GANs typically require. The service runs on NVIDIA GPUs in a public cloud service.\n\u201cArtists don\u2019t want to use pretrained models, they want their art to be unique, so they won\u2019t use someone else\u2019s GAN model,\u201d he said.\nPlans for an Encore\nSome artists use Playform to brainstorm, exploring new concepts that inspire what they paint by hand. Others use AI as an assistant, creating digital assets they incorporate in their work.\n\u201cWe\u2019re adding capabilities like synchronizing music and art for events and AI models trained to make music videos,\u201d he said.\nThe next Beethoven might start a symphony with a digital flourish.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Creators | Customer Stories | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | TITAN \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Nearly nine months ago, Nvidia said it would launch its most affordable RTX 3000 graphics card yet \u2014 the $329 RTX 3060. Good luck actually finding one at that price, right? That\u2019s why I subtitled my review \u201c$329 with an asterisk sign.\u201d And sure enough, they were nigh-impossible to find on launch day for Nvidia\u2019s sticker price.But that same day, February 25th, I signed up for EVGA\u2019s graphics card waiting queue on a whim. And after waiting in that queue for so long that I completely forgot I ever signed up, I got a surprise. On Monday, I received an email from EVGA letting me know I could actually purchase that $329 card for $329.So I did. Yesterday afternoon, a brand-new RTX 3060 arrived for $379.41 after tax and shipping. That\u2019s a card that\u2019s generally selling for north of $700 on eBay.Queues workThe queue worked! It remembered me, and it gave me what I wanted once it was ready. I never needed to wake up early and smash browser refresh buttons, never needed to throw down with scalpers, never needed to pre-fill my credit card information into half a dozen websites, never needed to pay an exorbitant finder\u2019s fee. I just had to register an account and try EVGA\u2019s two-step verification a few times (the website choked for me at first), and then I had 20 full hours to complete my purchase.We called out the industry in late 2020 for failing to let us simply sign up to buy products when they\u2019re ready to ship, the way Apple, Samsung, and others have done. But there\u2019s been little movement since. While Sony did finally introduce a way to register your interest in buying a PS5 last month, and Valve did introduce a first-come-first-served reservation system alongside its (now-delayed) Steam Deck handheld, most people who simply want to buy a new console or a new PC graphics card are at the mercy of the internet feeding frenzy.RelatedWhy the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5How has a tiny company like EVGA, best known as one of Nvidia\u2019s board partners, figured out what almost every other company hasn\u2019t? Well, it\u2019s not quite that simple.For one thing, as we pointed out in that late 2020 story, there are some perverse incentives that may keep companies from fixing the mess. Scarcity isn\u2019t always a bad thing for retailers since it drives word-of-mouth, and some people may give up on the thing they came to buy and buy something else instead. (Big-box retailers also love the frenzy of in-person Black Friday shopping sprees, for that matter, even though people can get hurt and even killed in a stampede. At least that\u2019s not a concern here.) But EVGA wins when you can buy a graphics card, and all of its new cards are in high demand.But also, EVGA isn\u2019t actually satisfied that it\u2019s figured out the queue quite yet. If you want to follow my lead and join the queue, you actually can\u2019t \u2014 the company shut down its queues about a month ago after feedback that it still wasn\u2019t quite fair. The company\u2019s tweaked its queue system a few times now, but there are still concerns that, for instance, some users were able to purchase multiple cards instead of just one for personal use.\u201cThis new queue may have some new rules and requirements\u201d\u201cAfter taking much feedback, we are working on a new version for [the] future with improvements to speed up queue fulfillment and fairness. This new queue may have some new rules and requirements, so for the time being, we have closed the existing queue for new signups as we continue to fulfill those in line, and plan to have more announcements in the near future,\u201d EVGA tells The Verge.Hopefully, EVGA can share its learnings with some other companies, too, because we\u2019re not liking the way the industry is pointed now: it feels like retailers themselves are starting to become the scalpers, in a sense. Walmart and Best Buy offer paid memberships, in addition to Amazon\u2019s Prime, that just so happen to let you into their member-exclusive sales \u2014 many of which are for in-demand tech, like consoles. They\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not the primary purpose of these services, but for now, it seems like retailers are capitalizing on the scarcity of this gaming hardware with an upcharge instead of committing to making the lines work for everyone else.That means you may have to wait twice: once for companies like EVGA to create the line and then again in the line to actually get your new console or GPU.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsPC GamingReportTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

But with minimum refresh rates of 90 Hz, razor-thin latency tolerances, and headset rendering resolutions at 4K or higher, VR is one of the most demanding PC applications and requires the best GPUs.\u00a0\nWith a GeForce RTX graphics card or laptop you can experience virtual reality the way it was intended, at the highest resolutions, with the highest graphics settings, and smooth frame rates. You\u2019ll have access to RTX technology that\u2019s not available on any other platform. And now, with Oculus Air Link (currently in beta), you can enjoy the fidelity of GeForce RTX-powered VR with the mobility and portability of an untethered headset.\nIn this article, we show you how to set up Oculus Air Link with a GeForce RTX laptop, and how to take advantage of all of the amazing developments in VR running on GeForce RTX.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate VR Mobility with GeForce RTX Laptops and Oculus Air Link\nPreviously, PC-powered headsets could only be used while tethered. That is, with a cable that transmits the frames from the PC to be displayed on the headset. Standalone headsets like the Oculus Quest removed this limitation, giving users more freedom of movement and portability, but at the cost of reduced visual fidelity because everything was rendered inside the headset on a mobile-class processor. Now, with Oculus Air Link, it\u2019s possible to play games rendered by a PC GPU without the tether. And when paired with a GeForce RTX laptop, VR gamers can enjoy the ultimate platform: the fidelity of PC-powered VR, with the mobility and portability of an untethered headset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyst on Oculus Quest 2 in standalone mode versus Myst on Oculus Quest 2 powered by a GeForce RTX PC. The graphical enhancements made possible by the PC version can be observed in the detail on the rocks, grass, and bricks in the scene. GPU is GeForce RTX 3080.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Oculus Air Link\nTo get the ultimate VR experience, you\u2019ll need three things:\n\nAn Oculus Quest 2 VR headset\nA low-latency gaming router\nA GeForce RTX 30 Series laptop\n\nBased on the recommendations from Oculus and our internal testing, we suggest a 5-GHz AC or AX router, and that the laptop be connected directly to the router via ethernet. In our experience, a direct connection improves visual quality and reduces artifacts, though it generally works well even over wireless, especially with a high-quality gaming router that supports WiFi 6. We further recommend that the laptop be plugged in and that the router be located in the same room as the headset.\nOnce you have your hardware in place, you\u2019ll need to do a few things:\n\nDownload and install the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver on your laptop\nInstall/update the Oculus PC app\nEnable Air Link on the PC and on the Quest headset\nPair your headset and PC\n\nThese instructions assume that you have already set up your headset in standalone mode. If not, please go back and do that now with the instructions that came with the headset.\nInstalling/updating the Oculus PC App: The Oculus App makes it possible to stream games from your PC to your Oculus Quest headset. Download the Oculus App here.\nAfter the application has finished installing, it will walk you through the setup. First, select your headset (note that Oculus Air Link is only officially supported for Oculus Quest 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, select the method that you would like to use to connect to your headset. Select Air Link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you will be prompted to put on your headset. Read this next section before you do so, as once you put the headset on it becomes difficult to see your computer screen.\u00a0\nWhen you put on your headset you will find yourself in your Oculus Home Environment. You should see your Oculus menu. If not, press the Oculus button, which is the concave button with the Oculus logo on the right controller below the thumbstick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBring up the settings menu by first launching the quick settings menu, and then clicking the gear icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the settings menu, go to the Experimental Features section. Click the toggle for Air Link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Air Link should appear as an option in your quick settings menu. Click on Air Link to connect to your PC. You will be asked to confirm the pairing by verifying that the numeric code you are presented on your PC matches a numeric code in your headset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your headset and PC are paired, click on Air Link from the quick settings menu to launch Air Link. This will launch the Oculus App on your desktop (if it\u2019s not already open), and in your headset will bring you to the Oculus PC home environment and the menu that incorporates the Oculus PC store and various other capabilities. From here you can purchase and launch Oculus PC content, or you can launch VR games from Steam.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo launch a game from Steam, click on the desktop icon from the Oculus control bar, which will bring up your PC desktop from within VR. From here you can launch the Steam desktop app, navigate to your library, and then launch the game. Launching a Steam game in VR mode will also launch the SteamVR runtime, which acts as a bridge between your headset and the SteamVR API.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019ve previously run the game, the Oculus PC environment provides a quick link to it on the left side of the launcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOculus Air Link enables you to play PC VR titles like Half-Life:Alyx, untethered on the Oculus Quest 2\nHalf-Life: Alyx \u00a9 Valve Corporation.\u00a0 All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay at the Highest Resolutions and Quality Levels with NVIDIA DLSS\nIn addition to more graphics horsepower, NVIDIA has developed new technologies to further increase the performance and graphical fidelity of gaming experiences.\nThere are three interrelated rendering challenges that impact the immersiveness of VR: frame rate, render resolution, and graphics settings. If the frame rate drops below the refresh rate of the VR headset it results in reprojection artifacts, which can appear as hitching or \u201cswimming\u201d of the scene. If the application render resolution is too low, the scene appears blurry, as if viewed through a fogged window. And if the graphics settings are too low, you just don\u2019t get to experience the full depth of the content as the developer intended.\nFor GeForce RTX users, there\u2019s a technology that allows VR gamers to enjoy faster performance and better image quality: NVIDIA DLSS. This AI-powered technology is made possible by the Tensor Cores found exclusively on GeForce RTX GPUs. In VR, it enables a game to be rendered at a lower resolution, boosting framerates, while producing visual quality and clarity that appears as though it was rendered at a much higher resolution.\nThis gives the user more freedom to crank up the graphics settings while still maintaining 90 FPS, for smooth VR gameplay. For VR, NVIDIA DLSS delivers a clearer image, with better in-game settings, all while avoiding reprojection artifacts. Eight VR titles, including No Man\u2019s Sky, Myst, and Legendary Tales join the growing list of games and applications that have adopted NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyst VR with DLSS Off (left) versus DLSS On (right). In order to maintain 90 FPS (and thus avoid reprojection artifacts and dropped frames) with DLSS Off the render resolution is set to 3248 x 1648 (1632 x 1648 per eye), resulting in significant loss of detail (note the foliage and the rigging on the ship). With DLSS Quality, a render resolution of 4864 x 2448 can be maintained. GPU is GeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Man\u2019s Sky with DLSS Off (left) versus DLSS On (right). In order to maintain 90 FPS at the Ultra graphics preset, with DLSS Off the render resolution is set to 2432 x 1216, resulting in significant loss of detail. With DLSS Performance, a render resolution of 3712 x 1872 can be maintained. GPU is GeForce RTX 3070.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Ray Tracing Comes To VR\nReal-time ray tracing adds a level of realism to games that cannot be achieved by any other method. By simulating the physics of light, ray tracing produces realistic reflections and shadows that behave the way they would in the real world.\u00a0\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs include RT Cores, specifically designed for accelerating ray tracing operations. And now, combined with NVIDIA DLSS, RT Cores make it possible to run ray tracing in real-time for VR applications, as in Helios VR and Wrench VR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrench VR uses RT and DLSS to enable realistic shadows and reflections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ultimate Portable VR Experience\nWith GeForce RTX laptops and Oculus Air Link, gamers can now enjoy the ultimate, portable VR experience, with high resolutions, fast frame rates, cutting edge graphics tech, and complete mobility.

We've even heard rumors that a Nintendo Switch Pro powered by a Lovelace GPU could be in the works.Of course, that's quite all quite a ways away, and that means we should take everything we've heard about Lovelace with generous skepticism. The ongoing chip shortage and the vagaries of Nvidia's product roadmap could easily lead to significant delays and changes.While we wait for the next generation from Nvidia, the top GPUs just fell below MSRP \u2014 should you buy now?\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI was hyped for Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5050 \u2014 until I saw these leaked specs\n\n\n\n\nHuge Asus ROG gaming laptop leak just revealed Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs and Intel 'Arrow Lake-HX' CPUs\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 3080 vs. AMD Radeon 6800 XT: Which GPU is for you?The\u00a0best gaming PCs\u00a0to buy nowPlus: Dell just canceled Alienware gaming PC orders in six US statesStill, what we've heard so far paints an exciting picture of where Nvidia's GPU business is headed. Given the remarkable performance and popularity of current Nvidia cards like the GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce RTX 3080, the prospect of a new set of Lovelace-powered cards (presumably with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 series branding) arriving in 2022 or 2023 should give PC gaming fans a lot to get excited about.\u00a0Let's just hope that when they do arrive, they're a bit easier to get ahold of than the current crop of Nvidia cards.Nvidia Lovelace rumored specsAs of July 2021, the latest and most credible leaks (from regular leakers @greymon55 and @kopite7kimi) about Nvidia's Lovelace GPU claim it will be manufactured by TSMC on a 5-nanometer node, or perhaps even a more performant version branded N5P (N5 Performance). Either way, a 5nm process should produce more efficient cards than the 8nm node process used for the GeForce 3070, 3080, and 3090 cards.If you're interested in raw numbers, the latest leaks claim that the flagship card in a Lovelace-powered GeForce 4000-series will have 144 streaming multiprocessors (the GeForce RTX 3090 has 82) and a maximum of 18,432 CUDA cores.\u00a0Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.If you're not familiar with CUDA cores, they're basically parallel data processing units within an Nvidia GPU that work similarly to the way the CPU works in your PC. In general, the more CUDA cores a GPU has, the more quickly it can work through complex data. Thus, it's pretty significant that an Nvidia GPU built on Lovelace could have over 18,000 Cuda cores, as that's nearly twice as many as the 10,496 you'll find on the beastly RTX 3090. Of course, the RTX 3090 is built on the Ampere architecture, so the two CUDA core counts aren't directly comparable.Leaker Greymon55 has also repeatedly floated the idea that Nvidia GPUs built on Lovelace will require significantly more power than the GeForce 3000-series GPUs they're replacing, as much as double in some cases. That's potentially a big deal because the GeForce RTX 3090 already draws between 300 and 400 watts, meaning if you put it into a beefy system you'll probably want at a power supply unit that delivers at least 850W, or more if you're using really power-hungry components like an AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU. If the GeForce 4000-series cards really do require twice as much power, we could be looking at a future where 1,000 - 1,800 watt power supplies are what you'll need to build truly performant PCs.Nvidia Lovelace release date leaksAs mentioned earlier, the current volatility of the GPU market is good reason to take all rumored release windows for the next generation of Nvidia cards with a big grain of salt.\u00a0That said, @greymon55 has so far claimed that Lovelace cards will debut \"no earlier than the end of 2022,\" which makes sense for multiple reasons. First and foremost, that gives Nvidia and TSMC plenty of time to spin up production, and we've heard reliable reports that TSMC and Nvidia rival AMD have already validated a 5nm process for producing desktop chip products.Also, Nvidia has often gone two years between releasing major GPU lines, so the fact that the high-end GeForce 3000-series cards debuted in late 2020 (with a revamped line of 3000-series Ti cards launching in 2021) means a late 2022 launch for a GeForce 4000-series would fit right into Nvidia's playbook.Nvidia Lovelace price speculationWe haven't heard any credible leaks or rumors about how Nvidia will price its next generation of GPUs yet, but we can make some educated guesses based on how the company has priced prior generations.\u00a0Typically the company launches a new GeForce line with a few high-end cards up front, with prices ranging from $500 to $1,500. In September of 2020, for example, it announced that its high-end GeForce RTX 3090 would cost $1,500. The RTX 3080 was initially sold for $699, and the mid-range RTX 3070 was priced at $499.Those prices were roughly in line with the pricing for the prior generation (RTX 2070-2090), so it's a safe bet that Nvidia will be trying to hit similar pricing with a GeForce RTX 4000-series of cards.\u00a0However, we really don't know what impact the current chip shortage and GPU market volatility will have on the final pricing of a new series of GeForce cards. All of the GeForce 3000-series cards are now selling (often second-hand) for much higher prices than they were initially offered at, and there's no reason to expect things will return to normal by the end of 2022. Plus, Nvidia may always choose to justify a price hike by pointing to the increased power and efficiency Lovelace is rumored to deliver.\u00a0Nvidia Lovelace outlookDespite the remarkable instability of the GPU market, it's a safe bet that Nvidia is working on a successor to its hyper-popular GeForce 3000-series cards, and right now all indicators point to those cards being powered by Lovelace.\u00a0If the leaks we've heard about how beefy those cards prove true, Lovelace could help Nvidia go toe-to-toe with rival AMD, who is also rumored to be debuting a series of next-gen 5nm GPUs in late 2022 using its own RDNA 3 architecture.\u00a0And of course, we can't completely discount the leaks we've heard that a scaled-down Lovelace chip will show up in the long-rumored Nintendo Switch Pro. Sure, after launching the Switch OLED Nintendo has officially stated it has \u201cno plans for launching any other [Switch] model at this time,\u201d but those plans may change by the end of 2022.Today's best Monitor deals - stock checked every 30 minutes: $9.99 $5.99ViewIBM Genuine Lenovo Thinkcentre M70e...IBM Genuine Lenovo Thinkcentre M70e Internal Computer Speaker 8Ohm 1W 54Y8252 $32.99 $19.95ViewJUN-ELECTRON for Raspberry Pi 4 Touch...JUN-ELECTRON for Raspberry Pi 4 Touch Screen with Case, 3.5 inch Touchscreen with Fan, 320x480 Monitor TFT LCD Game Display $26.99 $19.99ViewAmazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable...Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port - Cloud Blue $26.99ViewEcho Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand...Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port | Charcoal $26.99ViewAmazon - Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen)...Amazon - Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) Adjustable Stand with USB-C Charging Port (Echo Show not included - Accessory Stand Only) - Charcoal $149.99View27\" SB0 Essential Monitor - SB270 G0BIShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nAlex WawroSocial Links NavigationSenior Editor ComputingAlex Wawro is a lifelong tech and games enthusiast with more than a decade of experience covering both for outlets like Game Developer, Black Hat, and PC World magazine.

With its new upscaling algorithm, though, it is a lot like AMD\u2019s rival FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR): a spatial upscaler that applies an adjustable sharpening filter in the same pass. It still involves rendering games at a lower-than-native resolution to improve performance, then upscaling the image until it looks more or less like it\u2019s running at native.\r\n\n\n\n\nBattlefield 2042 Gameplay with NVIDIA Reflex and DLSS\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\r\nThe biggest adverse differences between Image Scaling an DLSS as that the former doesn\u2019t include its own anti-aliasing, instead upscaling the image using whatever AA was built into the game, and that it doesn\u2019t get smarter about applying its effects over time. However, unlike DLSS \u2013 and indeed, FSR \u2013 Image Scaling works on any game, not just those the developers have added support for. You don\u2019t even need one of the best graphics cards with all the RTX gubbins \u2013 any Nvidia GPU from the Maxwell family onwards (GTX 745 or better, basically) will work. Download the Gamer Ready 496.70 driver (out today), and you can enable it as a global or per-game setting in Nvidia Control Panel.\r\n\n\r\nICAT, or Image Comparison and Analysis Tool, is also free to download from Nvidia. Y\u2019know those sliding screenshot comparison widgets you see on sites with bigger production budgets than RPS? You can now have something just like that on your very own PC. I love it, and heartily recommend installing it if you want to test out different graphics settings yourself, but is Image Scaling also worth using? Let\u2019s find out, with a little help from ICAT.\r\n\n\r\nFirst off, it\u2019s worth noting that Image Scaling is designed specifically to help produce more frames per second at higher resolutions like 1440p and 4K. At 1080p, your native resolution isn\u2019t really putting enough strain on the GPU for any kind of upscaling to be worthwhile. I therefore tested Image Scaling by setting in-game resolutions to 1440p and letting the Nvidia tech automatically upscale the image to my monitor\u2019s native 4K (another difference to DLSS and FSR: those are best used when leaving resolution settings at native res). \r\n\n\r\nIn every game I tested, I ended getting identical or only very slightly lower performance to when using native 1440p with Image Scaling off \u2013 so significantly more frames than using native 4K. The particular settings I was using are apparently close to how FSR works on its second-highest \u2018Quality\u2019 setting, but Image Scaling outpaced both that and \u2018Balanced\u2019-quality DLSS in Deathloop as well.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\n\r\nEssentially, if you want maximum smoothness but aren\u2019t willing to drop resolution, there\u2019s already a good argument in Image Scaling\u2019s favour. In terms of fidelity, Image Scaling also turned out more competitive than I expected, especially in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. DLSS\u2019s built-in anti-aliasing looks better than upscaled TAA, but you can see in the comparison below \u2013 snapped in ICAT \u2013 that there\u2019s no less visible detail in Lara\u2019s clothing or hair, so textures aren\u2019t getting smushed by the more basic algorithm.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: Native 4K. Right: 1440p (Image Scaling to 4K, 67% sharpness).\n\n\r\nThere were even some environmental details where Image Scaling\u2019s integrated sharpening (I had this set to 67% at Nvidia\u2019s recommendation, you can change it freely) made it appear even more detailed than DLSS, like on these ancient stairs. Overall sharpness and motion handling remain better on DLSS, but given its strength lies in its ability to maintain fine details through the upscaling process, you\u2019d think it would beat Image Scaling more comprehensively.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: 4K (DLSS on). Right: 1440p (Image Scaling to 4K, 67% sharpness).\n\n\r\nImage Scaling also stood up well to native 4K in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. Not better, but close enough that I\u2019d gladly take an extra 22fps for it. It\u2019s certainly a lot closer to native 4K than how the game looks at 1440p, which remember, is the resolution it was actually rendering at before upscaling\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: Native 1440p. Right: 1440p (Image Scaling to 4K, 67% sharpness).\n\n\r\nAt this point it\u2019s safe to say that if the game you\u2019re playing supports neither DLSS nor FSR, Nvidia Image Scaling is at least worth trying out. But what if it supports both? In Deathloop, DLSS proved the upscaling tech to beat \u2013 besides smoothing out jagged edges more effectively than Image Scaling, it demonstrated a drawback of the latter\u2019s reliance on a sharpening filter. While this can help deal with the blurriness that arises from spatial upscaling, sharpening can also make object edges look overly dark, or give surfaces an odd grainy look. In Deathloop, the effect isn\u2019t ruinous, but certain details do look more naturalistic with DLSS. This Balanced DLSS as well, so the difference would be even starker when using the superior \u2018Quality\u2019 setting.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: 4K (Balanced DLSS). Right: 1440p (Image Scaling to 4K, 67% sharpness).\n\n\r\nAgainst FSR, Image Scaling has more of a fair fight, though I personally slightly prefer AMD\u2019s tech here. Again, Image Scaling seems to have an anti-aliasing disadvantage, and while some very distant details are easier to make out with Image Scaling, the extra jaggies are a considerably trade-off.\r\n\n\n\n \nLeft: 4K (Quality FSR). Right: 1440p (Image Scaling to 4K, 67% sharpness).\n\n\r\nUltimately, I reckon that if you have an RTX 20 series graphics card or newer, you\u2019re best off sticking with DLSS whenever it\u2019s available. You can actually have both DLSS and Image Scaling\u2019s sharpening component active at the same time, though I tried this in Deathloop and wasn\u2019t a fan of the added filter; with some exceptions, like those Tomb Raider stairs, DLSS is sharp enough as it is.\r\n\nI don\u2019t think this is going to kill off FSR either, though it will provide AMD\u2019s upscaler with some healthy competition (at least for Nvidia card owners; for AMD Radeon fans, FSR remains the only option). If the sharpening filter looks too strong, you can always tone it down as well \u2013 there are sliders both in Nvidia Control Panel and in GeForce Experience.\n\r\nI should also note the one and only technical hiccup I encountered while testing Image Scaling. The optional \u2018NIS\u2019 overlay, which can sit in the screen corner in-game and is colour-coded to show whether upscaling or just the sharpening filter is in effect, didn\u2019t appear in Forza Horizon 5. The effects themselves worked, I just didn\u2019t get the overlay to confirm. \r\n\n\r\nDon\u2019t be afraid of trying it out, mind. A game-agnostic upscaler was an admirably ambitious idea in 2019, and with this update to Image Scaling, Nvidia has produced something broadly as good as FSR \u2013 and definitely as capable of boosting your frame rate in a pinch.\nUpdate: our guide on how to use Nvidia Image Scaling will walk you through setting it up!\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

Welcome to a positively packed GFN Thursday.\nThis week delivers a sweet deal for gamers ready to upgrade their PC gaming from the cloud. With any new, paid six-month Priority or GeForce NOW RTX 3080 subscription, members will receive Crysis Remastered for free for a limited time.\nGamers and music lovers alike can get hyped for an awesome entertainment experience playing Core this week and visiting the digital world of Oberhasli. There, they\u2019ll enjoy the anticipated deadmau5 \u201cEncore\u201d concert and event.\nAnd what kind of GFN Thursday would it be without new games? We\u2019ve got eight new titles joining the GeForce NOW library this week.\nGeForce NOW Can Run Crysis \u2026 And So Can You\nWhen your reflection looks this good, you can\u2019t help but stop and admire it. We won\u2019t judge.\nBut can it run Crysis? GeForce NOW sure can.\nFor a limited time, get a copy of Crysis Remastered free with select GeForce NOW memberships. Purchase a six-month Priority membership, or the new GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership, and get a free redeemable code for Crysis Remastered on the Epic Games Store.\nCurrent monthly Founders and Priority members are eligible by upgrading to a six-month membership. Founders, exclusively, can upgrade to a GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership and receive 10 percent off the subscription price and no risk to their current Founders benefits. They can revert back to their original Founders plan and retain \u201cFounders for Life\u201d pricing, as long as they remain in consistent good standing on any paid membership plan.\nThis special bonus also applies to existing GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members and preorders, as a thank you for being among the first to upgrade to the next generation in cloud gaming. Current members on the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 plan will receive game codes in the days ahead; while members who have preordered but haven\u2019t been activated yet, will receive their game code when their GeForce NOW RTX 3080 service is activated. Please note, terms and conditions apply.\nStream Crytek\u2019s classic first-person shooter, remastered with graphics optimized for a new generation of hardware and complete with stunning support for RTX ON and DLSS. GeForce NOW members can experience the first game in the Crysis series \u2014 or 1,000+ more games \u2014 across nearly all of their devices, turning even a Mac or a mobile device into the ultimate gaming rig.\nThe mission starts here.\nExperience the deadmau5 Encore in Core\n\nThis GFN Thursday brings Core and deadmau5 to the cloud. From shooters, survival and action adventure to MMORPGs, platformers and party games, Core is a multiverse of exciting gaming entertainment with over 40,000 free-to-play, Unreal-powered games and worlds.\nThis week, members can visit the fully immersive digital world of Oberhasli \u2014 designed with the vision of the legendary producer, musician and DJ, deadmau5 \u2014 and enjoy an epic \u201cEncore\u201d concert and event. Catch the deadmau5 performance, with six showings running from Friday, Nov. 19, to Saturday, Nov. 20. The concert becomes available every hour, on the hour, the following week.\nTomorrow, come to the world of Oberhasli, designed by deadmau5, and experience the \u2018Encore\u2019 concert in Core.\nThe fun continues with three games inspired by deadmau5\u2019s music \u2014 Hop \u2018Til You Drop, Mau5 Hau5 and Ballon Royale \u2014 set throughout 19 dystopian worlds featured in the official When The Summer Dies music video. Party on with exclusive deadmau5 skins, emotes and mounts, and interact with other fans while streaming the exclusive, interactive and must-experience deadmau5 performance celebrating the launch of Core on GeForce NOW with the \u201cEncore\u201d concert this week.\nA New Challenge Calls\nExplore a savage alien wilderness in the aftermath of terraforming gone wrong \u2014 even on a low-powered laptop.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be GFN Thursday without a new set of games coming to the cloud.

Technology is changing the world more quickly than ever. And NVIDIA GTC brings together many of the people who are working to accelerate it.\nThe biggest highlight is NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s agenda-setting keynote on Tuesday, Nov. 9 at 9 a.m. Central Europe Time.\nHuang will describe how the company is advancing AI for a variety of industries.\nHe\u2019ll reveal the latest technology for enterprise and data center AI, conversational AI and natural-language processing, and AI at the edge in everything from robotics to healthcare to autonomous vehicles.\nHe\u2019ll also explore new applications for virtual worlds and how NVIDIA is working with partners to build digital twins of factories, cities and entire regions.\n\nThe keynote anchors a conference with more than 500 curated sessions \u2014 available live with a Q&A or on-demand \u2014 covering just about every innovation that benefits from moving faster.\nIndustry leaders will touch on the most significant challenges of our time, from climate change, cybersecurity and supply chain issues to helping enterprises create more helpful AI services to fueling drug discovery.\nHeadline-grabbing speakers include Epic Games CEO and founder Tim Sweeney, Open AI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, Stanford Professor and deep learning pioneer Fei-Fei Li, VMware CTO Kit Colbert, and Walmart Director of Personalization and Recommendations Kannan Achan, and many more.\nThere will be sessions focused on 13 different industries, ranging from energy and retail to manufacturing, finance and healthcare.\nAnd the free, virtual conference is a better experience than ever, with simple one-step registration, an integrated high-definition video player, playlists with meaningful content and a more visual experience.\nWe\u2019ve packed GTC with interactive events. They include training sessions with our Deep Learning Institute, our AI Art Gallery and networking options for a growing array of communities.\nBraindates will help attendees find and meet others who share their interests. The intimate one-on-one or group chats connect those interested in a broad range of topics for video calls throughout the event.\nAnd the conference\u2019s moderated Q&A capability lets attendees post live questions to moderators and speakers, giving them more opportunities to interact with industry leaders than ever.\nEverything at next week\u2019s GTC \u2014 from dazzling demos to hands-on training to insights from industry leaders \u2014 is designed to help participants move faster.\nSo get a move on. GTC registration is free and open to all. And there\u2019s no need to register for GTC to watch the keynote.\nWhere to Watch\nMark the date \u2014 Nov. 9 at\u00a0 9 a.m. Central Europe Time, with a rebroadcast at 8 am Pacific Time \u2014 on your calendar.

What is somewhat unexpected, however, is how different the perspectives on the topic are already proving to be. \nAt Microsoft's Ignite conference this week and as part of a news build-up towards next week's Nvidia GTC conference, both companies showed a more practical and business-oriented approach to the metaverse than the consumer-focused version that Mark Zuckerberg and team presented.\nWhile the Meta version of the metaverse focused on things like being able to take the digital skins purchased in one game environment into another, both Microsoft and Nvidia focused on team collaboration and business-to-business communication.\nThere are many other dissimilarities between the different metaverse perspectives. These differences speak to the intent of the different organizations, the means by which they intend to go to market, and more. Microsoft, for example, will be integrating its AR Mesh technology into Teams, providing a different \"view\" into the Teams environment for all Teams users.\n\nThe cartoon-like avatars provide participants a way to still offer non-verbal communication cues like facial expressions, gestures, and more without needing to be on camera all the time. Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not that will actually relieve the \"always on\" stress associated with excessive video calls...\nThe Mesh and Teams integration also extends into activities like shared whiteboarding across different physical locations and other forms of interaction that are designed to make participants feel more like they're in the same physical environment. Given the expected resilience of hybrid working models---even after employees start returning to work in larger numbers---it's easy to imagine how some of these capabilities can provide a practical benefit. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n A Super Bowl for nerds: The Microsoft Excel World Championship crowns its winner \n\n\n\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the company has been talking about its Omniverse platform for several years now, where it means to provide a highly graphical 3D environment designed for engineering, graphics creation and collaboration.\nOmniverse Enterprise is designed to collaboratively build graphically realistic simulations of real-world devices and systems, making it useful for everything from designing the latest cars to seeing how AI-powered versions of those cars would function in simulated environments. In fact, Omniverse provides the underpinnings for Nvidia's Drive Sim efforts on autonomous driving, as well as its Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform.\nOmniverse Create is the tool that leverages the company's RTX graphics technology to create advanced scene compositions and virtual worlds with photo-realistic detail and then share them via the Pixar USD format. (Ironically, while we'll never know for sure, it could even be that Meta used Omniverse Create to help build its fantastical metaverse \"worlds\".)\nOne of the other interesting aspects of Nvidia's approach is its focus on partnerships. As Microsoft is doing with Teams, Nvidia continues to emphasize Omniverse as an extensible platform that other software companies and developers can leverage, including big-name graphics ISVs like Adobe, Autodesk, and more. In addition, Nvidia is focused on working with a variety of hardware partners to help deliver the systems that can power its Omniverse vision. The company is also working with resale partners to bring the 3D graphics collaboration capabilities to enterprises.\n\nAll of which highlights yet another critical difference between the Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia offerings: the expected scope of the efforts. Even though Zuckerberg and other Meta leaders acknowledged many times over that most of the innovations needed to achieve the vision of extraordinarily impressive graphics in its metaverse are several years off, they also implied that it would be a mainstream option for all. In a sense, it was like a real-world implementation of the Oasis metaverse from the book and movie Ready Player One that essentially anyone who currently uses something like the Facebook app would be expected to regularly use.\nBoth the Microsoft and Nvidia concepts, on the other hand, seem much more targeted to certain environments in certain businesses. Microsoft's Mesh for Teams is meant to work for most types of business meetings in theory, but the fact that it requires dedicated AR/VR headsets (at least to power the avatars) will limit its usage. Nvidia's offering is even more specialized, as it's designed for the engineers, designers, and other creative professionals who are involved with creating 3D models and virtual worlds. It's an important group to be sure, but not a huge one.\nDespite more limited scopes, realistically they're also more practical than the Meta approach, not only from a numbers perspective, but an acceptance factor as well. While I certainly expect there to be significant generational differences in preference, I still believe it is fair to say that most people don't really want to spend significant amounts of time in a Ready Player One type metaverse---especially given the state of today's VR and AR hardware.\nWhile movie-like CGI graphics and fantasy-like environments are certainly visually compelling to watch, they aren't something most people want to view all the time. Plus, let's not forget what's involved with making those kinds of visuals. Have you ever seen what actors working on science-fiction and other graphics-intensive movies have to go through to get their scenes done? Surrounding yourself with green screens isn't an experience most people are going to want to do more than a few times and I certainly don't see how it's going to translate to home or even most office environments. Using such a setup multiple times a day doesn't seem practical in the least.\n... we need to think through the privacy implications of technologies that ultimately may be able to track all the environments we live, work, and play in, all the people we interact with, and all the things we do. That's a lot to ponder.\nFinally, we need to think through the privacy implications of technologies that ultimately may be able to track all the environments we live, work, and play in, all the people we interact with, and all the things we do. That's a lot to ponder.\nPart of this challenge has to do with the limitations of today's hardware---a challenge that will eventually go away. But even when these constraints are removed, there's still something very isolating about purely virtual interactions. Nearly two years into pandemic-driven changes to our work environments, most of us are feeling the effects of this, despite higher quality cameras and nearly non-stop video-based interactions. People like to interact with real people, in real time, in real life, and we're a very long way from any technology replacing that experience.\nIn fact, I can't help but note the irony of the timing for all these announcements. By the time most of these offerings become available next year, many people will likely be returning to the office on at least a semi-regular basis. As a result, the perceived need for these new types of interactions may not be as compelling as it currently is.\nTo be clear, meeting-based interactions and collaboration efforts with remote colleagues (across the world or just down the street) will continue to be critical. As a result, even though they're probably the least sexy of these new technologies, collaboration-driven developments will surely be ongoing and the most impactful---certainly within next five years.\nThat's why, at the end of the day, while it's definitely cool to think about the interesting possibilities that technologies and concepts like metaverses might enable, practical benefits are what's likely to ultimately find success.\nBob O'Donnell is the founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC a technology consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia plans to introduce two brand-new GPU architectures, Ada Lovelace and Hopper (named for American computer scientist Grace Hopper), next year. The new graphics processors will address virtually all segments of the market, and industry sources believe they will be made using TSMC's N5 process technology, reports\u00a0DigiTimes.\u00a0This remains a widely reported rumor, so as usual take it with a pinch of salt.\n\nRight now, Nvidia uses Samsung's 8LPP fabrication process to make its Ampere-based GeForce RTX 30-series GPUs, as well as TSMC's N7 node to produce its high-end GA100 datacenter GPU for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Such a dual-source strategy allows Nvidia to diversify its supply chain, but since neither if its foundries get the maximum orders, it cannot really get the maximum allocation. As a result, next year the company will exclusively use TSMC for all of its upcoming GPUs.(Image credit: Nvidia)Next year Nvidia plans to introduce two GPU architectures: the Hopper architecture for datacenters, AI, and HPC applications as well as the Ada Lovelace architecture for gaming GeForce GPUs.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Hopper H100 GPU is expected to be the company\u2019s first multi-die compute GPU to maximise performance per socket. The multi-die GPU is projected to be paired with HBM memory and will use TSMC\u2019s chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.\n\nBy contrast, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 40-series Ada Lovelace GPUs are aimed at gamers and are likely to use traditional memory and FC-BGA packaging. DigiTimes claims that ASE Technology was tapped to test and package such GPUs.\n\nWhat is completely unclear is when exactly Nvidia plans to introduce its next-generation GPUs. Based on rumors, the company intends to refresh its GeForce 30-series family once again early next year with new Ti and Super parts. Since it does not make sense to refresh a lineup if you plan to launch a brand-new series shortly, we may speculate that Ada Lovelace graphics cards will only be available sometime in late 2022.\n\nKeeping in mind that Nvidia\u2019s A100 compute GPU now has a strong rival in the form of AMD\u2019s Instinct MI200-series accelerators, Nvidia is certainly interested in launching its Hopper architecture sooner rather than later. To that end, we will likely see Hopper arriving ahead of Lovelace.\n\nNvidia did not comment on the news story, as the company traditionally does not publicly talk about future products.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (116)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

At least in a miner's rig they're doing something arguably more productive than simply generating prety pictures.\nI do not think governments should restrict mining, but China has forbidden mining supposedly because of the strain it puts on the electrical grid. Gaming has no such restrictions (yet). That is because gamers do not have arrays consisting of dozens of video cards working at maximum power for 24 hours a day. Do I think cryptocurrency mining is destroying the climate? No, I don't. Do I believe that the universe of video cards are using far more electricity with crypto mining than without it? Absolutely. Those \"pretty pictures\" may be worthless to you, but to others they are not. And, yes, crypto is worth money but is that the only standard by which we judge the worthiness of something? If so then it is best for everyone to sell their gaming rigs because, hey, you get money.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamesJones44\n\n\nOh good, maybe this means I can get an RTX 30 for only 125% of the MSRP instead of 200% MSRP.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenericUser\n\n\nVforV said:RTX 4090 Out of Stock Before You Buy SCALPER Edition - Jensen Signed.\nIf you remove the signature, that's just the normal founders edition.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndymio\n\n\nKing_V said:You keep repeating this whole fair-market-value mantra like a holy chant, but does not increase the ability of consumers to purchase products.Of course it does. You can purchase all these cards today -- if you're willing to pay fair market price.

I'm simply trying to get you to understand that crypto mining may be worthless to you, but it's not to others. To each their own. Making decisions about which activities of others are \"worthwhile\" and which are not is a slippery slope which ultimately leads to authoritarianism. From the gist of your other remarks, I believe you understand that yourself, so I won't preach further on that topic.\n\nYes, crypto is worth money but is that the only standard by which we judge the worthiness of something? The value of crypto is not because it is \"worth\" money, but because it, as a medium of exchange with benefits above those of government-issued currencies, adds utility to the global economy. That may be a difficult argument to swallow for those of you who have lived your entire lives in the US or other reasonably-laissez faire economies; but it is still correct. As just one small example a couple years back, when the citizens of Venezuela were having their lifetime wealth destroyed in a hyperinflationary spiral and their government essentially banned foreign funds transfer, crypto was the only escape for many of these people.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 116 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus' mini supercomputer taps Nvidia Grace Blackwell chip for 1,000 AI TOPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP's new Omen 16 Slim goes up to an RTX 5070 and is 16% slimmer than its predecessor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHP updates its OmniBook X line with a lattice-free keyboard, processors from AMD and Intel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jensen Huang\u2019s Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote here \u2014 Blackwell 300 AI GPUs expected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU meets PCIe-based hard drives: Seagate and Nvidia demo NVMe HDDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's beastly Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes to a new GMKTec mini-PC, and AMD's Lisa Su appears to approve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel finally releases the XeSS 2.0 SDK for developers \u2014 Technology still gated by closed-source barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070-series GPU supply to stabilize after April claims AIB partner Yeston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew undersea cable tech listens for sabotage \u2014 can be retrofitted to existing fiber optic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Due early next year, Orin is slated to become NVIDIA\u2019s flagship SoC for automotive and edge computing applications. And, has become customary for NVIDIA, they are also going to be making Orin available to non-automotive customers through their Jetson embedded computing program, which makes the SoC available on a self-contained modular package.\nAlways a bit of a side project for NVIDIA, the Jetson single-board computers have none the less become an important tool for NVIDIA, serving as both an entry-point for helping bootstrap developers into the NVIDIA ecosystem, and as a embedded computing product in and of itself. Jetson boards are sold as complete single-board systems with an SoC, memory, storage, and the necessary I/O in pin form, allowing them to serve as commercial off the shelf (COTS) systems for use in finished products. Jetson modules are also used as the basis of NVIDIA\u2019s Jetson developer kits, which throw in a breakout board, power supply, and other bits needed to fully interact with Jetson modules.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Jetson Module Specifications\n\n\n\u00a0\nAGX Orin\nAGX Xavier\nJetson Nano\n\n\nCPU\n12x Cortex-A78AE\r\n\t\t\t@ 2.0GHz\n8x Carmel\r\n\t\t\t@ 2.26GHz\n4x Cortex-A57\r\n\t\t\t@ 1.43GHz\n\n\nGPU\nAmpere, 2048 Cores\r\n\t\t\t@ 1000MHz\nVolta, 512 Cores\r\n\t\t\t@ 1377MHz\nMaxwell, 128 Cores\r\n\t\t\t@ 920MHz\n\n\nAccelerators\n2x NVDLA v2.0\n2x NVDLA\nN/A\n\n\nMemory\n32GB LPDDR5, 256-bit bus\r\n\t\t\t(204 GB/sec)\n16GB LPDDR4X, 256-bit bus\r\n\t\t\t(137 GB/sec)\n4GB LPDDR4, 64-bit bus\r\n\t\t\t(25.6 GB/sec)\n\n\nStorage\n64GB eMMC 5.1\n32GB eMMC\n16GB eMMC\n\n\nAI Perf.

Joining the Jetson AGX Xavier will be the aptly named Jetson AGX Orin, which integrates the Orin SoC.\nOrin featuring 12 Arm Cortex-A78AE \u201cHercules\u201d CPU cores and an integrated Ampere architecture GPU with 2048 CUDA cores, adding up to 17 billion transistors, Given Orin's mobile-first design, NVIDIA is being fairly conservative with the clockspeeds here; the CPU cores for Jetson AGX Orin top out at 2GHz, while the GPU tops out at 1GHz. Otherwise, the SoC also contains a pair of NVIDIA\u2019s latest generation dedicated Deep Learning Accelerators (DLA), as well as a vision accelerator to further speed up and efficiently process those tasks.\n\nRounding out the Jetson AGX Orin package, the Orin SoC is being paired with 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM, which is attached to a 256-bit memory bus, allowing for 204GB/second of memory bandwidth. Meanwhile storage is provided by a 64GB eMMC 5.1 storage device, which is twice the capacity of the previous generation Jetson AGX.\nAll told, NVIDIA is promising 200 TOPS of performance in INT8 machine learning workloads, which would be a 6x improvement over Jetson AGX Xavier. Presumably those performance figures are for the module\u2019s full 50W TDP, while performance is proportionally lower as you move towards the module\u2019s minimum TDP of 15W.\n\nMeanwhile, for this generation NVIDIA will be maintaining pin and form-factor compatibility with Jetson AGX Xavier. So Jetson AGX Orin modules will be the same 100mm x 87mm in size, and use the same mezzanine connector, making Orin modules drop-in compatible with Xavier.\nJetson AGX Orin modules and dev kits are slated to become available in Q1 of 2022. NVIDIA has not announced any pricing information at this time.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n19 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nabufrejoval - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nWould make a decent open source alternative to a M1 Mac mini or just a nice workstation, even gaming console. Too bad the prices won't be anywhere near the Jetson Nano, so unlike the Nano or a PI it won't fit into my 'toy allowance' and I'd have argue an actual use case to buy one...Alas, it is really tempting!\n\n\n\nnandnandnand - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nI'm not sure why the Jetson Nano is being compared to AGX Xavier. But the Jetson Xavier NX launched at $400, which is not ideal to those who want Jetson Nano prices, but a lot more affordable than the AGX Xavier.\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nThe problem with Nano is that it's getting pretty ancient, by this point.  It'd be great to have something in that price range, size, and power budget, but with newer ARM cores and modern tensor cores.  Even Xavier NX still isn't a good fit for many projects and budgets.\n\n\n\nbondr - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nNewer cores cost more to license and tend to be run on newer manufacturing process nodes, which are more expensive. Thus, they tend to mostly be used for parts which can be sold for more money. That's why Nvidia is just releasing a high-end SBC with new cores right now.The exception to this is smartphones, but that comes from the exceptional scale there.\n\n\n\nbondr - Tuesday, November 9, 2021 - link\nA good example of this: the Snapdragon 888 developer board costs nearly double what some Snapdragon 888 phones cost.\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Wednesday, November 10, 2021 - link\nThat's because it's intended at people doing commercial hardware development, not hobbyists, students, or the homebrew crowd.Frequently, hardware development kits can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.  They're simply not meant for the casual tinkerer that Nvidia is targeting with these kits.\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Wednesday, November 10, 2021 - link\n> Newer cores cost more to licenseHuh?  Carmel is Nvidia's own design, as with probably all the rest of the IP in those chips!> newer manufacturing process nodesYeah, so cut down the size and make it cheaper.  That would also help with power, size, and cooling.  You wouldn't need such a wide memory interface, either.Again, there are lots of robotics projects that would like to go beyond Nano but there's no viable option.\n\n\n\nbondr - Thursday, November 11, 2021 - link\nAll ARM cores are licensed IP from ARM. Nvidia just designed \"on top\" of the existing ARM IP, which they pay for. As a company, you will pay more to license newer ARM IP (e.g. that from the ARMv8.2-A ISA Carmel is based on).\n\n\n\nmode_13h - Friday, November 12, 2021 - link\n> All ARM cores are licensed IP from ARM.Huh?  Do you even know that Carmel is Nvidia's own clean-sheet design?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_DenverYes, even building your own ARM core requires requires an ISA license, but it's unlikely the ARMv8 ISA licenses cost more than licensing the actual design of the A57 cores they have in Jetson Nano.Plus, I think it doesn't matter if it's trivially more expensive.  It's not a deal-breaker if the successor is *a little* more expensive.  It just can't be > 3x.\n\n\n\nbondr - Thursday, November 11, 2021 - link\nAlso, the fact that Nvidia is doing custom ARM chips in-house is also a HUGE cost factor, and the division working on this can probably only focus on one chip release at a time. Take for contrast RasPi, where many have wished for custom designs. RasPi just did a custom microcontroller, but the engineering effort/cost to produce a full scale general purpose SoC is an order of magnitude higher. Nvidia can only afford the luxury of full custom SoC designs on the back of their other divisions and the expectation that the edge AI vertical will expand greatly in the future (and wanting to establish their dominance for the sector early), but the team is surely focused on one design at a time still.They obviously have a design cycle where they're going to keep updating Jetson. Since this Orin represents a new high end offering, it wouldn't be a surprise if their next release next year is a refresh on the low end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSabrent Rocket nano V2 External SSD Review: Phison U18 in a Solid Offering\n\n\nMediaTek to Add NVIDIA G-Sync Support to Monitor Scalers, Make G-Sync Displays More Accessible\nQualcomm Adds Snapdragon 7s Gen 3: Mid-Tier Snapdragon Gets Cortex-A720 Treatment\n\nCXL Gathers Momentum at FMS 2024\nFadu's FC5161 SSD Controller Breaks Cover in Western Digital's PCIe Gen5 Enterprise Drives\nPCI-SIG Demonstrates PCIe 6.0 Interoperability at FMS 2024\nDapuStor and Memblaze Target Global Expansion with State-of-the-Art Enterprise SSDs\nPhison Enterprise SSDs at FMS 2024: Pascari Branding and Accelerating AI\nIntel Sells Its Arm Shares, Reduces Stakes in Other Companies\nG.Skill Intros Low Latency DDR5 Memory Modules: CL30 at 6400 MT/s\nSamsung's 128 TB-Class BM1743 Enterprise SSD Displayed at FMS 2024\nKioxia Demonstrates Optical Interface SSDs for Data Centers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nPrivacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nVisit Our Corporate Site\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

By\u00a0Laura LovettNovember 09, 202111:15 am\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA headquarters\u00a0\nPhoto courtesy of NVIDIA\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s new platform, the Clara Holoscan, is zeroing in on the AI-backed medical device and robotics space. The new tool was developed to give industry stakeholders a computational infrastructure to stream data from medical devices.\u00a0\n\u201cFuture medical instruments will become robotic. Recent advances in AI, physics-ML, ray tracing and the computing advances we\u2019ve spoken about will also revolutionize medical instruments,\u201d Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, said this morning during the GTC Keynote.\n\u201cThe algorithms will be reimagined by AI. The instrument will be reinvented by edge computing architectures. The business models will be revolutionized as instrument sales will be replaced by Medical Device Software-as-a-Service solutions. \u2026 The industry needs a software-defined imaging platform to build this future on, just as the auto industry needed a software defined AV platform. Today we\u2019re announcing NVIDIA Clara Holoscan, a software, programmable,\u00a0imaging platform.\u201d\nSpecifically the team at NVIDIA created the tool in order to connect medical devices with edge servers. Developers are able to tap into the platform to create an AI microservices, which is able to run on\u00a0\u201clow-latency streaming applications on devices while passing more complex tasks to data center resources.\u201d\nNVIDIA says that the platform was designed to speed up five key workflow phases, including\u00a0high-speed I/O, physics processing, image processing, data processing\u00a0and rendering.\nThe company said that the tool can be used for creating libraries and AI models, giving the example of use in ultrasound, digital pathology\u00a0and endoscopy.\u00a0\nWHY IT MATTERS\u00a0\nIncreasingly\u00a0medical devices are connected and using artificial intelligence. Huang pitches this new technology as a way for medical device developers to build on current devices and assist in creating new ones in the future.\u00a0\n\u201cWith Clara Holoscan UCF, instrument makers have a development platform to build real-time applications that connect these powerful engines,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe Holoscan platform is open, third-parties can build upon Holoscan\u2019s interfaces and APIs, researchers can do great new science and\u00a0instrument makers can integrate the Holoscan into their solutions. \u2026 \n\"Holoscan applications can be deployed fully in-instruments, in the hospital data center or a mixture of both. This allows companies to develop applications that require more computing than is in the device or to upgrade the installed base of the devices years after development.\u00a0\nTHE LARGER TREND\u00a0\nOver the years, NVIDIA, which earned a name for itself in the tech space for its GPU processors, has increasingly focused on the healthcare space. In April, the company teamed up with pharma giant AstraZeneca and the University of Florida on artificial intelligence research projects focused on drug discovery and patient care.\u00a0\nIn 2018, the company rolled out its AI platform Clara, which was designed to use AI to create a virtual medical imaging platform. The company has since launched a Clara AI toolkit for radiologists.\n\n\n\n\nTags:\u00a0Nvidia, Clara, Clara Holoscan\n\n\n\n\n\nMore regional news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisp, Origin partner to expand women's healthcare accessBy Jessica HagenMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain.space secures $11M to grow its mental model platformBy Anthony VecchioneMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarmboxRx unveils social needs platform for non-health related itemsBy Anthony VecchioneMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Study: Brain-computer interface allows paralyzed man to control robotic arm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Proposed legislation paves the way for AI to prescribe drugs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Walgreens to pay nearly $1B in COVID-19 test contract case  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n AI will continue to play a key role in healthcare but with caveats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Highlights of HIMSS25 Smart Health Transformation Forum  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exclusive: 'STOP COVID-19' study will examine the accuracy of at-home tests \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hinge Health files for IPO amid stock market volatility \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Wisp, Origin partner to expand women's healthcare access \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Brain.space secures $11M to grow its mental model platform \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n FarmboxRx unveils social needs platform for non-health related items \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Hyperfine, NVIDIA team up to enhance AI-driven portable imaging technology \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Connecticut Children's, Xerox partner on AI-powered care delivery initiative  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Digital Medicine Society, Google Health launch free course on genAI  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Private insurer Medibank adds telehealth to portfolio and more briefs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Cigna teaming with Carrot on fertility access \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\nHealthcare IT News\nHealthcare IT News Australia\nHealthcare Finance News\nHIMSS TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobiHealthNews\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd MobiHealthNews to your network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIMSS25 Global Health Conference & ExhibitionGet ready to immerse yourself in the epicenter of healthcare innovation at the 2025 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition in Las Vegas!March 3-6, 2025   |   Las Vegas, NVLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIMSS25 European Health Conference & ExhibitionGet ready for knowledge-sharing, all the latest innovations, and in-depth demos with Europe's most influential healthcare community.10 - 12 June, 2025 | ParisLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Menu\nAbout\nAdvertise\nReprints\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 MobiHealthNews is a publication of HIMSS Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nVideo\nProvider\nPayer\nPharma\nConsumer\nInvestor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer\nEvents\nJobs\nLearning Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\nAbout\nAdvertise\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nANZ \n\nASIA \n\nEMEA \n\nGlobal Edition \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobiHealthNews:\nThe latest news in digital health delivered daily to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch form\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Study: Brain-computer interface allows paralyzed man to control robotic arm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Health2Sync eyes Taiwan IPO with $20M Series C fund \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Melbourne-based Heidi Health to expand AI scribe capability with new $17M fund \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And she showcased how this historic tool is now being made all the more powerful with AI.\n\u201cThe convergence of AI and scientific computing is a revolution in the making,\u201d she said.\nUsing new neural operator-based frameworks to learn and solve partial differential equations, AI can help us model weather forecasting 100,000x quicker \u2014 and carbon dioxide sequestration 60,000x quicker \u2014 than traditional models.\nSpeeding Up the Calculations\nAnandkumar and her team developed the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), a framework that allows AI to learn and solve an entire family of partial differential equations, rather than a single instance.\nIt\u2019s the first machine learning method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution \u2014 which means that FNOs enable AI to make high-resolution inferences without high-resolution training data, which would be necessary for standard neural networks.\nFNO-based machine learning greatly reduces the costs of obtaining information for AI models, improves their accuracy and speeds up inference by three orders of magnitude compared with traditional methods.\nMitigating Climate Change\nFNOs can be applied to make real-world impact in countless ways.\nFor one, they offer a 100,000x speedup over numerical methods and unprecedented fine-scale resolution for weather prediction models. By accurately simulating and predicting extreme weather events, the AI models can allow planning to mitigate the effects of such disasters.\nThe FNO model, for example, was able to accurately predict the trajectory and magnitude of Hurricane Matthew from 2016.\nIn the video below, the red line represents the observed track of the hurricane. The white cones show the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s hurricane forecasts based on traditional models. The purple contours mark the FNO-based AI forecasts.\n\nAs shown, the FNO model follows the trajectory of the hurricane with improved accuracy compared with the traditional method \u2014 and the high-resolution simulation of this weather event took just a quarter of a second to process on NVIDIA GPUs.\nIn addition, Anandkumar\u2019s talk covered how FNO-based AI can be used to model carbon dioxide sequestration \u2014 capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, which scientists have said can help mitigate climate change.\nResearchers can model and study how carbon dioxide would interact with materials underground using FNOs 60,000x faster than with traditional methods.\nAnandkumar said the FNO model is also a significant step toward building a digital twin of Earth.\nThe new NVIDIA Modulus framework for training physics-informed machine learning models and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform equip researchers and developers with the tools to combine the powers of AI, physics and supercomputing \u2014 to help solve the world\u2019s toughest problems.\n\u201cI strongly believe this is the future of science,\u201d Anandkumar said.\nShe\u2019ll delve into these topics further at a SC21 plenary talk, taking place on Nov. 18 at 10:30 a.m. Central time.\nWatch her full GTC session on demand, here.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Digital Twin | GTC 2021 | Machine Learning | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | NVIDIA Quantum-2 | Science | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In its latest report, DigiTimes states that partners including Taiwan factories that are partners with NVIDIA are getting ready for a major GPU refresh next year in the form of the GeForce RTX 40 series.\nNVIDIA Partners at Taiwan Prep For Major GeForce RTX 40 'Ada Lovelace' Series GPU Launch in 2022, Gaming GPUs To Utilize TSMC's 5nm Process Node\nWe have already heard about the possibility of NVIDIA utilizing TSMC's 5nm process node for its next-generation gaming GPUs codenamed Ada Lovelace from reliable leakers but this time, the information comes from directly within the Taiwanese based factories where these GPUs will be made. While the DigiTimes article is behind a paywall, a snippet of the information was revealed by RetiredEnginner (@chiakokhua) over at Twitter.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\"Nvidia's biennial GPU refresh coming in 2022, riding on metaverse and gaming. Following H100, based on Hopper architecture, using TSMC's 5nm + CoWoS, aimed at datacenter/AI, gaming GPU RTX40 series, based on Ada Lovelace architecture, will also tap TSMC's 5nm....\"\n\u2014 RetiredEngineer\u00ae (@chiakokhua) November 30, 2021\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will power the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards that will go head-on with AMD's RDNA 3 based Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards. There's still some speculation regarding the use of MCM by NVIDIA. The Hopper GPU, which is primarily aimed at the Datacenter & AI segment, is\u00a0allegedly taping out soon and will feature an MCM CoWoS architecture. NVIDIA won't be using an MCM design on its Ada Lovelace GPUs so they will keep the traditional monolithic design. The Ada Lovelace GPUs are expected to bring in a series of key innovations, architecturally.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card - Ada Lovelace Powered AD102 Flagship GPU\nBased upon previous rumors, there have been whispers that NVIDIA would utilize TSMC's N5 (5nm) process node for its Ada Lovelace GPUs. This includes the AD102 SKU too which will be an entirely monolithic design. In his latest tweet which talks about the specific GPU configurations, the AD102 GPU is said to feature a clock speed as high as 2.5 GHz (2.3 GHz average boost). The specific tweet states that the GPU clock for Ada Lovelace 'AD102' could be 2.3 GHz or greater so let's take that as a baseline and previously leaked specifications to figure out where the performance should land.\nThe NVIDIA AD102 \"ADA GPU\" appears to have 18432 CUDA Cores based on the preliminary specs (which can change), housed within 144 SM units. This is almost twice the cores present in Ampere which was already a massive step up from Turing. A 2.3-2.5 GHz clock speed would give us up to 85 to 92 TFLOPs of compute performance (FP32). This is more than twice the FP32 performance of the existing RTX 3090 which packs 36 TFLOPs of FP32 compute power.\n\nThe 150% performance jump looks huge but one should remember that NVIDIA already gave a big jump in FP32 numbers this generation with Ampere. The Ampere GA102 GPU (RTX 3090) offers 36 TFLOPs while the Turing TU102 GPU (RTX 2080 Ti) offered 13 TFLOPs. That's over a 150% increase in FP32 Flops but the real-world gaming performance increase for the RTX 3090 averaged at around 50-60% faster over the RTX 2080 Ti. So one thing we shouldn't forget is that Flops don't equal GPU gaming performance these days. Furthermore, we don't know if 2.3-2.5 GHz is the average boost or the peak boost with the former meaning that there could be even higher compute potential for AD102.\nAside from that, the leaker also states that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 flagship would retain a 384-bit bus interface, similar to the RTX 3090. What's interesting is though that the leaker mentions G6X which means that NVIDIA won't be moving to a new memory standard until after Ada Lovelace and utilize the higher pin-speeds of G6X of 21 Gbps for its next-generation cards before we see a newer standard (e.g. GDDR7). The card will feature 24 GB of memory so we can either expect single-sided 16Gb DRAM or dual-sided 8Gb DRAM modules.\n\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:\n\n\n\nGPUTU102GA102AD102\n\n\n\n\nFlagship SKURTX 2080 TiRTX 3090 TiRTX 4090?\n\n\nArchitectureTuringAmpereAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcessTSMC 12nm NFFSamsung 8nmTSMC 4N?\n\n\nDie Size754mm2628mm2~600mm2\n\n\nGraphics Processing Clusters (GPC)6712\n\n\nTexture Processing Clusters (TPC)364272\n\n\nStreaming Multiprocessors (SM)7284144\n\n\nCUDA Cores46081075218432\n\n\nL2 Cache6 MB6 MB96 MB\n\n\nTheoretical TFLOPs 16 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs~90 TFLOPs?\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6XGDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Capacity11 GB (2080 Ti)24 GB (3090 Ti)24 GB (4090?)\n\n\nMemory Speed14 Gbps21 Gbps24 Gbps?\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth616 GB/s1.008 GB/s1152 GB/s?\n\n\nMemory Bus384-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nPCIe InterfacePCIe Gen 3.0PCIe Gen 4.0PCIe Gen 4.0\n\n\nTGP250W350W600W?\n\n\nReleaseSep. 2018Sept. 202H 2022 (TBC)\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will power the next-generation GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards that will go head-on with AMD's RDNA 3 based Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards.

NVIDIA won't be using an MCM design on its Ada Lovelace GPUs so they will keep the traditional monolithic design.\n\n\n\nWhich next-generation GPUs are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n AMD RDNA 3 (Navi 3X Radeon RX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (GeForce RTX GPUs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Intel ARC Alchemist  (ARC Graphics Cards)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n104\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n102\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n73\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n44\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\n\n\n33\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1467\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Over the past decade, it\u2019s provided 1,000x performance increases, thanks to advances in five generations of GPUs and the full stack of software we\u2019ve built on top of them.\nScaling is a second engine, racking up advances of nearly 100,000x. That\u2019s because the data center is the new unit of computing.\nFor example, in 2015 it took a single Kepler GPU nearly a month to train ResNet-50, a popular computer vision model. Today, we train that same model in less than half a minute on Selene, the world\u2019s most powerful industrial supercomputer, which packs thousands of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs.\nWe developed many key technologies to enable this scaling, like our Megatron software, Magnum IO for multi-GPU and multinode processing, and SHARP for in-network computing.\nThe Dawn of Deep Learning\nThe third and most transformational force of our time is AI computing.\nLast year, deep learning powered a simulation of 305 million atoms over 1-millisecond timescale, showing the inner workings of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That work marked an over 10-millionfold increase from a then state-of-the-art simulation of 1 million atoms for 20 nanoseconds 15 years earlier.\nThat\u2019s why the combination of AI and high performance computing is sweeping through the scientific community. Researchers posted nearly 5,000 papers on work in AI+HPC on arXiv last year, up from less than 100 five years ago.\nOne of the most recent papers was from NVIDIA researchers. It showed a way to combine neural networks with classical physics equations to provide 1,000x speedups in traditional simulations.\nAccelerating Drug Discovery\nToday, the combination of accelerated computing, massive scaling and AI is advancing science and industrial computing.\nNo effort could be more vital than speeding drug discovery to treat diseases. It\u2019s challenging work that requires decoding protein structures in 3D to see how they work, then identifying the chemical compounds that stop them from infecting healthy cells.\nTraditional methods using X-rays and electron microscopes have decoded only 17 percent of the roughly 25,000 human proteins. DeepMind used an ensemble of AI models in its AlphaFold system last year to make a big leap, predicting the 3D structure of more than 20,000 human proteins.\nSimilarly, researchers at NVIDIA, Caltech and startup Entos blended machine learning and physics to create OrbNet, speeding up molecular simulations by many orders of magnitude. Leveraging that effort, Entos can accelerate its simulations of chemical reactions between protein and drug candidates 1,000x, finishing in three hours work that would have taken more than three months.\nUnderstanding a Changing Climate\nIt\u2019s a similar situation in other fields. Scientists hope to run global climate simulations soon with kilometer-scale resolution to help us adapt to changing weather patterns and better prepare for disasters.\nBut to track clouds and storm patterns accurately, they need to work at the resolution of one meter. That requires a whopping 100 billion times more computing power.\nAt the pace of Moore\u2019s law, we wouldn\u2019t get there until 2060. So, scientists seeking millionfold leaps are building digital twins of our planet with accelerated computing and AI at scale.\nTo speed that work, we announced plans to build Earth-2, the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting, mitigating and adapting to climate change. It will create a digital twin of Earth in Omniverse.\nIndustries Spawn Digital Twins\nResearchers are already using these techniques to build digital twins of factories and cities.\nFor example, Siemens Energy used the NVIDIA Modulus AI framework running on dozens of GPUs in the cloud to simulate an entire power plant. It can predict mechanical failures from the corrosive effects of steam, reducing downtime, saving money and keeping the lights on.\nIt\u2019s a kind of simulation technology that promises more efficient farms, hospitals and transformations in every industry. And that\u2019s why we developed Modulus \u2014 it eases the job of creating AI-powered, physically accurate simulations.\nIt\u2019s one more tool fueled by today\u2019s new engines of computing to enable the next millionfold leap.\n\u200b\u200bAccelerated computing with AI at data center scale will deliver millionfold increases in performance to solve problems such as understanding climate change, discovering drugs, fueling industrial transformations and much more.\nTo get the big picture, watch NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s GTC keynote address below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Digital Twin | GPU Computing | GTC 2021 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | Parallel Computing | Science | Simulation and Design | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
