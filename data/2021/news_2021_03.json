[+] February 7, 2019 in Tianjin, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)VCG via Getty Images\nDespite rising around 2.5x from its low in March 2020, we believe Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) has room for a further 15% upside to levels it reached in February 2021. The company\u2019s stock trades at $527 currently and is, in fact, roughly unchanged so far this year. Also, it traded at $315 in February 2020 \u2013 just before the outbreak of coronavirus \u2013 and is up more than 65% from that level. However, with the rise in gaming device and data center demand, the need for Nvidia\u2019s data center and GPU products is expected to rise further. We believe that the stock has the potential to gain around 15% from its current levels, on the back of steady demand growth and strong FY 2021 results (Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year ends in January). Our conclusion is based on our comparative analysis of Nvidia stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession in our interactive dashboard.\n\n\n2020 Coronavirus Crisis\n\nTimeline of 2020 Crisis So Far:\n\n\n\n\n12/12/2019: Coronavirus cases first reported in China\n1/31/2020: WHO declares a global health emergency.\n2/19/2020: Signs of effective containment in China and hopes of monetary easing by major central banks helps S&P 500 reach a record high\n3/23/2020: S&P 500 drops 34% from the peak level seen on Feb 19, 2020, as COVID-19 cases accelerate outside China. Doesn\u2019t help that oil prices crash in mid-March amid Saudi-led price war\nSince 3/24/2020: S&P 500 recovers 78% from the lows seen on Mar 23, 2020, as the Fed\u2019s multi-billion dollar stimulus package suppresses near-term survival anxiety and infuses liquidity into the system.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, here is how NVDA stock and the broader market fared during the 2007-08 crisis.\nTimeline of 2007-08 Crisis\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\n\n\n10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index\n9/1/2008 - 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08)\n3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index\n12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)\n\n\n\nNVDA and S&P 500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial Crisis\nWe see Nvidia stock declined from levels of around $12 in September 2008 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of around $8 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying NVDA stock lost around 33% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, to levels of just above $18 in early 2010, rising by around 2.2x between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied to levels of 1,124, rising by about 48% between March 2009 and January 2010.\n\n\nNVDA Fundamentals Over Recent Years\nNvidia revenues increased strongly from $9.7 billion in 2018 to $16.7 billion in 2021, due to higher revenues across all revenue segments driven by strong data center and GPU demand. Along with higher revenue, earnings also rose steadily, with EPS rising from $5.09 to $7.02 during this period.\nDoes NVDA Have Enough Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Coronavirus Crisis?\nNvidia\u2019s total debt stands at $7 billion currently, up from $2 billion in FY 2020. However, Nvidia\u2019s cash cushion of $11.6 billion, combined with $5.8 billion in cash from operations in FY \u201921, is more than enough to cover its debt obligations and ride out the current crisis.\nConclusion\nPhases of Covid-19 Crisis:\n\n\nEarly- to mid-March 2020: Fear of the coronavirus outbreak spreading rapidly translates into reality, with the number of cases accelerating globally\nLate-March 2020 onward: Social distancing measures + lockdowns\nApril 2020: Fed stimulus suppresses near-term survival anxiety\nMay-June 2020: Recovery of demand, with gradual lifting of lockdowns - no panic anymore despite a steady increase in the number of cases\nSince late 2020: Weak quarterly results, but continued improvement in demand and progress with vaccine development buoy market sentiment\n\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. gradually dropping, we see the rise in gaming device and data center demand continuing, driving up demand for Nvidia\u2019s products. This is evident from Nvidia\u2019s full-year 2021 results, where revenues jumped to $16.7 billion from $10.9 billion in FY 2020. This also boosted EPS to $7.02 from $4.59 over this period. We believe that Nvidia stock has potential upside in the near term, and with the lockdowns being gradually lifted, data center demand could rise further. This could see Nvidia stock potentially rise around 15% from its current level, to its February 2021 high of $615.High Quality PortfolioTrefis\nWhat if you\u2019re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

In the changed scenario, market leaders Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) are busy revisiting their business strategies, often with the aim of outsmarting each other.\nThe CPU Race\nOf late, Nvidia has been making inroads into the data-center space where Intel enjoys a strong foothold, with last year\u2019s Mellanox giving the server portfolio a fresh boost, while the latter is expanding its GPU prowess to challenge Nvidia in its home turf. Under the revised model, Intel rolled out its first server GPU last year. Considering the companies\u2019 growing interest in the self-driving market, there will be stiff competition to grab that market going forward.\n\nAlso read: Beating COVID blues, Nvidia is headed for a strong year\n\nThriving on the power of its GPU portfolio, Nvidia ended fiscal 2021 with another round of record revenues and earnings. At $5 billion, fourth-quarter revenues were up 61%, which pushed up the bottom-line by 64% to $3.10 per share. Obviously, the results surpassed the market\u2019s projection, as they did in every quarter for more than a decade. The management exuded confidence that the current momentum would be maintained in the current quarter.\n\nFrom Nvidia\u2019s Q4 2021 earnings conference call:\n\u201cOver the past year, it has become clear that we\u2019ve entered a new era in which gaming is an integral part of global culture. The number of concurrent users on Steam has more than doubled since 2018 and continues to hit new records. In 2020 alone, more than 100 billion hours of gaming content was seen on YouTube and 0.5 billion people watched eSports. Increasingly, we aren\u2019t just gaming, we\u2019re also watching sports, kept attending concerts, creating content, and connecting with our friends in virtual environments.\u201d\nInvesting in NVDA\nAfter growing many-fold in the last few years, Nvidia\u2019s shares are relatively more expensive. Though the stock retreated from last month\u2019s peak, it has the potential to bounce back and reach fresh highs. Experts\u2019 advice is to invest in Nvidia right now and take advantage of the low stock price. The consensus rating on the stock is strong buy. This year alone, the value more than doubled.\n\nRelated: Intel Corp. Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript\n\nIt has been around five years since Intel\u2019s quarterly earnings last missed analysts\u2019 forecast. Though the key metrics beat in the fourth quarter, they were almost flat year-over-year. A deeper look into the report shows the core client computing business did well but the other segments registered negative growth. As a result, revenues edged down 1% to $20 billion and earnings stayed unchanged at $1.52 per share. Worse, Intel executives see continued weakness in the early months of the current fiscal year.\nWeak Outlook\nThe muted outlook aligns with analysts\u2019 view on INTC, which is expected to pare a part of the recent gains this year. That makes it a risky investment right now. So, it is important to wait until a clearer picture emerges, before buying or selling the stock. One should not be surprised if the stock pulls back and slips below the $65-mark in the coming weeks. Probably, the stock\u2019s only attraction is affordability.\n\nDespite being a smaller player than Intel, Nvidia was more successful last year both in terms of profitability and creating shareholder value. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s efforts to expand into the smartphone CPU market through a $40-billion acquisition of UK-based Arm Holdings was put under a review by the regulators to investigate whether the buyout would breach competition rules.\nA Long-term Bet?\nThat said, Intel\u2019s strong fundamentals and scale of operation, supported by continued innovation, give it an edge from the long-term perspective. Moreover, the company continues to dominate the data-center and personal computer markets.\nNvidia\u2019s stock closed Tuesday\u2019s trading at $522.83, which is down 1%. Intel shares traded lower during the regular session and closed at $6.3.48, down 3%.\nRead management/analysts\u2019 comments on Nvidia\u2019s Q4 results\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nStocks you may like:\nIntel (INTC) Stock\nMicron Technology (MU) Stock\nNvidia Corp.

Krenz started a fund-raising campaign that brought in more than $18,000 for the charity that has helped RIP Medical Debt forgive the debt of more than 900 people so far. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)    TOM MURPHY  Updated 18 March 2021 3 min read          When flight paramedic Rita Krenz boards a helicopter, she knows her patients are about to face problems she can\u2019t fix \u2014 a health care system that buries people in debt after a car accident or stroke. So she decided to do something about it. She turned for help to RIP Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys and forgives medical debt.  Krenz started a fundraising campaign that brought in more than $18,000 for the charity. That money has helped RIP Medical Debt forgive the debt of more than 900 people so far, with the average bill abolished totaling around $1,340. Krenz has no way of knowing if she will help anyone she\u2019s treated. But it\u2019s enough to know that her campaign will help somebody. \u201cA lot of my friends in health care are worn down by this broken system,\u201d the Charlottesville, Virginia, resident said. \u201cThis, it helps give some relief to that weariness.\u201d Krenz flies several times a week during her 24-hour shifts, responding to emergencies like car accidents or transporting patients from hospital to hospital. The 47-year-old said she started her career focused idealistically on the help she could provide. \u201cYears in the system now fill me with doubt,\u201d Krenz wrote on her fundraiser\u2019s webpage, noting that she wonders how life-saving care can lead to financial ruin. \u201cHow can this be our system, in this amazing country?\u201d Rising care costs and shrinking insurance or a lack of coverage can swamp patients with debt, especially if they need a helicopter, which can result in bills topping $20,000 in some cases. More than one in seven U.S. residents with a credit record has overdue medical debt on it, according to the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.  It\u2019s one of the most common forms of debt in collections. RIP Medical Debt relies on individual donations, corporate sponsors and fundraising campaigns to attack this problem. Krenz started her campaign last September after first hearing about the nonprofit. She asked friends, family and co-workers for help. RIP Medical Debt promoted her campaign as well, but donations stalled at around $10,000. Then they picked up again toward the year\u2019s end. A church Krenz has no connection to gave $1,000. A couple she doesn\u2019t know contributed $2,500. That run, Krenz said, was so \u201cuplifting and reaffirming that there are good people in the world.\u201d She also threw in money from her pandemic relief stimulus checks, and the campaign climbed past its goal of $15,000. RIP Medical Debt buys blocks of older debt it can get cheaply and aims to help people with low incomes. It can buy debt in a particular area or market, but it cannot target specific people.   Story continues The nonprofit estimates that it has erased more than $3 billion in medical debt since two former debt collections executives started it in 2014. Much work remains.About $140 billion in medical debt was in collections last year, according to Stanford economist Neale Mahoney.Erasing debt can make it easier for patients to buy a car or get a job. It also can encourage them to keep up with their care since they don\u2019t have to worry about medical bills they still owe.Once RIP Medical Debt buys and forgives debt, it sends patients a yellow letter telling them things are resolved. For Krenz, that made what she was doing feel more real than simply writing a check to a charity.\u201cI can picture a person going to the mailbox and getting that letter,\u201d she said.___\u201cOne Good Thing\u201d is a series that highlights individuals whose actions provide glimmers of joy in hard times \u2014 stories of people who find a way to make a difference, no matter how small.

In an email to HEXUS Nvidia said that from today Nvidia Founders memberships are no longer available, instead those who wish to pay for an elevated level of service will be steered towards Priority membership.\nPriority membership is an offering with exactly the same service level as the Founders membership provided (see membership benefits chart below) but things are going to be more expensive from now on. As a thank you for existing Founders members, Nvidia has introduced the Founders for life benefit which locks in the special $4.99 / \u00a34.99 introductory rate as long the account is in good standing. Priority members will be paying $9.99 / \u20ac9.99 / \u00a38.99 per month starting from now. Yearly rates of $99.99 / \u20ac99.99 / \u00a389.99 will also be available.\n\nNvidia is keen to explain how it has improved GeForce Now over the last year, which goes some way to justifying these price hikes. It lists the following key upgrades:\n\nSupporting day-and-date launches, like Cyberpunk 2077, and top free-to-play games\nIncreasing the game library, which now includes more than 800 games\nThere are now nearly 10 million GFN members\nOpening new data centres, giving us more than 20 around the world\nExpanding capacity in existing data centres, allowing us to grow the service further\nImproving quality of service, with even more optimizations on the way.\n\nIt goes on to assert that upgrades and benefits are set to grow, with particular attention to streaming quality and ease of use, and adding more games.\nOne upcoming improvement that might interest potential subscribers is the new adaptive V-sync technology, set to arrive with the 2.0.28 update in about a week's time. This feature synchronizes frame rates at 60 or 59.94Hz at the server-side to match the display client-side, reducing stutter and latency on supported games. Moreover, a new adaptive de-jitter technology will enable us to increase bit rates for improved quality over choppy networks, too.\nAnother nicety worth anticipating is the account linking of key games, as well as pre-loading updates to cut load times in about half. Nvidia's busiest data centres are all getting additional capacity, and a new data centre opens in Montreal in the coming months. As for new regions, Nvidia has recently partnered with network providers in Turkey, with Saudi Arabia and Australia.\n\nSince it is again GeForce Thursday, 7 new games have been added to GeForce Now. These include:\n\nDo Not Feed the Monkeys (Steam)\nGoNNER (Steam)\nLoop Hero (Epic Games Store)\nMonopoly Plus (Steam)\nSnooker 19 (Steam)\nSystem Shock: Enhanced Edition (Steam)\nWanba Warriors (Steam) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\n\n                    And Nvidia's GeForce Now service becomes Xbox friendly (via updated Microsoft Edge). \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n11\nSir Trevor McDonald OBE becomes the GamesMaster\n\n                    He will take on the iconic role during the three 60-minute episodes aired later this year. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n10\nAMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Halo Infinite graphics card revealed\n\n                    This SKU won't be going on sale but will be used for competition prizes and so on. \n                \n\n\n\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nGod of War scheduled for PC release on 14th January\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\nNvidia ends support for Windows 7 and 8, as well as Kepler GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 7 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Triple?Would you pay double? Triple?by  Sean HollisterMar 23, 2021, 12:30 PM UTCLinkFacebookThreadsPhoto by Sean Hollister / The VergeSean Hollister is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.You might have heard there\u2019s a global semiconductor shortage going on, and that PC graphics cards in particular are nearly impossible to find. What you probably haven\u2019t heard is that the situation has steadily been growing worse \u2014 to the point some GPUs are worth triple their MSRP.Above, you\u2019ll see a photo of two graphics cards, the $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 and the $579 AMD Radeon RX 6800. In December, I calculated that the true street price of these cards had reached $819 and $841, respectively, or $1,660 for the pair.That very same photo now contains $2,570 worth of GPUs. That\u2019s not the asking price, mind you; people are actually paying over $1,200 on the open market, on average, for each of these graphics cards. And that isn\u2019t even as bad as it gets.This past week, I ran the PS5, Xbox Series X, and each of Nvidia\u2019s and AMD\u2019s new graphics cards through an open-source eBay scraper tool to figure out how much they\u2019re worth on average over a seven-day period (big thanks to data analyst Michael Driscoll), then spent a handful of hours validating the results and weeding out fakes.TL;DR: while the PS5 and Xboxes have actually cooled off a bit, you\u2019ll pay double, even triple for a new AMD or Nvidia GPU.GPU, PS5, Xbox street prices: March 2021ItemRetail priceStreet price (Dec 2020)Street price (Mar 2021)Current valueNvidia RTX 3090$1,499$2,076$2,9851.99xNvidia RTX 3080$699$1,227$2,1603.09xNvidia RTX 3070$499$819$1,2392.48xNvidia RTX 3060 Ti$399$675$1,2263.07xNvidia RTX 3060$329N/A$8282.5xAMD RX 6900 XT$999Did not check$1,8411.84xAMD RX 6800 XT$649$1,232$1,5552.4xAMD RX 6800$579$841$1,3312.3xAMD RX 6700 XT$479N/A$1,1692.4xPS5 (disc)$499$1,024$8331.66xPS5 (digital)$399$990$7541.88xXbox Series X$499$835$8051.61xXbox Series S$299$471$4321.45xRX 6700 XT is based on five, not seven days of eBay sales since it\u2019s brand-new.Frankly, I\u2019m not sure which numbers are the most staggering here. Is it that the supposedly $329 RTX 3060 fetches over $800 on average, or that the RTX 3090 and 3080 are each worth $900 more than they were just three months ago? Or maybe is it that my own 3060 Ti, which I finally managed to snap up for its retail price of $399 after months of trying, could sell for $1,200 now?I also looked at just how many of these items are actually getting sold on eBay, which can give you an idea of just how skewed the supply / demand equation is. For instance: over a seven-day period, eBay moved 5,284 PS5 consoles, and yet plenty of PS5s that were listed didn\u2019t sell. PS5 scalping is becoming less profitable, eBay\u2019s getting flooded, and things are slowing down.How many PS5s, Xboxes, and GPUs changed hands?Item# of listingsPS5 (disc)3,651PS5 (digital)1,633Xbox Series X1,518Xbox Series S960Nvidia RTX 3090372Nvidia RTX 3080384Nvidia RTX 3070505Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti141Nvidia RTX 3060782AMD RX 6900 XT106AMD RX 6800 XT107AMD RX 680083AMD RX 6700 XT98RX 6700 XT is based on five, not seven days of eBay sales since it\u2019s brand-new.Yet on the PC GPU side of things, it\u2019s the opposite. Every single GPU seems to be selling unless they\u2019re listed well above the average sale price, and there are precious few of them to go around \u2014 just 83 of AMD\u2019s RX 6800 and 141 of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 Ti changed hands during the same seven-day period as far as I can tell. There\u2019s nothing here to suggest scalping will slow anytime soon.It doesn\u2019t help that the actual retail prices of these graphics cards have been edging northward, too. Whether it\u2019s a reaction to the Trump tariffs or a blatant attempt to get a piece of the action, the GPUs that I actually do briefly see for sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Neweggs of the world are often far, far above the prices that AMD and Nvidia suggest, like an $840 RTX 3070 or a $900 RX 6800. The average list price for a $329.99 RTX 3060 was $471 on launch day. And while Newegg\u2019s raffle originally seemed like a potentially fair way to pay retail, it\u2019s almost become a parody now:And yet when that $330 video card that you buy for $540 might get scalped for $830, it\u2019s hard to be surprised when MSI and Newegg decide they want to extract a couple hundred dollars of that for themselves.The question, as always, is when AMD and Nvidia are going to be able to produce more than a trickle of new graphics cards to address this pent-up demand, and I\u2019m afraid the tea leaves aren\u2019t looking particularly good. AMD\u2019s promise of making \u201csignificantly more GPUs available\u201d and regularly refreshing stock at its own website haven\u2019t made a meaningful dent so far.

In the UK and US it seems that the Dell G Series mainstream and budget gaming laptops are limited to 10th gen Intel H series and AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors, with the best GPUs being RTX 2070 Super and RX 5600M options.\n\nA few hours ago PCWorld and The Verge reported that Dell had launched a G15 model in China which comes with and all new design, as well as with Nvidia GeForce 30000 mobile GPU options. At the time of writing the Dell China page doesn't list such graphics options for the G15, which is indeed marked with a 'NEW' sticker, all I can see is the default entry level choice of GTX 1650. So we only have scant details as yet, but I have bullet pointed them below:\nNew Dell G15 gaming laptop specs:\n\nUp to 15.6-inch 360Hz screen with low blue light\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3000 mobile graphics. Users can choose \"three performance options ranging up to 115W of TDP\".\nAlienware cooling tech\nRGB lighting: keyboard and 4 zones supported by AlienFX\nRedesigned durable plastic chassis, with Alienware influence\nDark Shadow Grey, Spector Green with Speckles, Obsidian Black, or Phantom Grey with Speckles colour options\n\n\nPhotos of the laptop show some more details, such as an Ethernet port, multiple USB, HDMI and audio IO. The design looks well vented too, with styled slats on the sides and rear, as well as grilles behind the keyboard deck.\nPreviously Dell had three G-series gaming laptop lines, the G3, G5 and G7 families, with the latter being the highest end with metal chassis, and niceties like per key RGB backlighting yet avoiding cannibalisation of its Alienware brand. With the plastic construction it looks like the G15 series will again sit nearer the entry level. Perhaps Dell will trim down its G series in the coming months.\n\nWe don't have indicative pricing for the G15 series laptops with RTX 3000 graphics from Dell. The sources were told that global availability will begin sometime in April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\n\n                    After Apple's blockbuster reveal last week, the GPUs don't live up to the hype. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\nUpgraded MacBook Pro laptops come with M1 Pro and Max SoCs\n\n                    14.2- and 16.2-inch laptops have more ports, a Mini LED screen (notch), Function keys. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nApple Unleashed on 18th Oct to debut new MacBook Pros, M1X\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 8, Pro X, and Go 3 revealed\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 1 Comment\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Sleep-sensing technology will be a key feature on Google's next generation of its Nest Hub, a 7-inch display unveiled Tuesday, March 16, 2021. (Google via AP)    MICHAEL LIEDTKE  Updated 16 March 2021 3 min read       In this article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   GOOGL   -2.39%       SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Google's next internet-connected home device will test whether consumers trust the company enough to let it snoop on their sleep. New sleep-sensing technology will be a key feature on Google's latest version of its Nest Hub, a 7-inch smart screen unveiled Tuesday. Like the previous generation, the $100 Nest Hub can display pictures and video in addition to fielding questions and handling household tasks through Google\u2019s voice-activated assistant. It also doesn\u2019t feature a camera.  But the latest Nest Hub's new trick may help differentiate it from similar devices, such as Amazon's Echo Show, while also providing a springboard for Google to get more involved in helping people manage their health. If you allow it, the device will also monitor your sleeping patterns from your bedside, negating the need to wear a fitness device or any other potentially bothersome gadget in bed. The feature, which Google intends to offer for free through at least this year, relies on a new chip Google calls Soli, which uses radar to detect motion, including the depth of a person\u2019s breathing. The Nest Hub is supposed to generate weekly sleep reports with easy-to-understand breakdowns on the length and quality of sleep, how frequently the user gets up at night and snoring and coughing frequency, along with tips developed in consultation with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Google says it honed the technology by studying 15,000 sleeping people over a combined 110,000 nights.  That kind of help may sound appealing to the millions of people who have trouble sleeping. But the feature may also raise privacy concerns \u2014 especially given Google\u2019s long history of online surveillance to collect personal details such as interests, habits and whereabouts to help sell the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. It also underscores Google\u2019s obvious intent to extend its tentacles into new areas of people\u2019s lives in its relentless quest to make more money, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer and privacy rights group. \u201cGoogle's goal is to monetize every cell of your body,\u201d Chester said. The sleep sensing feature will remain free through the rest of this year, but Google could eventually sell it as a subscription service, acknowledged Ashton Udall, Google Nest\u2019s senior product manager. The company may also eventually tweak the feature to work with its FitBit line of fitness devices, which Google took over in January. That $2.1 billion purchase has raised concerns that Google could use those gadgets to peer more deeply into people's personal health.   Story continues Google is emphasizing the privacy protections built into the sleep sensing feature. For starters, users will have to turn it on themselves. The Nest Hub will also have controls that Google says will make it clear when sleep tracking is on and to make it easy to delete data from the device.All audio will be kept on the device, meaning it won't be sent to Google's data centers, although other sleep information will be provided to generate the analysis and reports. None of the information collected through the sleep sensing feature will be used to sell ads, Udall said.But Chester is skeptical about that pledge. Knowing an individual's sleeping patterns, for instance, could help Google know when a person is feeling anxious or sick, Chester said, and those insights could influence which ads to show.

REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco  \u00b7 Romeo Ranoco / reuters By Chris Dolmetsch Philippines billionaire Enrique Razon was sued in New York by a company that claims the tycoon illegally terminated an agreement to operate a Manila casino and is hiding assets in the US to avoid paying an arbitration award. The suit, filed Monday in federal court in New York by Global Gaming Philippines, seeks to confirm a $296.6 million arbitration award handed down by a panel in Singapore against Razon over his withdrawal of rights to operate the Solaire Resort and Casino in Manila\u2019s Entertainment City suburb.  Global Gaming, whose executives have experience running some of the largest gaming operations in the world including the Las Vegas Sands, says Razon solicited its services in 2011 to help develop the resort and then terminated the agreement six months after it opened in 2013. The suit also accuses Razon of working to prevent Global Gaming from selling its rights in the project. The company alleges that Razon has avoided paying the arbitration award and taken actions to stop Global Gaming from collecting. The suit says Razon and agents of his have \u201cformed a vast network of shell companies\u201d in the US to hide his holdings in the county and diverted assets from the Philippines to fund those entities for the benefit of him and his family. A representative for Razon couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment. The suit is Global Gaming vs. Enrique K.

Kai Fook Mansion   image: Huttons Asia Kai Fook Mansion, a 9,999 year leasehold site, sits on a total land area of 1,476.8 sqm (15,896 sqft) and is zoned for \u201cResidential with Commercial at 1st Storey\u201d with an allowable gross plot ratio of 3.0. With the existing total strata area of 49,944 ft\u00b2, the Kai Fook Mansion site could be developed into a 6-storey comprising 41 residential apartments with an average size of 915 ft\u00b2 and approximately 12,500 ft\u00b2 commercial spaces which could house a large hyper-mart, F&B or co-working spaces, subject to planning approval. \u201cThe site offers an excellent redevelopment opportunity for developers to create a contemporary masterpiece within the nostalgic and vibrant Tiong Bahru estate\u201d says Mr Terence Lian, Head of Investment Sales, Huttons Group. Kai Fook Mansion is a mere 3-minute walk to Tiong Bahru Plaza and Tiong Bahru MRT station, which is a convenient location for both amenities and getting around the city. \u201cThe area is a popular choice for both locals and expatriates given its rich cultural heritage, hipster cafes, indie bookstores and its close proximity to the city-centre\u201d Mr Lian added. \u201cThis highly sought-after expatriate enclave will continue to have high demand for sale and rental, as it is not only a great place to live in, relax and mingle, but also has excellent connectivity to the various parts of Singapore\u201d says Ms Angela Lim, Deputy Head of Investment Sales, Huttons Group. The public tender for Kai Fook Mansion closes on Wednesday, 19 May 2021 at 12 noon. Mr Paul Ho, chief mortgage officer at iCompareLoan, said that \u201calthough the Covid-19 circuit breaker makes en bloc sales that much tougher, the site of the Kai Fook Mansion is in a good location and is hard to come by.\u201d The en bloc sales market has been relatively dampened by the cooling measures introduced over the past few years, but has been trying to rear its head again with the low interest rate environment. But developers are wary of end-demand and are hurt by the 5 per cent non-remittable Additional Buyers\u2019 Stamp Duty (ABSD) on land purchase. As such, itt is expected to have an impact on their offer prices.  Before the introduction of the property cooling measures, overall private property prices rose across most market segments, with the largest price surge seen in the Core Central Region and Outside of Central Region. As developers\u2019 existing stock continues to diminish and supply of completed homes remain low, many projects especially those in the CCR have raised prices of their unsold units, some by even double-digits this year. Private residential market continued to gain traction with individual re-sellers have also seized the opportunity of increasing their asking prices in light of the more positive market sentiment fueled by the recent collective sales frenzy.   Story continues Mr Ho suggested that if one\u2019s home is at risk of en bloc, the owner could consider a home loan where there is no locked-in penalty, but instead entails a higher housing interest rate cost. The next best option is to look for packages with a waiver of locked-in penalty due to sale of property. Such owners may contact a mortgage broker to assist them to find such packages with waiver of locked-in penalty.\u201cWith the right loan, the buyer can save thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars,\u201d he said. Adding, \u201cwhich is why they would have to work with established mortgage brokers who can provide them free service.\u201dAs the collective sale fever tries to make a come back, some smaller en bloc projects are getting better results and successes. Ten years ago, when the collective sale scene was more active a number of en bloc sales were called off because the developers were weak and could not raise sufficient capital and loans to complete the transactions. This proved disappointing for some subsidiary proprietors (SP) as they had committed to purchasing their next homes before the en bloc sales were aborted.What happened then is unlikely to be repeated this time around as most developers have built up a huge war chest of capital over the past few years. But still, SP and strata apartment unit owners should get involved and understand the deal that is being put together.KEEPING TRACK OF MILESTONESAs an SP, you should always keep track of all the milestones leading to the conclusion of your en bloc sales- milestones like when your Sales Committee (SC) was formed, Extra-Ordinary General Meetings, Updates from SC, etc. Most importantly don\u2019t rely on any knowledge or information you may have gleaned from your en bloc experience in the past.The en bloc regulations have been more firmly tightened, and the process strictly regulated in the past few years. The tighter laws we now have means the responsibilities of the SC, the property consultants, and the lawyers, are all well defined, which provides for better transparency of the en bloc processes.Timeline and Milestones of an En Bloc Sales ProcessIn order to understand how and whether to go into an En Bloc sales and sign on the Collective Sales Agreement (CSA), you will need to know how long it will take you to complete the En Bloc sales in case it is successful.

What Is a Cluster?\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOur digital lives run on collections of computers tightly linked on high-speed networks, and the latest one is an AI supercomputer called NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.\t\t\t\n\n\nMarch 5, 2021 by Rick Merritt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Everything we do on the internet \u2014 which is just about everything we do these days \u2014 depends on the work of pods, which are also called clusters.\nWhen we stream a hot new TV show, order a pair of jeans or Zoom with grandma, we use clusters. You\u2019re reading this story thanks to pods.\nSo, What Is a Pod? What Is a Cluster?\nA pod or a cluster is simply a set of computers linked by high-speed networks into a single unit.\nComputer architects must have reached, at least unconsciously, for terms rooted in nature. Pea pods and dolphin superpods, like today\u2019s computer clusters, show the power of many individuals working as a team.\nThe Roots of Pods and Superpods\nThe links go deeper. Botanists say pods not only protect and nourish individual peas, they can reallocate resources from damaged seeds to thriving ones. Similarly, a load balancer moves jobs off a failed compute node to a functioning one.\nThe dynamics aren\u2019t much different for dolphins.\nWorking off the coast of the Bahamas, veteran marine biologist Denise Herzing often sees every day the same pods, family groups of perhaps 20 dolphins. And once she encountered a vastly larger group.\n\u201cYears ago, off the Baja peninsula, I saw a superpod. It was very exciting and a little overwhelming because as a researcher I want to observe a small group closely, not a thousand animals spread over a large area,\u201d said the founder of the Wild Dolphin Project.\nFor dolphins, superpods are vital. \u201cThey protect the travelers by creating a huge sensory system, a thousand sets of ears that listen for predators like one super-sensor,\u201d she said, noting the parallels with the clusters used in cloud computing today.\nA data center with multiple clusters or pods can span multiple buildings, and run as a single system.\nPods Sprout in Early Data Centers\nAs companies began computerizing their accounting systems in the early 1960s, they instinctively ganged multiple computers together so they would have backups in case one failed, according to Greg Pfister, a former IBM technologist and an expert on clusters.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure NCR, MetLife and a lot of people did that kind of thing,\u201d said Pfister, author of In Search of Clusters, considered by some the bible of the field.\nIn May 1983, Digital Equipment Corp. packed several of its popular 32-bit VAX minicomputers into what it called a VAXcluster. Each computer ran its own operating system, but they shared other resources, providing IT users with a single system image.\nDiagram of an early PC-based cluster.\nBy the late 1990s, the advent of low-cost PC processors, Ethernet networks and Linux inspired at least eight major research projects that built clusters. NASA designed one with 16 PC motherboards on two 10 Mbit/second networks and dubbed it Beowulf, imagining it slaying the giant mainframes and massively parallel systems of the day.\nCluster Networks Need Speed\nResearchers found clusters could be assembled quickly and offered high performance at low cost, as long as they used high-speed networks to eliminate bottlenecks.\nAnother late \u201890\u2019s project, Berkeley\u2019s Network of Workstations (NoW), linked dozens of Sparc workstations on the fastest interconnects of the day. They created an image of a pod of small fish eating a larger fish to illustrate their work.\nResearchers behind Berkeley\u2019s NoW project envisioned clusters of many small systems out-performing a single larger computer.\nOne researcher, Eric Brewer, saw clusters were ideal for emerging internet apps, so he used the 100-server NoW system as a search engine.\n\u201cFor a while we had the best search engine in the world running on the Berkeley campus,\u201d said David Patterson, a veteran of NoW and many computer research projects at Berkeley.\nThe work was so successful, Brewer co-founded Inktomi, an early search engine built on a NoW-inspired cluster of 1,000 systems. It had many rivals, including a startup called Google with roots at Stanford.\n\u201cThey built their network clusters out of PCs and defined a business model that let them grow and really improve search quality \u2014 the rest was history,\u201d said Patterson, co-author of a popular textbook on computing.\nToday, clusters or pods are the basis of most of the world\u2019s TOP500 supercomputers as well as virtually all cloud computing services. And most use NVIDIA GPUs, but we\u2019re getting ahead of the story.\nPods vs. Clusters: A War of Words\nWhile computer architects called these systems clusters, some networking specialists preferred the term pod. Turning the biological term into a tech acronym, they said POD stood for a \u201cpoint of delivery\u201d of computing services.\nThe term pod gained traction in the early days of cloud computing. Service providers raced to build ever larger, warehouse-sized systems often ordering entire shipping containers, aka pods, of pre-configured systems they could plug together like Lego blocks.\nAn early prototype container delivered to a cloud service provider.\nMore recently, the Kubernetes group adopted the term pod. They define a software pod as \u201ca single container or a small number of containers that are tightly coupled and that share resources.\u201d\nIndustries like aerospace and consumer electronics adopted the term pod, too, perhaps to give their concepts an organic warmth. Among the most iconic examples are the iPod, the forerunner of the iPhone, and the single-astronaut vehicle from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nWhen AI Met Clusters\nIn 2012, cloud computing services heard the Big Bang of AI, the genesis of a powerful new form of computing. They raced to build giant clusters of GPUs that, thanks to their internal clusters of accelerator cores, could process huge datasets to train and run neural networks.\nTo help spread AI to any enterprise data center, NVIDIA packs GPU clusters on InfiniBand networks into NVIDIA DGX Systems. A reference architecture lets users easily scale from a single DGX system to an NVIDIA DGX POD or even a supercomputer-class NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.\nFor example, Cambridge-1, in the United Kingdom, is an AI supercomputer based on a DGX SuperPOD, dedicated to advancing life sciences and healthcare. It\u2019s one of many AI-ready clusters and pods spreading like never before. They\u2019re sprouting like AI itself, in many shapes and sizes in every industry and business.\nLearn more about supercomputing on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Explainer | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA DGX | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A 300-petaflops system now stands on the Link\u00f6ping University (LiU) campus, less than 70 kilometers from his birthplace in south-central Sweden, like a living silicon tribute to innovations yet to come.\n\u201cMany cities in Sweden have a square or street that bears Berzelius\u2019s name, but the average person probably doesn\u2019t know much about him,\u201d said Niclas Andersson, technical director at the National Supercomputer Centre (NSC) at Link\u00f6ping University, which is home to the system based on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.\nThe BerzeLiUs system will be twice as fast as Sweden\u2019s current top computer and would rank among the top 10 percent on the latest list of the world\u2019s TOP500 supercomputers.\nAn Ambitious AI Agenda\nAndersson and others hope many people will feel ripples from the ambitious work planned for the BerzeLiUs supercomputer. For starters, it may initially tackle as many as seven two-year projects that aim to make leaps forward in areas like wireless communications, cybersecurity, large-scale IoT and efficient programming.\nAbove and at top: The BerzeLiUs system. Pictures: Thor Balkhed, Linkoping University.\nIn addition, Swedish researchers can use the system to collaborate with their longstanding research colleagues at Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technical University (NTU) on six new efforts. They include finding new ways to enhance data analytics with visualization, developing more secure AI algorithms and orchestrating multiple AI models to work as one to schedule the NTU\u2019s campus bus network.\nIt\u2019s all part of Sweden\u2019s largest private research initiative focused on AI innovation. Known simply as WASP, the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program is a 15-year effort that\u2019s already recruited a faculty of more than three dozen international researchers and engaged 40 companies.\nBacking Science for a Better World\nThe effort is spearheaded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Sweden\u2019s largest private financier of research. It contributed most of the 5.5 billion kronor ($650 million) for WASP. In a separate gift, the foundation donated 300 million kronor ($36 million) last October to Link\u00f6ping University to build and run the BerzeLiUs supercomputer for WASP and other researchers.\nWASP hosted a virtual event in December that attracted speakers from Ericsson, IKEA, Volvo and SEB Group, one of Sweden\u2019s largest banks. At the event, the foundation\u2019s vice chair, Marcus Wallenberg \u2014 scion of the country\u2019s best-known family of industrialists \u2014 noted the collaboration between academia and industry is vital for research that makes a positive impact on society. In addition, Wallenberg spoke with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at the inauguration of the BerzeLiUs system (see video below).\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that, like early advances in chemistry, AI is becoming part of our daily lives.\n\u201cAI will be everywhere, it will get into many places we can\u2019t imagine at this point,\u201d said Andersson, whose 25-year career at NSC has been devoted to work in high performance computing.\nThe New Formula: HPC+AI\n\u201cHPC traditionally is mostly about simulation; and now, with the advent of AI, simulation becomes an input to new kinds of data analytics that will drive computing to much wider use \u2014 it\u2019s a big trend shift,\u201d he said.\nSpecifically, the BerzeLiUs system will help researchers scale their work to handle the larger datasets and models that power discoveries with AI.\nJ\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius\n\u201cMost people have been working with single machines that are not as powerful as DGX systems, so our most important task in the coming years is to help develop algorithms that can scale; and there are very large problems that can use many GPU nodes,\u201d he said.\nInside the New Machine\nThe BerzeLiUs system consists of 60 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, linked on a 200 Gbit/second NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HDR network. The same network links the processors to 1.5 petabytes of flash memory on four storage servers from DataDirect Networks.\nThe single InfiniBand network ensures data gets into the system fast, and AI is all about data. \u201cBuying more storage might be the first upgrade we will need because 60 DGX A100 systems can suck up a lot of data fast,\u201d Andersson said.\nTo get started quickly, NSC asked NVIDIA and Atos, who managed the build and integration, to configure the system\u2019s software. The stack will include the Atos Codex AI Suite as well as access to NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for GPU-optimized software for AI and HPC.\nIn the end, all the bits and bytes come down to people who, like Berzelius, create advances that drive society forward.\n\u201cWe need many new explorers in the universe of AI because it will infiltrate and transform all disciplines of research,\u201d said Andersson.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Networking | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | High-Performance Computing | NVIDIA A100 | NVIDIA Ampere Architecture | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA in Europe | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

All three GPUs are extremely capable graphics cards by themselves. At the time of this review, we had two RTX 3090 GPUs here in the lab and wondered what type of performance numbers we might generate using an SLI/ NVLink multi-GPU configuration.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3000 series graphics cards are somewhat of a problem. NVIDIA has basically dropped SLI support with the RTX 3000 series graphics cards. Not only does NVIDIA drop support, but most of the graphics cards themselves do not come equipped with the ability to use an SLI or NVLink bridge. NVIDIA has been slowly phasing out the consumer edge connector for this. However, one card in the lineup includes a NVLink edge connector, the RTX 3090.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Heatsink Side 2\nThe latest NVIDIA drivers for the 3000 series of graphics cards will not show SLI options even if one has the NVLink bridge installed. When one opens up the NVIDIA Control Panel and drills down into Manage 3D settings/ Program Settings, the traditional SLI settings are not there with an NVLink bridge in place.\nNVIDIA RTX 3090 SLI Control Panel\nThis phasing-out of SLI in favor of NVLink on higher-end GPUs makes a lot of sense. There is such a large delta between low-end GPUs and high-end data center GPUs that one can often scale in a single GPU system. Still, with NVIDIA seemingly phasing out SLI, we are no longer in the days that one can get two smaller cards for less than a larger card and get a value SLI setup. For our purposes, on the compute side we found that programs that can use multiple GPUs will result in stunning performance results that might very well make the added expense of using two NVIDIA 3000 series GPUs worth the effort.\nWe started off going down the multi-GPU adventure with two RTX 3090 graphics cards, the ASUS ROG Strix RTX 3090 OC and ZOTAC RTX 3090 Trinity. We did have a few problems to overcome. First, the ASUS ROG Strix RTX 3090 OC is simply huge, much like a large brick. A keen observer would also spot the size difference between the two cards hights. The ASUS ROG Strix RTX 3090 OC is 5.51\u2033 tall, while the ZOTAC RTX 3090 Trinity is 4.75\u2033 tall. We found our SLI bridge would not line up as the ZOTAC card was much lower. Being creative and only planning on running this configuration for these benchmarks, we ordered a PCIe x16 Extender Riser cable to lift the ZOTAC card. We now had a fully SLI configured system.\nNVIDIA RTX 3090 NVLink\nClearly, this was not an optimal configuration to run long term, but it did serve for running our benchmarks.\nWe are also going to quickly note that even as GPU prices have drifted upward, GPU-to-GPU connectors have gone from free items in motherboard boxes to $75+ parts.\nASUS ROG STRIX RTX 3090 OC\nThe last item to note. Being able to purchase even a single RTX 3090 is next to impossible unless you head down the second-hand market. Then getting two of the same RTX 3090 graphics is even more difficult. Normally we would want to run two NVIDIA RTX 3090\u2019s that are the same, however, we have to recognize that is not the environment we are in. The prospect of having two different cards is simply a sign of the times. If this was a week or two where availability was tight, then we would understand. Instead, this has been a persistent challenge since the cards launched spanning many quarters.\nZOTAC RTX 3090 Trinity\nWe figured it might be worth the experiment to run our two RTX 3090 graphics cards in an NVLink configuration and see what we might get in our benchmarks. We can then gauge whether going down the multi-GPU (desktop compute) route is even worth it in the first place. For many use cases, the power and cooling requirements will make this impractical to have on the desktop. Having more than two GPUs in a desktop system these days is possible, but the practical aspect will force multi-GPU workloads to data centers and data cabinets.\nThe market has changed since we did our\u00a0dual NVIDIA Titan RTX NVLink and dual NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 NVLink reviews. Part of that is due to NVIDIA\u2019s product lineup while some change is simply due to market conditions.\nNow, it is on to testing.\n\n\n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n\n TAGSAmpereASUSgeforceNVIDIARTX 3000Zotac \nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedinEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n Previous articleJolene Begay at Intel Brings Computer Science to the NavajoNext articleSTH Q1 2021 Update A Letter from the Editor William Harmonhttp://www.servethehome.com  \n \nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAcemagic F3A an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Mini PC with up to 128GB of RAM \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASUS ESC8000A-E13P Review an 8x PCIe GPU Server \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nASRock Rack 4U8G-TURIN2 A Fresh Take on a Classic AI Server Design \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike craspers\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 4, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            10:17 pm                                            \n\n\n\nDarn son that\u2019s the bossliest beast I ever did see!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Dobbs\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            March 5, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:55 am                                            \n\n\n\nDirectX 12 supports multi GPU but has to be enabled by the developers\nNVlink was only available on the 2080 Turing cards \u2013 so only the high end SKU having it \u2013 nothing new.

The issue with that is that, in theory, this is a datacenter use of the GPU and thus violates the Nvidia Terms of Use\u2026 \nAFAIK only Supermicro sells Servers equipped with the RTX 3080\u2026 why they are allowed to do that ? IDK\u2026 considering it is supermicro, they might just not care. \nHere comes the pricing issue though. If you are offering your customers the bigger brands such as HPE and Dell EMC you are stuck with equipping your Servers with the high end datacenter GPUs such the V100S or A100 which cost 6-8 times as much as a RTX 3080 with similar ML perfomance \u2026 on paper. \nNvidia seems to be shooting themselfes in the foot with this. In addition to making my job annoying trying to convince customers that putting a RTX 3080 into their towers should be considered a bad idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEugene\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            April 21, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            1:34 pm                                            \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got exactly the same 2 cards!\nWhat specific riser did you use?

I have configurations where there are 2-4 cards in the computers and when I run applications, they only seem to think that I have 12 GB of GPU memory only.  Even when 2 are NVLinked.  I see the processes spread out amongst the cards, but for large data files, I see that my GPU footprint increase to around 11.5 \u2013 11.7 GB and things slow down when this happens.  Thus, GPU memory seems to be the bottle neck that I have been running into (12 GB on the 3080ti and the 2080ti).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrett\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            February 10, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            At\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            12:49 pm                                            \n\n\n\nWhile getting cards has been a little difficult, it isn\u2019t that hard to source a pair of the same cards.

First, become a master of your network.\nTwitch-class champions in cloud gaming shred Wi-Fi and broadband waves. They cultivate good ping to defeat two enemies \u2014 latency and jitter.\nWhat Is Latency?\u00a0\nLatency or lag is a delay in getting data from the device in your hands to a computer in the cloud and back again.\nWhat Is Jitter?\nJitter is the annoying disruption you feel that leads to yelling at your router, (\u201cYou\u2019re breaking up, again!\u201d) when pieces of that data (called packets) get sidetracked.\nWhy Are Latency and Jitter Important?\nCloud gaming works by rendering game images on a custom GFN server that may be miles away, those images are then sent to a game server, and finally appear on the device in front of you.\nWhen you fire at an enemy, your device sends data packets to these servers. The kill happens on the game on those servers, sending back commands that display the win on your screen.\nAnd it all happens in less than the blink of an eye. In technical terms, it\u2019s measured in \u201cping.\u201d\nWhat Is Ping?\nPing in is the time in milliseconds it takes a data packet to go to the server and back.\nAnyone with the right tools and a little research can prune their ping down to less than 30 milliseconds. Novices can get pummeled with as much as 300 milliseconds of lag. It\u2019s the difference between getting or being the game-winning kill.\nBefore we describe the ways to crush latency and jitter, let\u2019s take its measure.\nTo Measure Latency, Test Your Ping\nSpeedtest.net and speedsmart.net are easy to take, but they only measure the latency to a generic server that may be in your network.\nIt doesn\u2019t measure the time it takes to get data to and from the server you\u2019re connecting to for your cloud gaming session. For a more accurate gauge of your ping, some cloud gaming services, such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW, sport their own built-in test for network latency. Those network tests will measure the ping time to and the respective cloud gaming server.\nBlazing Wi-Fi and broadband can give your ping some zing.\n\nMy Speedtest result showed a blazing 10 milliseconds, while Speedsmart measured a respectable 23ms.\nYour mileage may vary, too. If it sticks its head much up over 30ms, the first thing to do is check your ISP or network connection. Still having trouble? Try rebooting. Turn your device and your Wi-Fi network off for 10 seconds, then turn them back on and run the tests again.\nHow to Reduce Latency and Ping\nIf the lag remains, more can be done for little or no cost, and new capabilities are coming down the pike that will make things even better.\nFirst, try to get off Wi-Fi. Simply running a standard Ethernet cable from your Wi-Fi router to your device can slash latency big time.\nIf you can\u2019t do that, there are still plenty of ways to tune your Wi-Fi.\nEthernet is faster, but research from CableLabs shows most gamers use Wi-Fi.\nYour ping may be stuck in heavy traffic. Turn off anything else running on your Wi-Fi network, especially streaming videos, work VPNs \u2014 hey, it\u2019s time for play \u2014 and anyone trying to download the Smithsonian archives.\nA High Five Can Avoid Interference\nIf rush-hour traffic is unavoidable on your home network, you can still create your own diamond lane.\nUnless you have an ancient Wi-Fi access point (AP, for short \u2014 often referred to as a router) suitable for display in a museum, it should support both 2.4- and 5GHz channels.\nYou can claw back many milliseconds of latency if you shunt most of your devices to the 2.4GHz band and save 5GHz for cloud gaming.\nApps called Wi-Fi analyzers on the Android and iTunes stores can even determine which slices of your Wi-Fi airspace are more or less crowded. A nice fat 80MHz channel in the 5GHz band without much going on nearby is an ideal runway for cloud gaming.\nQuash Latency with QoS\nIf it\u2019s less than a decade old, your AP probably has something called quality of service, or QoS.\nQoS can give some apps higher priority than others. APs vary widely in how they implement QoS, but it\u2019s worth checking to see if your network can be set to give priority to cloud gaming.\nNVIDIA provides a list of the recommended AP it\u2019s tested with GeForce NOW as well as a support page for how to apply QoS and other techniques.\nTake a Position Against Latency\nIf latency persists, see if you can get physically closer to your AP. Can you move to the same room?\nIf not, consider buying a mesh network. That\u2019s a collection of APs you can string around your home, typically with Ethernet cables, so you have an AP in every room where you use Wi-Fi.\nSome folks suggest trying different positions for your router and your device to get the sweetest reception. But others say this will only shave a millisecond or so off your lag at best, so don\u2019t waste too much time playing Wi-Fi yoga.\nStay Tuned for Better Ping\nThe good news is more help is on the way. The latest version, Wi-Fi 6, borrows a connection technology from cellular networks (called OFDMA) that reduces signal interference significantly, reducing latency.\nSo, if you can afford it, get a Wi-Fi 6 AP, but you\u2019ll have to buy a gaming device that supports Wi-Fi 6, too.\nNext year, Wi-Fi 6E devices should be available. They\u2019ll sport a new 6MHz Wi-Fi band where you can find fresh channels for gaming.\nCoping with Internet Latency\nYour broadband connection is the other part of the net you need to set up for cloud gaming. First, make sure your internet plan matches the kind of cloud gaming you want to play.\nThese days a basic plan tops out at about 15 Mbits/second. That\u2019s enough if your screen can display 1280\u00d7720 pixels, aka standard high definition or 720p. If you want a smoother, more responsive experience, step up to 1080p resolution, full high def or even 4K ultra-high def \u2014 this requires at least 25 Mbits/s. More is always better.\nIf you\u2019re playing on a smartphone, 5G cellular services are typically the fastest links, but in some areas a 4G LTE service may be well optimized for gaming. It\u2019s worth checking the options with your cellular provider.\nWhen logging into your cloud gaming service, choosing the closest server can make a world of difference.\nFor example, using the speedsmart.net test gave me a ping of 29ms from a server in San Francisco, 41 miles away. Choosing a server in Atlanta, more than 2,000 miles away, bloated my ping to 80ms. And forget about even trying to play on a server on another continent.\nGeForce NOW members can sit back and relax on this one. The service automatically picks the fastest server for you, even if the server is a bit farther away.\nA Broadband Horizon for Cloud Gaming\nInternet providers want to tame the latency and jitter in their broadband networks, too.\nCable operators plan to upgrade their software, called DOCSIS 3.1, to create low-latency paths for cloud gamers. A version of the software, called L4S, for other kinds of internet access providers and Wi-Fi APs is also in the works.\nBroadband latency should shrink to a fraction of its size (from blue to red in the chart) once low-latency DOCSIS 3.1 software is available and supported.\n\nThe approach requires some work on the part of application developers and cloud gaming services. But the good news is engineers and developers across all these companies are engaged in the effort and it promises dramatic reductions in latency and jitter, so stay tuned.\nNow you know the basics of navigating network latency to become a champion cloud gamer, so go hit \u201cplay.\u201d\nLearn more about latency on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\nFollow GeForce NOW on Facebook\u00a0and Twitter and stay up to date on the latest features and game launches.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | Gaming | How ToTags: Cloud Gaming | Gaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Stating, without irony, that the RTX 3080 Ti \"is almost certain to be released around mid-April\" could be setting itself up for a fall should that turn out to be little more than an early April Fool's joke.But, given the fact that more and more potential GeForce RTX 3080 Ti noises have been echoing around the incestuous world of hardware rumour-mongers, the old no smokey, fire, fire adage would seem to apply here.\u00a0It seems very likely now that the RTX 3080 Ti is on the Nvidia roadmap this year, but, as we've reported before, seemingly in a very different guise to the original 20GB version that was planned for after the initial GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 cards were released.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nA European storefront listing suggests the RTX 5070 Ti may be launching on February 20 and there might actually be a good reason to believe it\n\n\n\nWe certainly know of one GPU partner who had the 20GB version planned in, but scrapped it seemingly once the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT and Radeon RX 6900 XT cards were released.The latest speculative specs for the RTX 3080 Ti have it sporting the same 12GB of VRAM as the recently launched GeForce RTX 3060, but using GDDR6X instead. It's also suggested that the GA102 core is going to come with 10,240 CUDA cores as opposed to the full 10,496 that had originally been suggested.Virtual reality(Image credit: Valve)Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VRWe're also pretty confident that when Nvidia's Collete Kress says that \"Starting with the 3060, we're taking an important step to maximize the supply of GeForce GPUs for gamers,\" she means that we can expect new cards with Ethereum hash rate limiters to be released this year. So long as that limiter remains unhacked...A mid-April RTX 3080 Ti release date does at least make sense, given that we'll be over six months on from the original Ampere launch.

The GeForce RTX 3050, in particular, has leaked out today in the form of its GPU-z screenshot which was posted over at Bilibili (via Videocardz).\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Mobility Discrete GPU Spotted, Features GA107 GPU With 2048 Cores & 4 GB GDDR6 Memory\nThe specifications for both NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics cards for the mobility platform were leaked out a few weeks back. We were able to confirm the most basic specifications and now we've got a more exact look at what they are going to be (at least for the Non-Ti variant). The GeForce RTX 3050 series cards will be targetting the budget gaming segment with desktop cards priced within a sub-$250 US range while the laptops based on these cards will retail at under $599 US considering the RTX 3060 laptops start at $999 US.\nRelated Story Watch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For UnveilingSo coming to the specifications, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Non-Ti variant is based on the N20Z-QS1-A1 GPU SKU (Ampere GA107) which features 16 SM units or 2048 CUDA cores. GPU-z can't tell the exact clock speeds that the GPU features and only reports a base clock of 300 MHz and a boost clock of 795 MHz which are a far cry from its final clocks. The GPU also carries 4 GB of GDDR6 video memory which operates across a 128-bit bus at speeds of 12 Gbps, delivering a total bandwidth of 192 GB/s.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU was reportedly running on a Dell machine on a PCIe Gen 3.0 interface which suggests it was either running on an AMD Ryzen 5000 or an Intel 10th Gen Comet Lake CPU based notebook considering these are the only two options that offer Gen 3 interface & Intel's 11th Gen Tiger Lake CPUs are the only notebook offerings that come with PCIe Gen 4.\nThe other key feature is that the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti is listed as an \"RTX\" variant. Previously, ray tracing was kept exclusive to **60 series graphics cards and above but this changes with Ampere and now we can get ray tracing on entry-level graphics cards too. However, the pricing of the GPU will be higher with the RTX 3050 Ti expected to be set at around $229-$279 US while the RTX 3050 will cost just slightly below the sub-$200 US range. Expect more details on these cards along with several laptop configurations in the coming months.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Mobility GPU Lineup:\n\n\n\nGPU NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 ANVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n\n\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 4NTSMC 4NSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nGPU SKUGA107GA107AD106GA107GA106GA104GA104GA104GA103\n\n\nSMs161614203040464858\n\n\nCUDA Cores204820481792256038405120588861447424\n\n\nBase Clock1057 MHz1042 MHzTBD1035 MHz1283 MHz1290 MHz1035 MHz1245 MHz1125 MHz\n\n\nBoost Clock1740 MHz1470 MHzTBD1695 MHz1703 MHz1620 MHz1485 MHz1710 MHz1590 MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock12 Gbps14 GbpsTBD12 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps16 Gbps\n\n\nMemory TypeGDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Size4 GB6 GB4 GB4 GB6 GB8 GB8 GB8/16 GB16 GB\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit96-bit64-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit\n\n\nBandwidth192 GB/s168 GB/sTBD192 GB/s336 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s448 GB/s512 GB/s\n\n\nTGP35-95W35-95W35-50W35-95W60-115W80-125W80 - 125W80-150W+175W\n\n\nConfigurationsMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PTBDMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-PMax-Q\nMax-P\n\n\nLaunchQ2 2021Q1 20242024?Q2 2021Q1 2021Q1 2021Q1 2022Q1 2021Q1 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n91\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n51\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n35\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n34\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

With many things going on concurrently: the ongoing global pandemic, trade war, and cryptocurrency mining boom, that's the situation we find ourselves in at the moment.\nThe first batch of reviews of the RTX 3060 went live about ten days ago, and while we had to delay ours, on the plus side this allowed us to take a more accurate look at pricing and post-launch availability. Of course, we have the usual array of benchmarks to go over and we'll jump into that in a moment.\n\nThe RTX 3060 is based on the new GA106 die which measures 300mm2 and packs 3584 cores, 112 TMUs and 48 ROPs. That's 26% fewer cores and TMUs than the 3060 Ti version, but 40% fewer ROPs due to the downgrade from a 256-bit wide memory bus to 192-bit. Helping to minimize that reduction is higher clocked 15 Gbps GDDR6 memory which provides a peak bandwidth of 360 GB/s, so just a 20% reduction from the 3060 Ti.\nThis change to the memory subsystem meant that Nvidia couldn't pair the RTX 3060 with 8GB of VRAM. The options were essentially 6GB or 12GB. The former would have been embarrassing at this price point and with AMD set to release their mid-range parts with 12GB, Nvidia had little choice.\n\nIt also helps them to market the RTX 3060 and justify the $330 asking price which sees it come in just 18% cheaper than the 3060 Ti despite the significant reduction to the core configuration. On paper, the RTX 3060 doesn't appear to be a great value product, assuming all models sold at the MSRP, but we'll of course conduct a full performance evaluation and then work out where it lands in terms of cost per frame.\n\n\nFor testing we're still using the Ryzen 9 3950X test system as we progress on updating everything to be tested under the R9 5950X. Expect all that data once we get through this latest round of product releases. The test system is configured with 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory.\n\nWe're going to look at the 1080p and 1440p data for half a dozen of the 14 games tested before we jump into our usual performance breakdown graphs.\n\nBenchmarks\nStarting with Watch Dogs Legion at 1080p, we see that the RTX 3060 is good for just 61 fps on average, making it slightly slower than the previous generation Radeon 5700 XT. A disappointing result to see in an Nvidia sponsored title. We're basically looking at RTX 2070-like performance, so $500 GPU performance from 3 years ago.\n\n\nThe margins are fairly similar at 1440p, at least relative to other GeForce GPUs such as the RTX 2070. The RTX 3060 manages to match the 5700 XT here, so that's certainly an improvement over what we saw at 1080p, but it's still 21% slower than the 3060 Ti.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is an AMD sponsored title and here the 5700 XT is well ahead of the RTX 3060 delivering 22% more frames. Again, the 3060 is comparable to the RTX 2070 and 8% slower than the 2070 Super. Relative to the 3060 Ti it does well a 13% deficit here, though we are only at 1080p.\nThe margin remains much the same at 1440p, where the 3060 was 14% slower than the 3060 Ti and 15% slower than the 5700 XT. It does match the vanilla RX 5700 and that means it's just a few frames faster than the RTX 2070.\n\n\nThe RTX 3060 like most modern GPUs performs well in Death Stranding at 1080p, hitting 129 fps on average to match the GTX 1080 Ti and RX 5700. That said it's 11% slower than the 5700 XT and 19% slower than the 3060 Ti.\nThe 1440p data is mostly more of the same: 10% slower than the 5700 XT and now 20% slower than the 3060 Ti. It matches the RX 5700 again, so it was 9% faster than the RTX 2070.\n\n\nYou can play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 at 1080p maxed out with the RTX 3060, though you are only looking at performance that's equivalent to the RTX 2060 Super, RTX 2070 or RX 5700 with 40 fps on average.\nThen at 1440p it roughly matches the 5700 XT and RTX 2070 with 32 fps on average. This is just playable in our opinion \u2013 certainly not good enough for a shooter-style game, but for this simulator it works.\n\n\nMoving on we have Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Here the RTX 3060 rendered 123 fps on average at 1080p which sees it match the 5700 XT to come in 21% slower than the 3060 Ti. When compared to the previous generation base model RTX 2060 which came in at a similar price, the 3060 is 18% faster.\nAt 1440p we drop to what's still a highly playable 83 fps. Again, the RTX 3060 is seen matching the 5700 XT, making it 23% slower than the 3060 Ti.\n\n\nIn Rainbow Six Siege at 1080p, the RTX 3060 is good for 292 fps, which makes it a little faster than the 2070 Super and places it roughly on par with the RTX 2080 and 5700 XT. It's some 12% faster than the similarly priced RX 5700, though that's not exactly progress.\nWe find that the 1440p data is similar with the RTX 3060 on par with the 2070 Super and 5700 XT, making it marginally faster than a vanilla 5700, but 21% slower than the 3060 Ti.\nPerformance Summary\nHere's a look at the 14 game average data running at 1080p. The RTX 3060 is just 6% faster than the RX 5700, which is not great considering the MSRP is ~6% lower. When compared to the two-year-old AMD GPU, you're getting on average 6% more performance for what should be a 6% price saving, amazing stuff.\n\nCompared to Nvidia's previous offerings, the RTX 3060 looks a bit more impressive, offering 15% more performance than the two-year-old RTX 2060 Super which cost 18% less. Of course, Turing was never great value, but looking exclusively at Nvidia products, the 3060 is quite good.\n\nThe 1440p data tells a similar story, where the RTX 3060 is on average 8% faster than the RX 5700 and 5% slower than the 5700 XT. It's also 17% faster than the RTX 2060 Super and 22% slower than the 3060 Ti.\n\nCost per Frame\nNow let's take a look at the controversial MSRP-based cost per frame data. There are RTX 3060 cards listed for $330 at several retailers including Newegg, but whether or not they'll ever have stock for those models is hard to say. They certainly don't right now and that's hardly surprising. When compared to AMD, the situation does look better, the RX 6800 for example has an MSRP of $580, yet the cheapest model over on Newegg is $680 with most priced well over $700 and all out of stock.\nIt's possible that MSRP pricing for out of stock GeForce cards is a ploy to claim the MSRP at launch, with card makers advertising base model cards that won't get stocked anytime soon. We can't say if that theory is correct though, given we've heard from people who managed to snap up RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 models at the MSRP at some point. Whatever the case may be, supply of those models is even more limited and clearly for the vast majority of shoppers the MSRP means nothing.\nThose reading weeks or months into the future, when GPUs are back to regular pricing, here's how the RTX 3060 stacks up at the claimed MSRP...\n\nFor $330, the GeForce RTX 3060 is slightly worse than the 3060 Ti in terms of cost per frame, coming in at a 6% premium. Given the RTX 3060 Ti is 12% better value than the RTX 3070, you'd expect the 3060 to cost no more than $280, so $50 less than the actual MSRP. Compared to previous-gen GPUs such as the Radeon 5700 XT, the RTX 3060 is just a 14% improvement in cost per frame.\nAs of writing, major tech retailers didn't have a single RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti or 3060 in stock. Even the bundles where you have to buy a motherboard and memory were out of stock. That means if you want to buy a graphics card now, your best bet is to pay scalper prices over on eBay, something we strongly recommend you resist doing.\nIn the following graph we're looking at the average sale price of completed listings for new products over the past week on eBay. We've manually gathered this data and any dodgy listings, like a $500 RTX 3090, for example, were ignored.\n\nOf this bunch, the cheapest model was the GeForce RTX 2060 for $505 on average, roughly a 45% increase over the MSRP, resulting in a cost per frame of $8.01 when it should be $5.55.\nThe RTX 3060 comes in at $9.44 per frame, and while that does make it the cheapest of the GeForce 30 series, it was only a percent cheaper than the RTX 3070.\nAdmittedly though, this data is meaningless when you consider the average sale price of the RTX 3060 was $793, a staggering 140% markup over the MSRP. Certainly no one should pay that for an RTX 3060, but that's the bleak and realistic outlook for cards that are more readily available.\n\nRay Tracing and DLSS Performance\nBefore wrapping up, we wanted to take a quick look at ray tracing and DLSS performance along with power consumption and overclocking. For ray tracing testing, do note we're using the second highest quality preset for the three games, so not the minimum in-game quality settings. We're also testing at 1440p only (and not 1080p) as that makes better sense when you're prioritizing visual quality over high frame rates.\n\nIn Watch Dogs Legion at 1440p, the RTX 3060 was good for just 62 fps on average at the native resolution. Enabling quality DLSS boosted the frame rate by 30% to 81 fps, a very nice performance upgrade.\nWith medium quality ray tracing enabled with DLSS, the frame rate dropped below 60 fps to 54 fps on average. Not amazing, but certainly still playable. Then with ultra-quality ray tracing the frame rate dropped to 49 fps, not great but the game is still playable depending on your requirements. Without the aid of DLSS the game was unplayable using ray tracing on the RTX 3060 at 1440p as frame rates dropped well below 40 fps.\nWhen compared to the RTX 2060, the 3060 was 13% faster when comparing native performance or DLSS-enabled performance. However, with ray tracing enabled the RTX 3060 was much more efficient, delivering up to 26% better performance.\nThis also shows just how poorly AMD's RDNA2 GPUs perform with ray tracing enabled, at least in these Nvidia optimized titles. Here the RX 6800 was 65% faster than the RTX 3060 without ray tracing, but with it enabled the Radeon GPU was just 31% faster and 16% faster with the ultra quality RT setting.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider only uses ray tracing for shadows and DLSS doesn't work nearly as well in this title, offering almost no performance uplift without ray tracing enabled. This time the RTX 3060 was 16-20% faster than the 2060 with ray tracing, while it was 11% faster for straight rasterization performance.\n\nThe performance uplift offered by DLSS in Control is massive. The RTX 3060 was 61% faster with DLSS enabled, so medium quality ray tracing with DLSS enabled was able to match native resolution performance, though do keep in mind we're only testing the game using the medium quality preset.\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 was 25% faster than the RTX 2060 for rasterization performance and we saw similar margins with ray tracing and DLSS enabled.\nPower Consumption\n\nThe RTX 3060 isn't particularly impressive in the power consumption front, using only slightly less power than the RTX 3060 Ti, or at least that was the case for the Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle model we used for testing. When compared to the RTX 3060 Ti, we're looking at a mere 2% reduction in total system power usage.\n\nHere's a better look at graphics card power consumption using PCAT. We find that the RTX 3060 does consume 12% less power than the 3060 Ti, but given it was on average 22% slower, that's not a good result for power efficiency. It's a little more efficient than the 2060 Super, for example, consuming 6% more power for 17% more performance on average, not amazing but it's an improvement.\n\nA very brief look at overclocking has the Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3060 overclocked from the stock boost frequency of 1777 MHz up to 1997 MHz, which resulted in a sustained in-game clock speed of 2.1 GHz. The memory also overclocked from the stock 15 Gbps transfer speed to 17.2 Gbps.\nThis manual overclock improved performance in Shadow of the Tomb Raider by 10%, taking the average frame rate from 83 fps up to 91 fps to match the RTX 2070 Super in this title. That's a pretty typical Ampere overclock.\nWhat We Learned\nUnder normal conditions, as in you could buy graphics cards around the MSRP, the GeForce RTX 3060 would be a bit of a flop. It brings nothing new to the table, it's technically worse value than the RTX 3060 Ti, and while it does pack more VRAM, at this price point 8GB is enough, at least for now.\n\nPut the VRAM factor aside and you can see the RTX 3060 has very little going for it. For RTX 2060 owners it's a very small upgrade, and it's almost a side grade for 2060 Super owners, while it's a downgrade for anyone with a 5700 XT.\nIf you own a GPU from a prior generation, like the GTX 1060 or even at GTX 1070, then the RTX 3060 is a decent upgrade in terms of performance, but you'd be better off spending a little more on the Ti version or waiting to see what AMD does at this price point.\n\nWhich of course, brings us to the present situation. At the moment, Nvidia has no incentive to make the RTX 3060 a killer value. Nvidia can still present this price point and sell as many cards as they can produce, evidenced by the fact that it sold out instantly. Even if the market returned to normalcy later in 2021 \u2013 something we're not expecting \u2013 Nvidia could simply refresh the 3060 series with a Super variant and adjust pricing to whatever is appropriate then.\n\nBottom line, the GeForce RTX 3060 isn't a bad product, it's technically very good, but pricing is simply not attractive to make it a compelling upgrade \u2013 but wait \u2013 all of that won't matter right now as gamers and miners fight over any GPU stock available. Until things improve, we don't expect Nvidia or AMD to release any good value GPUs while demand remains exceedingly high.\nShopping Shortcuts:\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3070 on Amazon\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 on Amazon\nAMD Radeon RX 6800 on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 9 5900X on Amazon\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600X on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 28\n\n\n Got something to say?

Users looking to get their hands on the high-performance GPU as soon as it hits the shelves might want to set their eyes on the following retailers.Also Read :\nRTX 3080-Powered PC Shoes Take the Internet by Storm, But What is It Exactly?RTX 3080: Best Places to Buy OnlineOn Monday, March 29, A Techradar article recommends users to keep their eyes on the following retailer sites to have better chances of getting the RTX 3080.eBayUsers who wish to get their hands on the RTX 3080 fast despite its inflated prices may opt to buy the GPU from eBay. However, recent listings almost always end up skyrocketing to $2,000 or above.AmazonThe country's e-commerce giant has been spotted to have the RTX 3080 in stock consistently, but restock announcements are at random. Users may need to keep their eyes peeled as restocks happen without a pattern.DellFor those looking to buy a whole PC with RTX 3080 installed, one may choose to spend money on Dell's pre-built desktop PC. Apart from the GPU, Dell's Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 gaming desktop comes with the AMD RyzenTM 7 5800X processor that features the \"Zen 3\" Architecture for incredible energy efficiency and lower latency.GameStopGameStop may have recently started carrying GPUs, but enthusiasts have seen the videogame retailer offering the RTX 3080 coupled with next-gen console restocks.Best BuyBest Buy is perhaps the best place to find the RTX 3080 in the country as it offers the fastest and easiest way to check out as soon as the GPU becomes available. Users could check out with Best Buy faster than their competitors could as long as they have their address and credit card details correctly set ahead of time.Why is the RTX 3080 always out of stock?WePC weighed Nvidia RTX 3080's availability issue and published its speculations in an article dated February 25.According to them, one huge factor to the GPU's scarcity comes from the impact of the ongoing pandemic.People worldwide have been trying to stay at home, and the disposable income freed up thanks to the new lifestyle prompted them to be scrolling for things to buy more often.The increase in demand also gave rise to a practice called \"scalping,\" wherein resellers buy a particular item in bulk for the sole purpose of selling them at incredibly high prices.Related Article:\nNvidia RTX 3080 Reaches $1,300 Average Selling Mark on eBay, 85% Above MSRP\n\nThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by Lee Mercado  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

As of the moment, GPUs have now become extremely expensive to purchase as their prices have skyrocketed past the ceiling.GPU price hikeFor the series of the past six months, every single CPU, GPU, and all of the desires of console gamers have been extremely difficult leaning towards impossible as gamers find it hard to purchase. Now, buying the parts or the new consoles would take an extreme amount of luck, skill, or maybe even the willingness to pay scalpers a monthly fee in order to increase the chances of buying the new GPUs.The situation has become really brutal for everyone in the market as things have become extremely difficult for both PC gamers and console buyers. Starting off with the good news, a new analysis that was done by The Verge on Tuesday, March 23, shows that the markedup prices for the PlayStation 5 is slowly coming down.PS5 scalpers going down?A number of third-party vendors on eBay are now reportedly selling the console for a lower price, as of the moment. Sean Hollister now writes that over the course of a seven-day period, eBay has now moved the 5,284 PS5 consoles as well as a number of PS5s that were reportedly not sold. PS5 scalping has finally become less profitable and eBay is definitely getting flooded as things start to slow down.The Nvidia RTX 3090 retail price is originally at $1,499 which is already quite large in a way but due to scalpers and the scarcity of this GPU, prices as of March 2021 have reached $2,985.According to the story by ExtremeTech, GPU manufacturers still expect Nvidia GP availability to remain quite scarce moving into Q3, 2021 and like always, the holiday demand on Q4 will also be quite rough for interested buyers.Read Also: Intel Xe HPG GPU Might Launch Next Week: 512 Execution Units, 4,096 Cores, and 12GB DDR6Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti priceWhile people try to remain positive when it comes to prices, the global chip shortage has just really made it harder on everyone and definitely more expensive for gamers to purchase a good GPU or a gaming console. Another article by Extreme Tech even shows the price of GPUs go up for the simple lower end GPU.The Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti which is a pretty standard GPU has increased in price. The original retail price of the GPU should supposedly only run $140 but due to the global shortage as well as scalpers increasing the prices, the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti price now costs $200 which is pretty steep for a pretty fair and lower end GPU as opposed to those expensive ones. While it used to be for rare higher-end GPUs to be scalped, scalpers now move towards lower-end GPUs as well.\n\nRelated Article: Digital PS5 Owners Will be Able to Use DVDs with This Add-OnThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by Urian Buenconsejo  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Aggressive cyclists expect their bikes to meet their every need, no matter how detailed and precise. And meeting these needs requires an entirely new approach.\nPredator Cycling engineers and manufactures high-end custom-built carbon fiber bicycles that have garnered praise from championship cyclists around the world. For the past 15 years, the Predator team has designed every aspect of their frames and conducted intensive engineering simulation, rendering and manufacturing processes in-house.\n\u201cI had been following Predator for over a decade, and knew there was only one guy, Aram, who could take my raw idea, refine it, and turn it into a finished product worthy of use on track cycling\u2019s biggest stage,\u201d said Olympic cyclist Bobby Lea.\nRecently, Predator Cycling worked on its most innovative project to date \u2014 the new RF20 frame. With increasing costs of materials and the complexity of production requirements, the RF20 spent extended time in research and development.\nTo bring the RF20 to market at a competitive price and minimize the build time of each bicycle, Predator Cycling knew it needed to maximize performance and efficiency. The team found the exact solution it needed with the Lenovo ThinkStation P620, powered by the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.\nThe RTX A6000 enables Predator Cycling to process more complex models, and render and run engineering simulations in real time. With the ThinkStation P620, the team can easily handle real-time computing and multitasking, allowing them to accelerate production workflows.\n\nRTX Hammers to the Front in Every Stage\u00a0\nSince using the RTX A6000-powered ThinkStation P620, Predator Cycling has streamlined their manufacturing processes significantly. This allowed them to speed up production workflows and bring the RF20 frame out of R&D and get it out on the road. Overall, the company estimates it has shrunk its go-to-market timelines by 12-16 weeks.\n\u201cThe NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU and ThinkStation P620 deliver cutting-edge performance and speed to accelerate design processes and production times,\u201d said Aram Goganian, co-founder of Predator Cycling. \u201cWe\u2019re able to do complex wind drag simulations, mechanical and structural testing, and topology optimizations with AI in near real time, enabling us to show customers design changes with minimal delay.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just projects like the RF20 frame that have been significantly accelerated \u2014 Predator Cycling\u2019s relationships and interactions with customers have also been enhanced.\u00a0\n\nEach of Predator Cycling\u2019s bikes is custom-built, so customers need real-life representations to help them select the components and finishes they want. Previously, this meant building physical prototypes that took months to complete.\nNow, the powerful RTX A6000 has allowed the Predator team to provide customers with realistic bike renders long before they create physical prototypes. Clients can provide instant feedback on the photorealistic renders, which allows Predator Cycling to skip continuous iteration cycles and go from prototyping to testing fast.\nPredator Cycling produces photorealistic bike renders in real time, saving weeks in their go-to-market timeline from producing physical prototypes. Image courtesy of Predator Cycling.\nPredator Cycling has also notably improved internal workflows when it comes to running simulations, and they\u2019ve seen performance gains of 2-6x across a number of applications such as Luxion KeyShot, ANSYS Discovery, ANSYS Fluent and Autodesk Fusion 360.\nLearn more about Predator Cycling.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | Ray Tracing | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And it\u2019s certainly been worth the wait, writes Greg Corke\n\n\nNvidia first announced its new Nvidia RTX A6000 workstation GPU back in October 2020. But like many IT products in the year of Covid-19, it was delayed and we\u2019ve been eagerly awaiting its arrival.\nAnd now it\u2019s finally here \u2013 or rather, it should be, by the time you read this. UK firm Scan should have availability of the PNY Nvidia RTX A6000 from 3 March and sent us a sample to review inside its new 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T AMD Ryzen Threadripper workstation, which we take a closer look at here.\nTuned for visualisation workflows, the Nvidia RTX A6000 (A for Ampere) is Nvidia\u2019s second-generation RTX GPU. With an emphasis on hardware-based ray tracing, it promises to deliver more than double the GPU rendering performance of its predecessor, the Turing-based Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000. And, of course, it also offers a significant boost for 3D graphics, VR and AI workflows. And all for \u00a33,730 + VAT.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 is the first workstation GPU to be built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture, and also the first to support PCIe Gen 4. With double the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 3, it should mean data can move in and out of the GPU quicker, but it won\u2019t benefit all workflows. PCIe Gen 4 is currently only available in workstations with the latest AMD CPUs.\nWhat? No Quadro?\nThe observant among you will have noticed that the Nvidia RTX A6000 is missing something. Yes, after 17 years, it appears that Nvidia is retiring its Quadro brand.\nFor someone who has written about Nvidia professional GPUs since the early 2000s, it\u2019s hard to get used to this change. And, it would seem, Nvidia is struggling too. For the October launch, product photos were sent out with \u2018Nvidia Quadro RTX A6000\u2019 in the file name, which suggests a last-minute rebranding.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nBut the Nvidia RTX A6000 is certainly a Quadro card in everything but name. It has certified drivers for pro applications, renowned reliability, ECC memory and plenty of niche features for pro visualisation, such as stereo and Frame Lock for viz clusters. There\u2019s also support for Nvidia virtual GPU (vGPU) software, which allows a workstation to be repurposed into multiple high performance virtual workstation instances.\nWith 48 GB of VRAM, the Nvidia RTX A6000 has the most memory of any professional GPU \u2013 on par with the Quadro RTX 8000, and double that of the Quadro RTX 6000.\nThis is particularly relevant for those working with high poly count models and very high-resolution textures in GPU renderers or real-time visualisation/VR. But more on this later.\nWhat\u2019s more, two Nvidia RTX A6000s can be bridged together with an NVLink adapter to create a memory pool of 96 GB. However, sharing geometry between two GPUs can come with a significant performance hit.\nBeauty and the beast\nNvidia\u2019s product design team has really gone to town on the Nvidia RTX A6000 and the card is a thing of beauty, with a minimal angular design and black mirror finish. NVLink, Stereo and Sync connectors are all hidden away behind discrete panels.\nThe board is rated at 300W, so you\u2019ll need a fairly hefty PSU in your workstation. It gets its power from a special 8-pin connector, which is connected to two standard 8-pin PSU connectors via an adapter. It is cooled by two fans, top and bottom. There are four DisplayPort 1.4a connectors nestled below a heat sink.\nTesting the RTX A6000\nWe put the PNY Nvidia RTX A6000 through a series of real-world application benchmarks, both for GPU rendering and real-time visualisation.\nThe GPU is simply overkill for current generation CAD and BIM software, so we didn\u2019t do any testing in that regard. However, it\u2019s important to note that it will still be certified for the likes of Solidworks, PTC Creo and Siemens NX, which is useful if you plan to use those kinds of applications alongside more viz-focused tools like Chaos V-Ray, Luxion KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize.\nThe full spec of our Scan 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T test machine can be seen below.\nYou can read a full review here.\nScan 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X (32C/64T) (3.7GHz \u2013 4.5GHz)\nGraphics card: Nvidia RTX A6000 (48 GB) (461.09 driver)\nMemory: 128 GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600MHz DDR4\nSystem drive: 2TB WD Black SN850 PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD\nStorage drive: 4TB Samsung 860 EVO SSD\nMotherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX TRX40-E\nCase: Fractal Design Define 7\nCPU cooler: Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360\nPower supply: Corsair RM1000i \u2013 80PLUS Gold\nOperating system: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit\nPrice \u00a37,500 + VAT\nFor comparison, we used a Quadro RTX 4000 and historic data from the Quadro RTX 6000 GPU (457.09 driver), tested in a Lenovo ThinkStation P620 workstation with AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3995WX CPU and 128 GB RAM.\nRendering with RTX A6000\nGPU rendering has now reached a stage where it is becoming ubiquitous. While renderers built into CAD applications still tend to rely on the CPU, most of the major design viz focused renderers now offer a GPU rendering capability. They can also take full advantage of Nvidia RTX technology, including the dedicated Ray Tracing cores and Tensor cores for AI denoising.\nAs a side note, it\u2019s important to check that your chosen GPU rendering tool supports the new Nvidia RTX A6000. Users of Solidworks Visualize 2021, for example, will have to wait until Service Pack 3 in April 2021 before they can take advantage of any \u2018Ampere\u2019 GPU.\nChaos Group V-Ray\nV-Ray is one of the most popular physically based rendering tools, especially in architectural visualisation. We put the Nvidia RTX A6000 through its paces using the new, freely downloadable V-Ray 5 benchmark, which has dedicated tests for Nvidia CUDA GPUs, Nvidia RTX GPUs, as well as CPUs.\nThe results were extremely compelling, with the Nvidia RTX A6000 showing itself to be 2.32 faster than the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 in the CUDA test and 1.85 times faster in the RTX test. Considering this is just a generation-ongeneration comparison, it\u2019s a phenomenal leap in performance.\nLuxion Keyshot\nKeyShot, a CPU rendering stalwart, is a relative newcomer to the world of GPU rendering. But it\u2019s one of the slickest implementations we\u2019ve seen, allowing users to switch between CPU and GPU rendering at the click of a button.\nIn the Keyshot 10 benchmark, part of the free KeyShot Viewer, we saw similar results to V-Ray. The Nvidia RTX A6000 outperformed the Quadro RTX 6000 by a factor of 1.97.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU memory \u2013 why 48GB?\nOne aspect of technology that has long held back GPU rendering is the limited amount of GPU memory available on each card. When a scene, including geometry, materials and lighting, doesn\u2019t fit entirely into GPU memory, the render can fail, slow down (if it runs \u2018out of core\u2019 using system memory), or simply fall back to the CPU.\nThere are many established workarounds to help users ensure a dataset fits entirely within GPU memory \u2014 such as resizing or optimising textures, simplifying or stripping out geometry, or rendering in separate passes \u2014 but all of this takes time to prep. What the user really wants is not to have to worry about GPU memory at all.\nWith 48 GB, the Nvidia RTX A6000 is arguably the GPU that will enable this. And while it\u2019s not the first to offer that much memory (the Quadro RTX 8000 also came with 48 GB) it\u2019s the first to do so at a sub \u00a34,000 price point.\nOf course, for some workflows 48 GB will be overkill. However, for those pushing the boundaries of realism, using very hi-fidelity textures (such as those captured from reallife scans) or colossal engineering accurate datasets, it should open up a wealth of opportunities.\nLuxion, for example, has in the past reported ray tracing a KeyShot scene with 1.37 billion unique triangles using two Quadro RTX 5000 cards and NVLink for a combined 32 GB of memory.\nIndeed, despite its designer-friendly workflows, KeyShot is doing much to break new ground. A new feature in KeyShot 10 called RealCloth 2.0, for example, allows users to generate visually accurate woven materials using thread geometry. However, this can be incredibly memory-hungry when using the option to represent each individual thread as a geometric entity, even with relatively small scenes.\nPreviously, we\u2019ve explored this feature in our KeyShot 10 review. Using a 16 GB Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000, however, we quickly ran out of memory, with the scene falling back to the CPU to render.\nHowever, we can report that things were entirely different with the Nvidia RTX A6000.\nWith 48 GB to play with, we were able to much better match the scale of the weave in KeyShot to that of the physical fabric.\nAs you will see from the images below, the difference in accuracy, in terms of how the material is represented, is quite incredible.\nOf course, RealCloth 2.0 is quite a niche example. However, there will certainly be some architectural or automotive visualisers out there that would benefit from 48 GB (or even 96 GB with two RTX A6000s over NVlink) now or in the future. You\u2019ll know who you are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tKeyShot 10: RealCloth 2.0 with coarse weave (uses 6.8 GB/48 GB VRAM)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tKeyShot 10: RealCloth 2.0 with a much finer weave (uses 38.2 GB/48 GB VRAM)\n\t\t\t\t\n\nReal-time 3D\nWhile GPU rendering is a major play for the Nvidia RTX A6000, real-time 3D using OpenGL and DirectX continues to be a very important part of visualisation, with applications including Autodesk VRED, Lumiscaphe, Unreal Engine, Unity and others. And, of course, the boundaries between real-time 3D and ray tracing continue to blur.\nTo test frame rates, we used FRAPS in combination with a 3DConnexion SpaceMouse to ensure the models moved in a consistent way every time. We only tested at 4K (3,840 x 2,160) resolution. At FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution, this level of GPU simply isn\u2019t stressed enough.\nNvidia RTX A6000 inside the Scan 3XS GWP-ME N1-32T\nEnscape\nEnscape is a real-time viz and VR tool for architects that uses OpenGL and delivers very high quality graphics in the viewport.\nEnscape has used elements of ray tracing in its software for some time. Newer versions of the software are RTX-enabled, so full ray tracing can be toggled on and off.\nFor our tests, Enscape provided a large architectural scene of a museum and its surrounding area. At 7.5GB, the GPU memory requirements of this model are relatively high, but Enscape models can take up much more and this is a drop in the ocean for the Quadro RTX A6000.\nIn terms of performance, the Nvidia RTX A6000 delivered a phenomenal 53 frames per second (FPS) for an incredibly smooth experience. This is around 1.39 times faster than the Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 and 2.79 times faster than the Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFour DisplayPorts\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTop fan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHidden connectors\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBottom fan\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAutodesk VRED Professional\nAutodesk VRED Professional is an automotive-focused 3D visualisation, virtual prototyping and VR tool. It uses OpenGL and delivers very high-quality visuals in the viewport. It offers several levels of real-time anti-aliasing (AA), which is important for automotive styling, as it smooths the edges of body panels.\nHowever, AA calculations use a lot of GPU resources, both in terms of processing and memory. We tested our automotive model with AA set variously to \u2018off\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018ultra-high\u2019.\nThe Nvidia RTX A6000 was significantly faster than the Quadro RTX 6000 delivering between 1.46 and 1.50 more frames per second in all of our tests. Most notably, the card delivered a very smooth 25.15 FPS when AA set to \u2018ultra high\u2019, which is unheard for a model of this complexity. This is 2.97 times faster than a Quadro RTX 4000.\nConclusion\nNvidia has put a huge effort into developing its hardware-based ray tracing technology and it\u2019s now really starting to see the fruits.\nIt\u2019s quite incredible to think it has managed to double the GPU rendering performance, generation on generation (Turing to Ampere). And, in real-time 3D, with a 1.4 to 1.5 times boost, it\u2019s hardly dragging its heels.\nRendering has become the big battleground for hardware manufacturers and, with the 64-core AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU, competition between GPU and CPU has never been so fierce.\nCPUs have always had the lead when it comes to addressable memory and there\u2019s an ongoing debate about rendering performance versus accuracy. But with 48 GB per GPU, and the ability to scale up cards as and when required (the new Supermicro SuperWorkstation 5014A-TT can support up to four Nvidia RTX A6000s), the argument for GPU rendering has never been more compelling.\nIn many ways, the biggest competition for the Nvidia RTX A6000 is from Nvidia itself.\nThe consumer-focused Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 should offer roughly the same performance for one third of the price. It does have half the memory (24 GB), but with support for NVLink, two can be linked together to create a virtual 48 GB render resource. The downside is that it\u2019s nigh-on impossible to get hold of a board right now and prices are inflated accordingly.\nOf course, for some firms, it will always need to be Quadro all the way. Or should we say Quadro in features, warranty, reliability and certification, but not in name. It\u2019s going to take some time to get used to the rebranding.\nRelated articles:The power of PiSwatchbook Mix ReviewClassic stylings: Future directions for Autodesk AliasAMD FireRender \u2013 a new physically correct material and rendering technology for professional DEVELOP3D puts new AMD FirePro V5900 graphics card through its pacesWATCH // Keyshot 7 - Sneak PeekBOXX delivers overclocked 8 core workstationsVirtual workstations empower users anywhere, anytime \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the DEVELOP3D community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nControlled Permeability added to AM parts by Dyndrite and Elementum3D\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3D printing the Nozzle office chair\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSiemens PAVE360 uses AMD GPUs to run on Microsoft Azure\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhy additive manufacturing needs AI\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nELM Mobility\u2019s special delivery\n\nMarch 17, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008-2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street.

Gigabyte has submitted a total of 12 different 3080 Ti offerings to the Eurasian Economic Commission with slight revisions.\nThe Original GA102-250 GPU Intended To Be Used On The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Has Being Remarked And Used On RTX 3090s\nLast December, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti was going to offer 20GB of VRAM on the GA102-250 GPU with Gigabyte's original EEC submission. The GA102-250 GPU has now been quietly shifted over onto RTX 3090 cards. A HardwareLuxx forum member \u2018iso0\u2019 purchased a Founders Edition RTX 3090 with the intent to water cool and found that the die featured a scratched out GA102-250 engraving with the GA102-300 engraving below it. Apparently, the GA102-250 GPU could only support a 320-bit bus.\nRelated Story GPU Prices Continue To Crash \u2013 AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Now Selling For $699 US, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Starting at $869 US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has not been a model without constant change and the GPU has now been changed to the GA102-225 GPU from the original GA102-250 GPU. As well as the die changing, the memory has also changed, the original 20GB has been dropped down to 12GB of GDDR6X using a 384-bit bus with a speed of 19 Gbps. It comes equipped with 10240 CUDA Cores and 80 SM units. The clock speeds have not been listed as the launch is still more than a month away.\nTranslated From Russian\nThe models listed in the EEC submission range from the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti AORUS XTREME WATERFORCE WB as the ultra-premium offering all the way down to the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti TURBO at the budget end of the spectrum. The five series with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti offerings are the TURBO, EAGLE, VISION, GAMING, AORUS MASTER, and AORUS EXTREME ordered based on Gigabyte's hierarchy with the AORUS EXTREME being the ultra-premium offering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nAnother sneaky addition alongside the 12 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti's is their CMP 30HX offering. The CMP 30HX model (GV-N30HXD6-6G) has been submitted as well. It is the entry-level mining card in NVIDIA's CMP series with 6GB of GDDR6 memory with a 192-bit bus. Images of the Windforce CMP 30HX have been shown by VideoCardz. The clock speeds are unknown, but another CMP 30HX, the Palit CMP 30HX, features a base clock speed of 1530 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1785 MHz. The Palit CMP 30HX has shown us that the 30HX seems to be a mining clone of the GTX 1660 SUPER.\nGigabyte has not revealed the pricing of the various custom RTX 3080 Ti, but the MSRP for the Founders Edition card is expected to be $999. However, most manufacturers such as MSI and ASUS have increased the price due to the low stock and high demand which makes me think that most models other than the TURBO will not be very close to the MSRP.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Upgrades Mobility GeForce RTX 30 GPUs: RTX 3080 Ti The Fastest Mobile GPU Ever Made, RTX 3070 Ti 70% Faster Than RTX 2070 SUPER\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti For Laptops To Be The Most Powerful & Most Power Hungry Mobile GPU Ever Made!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKFA2 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti EXG 12 GB Graphics Card Review \u2013 Designed For Gamers First!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUS\u2019s Next-Gen ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 GX650 Laptop Rocks AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX \u2018Rembrandt\u2019 CPU & NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n57\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n45\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n38\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nWatch The NVIDIA GTC 2025, CEO Jensen Huang, Keynote Live Here \u2013 Upgraded Blackwell Ultra \u201cB300\u201d All Set For Unveiling\n\n\n\n32\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

(Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nAll eyes are on big tech mergers and acquisitions as political leaders from both parties have expressed concern about the concentration of power.\n\nMost Americans agree that companies like Amazon and Facebook should be broken up, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, according to a Jan. poll by Vox and Data for Progress.\n\n\nIn this uncertain business environment, Nvidia announced last September that it reached a deal with Softbank to acquire U.K. based semiconductor and software design company Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, making it one of the biggest acquisitions in tech.\n\nBehemoths like Google and Microsoft are opposed to the deal, which requires approval from authorities in at least four governments, including the U.S., U.K., E.U., and China. Qualcomm is fighting the acquisition, as the company relies heavily on Arm for microprocessor intellectual property (IP).\n\n\nApple is also concerned as Arm\u2019s IP powers 90% of the world\u2019s mobile processors/smartphones, with both Qualcomm and Apple as major customers. Should the acquisition be approved, it is easy to imagine Nvidia creeping into their territory.\nMost of the naysayers, who have themselves been accused of anti-trust and controlling the market as monopolies for decades, are concerned about whether they\u2019ll have equal access to Arm technology after the acquisition closes.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nThese companies want Arm to be Switzerland\u2014but this may be unrealistic as remaining neutral has resulted in thin profit from designs and licensing. Who will own Arm unless it strategically benefits the company\u2019s core business?\n\nArm Acquisition Is Not Dead \nSoftBank owning Arm is not viewed as a threat right now because Arm does not add meaningfully to its business (more on this below). Therefore, SoftBank is looking for a buyer. As with most M&A in the free markets, the only reason to pursue Arm is if it adds strategically to the business.\n\n\nIn terms of market share of licensing and designs, Arm is incredibly successful. Yet, despite near omnipotence in mobile, televisions, and ADAS automotive systems, the top line is only $2 billion annually and the bottom line is $50 million in profit.\nTherefore, Arm will need to be a strategic target that furthers the acquirer\u2019s market share\u2014there is no other outcome as accretive does not work with these numbers. Nvidia\u2019s bottom line in the current fiscal year is about $4.3 billion.\nAny potential bidder will be seen as a threat because Arm must be a strategic acquisition. The problem lies with the fact Arm, a tech company, is attempting to be neutral. Being neutral does not work in a competitive industry.\nThe governments reviewing the acquisition will likely consider Nvidia an excellent candidate to push forward their agendas for AI and edge computing. Nvidia has proven itself as a GPU-leader in the data center with 98% of cloud infrastructure-as-a-service using Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPU). There needs to a similar, ubiquitous approach for trillions of edge devices, where more AI-decisions will be made.\nTherefore, I predict there is a stronger chance that the Nvidia-Arm deal goes through than what the critics believe.\nThis is because the governments reviewing the acquisition will need AI to power their economies. Competition is healthy for the tech market, yet moving forward as an ecosystem owner is also paramount. You cannot block innovation at its most crucial point and I believe Nvidia is best equipped to deliver AI to devices for future development.\nPlease note, I\u2019ve covered Nvidia at length here and here. This analysis will primarily focus on Arm.\nHistory of Arm\nThe name Arm stands for \u201cAcorn RISC Machine\u201d and comes from founders Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber discovering that a CPU can run faster on a small set of instructions. The discovery these two made in the early 1980s was to let the operating system break down tasks rather than add more instructions to the processor. While most CPU designs were adding more instructions to chips, Arm patented the technique of using fewer instructions that run more quickly and efficiently. Due to power constraints of the mobile device, which was introduced much later, Arm found a massive market where it dominates at 90%.\nAround 2012, mobile phones began using the 64-bit architecture that PCs had been using for some time. Arm introduced the ARMv8 64-bit architecture for mobile in 2011. This architecture has two execution states to run 32-bit code and 64-bit code. To run on both Arm and Intel architectures, a developer might compile native code for both or run code emulation, although it is more common to choose one and stick with that choice. This is why we see near ubiquity with Arm on mobile whereas Intel and AMD have done quite well in the data center.\nGenerally speaking, Arm\u2019s architecture is the best choice for mobile and Intel\u2019s is the best choice for the data center and PCs like Windows. Another important difference is Intel maintains its IP in-house and sells chips while Arm licenses its IP.\u00a0\nFor mobile, Arm\u2019s design known as \u201cheterogenous compute\u201d has helped facilitate lower power requirements as the architecture allows different CPU parts to work together for improved efficiency. This enables workloads to work across both high-performance and low-performance CPU cores to lower energy by balancing performance.\nArm: Product Overview\nArm is an intellectual property company (IP) that works quietly in the background with 22 billion chips shipped globally in 2019 and a cumulative total of 166 billion chips in 2019. The company hit 180 billion chips\u00a0as of the press release on the acquisition.\nRevenue is generated from licenses for Arm\u2019s technology and royalties that come from the subsequent sale of the licensees\u2019 chips that contain Arm\u2019s technology. To compare,\u00a0Nvidia announced\u00a0it had shipped 1 billion processors in 2011 and there has not been an update for the 2 billion mark yet, with estimates of Nvidia\u2019s shipments hitting around 100 million chips per year.\nArm is most dominant in mobile with 90% market share in mobile processors, and dominates in-vehicle infotainment and advanced-driver assistance system (ADAS) processor market at 75%. The overall share of Arm\u2019s related markets is 34%.\nArm-based technology is found in electronic devices and PCs, including Microsoft\u2019s Arm-based Surface and Apple\u2019s custom CPUs for Macs. The majority of tablets and digital TVs also use Arm\u2019s architecture.\nIn fact, Arm offers the most popular CPU architecture in the world. The company\u2019s dominant market share is achieved through its developer ecosystem,\u00a0which fits neatly into one of our primary theses for Nvidia,\u00a0its GPU-powered cloud and developer ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0\nArm will bring an estimated 15 million software programmers to Nvidia. In Nvidia\u2019s recent earnings report, the company announced it had doubled from 1 million to 2 million developers \u2013 so Arm increases Nvidia\u2019s reach by 7X.\nCPUs require instruction sets that tell the processor to move data between registers and memory or to perform calculations with a specific execution unit. Architecture is defined by providing the link between instructions and processor hardware designs.\nHere\u2019s what\u00a0Arm\u2019s instruction set looks like.\nWhen comparing processor architectures, Arm\u2019s architecture is a competitor to Intel\u2019s x86.\u00a0The major fundamental difference between Arm\u2019s approach and Intel\u2019s approach is that Arm favors energy efficiency and Intel favors peak performance.\nArm is based on lower power instruction sets and hardware. When reading about Arm\u2019s architecture, you may come across the acronym RISC-V (pronounced risk-5). This stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing,\u00a0which describes Arm\u2019s approach to energy efficiency by reducing the number of instruction sets required. Intel\u2019s CISC, or Complex Instruction Set Computing, offers more complex instructions that execute multiple operations. This may lead to better performance but more power consumption due to the need to decode the complex instructions.\nArm\u2019s Financials:\nAs stated above, despite dominating mobile, televisions, and ADAS automotive systems, Arm generates less than $2 billion in annual revenue and $50 million in profit.\nFor the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, the Arm segment reported 202,966 million Yen, according to Softbank\u2019s filing. This translates into $1.9 billion of SoftBank\u2019s total $55.3 billion total sales in 2020. For the full year 2020:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arm reported 2.6 million Yen in cash or $24 million.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revenue from technology royalties fell 1.5% year-over-year to $1.1 billion.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Technology licensing revenue increased 6.4% to $582 million\nIn 2018, Arm sold a 51% equity interest in its Chinese subsidiary, \u201cArm China,\u201d for $845 million to form a joint venture for Arm\u2019s semiconductor technology IP business in China. In the\u00a0investor presentation, Nvidia stated they believe the acquisition will double Nvidia\u2019s addressable market to $250 billion.\nThe acquisition of Arm will be paid from a mix of cash from balance sheet and equity. Nvidia will not raise debt to finance the transaction.\u00a0Per the press release, Nvidia will pay SoftBank $21.5 billion in common stock and $12 billion in cash.\nThe number of shares to be issued is 44.3 million, which increases the number of shares outstanding by about 7%. Arm employees will get $1.5 billion in Nvidia stock at time of closing. There is an additional $5 billion in cash or common stock being offered subject to specific financial performance targets by Arm.\nNvidia\u2019s Move Into Edge Devices\nIf Nvidia does not acquire Arm for a proposed $40 billion, there are rumors Arm may be spun off as a public company through the initial public offering (IPO) process in the $40 billion range.\nAs seen in Arm\u2019s financials, owning the majority of a market and maxing out your TAM has a drawback. The upside for Arm is limited. To increase the top line, Arm must move into new markets. Even then, it may resemble the same relationship the company has in the mobile market where the Switzerland makes very little while competitive tech giants see large gains.\nDespite Arm powering 90% of the mobile market, its $2 billion a year does not compare to Qualcomm\u2019s $25 billion or Apple\u2019s roughly $260 billion in revenue a year. Given this, stock investors are likely to choose the manufacturers over Arm in any market where Arm supplies IP.\nThe\u00a0letter to Arm employees\u00a0was fairly clear as to Nvidia\u2019s goal: \u201cWe are joining arms with Arm to create the\u00a0leading computing company for the age of AI.\u201d The letter discusses how AI supercomputers can write software that no human can and how AI will facilitate trillions of computers running AI to create a new internet-of-things.\nTo really unpack the synergies between Nvidia and Arm, we have to look at future AI technologies. The number of smartphones is not increasing meaningfully, yet there could be a time when smartphones utilize machine learning and leverage AI-assistants. Demands on 5G base stations, switches and routers are limited yet will need to deliver large workloads. Data centers see pressure from lower cost and improving power efficiency. The bigger picture down the line is the internet of things, which will require an exponential amount of data to be downloaded.\u00a0\nAs stated on the call, Nvidia-Arm has three areas for potential growth: the cloud data center where data is analyzed and stored, edge computing where data is filtered and downloaded/streamed, and trillions of devices, where more AI-decisions will be made.\nArm\u2019s presence is expected to see the most growth in the networking equipment market grow from 32% to 65% over the next ten years, and data center/cloud market, growing from 5% to 25% over the next ten years.\nThe most dominant markets for Arm are mobile application processors, IoT application processor and in-vehicle infotainment and ADA, where Arm owns 90% of these markets.\nAccording to these numbers provided by SoftBank, it is unlikely Nvidia is acquiring Arm for the estimated 25% data center penetration in 2028 but rather for Arm\u2019s true strengths and areas of dominance, which is edge devices. Edge devices go beyond mobile and vehicles to include street lights, parking meters, etcetera, plus industrial automation. Arm set a goal of shipping 1 trillion connected Arm-based devices by 2035 in what the company calls \u201cProject Trillium.\u201d\nThere are also edge servers to consider, which will be a new market that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed. Arm\u2019s architecture may be a good candidate as this part of the infrastructure stack requires fast processing speeds.\nHuang, whose company gets over 40% of its revenue from data center products following the recent\u00a0Mellanox Technologies acquisition, stressed that Nvidia will build on ARM\u2019s already-sizable investments in its\u00a0Neoverse platform\u00a0for server CPUs and other \u201cinfrastructure\u201d processors.\nAs stated, he also signaled Nvidia plans to use its server GPUs,\u00a0Mellanox\u2019s data processing units\u00a0(DPUs) and ARM\u2019s server CPU IP to develop end-to-end silicon and software platforms for servers.\nNvidia has (quietly) Become the Global Leader in AI\nMost investors are aware of what mobile and cloud did for tech stocks. These gains will seem minor in comparison to the gains artificial intelligence will produce.\nBetween the years 2025-2030, AI is expected to add $13T to $15T to global economic activity, or 1.2% to GDP every year. We are in the early days of returns from AI. But as adoption accelerates, the penalty for laggards will be steep. We should see AI acceleration around 2022-2023 and I predict the last window for substantial gains in AI will be 2025.\nIn order to truly excel, a programming language has to be universal. GPUs have become integral for AI and machine learning. Nvidia has a special language called CUDA that is universally known due to the company\u2019s first mover advantage in GPU.\nNvidia is already the universal platform for development, but this won\u2019t become obvious until innovation in artificial intelligence matures.\nDevelopers are programming the future of artificial intelligence applications on Nvidia because of the CUDA platform and its GPUs are easier and more flexible than customized ASICs or TPU chips from Google and FPGA chips used by Microsoft and AMD-Xilinx.\nDespite a selloff in the name, Nvidia smashed records for quarterly revenue, full year revenue, and earnings when it announced Q4 results Feb. 24. The chip manufacturer posted revenue of more than $5B for the first time, up approximately 61% YoY, beating expectations by $180M.\u00a0\nAdjusted EPS of $3.10 beat by $0.29.\nGaming and Data Center also hit new records. Gaming saw $2.5B in sales, up 67% YoY, and data center sales hit $1.9B, up 97% YoY.\nFor the full year, revenue was $16.68B, up 53% YoY. GAAP earnings was $6.90, up 53%YOY. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $10, up 73% YoY.\nThe company also provided strong guidance, with revenue of $5.3B, plus or minus 2%, versus expectations of $4.51B.\nGaming has become an integral part of global culture and will remain robust going forward, said Nvidia Executive Vice President and CFO Colette Kress during the call. She also expressed optimism about growth in virtual experiences, data center, and AI.\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a new age in which AI fuels industries ranging from healthcare to scientific research to the environment,\u201d Kress said. \u201cWith this transaction, our vision is to boost Arm's potential so it can thrive in this new era and grow into promising new markets.\u201d\nThe Pros and Cons of Nvidia-Arm AcquisitionPros:\nThe pros to this deal include combining Arm\u2019s developer following with Nvidia\u2019s developer following to advance artificial intelligence at the edge. Apple would not be a good choice because it competes directly with developers and this would harm the ecosystem. Qualcomm does not have AI experience, per se, as the leader in 5G. Rather, bringing AI acceleration from the data center to the edge is the correct path, which is unique to Nvidia.\nIt is not possible to dominate the AI market by remaining at the server level. AI will need to be on-device. The ultimate goal for governments reviewing this acquisition is not for you and I to have a smart refrigerator (human-to-machine), or faster Netflix streaming. The ultimate goal for the governments reviewing this decision is to determine what company is capable of delivering machine-to-machine communication without human operators and enabled through AI so they can increase GDP.\nCons:\nArm\u2019s open source competitor RISC-V could see a wave of interest should the acquisition be approved. Nvidia\u2019s acquisition could start a major push to build on the open RISC-V architecture. Called \u201cRISC-V\u201d this is\u00a0an alternative to Arm\u00a0started by a group of academics who did not want to pay licensing fees. The first chip coming out of this open source project was in 2014 from UC Berkeley.\u00a0This group had a goal of doing for hardware what Linux did for software. When Huawei was first determined to be a security risk, RISC-V rose in popularity in China, for instance.\nDespite Nvidia promising to keep Arm open, the company has plenty of baggage with both open source systems, like Linux, and also closed ecosystems, such as Apple.\nLinux is the most popular OS for Arm chips, yet Nvidia has not been willing to open source its drivers. In 2012, Linus Torvalds was asked why Nvidia support on Linux was so poor, and\u00a0Torvalds famously responded, \u201cNvidia has been the single worst company we\u2019ve ever dealt with. Nvidia, [expletive] you!\u201d\nThe translation here is that Arm\u2019s 17 million developers may not all convert to the Nvidia-Arm combination, especially outside of mobile, as Arm is well tolerated by the open-source community while Nvidia is more commercialized.\nThe acquisition could also drive competitors to use Intel or AMD in situations where these two are seen as less of a competitor in the data center. Hermann Hauser, co-founder of ARM, has stated he wants a guarantee that Nvidia won\u2019t get any preferential treatment from ARM post-acquisition. This could be hard to enforce once the acquisition is complete.\nThe linchpin to the complexity of the deal is China. The Global Times China has published a series of articles that do not seem optimistic about China\u2019s views of this proposal,\u00a0such as stating, \u201cTo a certain extent, the purchase of Arm by Nvidia, if settled, could serve as another trump card for the US government in the global semiconductor industry.\u00a0Given the US-China tensions and US suppression on a range of Chinese technology enterprises, if Arm falls into US hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market.\u201d\nAnother\u00a0article stated, \u201cXiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Monday that the Chinese government is likely to play a role in reviewing the case and the chance of its approval is low.\u201d\nMy first and only statement on Twitter was to offer a poll on whether this would be blocked or approved following the news. One thing I did not offer on that poll is a third option: whether the United States would go through with the acquisition even if China blocks it.\nThat may seem absurd (or perhaps impossible) but we are in the midst of a cold war and tech is the battleground. This includes 5G infrastructure suppliers, semiconductor manufacturing and social media with TikTok.\nArtificial intelligence could be the breaking point, in my opinion. Product-wise, this acquisition can advance the United States through artificial intelligence, which is an important element to defense and global dominance. To leave that decision up to our competitor seems illogical. China may try to block the deal and weaken the United States. But will the United States and the UK cooperate with an adversary stunting technological progress required for dominance?\nConclusion:\nThe acquisition deal is being reviewed by governmental authorities and the process is moving forward as expected, according to Nvidia\u2019s Q4 earnings report. During the call, Kress reiterated Nvidia\u2019s commitment to maintaining Arm\u2019s open licensing model.\n\u201cWe love and intend to maintain Arm's open licensing model, a commitment guaranteed both by long-term legally binding contracts as well as our own interest in ensuring this investment is a profitable one for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are on the cusp of a new age in which AI fuels industries ranging from healthcare to scientific research to the environment. With this transaction, our vision is to boost Arm's potential so it can thrive in this new era and grow into promising new markets.\u201d\nWith mobile, Arm has been considered a neutral Switzerland. There is no such thing as remaining neutral with AI, as it is a polarizing technology that will determine the world\u2019s most powerful economy. Eventually some hard decisions will need to be made, as tech produced in the United States but manufactured in China is strengthening China\u2019s lead. Nvidia-Arm brings this to a head.\nLong article here, but the take-away is that the Nvidia-Arm acquisition is a move to secure Nvidia\u2019s place for on-device AI, and this will be seen as a threat to China. I foresee the UK being in a tight spot where the country will have to choose if it is with China or the United States, with no neutral ground offered if/when China attempts to block the acquisition. Be prepared for anything to happen, as I believe the United States will view this as a means of defense.\nWe are optimistic on this acquisition and bullish on Nvidia regardless of the outcome with Arm.\nBeth Kindig and the I/O Fund currently owns shares of Nvidia.

The same is true for esports -- better GPUs, displays, peripherals, and good software can help you respond more quickly and precisely to opponents. Enter NVIDIA Reflex, a new, free upgrade, which reduces system latency, making gameplay more responsive, giving you a competitive edge.\nToday, following the addition of Reflex to top esports and competitive games, Reflex will come to Rainbow Six Siege. Download and install our newest Game Ready Driver now, which is a required update for Reflex in Rainbow Six Siege, so you\u2019re ready to roll the second it launches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular esports around, though it\u2019s not your typical shooter, favoring strategic and tactical gameplay over a \u2018run-and-gun\u2019 style. Reaction time is measured in milliseconds, and is critical to a player's success. Being a fraction of a second late on the trigger is the difference between your digital life and death, so reducing system latency can be a huge boon for Rainbow Six Siege players.\nWith NVIDIA Reflex, system latency is reduced by up to 30%, making shots fire faster, making it easier to target enemies, and in general improving your competitiveness. NVIDIA Reflex is available in the Vulkan version of the game, providing a free upgrade to a huge number of GeForce gamers, back to those running GeForce GTX 10 Series GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable NVIDIA Reflex, download and install our new GeForce Game Ready driver, grab the latest Rainbow Six Siege update, load the Vulkan version of the game, and simply head into the game\u2019s Display Options, where you can switch it on with a few clicks. Press Apply, and get gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Tuned For More Reflex and GeForce Updates\nWe\u2019ve got more NVIDIA Reflex announcements in the pipeline, and more games coming with ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS as well. To be the first to learn about them, bookmark GeForce.com and follow our social media accounts on your platform of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When Microsoft Flight Simulator launched last August, the GeForce RTX 20 Series was the best you could buy. But now, there\u2019s the GeForce RTX 30 Series, powered by the Ampere Architecture, boasting innumerable enhancements that deliver faster gaming performance and more performance per Watt.\nTo ascertain the advantages of using a GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU in Microsoft Flight Simulator, instead of a prior generation GPU, and to reveal how much faster your performance could be with an upgrade, we\u2019ve teamed up with Digital Foundry to put our most popular graphics cards through their paces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor their testing, the Digital Foundry team created scripted benchmarks with their optimized settings in Doha, New York, Tokyo, and London, the latest city to be enhanced in a free update. On average, performance doubled when upgrading from popular GeForce GTX 10 Series GPUs to our latest GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards, with peak performance gains measured at 2.4x. And if you\u2019re seeking the absolute best performance possible, an upgrade from GeForce RTX 20 Series cards can improve frame rates by up to 53% on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 4K, a GeForce RTX 3080 upgrade delivers the biggest boost in Digital Foundry\u2019s testing, with performance soaring by 2.26x. This enables players to land, take off and fly over Microsoft Flight Simulator\u2019s most detailed and demanding cities at over 60 FPS, with excellent levels of image quality, for a smoother, more immersive experience that benefits from the improved controller responsiveness that higher frame rates deliver.\nAnd when you\u2019re flying through the skies and buzzing smaller towns, you can expect even faster frame rates that\u2019ll make your experience even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, a resolution that\u2019s rapidly growing in popularity with gamers seeking the sweet spot between performance and image quality, and monitor cost, the GeForce RTX 3070 was 2.1x faster on average than the GeForce GTX 1070.\nWith frame rates skirting around 30 FPS in most of Digital Foundry\u2019s testing, the GeForce GTX 1070 struggled to maintain responsive, playable frame rates when landing, the most important moment during any flight. Using a GeForce RTX 3070, frame rates never dipped below 50, and in general ranged from 60-70, giving budding captains an excellent experience at all times, with rich, detailed graphics that ground and immerse the player in the realistic sim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 1920x1080, the most popular resolution of all, the GeForce RTX 3060 serves up significant gains over the GeForce GTX 1060, the most popular GPU on Steam, and one of the most used amongst Microsoft Flight Simulator players.\nThe GeForce RTX 3060, with performance boosts of up to 2x, delivered consistently playable, responsive gaming, whereas the venerable GeForce GTX 1060 was overwhelmed in certain scenarios, seeing FPS dip below 20 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it, a GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU delivers a 2x upgrade on average versus GeForce GTX 10 Series GPUs, for a far faster, smoother, responsive and playable experience. Upgrading from GeForce RTX 20 Series also delivers positive gains up to 53%. But perhaps you\u2019re already playing at a higher frame rate because you turned the settings way down? In that case, an upgrade will help you experience Microsoft Flight Simulator with a greater level of realism and immersion, which is what sims are all about.\nIf you decide to upgrade, or want to buy a GPU to make a brand new sim-capable machine, head here to check out our complete range of GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Garage Ultimate Flight Sim Rig\nGeForce RTX 30 Series GPU? Check. Baller PC? Check. Desire to up your Flight Sim game? Check!\nOver at GeForce Garage, where expert modders and enthusiasts show jaw dropping builds and reveal what it takes to make amazing PCs, we\u2019ve assembled a top-flight Microsoft Flight Simulator PC, with an incredible cockpit and chair setup that\u2019ll elate simmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn all-EK watercooled GeForce RTX 3080 PC powers three LG CX 65\u201d OLED TVs, running Microsoft Flight Simulator at 5760x1080 in Surround. Attached to the PC is an awesome combo of controls and screens, giving the player cutting-edge tactile, haptic and motion feedback.\nAs if they were in a real plane, the player has a full cockpit, with Logitech\u2019s complete range of instrument panels, switch panels and displays, all housed in a Volair Sim Avionics Panel. As needed, the player will flick the switches to get their plane airborne, and navigate runways and the skies using the panels, displays and readouts, heightening immersion and presence in the game.\nBut under the player is where the magic happens: Next Level Racing \u2018motion platforms\u2019 tilt the chair in all directions in sync with the gameplay, controlled via Logitech\u2019s throttle, yoke and rudder pedals. And for force feedback, there\u2019s a ButtKicker, sending vibrations through the chair in sync with runway movement, air resistance, and unscheduled nosedives.\nAs you can see in the video below, this near-$20,000 flight sim rig delivers an unbeatable, unprecedented experience that\u2019s as close to flying a real plane as most of us will ever get. And it\u2019s all powered by a single GeForce RTX GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more incredible PCs, builds and projects, stay tuned to our GeForce YouTube channel and bookmark the GeForce Garage playlist.

We like to think he\u2019d endorse GFN Thursday as the best day of the week, too.\nThis is a special Thursday, as we\u2019re happy to share that our cloud-streaming service has added more support for GOG. As part of our continuing open-platform strategy, members who own games from The Witcher series on GOG can now play those versions across their devices. It\u2019s all powered by GeForce NOW\u2019s streaming servers \u2014 they\u2019re so powerful that Vikings would have called it magic.\nAnd we\u2019re planning even more events in cooperation with GOG in the future. But first, let\u2019s talk GOG and Geralt.\nThis Is Your Story\nCD PROJEKT RED\u2019s The Witcher series has sold more than 50 million copies, and gamers around the world have joined Geralt on his adventures. Additionally, GOG is a digital distribution platform created with utmost care about customers and we\u2019re big fans of their PC-focused philosophy. They also built GOG GALAXY, an application that combines multiple libraries into one and connects you with friends across all gaming platforms.\nDon\u2019t worry, Geralt will be fine. This is a battle only a witcher can win.\nWe\u2019ve been working with the GOG team to add support for more games ever since the launch of CDPR\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077, the first GOG-enabled game on GFN. With that quest complete, we worked with our partners at GOG on phase two.\nThat phase begins today. Members who own the following titles on GOG can stream the games across their devices straight from our cloud-gaming servers.\nMembers can also easily capture their best gameplay moments in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \u2013 Game of the Year Edition, thanks to GeForce NOW\u2019s sharing tools. Capture your best monster takedowns using our in-game overlay, or apply your signature look using NVIDIA Freestyle. And with Ansel, you can compose the perfect photo of Geralt from any angle of CDPR\u2019s beautiful open world.\nThe world of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is gorgeous, and you can capture every detail with GeForce NOW\u2019s share tools.\nMore to Play\nThis week, members can look for the following GeForce NOW library additions, including GOG.com support for games from The Witcher series:\n\nThronebreaker: The Witcher Tales (GOG.COM)\nThe Witcher Adventure Game (GOG.COM)\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition (GOG.COM)\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \u2013 Game of the Year Edition (GOG.COM)\nStronghold: Warlords (new release on Steam)\nMonster Energy Supercross \u2013 The Official Videogame 4 (day-and-date release on Steam, March 11)\nPascal\u2019s Wager: Definitive Edition (day-and-date release on Steam, March 12)\nUno (Steam)\nWorkers & Resources: Soviet Republic (Steam)\n\nWith GeForce NOW, there\u2019s always another game to play.

And just like getting a new racket or pair of shoes can help you play your best in traditional sports, powerful GPUs, high refresh displays, and tuned game settings can help gamers unlock their full potential.\nNow there\u2019s also NVIDIA Reflex, a free update for many popular competitive games that reduces system latency to further improve player competitiveness. Acquire targets faster, react quicker, and increase aim precision simply by enabling NVIDIA Reflex in a game\u2019s settings.\nNVIDIA Reflex is now available on the Overwatch Public Test Region (PTR). When enabled, system latency is reduced by up to 50%, greatly improving your experience:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo participate in the NVIDIA Reflex public test, you must have an Overwatch game license for Windows attached to your Battle.net account, that\u2019s in good standing (i.e. it hasn't been suspended or banned). Additionally, you must have installed Overwatch and logged into the game at least once. If the PTR is not available for you in the Battle.net client after following the steps below, try logging into Overwatch, exiting the game client, and then launching the PTR again.\nStep 1: Restart the Battle.net desktop app.\nStep 2: Navigate to the Overwatch tab on the left-hand menu.\nStep 3: Select \"Public Test Region(PTR)\" from the \u201cGAME VERSION\u201d drop-down menu. \nStep 4: Click \"Install\" to begin the installation process.\nStep 5: Once the PTR client is installed and updated, click \"Play\" to begin\nOnce you have the Overwatch PTR client installed, and have the March 11th update downloaded, open the game, go to Options, Video settings, and enable NVIDIA Reflex. With NVIDIA Reflex activated, gameplay will instantly be more responsive, increasing your chances of victory online.\nOverwatch also features the Latency Flash Indicator. If you are sporting a new Reflex Latency Analyzer compatible monitor and have GeForce Experience installed, simply enabling the flash indicator and positioning your monitoring rectangle over the indicator location will give you accurate results every time - regardless of hero, ability, or weapon you use.\nIf you wish to reduce system latency further still, there are a number of system tweaks, game tweaks and hardware upgrades that you can make, detailed in full in our System Latency Optimization Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Tuned For More Reflex and GeForce Updates\nTo be the first to learn about the latest NVIDIA Reflex games, bookmark GeForce.com and follow our social media accounts on your platform of choice. Also, be sure to check out our extensive NVIDIA Reflex and system latency primer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

New Survey Says You Can Bank on It\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA survey of global financial services professionals highlights AI growth opportunities, deployment models and future plans in 2021.\t\t\t\n\n\nMarch 10, 2021 by Kevin Levitt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Financial services companies are challenged with defining and executing their AI strategy.\nAI solutions contribute to both the top and bottom line for firms by powering nearly every function, including customer service, cybersecurity, new account acquisition and regulatory compliance.\nEveryone from executives to data scientists are involved with determining how much to invest, the most profitable use cases to pursue and the biggest challenges that must be overcome in 2021 and beyond.\nThese are some of the findings of NVIDIA\u2019s recent survey of over 200 financial services professionals from around the world. To fill in a more complete picture of how financial services institutions are using AI, and where it\u2019s headed, our \u201cState of AI in Financial Services\u201d survey consisted of questions covering a range of AI topics, such as deployment models, infrastructure spending, top use cases and biggest challenges. Respondents included C-suite leaders, managers, developers and IT architects from fintechs, investment firms and retail banks.\nGetting a Pulse on AI in Financial Services\nThe survey results showed two consistent themes: AI provides a competitive advantage in financial services, and banks plan to invest significantly in AI infrastructure to unlock its full potential.\nAmong different roles and subsectors within the industry, the survey data showed finer differences in how AI can best be deployed and the specific challenges for business decision makers and technical implementers.\nThree highlights stood out among the survey results:\n\nAI-Enabled Services Grow Revenue and Cut Costs\nOur respondents were in widespread agreement on the value of enterprise AI, as 83 percent agreed with the statement that \u201cAI is important to my company\u2019s future success.\u201d\nThe survey results showed how financial services firms view AI as an enabler of growth opportunities. Over half of those surveyed who had an opinion stated AI will increase their company\u2019s annual revenue by 10 percent or more. In contrast, only 12 percent of respondents \u2014 excluding those who marked \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d \u2014 stated that AI is having no impact on their revenue growth.\nAI can also improve the bottom line of financial services institutions through cost savings. For instance, banks, insurers and asset managers are creating significant efficiencies in their daily operations using technologies such as conversational AI, robotic process automation, optical character recognition and other machine learning and deep learning applications.\nThese AI services save time and reduce expenditures by automating insurance claims processing, augmenting call center agents via automated speech recognition for call transcription and carrying out other manually intensive services.\nPassing AI Benefits to Customers\nSurvey respondents said the top three areas where AI affected their companies were yielding more accurate models (42 percent), creating a competitive advantage (41 percent) and building new products (34 percent).\n\nUtilizing AI to create more accurate models means better outcomes for banks and their customers, particularly in protecting against fraud and maximizing investment returns. These benefits translate into competitive advantage that often leads to increased market share and greater shareholder value. New products from AI enable cross-sell opportunities through enhanced personalization, which generates higher customer retention.\nChallenges to Achieving AI Goals\nWhile the benefits of leveraging AI in financial services are unmistakable, the journey from research to enterprise-scale production for AI models within banks, insurers and asset managers is marked with potential pitfalls and challenges.\nOur survey identified those barriers, starting with the biggest challenges to achieving a company\u2019s AI goals. The top three cited by respondents were too few data scientists (38 percent), insufficient technology infrastructure (35 percent) and a lack of data (35 percent).\nThe C-suite is looking to overcome these challenges by building AI expertise across the enterprise. 60 percent of C-level executives responded that their largest focus moving forward is identifying additional AI use cases. One in two respondents from the C-suite noted that their company also plans to hire more AI experts \u2014 addressing the gap of too few data scientists.\nThese findings warrant further exploration, especially in the context of new AI frameworks and platforms for smarter banking.\nPopular AI Use Cases for Financial Services\nSurvey respondents from fintechs and investment firms highlighted portfolio optimization and algorithmic trading as the top AI use cases their companies currently invest in. This data can be understood in the context of maximizing client returns on investment.\n\nRespondents from commercial and retail banks, on the other hand, noted that their companies are mainly investing in AI for fraud detection through payments, transactions and anti-money laundering. These survey results reflect a primary focus on protecting sensitive financial data for their customers.\nPowering the Future of Banking with Enterprise AI\nWith these top use cases for AI in financial services, and dozens if not hundreds more available to banks, insurers and asset managers, the industry is understandably looking to grow its investment in AI. Sixty-two percent of our survey respondents \u2014 excluding those who marked \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d \u2014 agreed that their company should spend more on AI applications.\nFinancial services professionals not only see the potential in AI, but are willing to invest more to deliver on its promise. That potential is actively being realized by companies who see AI generating competitive advantage, creating new products, adding significant revenues to the top line, and reducing costs to grow the bottom line.\nAs new use cases are identified and AI becomes more pervasive across organizations, the next challenge for C-suite and IT leadership will be creating enterprise-level AI platforms that deliver the productivity, scalability and return on investment necessary to support the variety of AI teams across their companies.\nAnd, instead of starting from scratch, data scientists building models for a variety of use cases can utilize containers from NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub of GPU-optimized software. These include NVIDIA Riva\u00a0for automated speech recognition and speech to text for call center transcription to NVIDIA Merlin for recommendation system application frameworks.\nTo learn more about AI in the future of finance, download the survey report for more in-depth results.\nAnd join GTC 2021 for free to hear from industry experts at Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Munich Re, Scotiabank, Wells Fargo and other leading financial institutions.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Financial Services \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In addition to ensuring those apps can scale, enterprise IT teams must have the right amount of resources required to run them optimally and guarantee uptime levels remain high and consistent.\nNow, a new wave of change in the application landscape has enterprises moving to be more driven by data with advanced analytics and AI, and to develop cutting-edge products with graphics-rich virtual desktops.\nWith these complex applications, unique requirements often eliminate the possibility of leveraging the standard, optimized pool of resources in the data center.\nTo be sure, dedicating infrastructure for business-critical applications isn\u2019t always a bad thing, especially in the near term. But efficiencies can always be gained when more applications leverage a shared pool of resources.\nTo bring new applications into their data center environments, IT teams face three frequent challenges:\n\nMeeting the intense compute, networking and graphics resource demands from modern applications,\nServicing applications that have complex workflows, and\nHandling a new set of siloed infrastructure when apps can\u2019t use shared resources.\n\nFortunately, accelerated computing and advances in unifying data center architectures can overcome these issues. But first, let\u2019s dive into the three common roadblocks for enterprise IT.\nIntensive Resource Demands \nModern, data-intensive applications such as training AI models using TensorFlow require a vast number of compute cycles. And working AI models often demand a real-time response. In addition, many of these workloads scale out, such as a data preparation and analytics pipeline orchestrated by Apache Spark, which often involves huge transfers of data across multiple systems.\nDesigners and engineers are challenged to create higher quality products and content, with photorealistic imagery, faster. Also, now that many people are working from home, virtual desktop applications are requiring more graphics capabilities than ever. For example, video and audio must be delivered with high quality for video conferencing applications to be effective.\nTraditional data center infrastructures just aren\u2019t able to provide the necessary compute power to run these applications and support the service levels demanded by the business.\nComplex Workflows \nModern applications are also moving toward a cloud-native architecture, where a large number of containerized microservices are organized into complex workflows.\nThe logical applications clusters will spin up, spin down and scale out rapidly as demand fluctuates. This causes challenges to management, scalability, security and visibility. And this increase in size and scale generates a large amount of network traffic across the data center, which is becoming another bottleneck for achieving desired levels of service.\nNew Apps, New Silos \nBecause of the challenges associated with resource demands and workflow complexity, organizations often end up deploying these applications into one-off single-purpose clusters on premises, or in the cloud.\nThese new silos then require new toolsets, processes, protocols and sometimes even teams to manage the infrastructure. Since these apps don\u2019t fit the standard mold, they can\u2019t leverage the optimized infrastructure that runs the majority of the enterprise applications.\nThis results in increased operational overhead, and often these siloes don\u2019t adhere to IT standards for visibility, security and governance. This is especially true if organizational teams are going around IT and just running in the public cloud.\nThe Solution to These Enterprise IT Challenges\nTo overcome these challenges, enterprise IT can leverage tools based on the latest advances in server virtualization, software-defined infrastructure, hybrid cloud capabilities and, most recently, orchestration of cloud-native and containerized applications.\nOne solution is to evolve enterprise IT infrastructure where modern and traditional applications can run optimally on a shared pool of resources.\n\nToday, a majority of enterprise applications in the data center runs on a shared pool of resources managed by a virtualization or orchestration platform. This strategy maximizes the utilization of capital infrastructure and allows operational efficiency to be high. Then, all other applications that can\u2019t leverage that shared pool are run in a silo, where operational efficiencies are fundamentally lower.\nAlong with key platform partners such as VMware and Red Hat, NVIDIA is evolving the data center architecture so modern applications that require accelerated infrastructure can run alongside traditional applications using NVIDIA-Certified systems, operating systems and management platforms that have been optimized over the past decade and a half.\nThese solutions are accelerated by NVIDIA technology, including powerful GPUs, virtual GPU software and NVIDIA Mellanox networking, and are integrated into leading virtualization and container orchestration platforms. This combination delivers IT ease of management, deployment, operations and monitoring.\nLearn more about this architecture and accelerated computing for enterprise IT.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Cloud Services \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And there are multiple ways to build your library.\nWe\u2019ll review how to sync your Steam game catalog, search for games, add games to your library, and explain the difference between Instant Access and Single Session games.\nStart with a Steam Sync\nGeForce NOW members, on average, have about 50 games in their Steam catalog. The quickest and easiest way to find all the instant access games you already own is by using the Game Sync option.\nSimply launch GeForce NOW, select the Sync Your Games tile and log in to Steam. Now all your GeForce NOW supported Steam games appear in your GeForce NOW library.\nSync your entire Steam game library in about one minute.\nMembers can also sync their Steam library by going to Settings > Game Sync.\nOnce your Steam account is authorized, you can update your GeForce NOW library from Settings > Game Sync every time you purchase a new Steam game. It\u2019s the easiest way to keep your games catalog up to date in the GeForce NOW app.\nDiscover Games on GeForce NOW\nThe complete GeForce NOW games list is available online, including the latest releases.\nMembers can also find games in GeForce NOW using the search function, a powerful tool that lets you search by game title, developer, publisher, genre or keyword. Try searching for \u201ckittens\u201d and see what you find.\n\nGeForce NOW expands its games library each week. The latest games are available day-and-date, while back catalog games are added every Thursday. Check back regularly to see what\u2019s new.\nAdd Your Games to Your GeForce NOW Library\nOwners of games from Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Store (looking at you, Fortnite fans) or custom game launchers can search for games and manually add them to My Library by clicking +LIBRARY.\nAfter that, click PLAY and if it\u2019s the first time playing that game, just sign in to your account, when prompted, and you\u2019re ready to game.\nSuddenly your games are available on all the devices you own.\nBuying Games to Play with GeForce NOW\nGeForce NOW is a powerful gaming PC in the cloud \u2014 not a store.\nEven though it\u2019s not a store, members can still buy Steam games while in the app. There are two ways to do this. Add the game to your library, click PLAY, log in to Steam and purchase as you normally would. Or launch Steam to browse and make purchases.\nFor other game stores, or custom game launchers, you can purchase a supported game through the respective store, then go back into the GeForce NOW app to add it as outlined above.\nDiscover a game you want to play? Find which store it\u2019s supported on in the game page.\nFeatured GeForce NOW supported games are \u201cInstant Access.\u201d These appear within the app and can be added to your GeForce NOW library in less than a minute, all with streaming optimizations applied automatically for optimal graphics settings.\nDon\u2019t forget to check out weekly free games on the Epic Games Store, which are often supported on GeForce NOW.\n\nGame Selection Explained\nIt\u2019s important to remember how new cloud gaming is to NVIDIA and, especially, game publishers. Adding games to a new platform is a critical decision for publishers. Remember what Netflix was like when it first launched? Sending DVDs through the mail? Bold, but undeniably forward-thinking.\nGeForce NOW uses an opt-in process to make it easy for developers and publishers to join the service. NVIDIA signs an agreement with every game developer before publishing their titles on GeForce NOW. There is no cost for developers \u2014 games just run without difficult porting requirements \u2014 helping them reach millions of players who don\u2019t have game-ready PCs.\nNow, Get YOUR Game On\nGeForce NOW supports more than 800 games in total. More than 80 of those games are free-to-play. That\u2019s a great way to start building your library, especially for members who are new to PC gaming.\nMembers can build their library with +80 (and counting) free-to-play games.\nSign up, download the app, browse a wide selection of titles, click the game of your choice and begin your cloud gaming journey with GeForce NOW.\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the second in a series on the GeForce NOW game-streaming service, how it works and where it\u2019s going next. To learn more about cloud gaming, and the origins of GeForce NOW, read part one: GeForce NOW Explained: What is Cloud Gaming?\nIn our next blog, we\u2019ll talk about latency, what it is and tips to improve your GeForce NOW experience.\nFollow GeForce NOW on Facebook and Twitter and stay up to date on the latest features and game launches.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Gaming | How ToTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They\u2019re the TPS reports of creativity. Mundane moments like manually removing the same backgrounds from a series of images or adjusting the subject of a video, frame by frame.\nFor 3D artists, there\u2019s also a lot of hurry up and wait. Race to finish the model, then sit around and watch it render over the course of minutes, if not hours, making your underpowered laptop useless.\nThat\u2019s where AI comes in...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Forbes discusses how AI impacts modern creative work.\nAI can help shoulder the load and take care of these tedious tasks, freeing artists to spend more time creating and less time with chores. With AI speeding up creative workflows, creatives meet their deadlines more easily, saving valuable time and money in the process.\nThis month we\u2019re celebrating AI in all its forms with features that assist creators in realizing their artistic visions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Imagery\nLet\u2019s start with one of the biggest priorities for every photographer and graphic designer, image quality. \u00a0\nEnhance Images, a feature in Adobe Lightroom, uses machine learning to sharpen and improve image quality, running up to 5x faster on NVIDIA GPUs. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts scion, Super Resolution, is available now in Adobe Camera Raw, and is coming to Lightroom and Lightroom Classic this summer. This new feature improves an image\u2019s quality by intelligently enlarging photos while maintaining clean edges and preserving important details. With the push of a button, Super Resolution smoothly enlarges and enhances a 10-megapixel photo\u00a0into a 40 megapixel picture that\u2019s ready to be printed large for display.\nBetter yet, tests show Super Resolution processes images an astonishing 27X faster with the power of a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 laptop GPU compared to a laptop CPU with integrated graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBicubic resampling (left) versus Super Resolution (right).\nLooking for more tips on Lightroom?

With Smart Portrait in Photoshop, artists can easily experiment, making edits to facial characteristics, such as gaze direction and lighting angles, simply by dragging a slider.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone manually, these adjustments would take artists hours of tedious work. AI allows artists to make these changes almost instantaneously.\nThis gives artists greater flexibility with their images long after the photoshoot has ended. And they retain full control over their work with a non-destructive workflow, while the effects blend naturally into the original image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Inspiration\nBlackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve 17 is a massive release, with a ton of exciting features, including time-saving AI tools.\u00a0\nThe AI-based Magic Mask uses the DaVinci Neural Engine to automatically create masks for an entire person or specific features such as face or arms. Creators get matte finesse tools, the ability to add and remove strokes and automatic tracking.\nSmart Reframe quickly edits 16:9 HD or Ultra HD footage into square or vertical versions by automatically detecting and tracking objects and keeping them in frame, replacing the need to do this manually.\u00a0\nScene Cut Detection analyzes content on the timeline and applies blade edits to isolate each scene, rather than apply edits individually.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay Adobe Premiere Pro is your creative preference.\u00a0\nScene Edit Detection, recently introduced in the Premiere Pro public beta, is optimized by NVIDIA GPUs to quickly detect and tag cuts in final video files; eliminating painstakingly long scrubbing sessions just to make manual edits.\nAuto Reframe automatically keeps the most important part of your shot in frame when reformatting aspect ratios for various social media sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd once it\u2019s time for exporting, the built-in NVIDIA hardware encoder on NVIDIA GeForce GPUs exports high-resolution video up to 5x faster than CPU alone.\nAll of this helps you spend less time in the editing bay.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtistically Instrumental\nIt can be difficult to modify and detail massive 3D scenes without massive slowdown. By now you probably know where I\u2019m going with this.\u00a0\nAI-powered denoising in Blender is a process that predicts final images from partially rendered results while designing in the viewport. This allows users to explore new ideas and quickly iterate on design choices with full confidence in how it will turn out.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI will play a big part in the future of many industries but is very much present in creative workflows now. Give these AI features a try and be amazed by the results. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Screens Are Better Than One\nOne of the most popular and unique Studio laptops is newly refreshed. The ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo 15 OLED features a new GeForce RTX 3070 GPU and a one-of-a-kind 4K OLED HDR touchscreen paired with the unique ASUS ScreenPad\u2122 Plus secondary 4K display and a brand-new tilting design that offers effortless ergonomics and seamless creative workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew GeForce RTX 30 Series Studio laptops from ASUS and Razer are back in stock in the Studio Shop.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize Your AI With the March Studio Driver\nNVIDIA Studio Drivers are built specifically for creators and tested extensively against top creative apps and workflows.

This combination enables scale-out, multi-node performance and compatibility for a vast set of accelerated CUDA applications, AI frameworks, models and SDKs for the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that use vSphere for server virtualization.\nThrough this first-of-its-kind industry collaboration, AI researchers, data scientists and developers gain the software they need to deliver successful AI projects, while IT professionals acquire the ability to support AI using the tools they\u2019re most familiar with for managing large-scale data centers, without compromise.\nFigure 1: NVIDIA AI Enterprise for VMware vSphere runs on NVIDIA-Certified Systems to make it easy for IT to deploy virtualized AI at scale.\nOne Suite Package for AI Enterprise\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade AI tools and frameworks that optimize business processes and boost efficiency for a broad range of key industries, including manufacturing, logistics, financial services, retail and healthcare. With NVIDIA AI Enterprise, scientists and AI researchers have easy access to NVIDIA\u2019s leading AI tools to power AI development across projects ranging from advanced diagnostics, smart factories, fraud detection and more.\nThe solution overcomes the complexity of deploying individual AI applications, as well as the potential failures that can result from having to manually provision and manage different applications and infrastructure software that can often be incompatible.\nWith NVIDIA AI Enterprise running on vSphere, customers can avoid silos of AI-specific systems that are difficult to manage and secure. They can also mitigate the risks of shadow AI deployments, where data scientists and machine learning engineers procure resources outside of the IT ecosystem.\nLicensed by NVIDIA, AI Enterprise for vSphere is supported on NVIDIA-Certified Systems which include mainstream servers from Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro. This allows even the most modern, demanding AI applications to be easily supported just like traditional enterprise workloads on a common infrastructure and using data center management tools like VMware vCenter.\nIT can manage availability, optimize resource allocation and enable the security of its valuable IP and customer data for AI workloads running on premises and in the hybrid cloud.\nScalable, Multi-Node, Virtualized AI Performance\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise enables virtual workloads to run at near bare-metal performance on vSphere with support for the record-breaking performance of NVIDIA A100 GPUs for AI and data science (see Chart 1 below). AI workloads can now scale across multiple nodes, allowing even the largest deep learning training models to run on VMware Cloud Foundation.\nChart 1: With NVIDIA AI Enterprise for vSphere, distributed deep learning training scales linearly, across multiple nodes, and delivers performance that is indistinguishable from bare metal.\nAI workloads come in all sizes with a wide variety of data requirements. Some process images, like live traffic reporting systems or online shopping recommender systems. Others are text-based, like a customer service support system powered by conversational AI.\nTraining an AI model can be incredibly data intensive and requires scale-out performance across multiple GPUs in multiple nodes. Running inference on a model in deployment usually requires fewer computing resources and may not need the power of a whole GPU.\nThrough the collaboration between NVIDIA and VMware, vSphere is the only server virtualization software to provide hypervisor support for live migration with NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU technology. With MIG, each A100 GPU can be partitioned into up to seven instances at the hardware level to maximize efficiency for workloads of all sizes.\nExtensive Resources for AI Applications and Infrastructure\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise includes key technologies and software from NVIDIA for the rapid deployment, management and scaling of AI workloads in virtualized data centers running on VMware Cloud Foundation.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is a certified, end-to-end suite of key NVIDIA AI technologies and applications as well as enterprise support services.\nCustomers who would like to adopt NVIDIA AI Enterprise as they upgrade to vSphere 7 U2 can contact NVIDIA and VMware to discuss their needs.\nFor more information on bringing AI to VMware-based data centers, read the NVIDIA developer blog and the VMware vSphere 7 U2 blog.\nTo further develop AI expertise with NVIDIA and VMware, register for free for GTC 2021.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Virtualization \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

AWS IoT Greengrass is an Internet of Things (IoT) open source edge runtime and cloud service that helps you build, deploy, and manage device software. Customers use AWS IoT Greengrass for their IoT applications on millions of devices in homes, factories, vehicles, and businesses. AWS IoT Greengrass V2 now offers an open source edge runtime, improved modularity, new local development tools, and improved fleet deployment features. This new version provides a component framework that manages dependencies, and allows you to reduce the size of deployments since you only need to deploy the flexible components required for your application. A component is defined with a YAML or JSON formatted recipe. Additionally, applications no longer have to be AWS Lambda based; you can now package a command-line application directly in your recipe in whatever language you choose. Of course, AWS IoT Greengrass V2 provides components that enable to run Lambda applications as well. You can access the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 open source project here on GitHub and learn more about what\u2019s new in AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 in the AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide.\nThis post will walk you through the following two use cases of the integration between AWS IoT Greengrass V2 and NVIDIA Jetson modules:\n\nHow to deploy and use GPU accelerated Image Classification on NVIDIA Jetson modules (Nano, TX2, Xavier NX and AGX Xavier supported) with Amazon SageMaker Neo and\nHow to deploy a Video Analytics Pipeline with NVIDIA DeepStream on Jetson modules.\n\n\nThe two use case walkthrough sections are not dependent on each other. If you want to only deploy the NVIDIA DeepStream application sample, you can skip Section 1 and go directly to Section 2.\nPre-requisites\n\nNVIDIA Jetson module (Nano, TX2, Xavier NX or AGX Xavier)\nNVIDIA Jetpack 4.4\nGit\nopencv-python (if you are using a sd image this is included otherwise install with NVIDIA SDK Manager)\nNumPy (install this ahead of time as it can take some time to install)\nAWS IoT Greengrass V2\nAWS account with administrator access \u2013 If you don\u2019t have one, see Set Up an AWS Account\nAWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with AWS IoT Greengrass V2 support\u00a0\n[For part 2] NVIDIA DeepStream SDK installed on Jetson module\n\nSection 0: AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 Installation\nThis post is not an introduction to AWS IoT Greengrass V2. For detailed steps for installing and running AWS IoT Greengrass V2 on edge devices, refer to the getting started section of the developer guide.\nIf you just want to install AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 on Jetson modules and get started quickly, then you can take the installation script we prepared in GitHub and run this bash script on your Jetson module. Once it successfully installs, you can move on to the next sections.\nSection 1: Image classification with Amazon SageMaker Neo compiled models\nIn this section, we are going to walk you through how to run an Amazon SageMaker Neo-compiled and optimized image classification neural network model. This is common in use cases such as animal image classification.\nThis example will take a pre-made JPEG image of a dog converted to a NPY file, perform inference (classification) on it, and send the results as a message to AWS IoT Core via MQTT.\n\n\nFigure 1: Picture of a dog\n\nIn the context of AWS IoT Greengrass V2, this section will deploy three AWS IoT Greengrass components on your Jetson module:\n\nvariant.Jetson.DLR \u2013 installs the appropriate Amazon SageMaker Neo DLR on your device. Learn more about AWS IoT Greengrass V2 DLR Installer in the Developer Guide.\nvariant.Jetson.ImageClassification.ModelStore \u2013 installs ResNet18 image classification models optimized for Jetson modules\naws.greengrass.JetsonDLRImageClassification \u2013 Contains the Python example that does image classification and sends a message to AWS IoT Core using the MQTT protocol.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This example deployment will install some Python packages outside of a virtual environment. To be specific, python-opencv is specially installed as part of Jetpack 4.4. so the installation the Debian package may run for an extended period of time. NumPy can also take a long time to install.\nCheckout components for deployment\nIn this section we will clone the sample repository from GitHub and prepare the components for deployment. You will get Git installed to proceed.\nTo prepare the samples for deployment:\n1. From your Jetson module, check out the GitHub repository with the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-greengrass-v2-deploy-nvidia-deepstream.git\n2. In the GitHub repository, copy the recipes in the jetson_inference/recipes into your local GreengrassCore (i.e., ~/GreengrassCore/recipes). See the directory trees below that show the source paths in GitHub vs what it should look like in your GreengrassCore home directory after you copy them.\n\nDirectory structure for deployment\n\u00a0\n3. Copy the directory contents of jetson_inference/artifacts to your GreengrassCore/artifacts directory so that the folder structure looks like the following. \nGitHub Source\n4. Next, we will upload the component versions to the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 cloud service. Run the following commands on your Jetson device in your GreengrassCore home directory (~/GreengrassCore) you copied the recipes and artifacts into:\naws greengrassv2 create-component-version --inline-recipe fileb://recipes/aws.greengrass.JetsonDLRImageClassification-1.0.0.json aws greengrassv2 create-component-version --inline-recipe fileb://recipes/variant.Jetson.DLR-1.0.0.json aws greengrassv2 create-component-version --inline-recipe fileb://recipes/variant.Jetson.ImageClassification.ModelStore-1.0.0.json\nDeploy the sample components provided to Jetson module through AWS IoT Greengrass V2\nBefore starting this section, verify that you have successfully installed AWS IoT Greengrass V2 on your Jetson device. Uploading components to the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 service will allow you to install the examples to your AWS IoT Greengrass Core software installation on your Jetson device. Verify you have a valid installation of AWS IoT Greengrass Core software v2 \u2013 refer to the Pre-requisites section for help.\nTo deploy the components to your Jetson module:\n\nNavigate to the AWS IoT Core Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home).\nChoose Greengrass.Components to deploy\nChoose Components \u2013 You should see the three components you created via the AWS CLI.\nChoose any one of the three components you created.\nChoose Deploy.\nChoose Create new deployment.\nChoose Next.\nFor Name give the deployment a name.\nFor Target type, choose Thing Group and enter the name of your device core, which can be found at the following link to the AWS IoT Greengrass Core page within the AWS Management Console:\u00a0\u00a0 https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/greengrass/v2/cores).\nChoose Next.\nOn the Select Components screen, make sure to select all three of the components you created and choose Next.\nOn the Configure Components screen, choose Next.\nOn the Configure advanced settings screen, choose Next.\nOn the Review screen choose Deploy.\n\nVerify Inference Results\nIf you have successfully deployed the three components, inference should start immediately.\nThis will show inference data coming from your Jetson device resulting from a successful deployment. If you do not see any data, please go through and verify successful completion of each procedure outlined in the \u201cDeploy the Components to your account\u201d section, or consult the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Troubleshooting Guide.\nTo view results with the MQTT Test Client:\n\nOn the AWS Management Console, choose AWS IoT Core\nChoose Test\nChoose MQTT Test ClientEnter topic to filter messages\nEnter demo/topic for Subscription Topic\u00a0\nChoose Subscribe to topicInference/classification messages\n\nSection 2: Deploy NVIDIA DeepStream Application with AWS IoT Greengrass V2\nNVIDIA\u2019s Jetson product family enables customers to extend server-class compute to devices operating at the edge. NVIDIA has developed a streaming analytics toolkit called DeepStream to leverage TensorRT and CUDA to optimize AI performance at the edge. The DeepStream SDK provides an end-to-end video processing and ML inferencing analytics solution for transforming pixels and sensor data into actionable insights.\nIn this section, we will present how AWS can help deploy DeepStream apps and new ML models run by DeepStream apps on NVIDIA Jetson modules at scale with AWS IoT Greengrass V2.\nFor this demonstration, we will use the sample model and sample DeepStream application developed by NVIDIA in their DeepStream SDK as an example. You are also welcome to use your customized models and DeepStream apps.\nBefore starting the deployment process, first verify your DeepStream installation on your Jetson module:\n1. Enter this command on your terminal to start the reference application\n$ deepstream-app\u00a0-c\u00a0<path_to_config_file>\n** <path_to_config_file>\u00a0is the pathname of one of the reference application\u2019s configuration files\n2. Verify DeepStream application runs successfully on your terminal\nNote, if you are using a Jetson Nano , we recommend using /opt/nvidia/deepstream/<your deepstream version>/samples/configs/deepstream-app/source8_1080p_dec_infer-resnet_tracker_tiled_display_fp16_nano.txt\u00a0as your configuration file.\nIf\u00a0the sample app starts without reporting error, then proceed to the deployment section in this article.\u00a0 If you have trouble running this sample app, please refer to DeepStream documentation troubleshooting section for more details.\nTo deploy the NVIDIA DeepStream Application with AWS IoT Greengrass V2:\nStep 0: Create a DeepStream application package\nBefore completing the steps in this section, first determine if you\u2019d like to use a sample DeepStream application package or use your own customized deployment package. We have created a sample DeepStream application package that consists of three components:\n\nML model (directly sourced from DeepStream SDK provided by NVIDIA:\u00a0 https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-download)\nModified version of sample DeepStream application configuration file.\nModified version of sample DeepStream primary GIE configuration file.\n\nYou can use this as an example to follow along the deployment steps, or you can use your own customized version of DeepStream configuration files and your own trained ML models.\nStep 1: Prepare local environment\n\n1. If you have not yet cloned the GitHub repository, run the following command to clone it locally git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-greengrass-v2-deploy-nvidia-deepstream.git\n2. Export the path to the GitHub repository locally as an environment variable by running: cd aws-iot-greengrass-v2-deploy-nvidia-deepstreamexport DEMO_PATH=${PWD}\n\nStep 2: Upload your package into an Amazon S3 bucket\n\nCreate an S3 bucket by running the following command. (if you already have an S3 bucket, skip this step and use your existing bucket in Step XX): aws s3 create-bucket \u2013bucket [YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME]\nEnter into nvidia_deepstream_integration folder in your GitHub repository by running: cd $DEMO_PATH/nvidia_deepstream_integration\nUpload our prepared sample deployment package in our S3 bucket: aws s3 cp jetson_deployment.zip\u00a0 s3:// [YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME]/jetson_deployment.zip\n\nStep 3: Create an AWS IoT Greengrass V2 component\n\nRename greengrass_component.json file by adding a postfix \u00a0that AWS IoT Greengrass V2 uses as version number. For example: mv greengrass_component.json greengrass_component-1.0.0.json\nOpen greengrass_component.json file with your text editor, and replace the placeholder [YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME] with the actual bucket name that you used in Step 2.\nUpload an AWS IoT Greengrass V2 component to the AWS IoT Greengrass cloud service. aws greengrassv2 create-component-version --inline-recipe fileb://greengrass_component-1.0.0.json\n\nYou will see the following message returned by AWS CLI:\n{\n\u201carn\u201d: \u201carn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:XXXXXXXXXXXX:components:deepstream-deployment:versions:1.0.0\u201d,\n\u201ccomponentName\u201d: \u201cdeepstream-deployment\u201d,\n\u201ccomponentVersion\u201d: \u201c1.0.0\u201d,\n\u201ccreationTimestamp\u201d: \u201c2021-03-19T14:13:30.126000-07:00\u201d,\n\u201cstatus\u201d: {\n\u201ccomponentState\u201d: \u201cREQUESTED\u201d,\n\u201cmessage\u201d: \u201cNONE\u201d,\n\u201cerrors\u201d: {}\n}\n}\n** Note: the default AWS IoT Greengrass V2 role does not have S3 access. So please manually add S3 access to your AWS IoT Greengrass V2 role if you have not already done so by running the following AWS CLI command or doing it manually in the AWS Management Console.\naws iam attach-role-policy --role-name [Your_Greengrass_V2_role_name] --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess\nIf you encounter Invalid choice: 'greengrassv2', this indicates that you need to download and update your AWS CLI service to the latest version.\nStep 4: Deploy the AWS IoT Greengrass\u00a0V2 component\n\nNavigate to the following page on AWS IoT console and click on \u201cDeploy\u201d. \n\n\nAWS Management Console, AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Components Deployment\n\nVerify that the component ran successfully either from your AWS IoT Greengrass Core software v2 runtime log located at /greengrass/v2/logs. \n         \nIn that folder, there\u2019s greengrass.log (for the nucleus) and <componentName>.log for each component.\nYou can also verify by observing if you are receiving inferencing results on your configured DeepStream pipeline sink.\n \n\nSection 3: Additional Resources\nLocal deployment of AWS IoT Greengrass V2 components\nYou can also deploy locally without an internet connection as outlined in the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Getting Started Guide (Create your first component section).\nChange camera source\nYou can replace the image inference with a camera interface. Because most Jetson modules do not come with cameras, your method for interfacing with the camera may vary for your type of camera. Please refer to inference.py for more details.\nDeepStream IoT Test Applications (test 4 or test 5 in DeepStream application)\nDeepStream applications have a function called Gst-nvmsgbroker. This plugin can send payload messages to AWS IoT Core** using MQTT protocol. It accepts any buffer with NvDsPayload metadata attached and uses the nvds_msgapi_* interface to send the messages to the server. If you need to use AWS IoT Core or AWS IoT Greengrass as a MsgBroker sink for your DeepStream application, you need the shared library from this GitHub:\u00a0AWS IoT Core Integration with NVIDIA DeepStream.\nNVIDIA DeepStream integration with AWS IoT Greengrass V1 (legacy)\nTo review the integration between DeepStream and AWS IoT Greengrass V1, please refer to the following GitHub repository. https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-greengrass-deploy-nvidia-deepstream-on-edge\nSummary: Start building!\nIn this post we\u2019ve shown two ways to use AWS IoT Greengrass V2 on NVIDIA Jetson devices: classify images using SageMaker Neo and deploy a DeepStream video analytics pipeline for video data. To help you evaluate, test, and develop with this new release of AWS IoT Greengrass, the first 1,000 devices in your account will not incur any AWS IoT Greengrass charges until December 31, 2021. You will still incur charges for other AWS services you use with your applications running on AWS IoT Greengrass such as AWS IoT Core. We can\u2019t wait to see what you build!\nReferences\nChihuahua picture is part of the Stanford ImageNet resource collection located at http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs.\nNVIDIA DeepStream Developer Guide: https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-getting-started\nAWS IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/index.html\nAbout The Authors\nRyan Vanderwerf is a Partner Solutions Architect focusing on IoT partnerships\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYuxin Yang is an IoT Consultant in AWS Professional Services\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n         TAGS: \n        Amazon Alexa, amazon sagemaker neo, AWS IoT, aws iot greengrass v2, edge computing, image classification, NVIDIA Deepstream, video analytics pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resources\n\n Getting Started\n What's New\n Top Posts\n Official AWS Podcast\n AWS Case Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Follow\n\n \u00a0Twitter\n \u00a0Facebook\n \u00a0LinkedIn\n \u00a0Twitch\n \u00a0RSS Feed\n \u00a0Email Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Sign In to the Console \n\n Learn About AWS\n\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Accessibility\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nWhat is Generative AI?\nWhat is Machine Learning (ML)?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n Resources for AWS\n\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Library\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partners\n\n\n\n Developers on AWS\n\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavaScript on AWS\n\n\n\n Help\n\nContact Us\nGet Expert Help\nFile a Support Ticket\nAWS re:Post\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\nAWS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Create an AWS Account \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Amazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: \n          Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\nBahasa Indonesia\nDeutsch\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\nFran\u00e7ais\nItaliano\nPortugu\u00eas\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\u03a1\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53)\n\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7e41\u9ad4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Terms\n|\n Cookie Preferences \n|\n\u00a9 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

A Basic Definition\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBy\nScharon Harding \n\npublished\n\n29 March 2021\n\n\n\n\nMax-Q laptops explained \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments (9)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)If you\u2019re looking for a gaming laptop that\u2019s able to handle demanding titles or high-resolution gaming but don\u2019t want the thickness, weight and loud fans that often come with gaming laptops, a PC running an Nvidia Max-Q graphics card may be the answer.When shopping for a gaming laptop, you\u2019ll probably run into models featuring some sort of Max-Q graphics card, such as an \u201cRTX 2080 Max-Q.\u201d Max-Q is a graphics card technology Nvidia first launched in 2017 that allows the rendering horsepower of the company\u2019s higher-end graphics cards -- previously reserved for gaming PCs or very bulky gaming laptops--to fit in a slimmer form factor that's more like mainstream laptops. There are Max-Q versions of Nvidia\u2019s GTX and RTX graphics cards, but there is no AMD equivalent to Nvidia\u2019s Max-Q.If you\u2019re wondering about the unique name, the term Max-Q is one that Nvidia borrowed from the aerospace world. As Nvidia detailed in a blog post, Max-Q is when a spacecraft has its maximum dynamic pressure. Go figure.But for PCs, Max-Q is about allowing laptops to run Nvidia graphics technology while still being thinner, quieter and more energy-efficient than other gaming laptops. In general, graphics cards require substantial heat management, which leads to bulky, loud cooling systems and the thick and heavy shape of typical gaming laptops.Max-Q graphics cards are meant to to optimize efficiency and cooling systems so you can run heavy graphics workloads, such as 4K gaming, on a laptop that doesn\u2019t look like a heavily ventilated, noisy, chunky PC from the \u201890s. Max-Q laptops aim to have a peak noise level of 40dBA from a 25cdm (cubic decimeter) distance and when facing \u201caverage\u201d gaming workloads and room temperatures.Again, Max-Q graphics cards are only found in laptops. You wouldn\u2019t buy one to equip your gaming desktop or custom PC build. Laptop vendors currently making laptops with Max-Q graphics cards include Acer, Alienware, Asus, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI and Razer. Sadly, vendors don't always clearly state whether their system is using a Max-Q or non-Max-Q (sometimes called Max-P) mobile GPU, but we'll always tell you in our laptop reviews.Are Max-Q Graphics as Powerful as Regular Mobile Graphics?Max-Q graphics cards are generally slightly less powerful than their native counterpart (i.e. you can expect slightly lower frame rates from a laptop running an RTX 2080 Max-Q than one running a regular mobile RTX 2080, for example). \u00a0In testing, we've found an RTX 2070 Max-Q laptop to about tie with an RTX 2060 non-Max-Q laptop. Ultimately, Max-Q imposes a power limit that feeds into lower clocks, so very different GPUs end up performing at a similar level.But when comparing a Max-Q to a non-Max-Q laptop, the former should still be thinner, lighter and quieter than the other, as well as less expensive (assuming all else is equal).How Do Max-Q Graphics Cards Work?(Image credit: Nvidia)Max-Q graphics cards are able to fit in thin laptops due to Nvidia optimizing them for \u201cpeak efficiency.\u201d So rather than ramping up the clock speed, voltages and memory bus to deliver the best performance, they are tuned to deliver the best performance possible in a given thermal envelope or at a given level of sound output. According to the company, chips, drivers, the control system and thermal and electrical components are carefully engineered for Max-Q graphics cards.Max-Q laptops still have cooling systems, but their makers have to carefully construct things like thermal and electrical designs, heatpipes, heatsinks, efficiency energy regulators, quality--yet quieter--fans and other components.RTX 20-Series Max-QAs Nvidia has moved onto its RTX 20-series and, soon, RTX 30-series mobile GPUs, its Max-Q tech has also evolved.\u00a0The second generation of Max-Q, found in relevant mobile RTX 20-series cards, features efficiency-focused improvements, specifically:Dynamic BoostLow voltage GDDR6Advanced OptimusNext-gen regulator efficiencyDLSSDynamic Boost introduces a more flexible way for a laptop to share its thermal capabilities between the graphics silicon and the CPU. With Dynamic Boost, the Max-Q graphics card will use up to 15W more power--for up to 10% better performance and higher frame rates--when the CPU's workload is lightened. One example of when a laptop often won't need a CPU's full power is during gaming -- especially if that chip has a lot of CPU cores and threads.RTX 20-series Max-Q tech (Image credit: Nvidia)RTX 20-series Max-Q cards can also support Nvidia's Advanced Optimus Technology, which helps laptop battery life by switching over to the CPU's integrated graphics for less intense workloads, such as web surfing or watching videos. Advanced Optimus Technology also works with Nvidia G-Sync. Laptop vendors have to choose to implement the feature. Examples include the Lenovo Legion 7i and 5i so far.\u00a0RTX 30-Series Max-QStarting January 26, laptops with mobile RTX 30-series cards will be available. This also introduces the third-generation of Max-Q.Updates this time around are focused on gaming speed, specifically:Dynamic Boost 2.0WhisperMode 2.0Resizeable Base Address Register (BAR)Dynamic Boost 2.0 claims a \"larger performance boost\" than its predecessor and works on a per-frame basis. Meanwhile, WhisPerMode 2.0 uses AI algorithims to control CPU, graphics card, PC temperatures and fan speeds for quieter performance. And Resizable BAR is Nvidia's answer to AMD Smart Access Memory\u00a0(SAM). It looks to improve performance letting your CPU \"access the entire GPU frame buffer at once\" via PCIe.\u00a0Notably, Nvidia isn't being very specific here, so we'll have to wait until the next generation of Max-Q laptops ends up in our lab before knowing if these improvements are impactful.\u00a0Does My Laptop Use Max-Q?\u00a0With the release of RTX 30-series laptops, some laptop manufacturers stopped including whether or not a laptop uses Max-Q technology in its specs sheets.\u00a0For detailed instructions on confirming whether or not you're using a Max-Q graphics card, check out our tutorial, How to Tell if an RTX 30-Series Laptop Uses a Max-Q GPU.\u00a0This article is part of the Tom's Hardware Glossary.Further reading:Best Gaming LaptopsGaming Laptop Buying Guide\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (9)\n\n\n\nScharon HardingSocial Links NavigationScharon Harding has a special affinity for gaming peripherals (especially monitors), laptops and virtual reality.

For example the difference between RTX 2080 and 2080 Max-Q is more than 50%. It is rather more significant than \"a slightly lower FPS\". \n\nHence the term optimized for efficiency means nothing more than \"lowered clock speed, lower power consumption limit and a tailored performance ramp down based on measured fan noise and laptop cooling solution\". Great ideas for creating a workable environment using the same underlying chip as the desktop part.\n\nI guess Max-Q sounds more sellable than underclocked?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyronnen\n\n\nWow, that's significant, and will affect my decision to purchase a Max-Q laptop. Based on that, the 1080 Max-Q should perform better. Afaik the difference on the 10 series is not 50%.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncats_Paw\n\n\nI believe this article is more of an ad than a definition of what Max-Q is.\nThis is fairly sad because the Max-Q cards are fairly good as a concept (if you play less demanding titles but want to have a cool, thin laptop... so far this is almost a must).\n\nThe main cringe is adding into your definition a slide from nVidia's marketing. \nnotebookcheck.net wrote a great article on the max-Q technology, keywords for search in brackets (Opinion: Nvidia's Max-Q).\nConclusion? \"All in all, from my perspective this appears to be largely a gimmick for sales to customers\".\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimeMania\n\n\nIs it possible to buy/upgrade graphics cards for laptops.

It seems like some company is missing a small opportunity.\nMost laptops have their graphics solutions soldered onto their mainboard and therefore cannot be simply upgraded internally. The solution to this is an external based box that runs over USB-C Thunderbolt. These however are usually only used when gaming and not something that is plugged in 100% of the time since this makes the portability of the laptop rather more cumbersome.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntytlyf\n\n\nThere are Max-Q versions of Nvidia\u2019s GTX and RTX graphics cards, but there is no AMD equivalent to Nvidia\u2019s Max-Q AMD uses SmartShift Technology. Which is essentially the same thing. The RX Radeon series support this.\nTo me, I'd prefer AMD's solution to the Max-Q. But you need a full AMD system CPU/GPU to take advantage.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimmyP777\n\n\nAnimeMania said:Is it possible to buy/upgrade graphics cards for laptops.

They were called MxM modules and I personally changed one for a friend in the late 2000s.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPapaCrazy\n\n\nTH should be ashamed to publish such obfuscated fluff. The Max-Q GPUs are massively gimped cards. All this talk of \"optimization\" and complete lack of benchmark data does your readers a disservice.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk3rzorg\n\n\nIf that's what everyone is saying about Max-Q, I am quite happy then! \nPlaying big games at full scale in laptop is the last thing I'd do and I already have big machine for that! I needed a portable lightweight device with good modern GPU power and for that, I believe Max-Q does the job for me.\nI got a Zephyrus M15 with 2070 Max-Q for $1300 (BestBuy BF deal) and so far, I'm quite happy about it's performance and yes, I kinda do appreciate it's factory underclock which will help my machine from going rogue with heat and fan sound!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 9 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Here's How Dual Property Ownership Applies to You    PropertyGuru   11 March 2021 7 min read            Returning Home from Overseas? Here's How Dual Property Ownership Applies to You   As the pandemic continues to worsen in several countries overseas, Singaporeans continue to return home to be reunited with family and move away from areas where the spread of the COVID-19 virus is rampant. Some do so for safety, others do so due to loss of jobs, but the purpose is the same; Singaporeans have returned to find shelter from the storm. It is estimated that some 13,700 Singaporeans have returned home.  Returning home brings its own struggles concerning housing, however. Some Singaporeans are still holding on to their various properties abroad, be it under rent or as outright ownership. For those who did not foresee this situation, many have been stuck in a loop of renting locally, or moving back in with their parents. However, these are both short-term solutions with no long-term investment from an economic view.  For those affected, we have narrowed down some options in light of the unusual circumstances that the pandemic has brought to our shores. Can I Buy A New HDB Flat Now? The short answer is \u201cYes\u201d. However, there are certain conditions, including the requirement that one does not own any other property, be it in Singapore or overseas. This is because HDB flats are public housing which prioritises Singapore citizens who need a home (i.e. they don\u2019t have any other property).  If you\u2019re caught in a sticky situation with an overseas property yet are in genuine need of a roof over your head in Singapore, you can try making an appeal to HDB. Approval, however, is on a case-by-case basis, though there have been successful cases in the past. Browse resale HDB flats on PropertyGuru.  How Can I Make A HDB Appeal? For some who have settled down overseas, disposing of their overseas family home might not be an option. This could be due to a myriad of reasons such as children studying overseas staying at the property, aged parents staying behind as they are unable to travel, an inability to sell the property due to complicated real estate situations aboard and so on. If your situation is complicated, you have a chance of appealing with HDB. The main point of communication is to let the relevant authorities know that you are unable to afford buying private property and have an immediate need to instead purchase an HDB flat.  Appeal Tip #1: Get Your Finances in Order  Part of the criteria taken into consideration during an appeal is whether or not you have a good financial position that reassures HDB of your ability to afford and support a flat in Singapore. In this respect, it would benefit your case to assemble all the necessary financial documents to prove that you have the necessary income and funds to fulfil eligibility requirements.    Story continues At the same time, you should be ascertaining what you can afford, and how much of a home loan you might be able to get, based on those financial means. Using online tools like PropertyGuru's Affordability Calculator can help you calculate your TDSR, and thus what kind of property you can afford. Appeal Tip #2: Be Transparent about your Reasons for Holding onto Overseas PropertyBeing honest and transparent about your need to hold onto your overseas property is a necessity, be it family members staying behind, or legal ramifications that prevent you from selling. If you are earning any money from renting out your property, it is important to declare that as well. Appealing for a new HDB flat is not a means to work the system but a means by which citizens can still find a home to own and a place to live affordably in Singapore at great need.This entire process can take up to several months and you should make sure that you have all the paperwork necessary before moving forward. Popular Case Studies for Returning Singaporeans Case Study #1: New Couple Who Own Overseas Property Where Their Aged Parents Are StayingThis is a popular scenario, particularly in parts of Malaysia and Australia where more than 15,000 Singaporeans diaspora reside. These places are favourable due to their large sprawling land space as well as the fact that they are away from the hustle and bustle of life. It is a common occurrence to see aged parents follow their children overseas to retire in more peaceful surroundings while taking in the adventures that retiring in a foreign country can provide. In light of the pandemic, it has been said to be dangerous for those who are elderly or in more vulnerable health states to travel and some might not wish to go through the rigours of travel or the intensity of quarantine on their return home.The best-case scenario for this is if you wish to return to buy a resale flat that will give you the means to stay in Singapore while not having to worry about the worries connected with a brand new one. However, the Additional Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (ABSD) of 12% will be incurred but you may wish to appeal your case to HDB directly to lower it. Alternatively, if possible, you may wish to pass the title of your overseas property to your parents directly and take on the new property in Singapore as your \u201cfirst property\u201d. This might also simplify some of the legal matters overseas where your parents are living. Case Study #2: Older Couple Buying Local Property For Retirement While Owning Second Property Overseas For Children Staying ThereThis has also become a common occurrence. When children move overseas to study, if the parents are so inclined, they tend to move overseas as well, working remotely, retiring or even starting their own businesses. However, the pandemic saw many parents coming back for fear of worsening situations forcing their children to be left behind to pursue their education. In this scenario, if your overseas property is being used by your kids, you might want to retain the title to that property and instead use their names to purchase private condominiums here. This has become a popular occurrence not just to protect their children\u2019s ability to have property in Singapore, but to avoid the nasty ABSD that comes with dual property ownership. If you do not have the financial means to purchase private property, similar to case study one, you may want to pass off the overseas property to your children and buy more affordable housing for retirement plans locally. Catch-22 The real dilemma comes from those who do not plan for the future. Unfortunately, Singapore laws act in such a way that they allow you to buy overseas property after your initial purchase of a HDB flat (after the MOP of your flat has been fulfilled). However, you will be unable to do the opposite which is to buy a HDB flat after purchasing an overseas property under your name. Though COVID-19 comes with its unprecedented scenarios, if you are planning for the future and eventually intend to return home, securing your first home locally is an important step forward. Whether you are buying a property with less restrictions, or you have successfully appealed to HDB, you will then also need to finance your property with a suitable mortgage. Given that you might have been out of touch with Singapore's property and finance regulations if you have been overseas for a long time, consulting PropertyGuru Finance\u2019s Home Finance Advisors will familiarise you with your next steps, and also help you find the most suitable mortgage from all the major banks in Singapore when you've received approval and found your ideal property, so that you can successfully start your home ownership journey in Singapore\u2014wherever that might take you.

These include priority access to gaming sessions, extended session lengths and RTX ON for beautifully ray-traced graphics and DLSS in supported games.\nMonthly memberships are available at $9.99 a month. A new annual membership option, at $99.99, provides the best value.\nGeForce NOW wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without our Founders members. That\u2019s why we\u2019re adding the Founders for Life benefit, which continues the special $4.99 introductory rate as long the account is in good standing. (For more details, click here.)\nWhether it\u2019s a short time, a long time or a lifetime, we want our Founders members, who\u2019ve supported GeForce NOW from the start, to stay a part of the family.\nThe Next Level\nWe\u2019re grateful for the feedback we receive from all our members. We use it to improve the service and plan for the future. In the last year, that included:\n\nSupporting day-and-date launches, like Cyberpunk 2077, and top free-to-play games\nIncreasing the game library, which now includes more than 800 games\nOpening new data centers, giving us more than 20 around the world\nExpanding capacity in existing data centers, allowing us to grow the service further\nImproving quality of service, with even more optimizations on the way.\n\nAs GeForce NOW continues to grow, we\u2019re working to improve streaming quality and ease of use, and to add more games.\nWith the 2.0.28 update, currently rolling out to members and available to all in about a week, streaming quality takes the next step.\nOne of the ways we do this is with a unique adaptive Vsync technology. The feature synchronizes frame rates at 60 or 59.94 Hz server-side to match the display client-side, reducing stutter and latency on supported games. A new adaptive de-jitter technology will enable us to increase bit rates for improved quality over choppy networks, too.\nWe\u2019re also passionate about making GeForce NOW easier to use, including updates that get members into the game even faster. The first phase of these improvements includes account linking for key games on the platform, coming in the next 1-2 months, as well as updates to game preloading that should cut load times by about half.\nAdditionally, we\u2019re adding capacity in our busiest data centers along with new server locations. Next up is Phoenix, Arizona, with our first Canadian data center, in Montreal, to follow. We expect both to be operational later this year, helping reduce wait times for Priority and Founders members.\nWe\u2019re bringing new and expanded data centers online for GeForce NOW.\nWe also get tons of questions from our community about bringing GeForce NOW to new regions. We just launched with a new partner in Turkey, with Saudia Arabia and Australia on the horizon.\nGeForce NOW Alliance partners operate regional data centers and offer GeForce NOW in local currencies and local language support. That means reduced latency, significantly better ping times and less waiting. Expect additional GeForce NOW Alliance partners expanding into new territories soon.\nSpeedrunning Your GFN Thursday\nFinally, we\u2019re upgrading GFN Thursday, our ongoing commitment to bringing great PC games and service updates to members each week.\nIn 2020, we onboarded and released an average of 10 games a week. With a new express onboarding pipeline, our goal is to increase that by about half by year-end.\nWe\u2019ve continued to add support for additional digital game stores. In case you missed it, last week we released GOG.COM versions of four CD PROJEKT RED games, including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Game of the Year Edition.\nAnd since it\u2019s Thursday, we can\u2019t leave without giving our members their weekly dose of new games.\nSystem Shock: Enhanced Edition (Steam) and more are joining the GeForce NOW library this week.\nIn addition to the service updates rolling out with this week\u2019s 2.0.28 release, we\u2019re streaming 7 new games on GeForce NOW. Members can look for:\n\nDo Not Feed the Monkeys (Steam)\nGoNNER (Steam)\nLoop Hero (Epic Games Store)\nMonopoly Plus (Steam)\nSnooker 19 (Steam)\nSystem Shock: Enhanced Edition (Steam)\nWanba Warriors (Steam)\n\nNew memberships, improved streaming, more games \u2014 GeForce NOW year two is just getting started.\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

All information in this article is accurate as of the time of the update. If you know of any other baby grants, initiatives, or schemes not mentioned, drop us a message at editorial@dollarsandsense.sg  Being a parent is one of the greatest joy a person can experience. However, it also comes with a lifetime of responsibilities. For many parents in Singapore, there will be days where you and your spouse be tested physically, emotionally, mentally, and of course, financially, as you care for your little ones. Celebrating alongside you is none other than the Singapore Government. And with the fertility rate in Singapore at just 1.10 as of 2020, it\u2019s not difficult to see why they are just happy. Raising a child in Singapore is not cheap. After having spent anything between $5,000 to $15,000 from pregnancy to delivering the baby, parents can easily incur between $8,000 to $18,000 in costs just for raising their baby in the first year. To help new parents with the cost of raising their babies in Singapore, there are quite a number of baby grants that the government has introduced. In this guide, we will run through each of these baby grants that you and your little ones will be eligible for. Find Out More Baby Bonus Cash Gift Child Development Account Medisave Personal Income Tax Relief And Rebate  Baby Bonus Cash Gift The Baby Bonus Cash Gift is a baby grant that basically gives cash to parents of newborn babies. How much parents receive depends on the birth order of their child. This ranges from $8,000 (1st and 2nd child) to $10,000 (3rd and subsequent children).    Source: MSF For the first and second child, parents will get a total of $8,000 in cash over a period of 18 months. For the third and subsequent child, parents will get a total of $10,000 in cash over a period of 18 months. In addition, there will be an additional one-off $3,000 Baby Support Grant for parents of Singaporean children born from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2022. Child Development Account The Child Development Account (CDA) is part of the baby bonus scheme designed to help parents with the cost of raising their child. Money in the CDA account can be used to pay for educational and healthcare expenses at approved institutions. You can find the list of approved institutions on this list. CDA First Step Announced in the 2016 Budget, all Singaporean children born from 24 March 2016 onwards will receive an initial $3,000 in their CDA.   Story continues Dollar-For-Dollar MatchingOn top of the First Step Grant of $3,000 for each child, the government will match any savings made to the child\u2019s CDA on a dollar-for-dollar basis, capped at the following:1st child: Dollar-for-dollar matching capped at $3,000 per child2nd child: Dollar-for-dollar matching capped at $6,000 per childDo note this is only applicable for children who are born or have an estimated date of delivery, on or after 1 Jan 2021. If a child is born before 1 Jan 2021, the maximum Government co-matching is $3,000.3rd and 4th child: Dollar-for-dollar matching capped at $9,000 per child5th child and beyond: Dollar-for-dollar matching capped at $15,000 per child  SourceBecause the CDA is a savings account, you will need to choose a bank for the CDA to be opened at. This can be done online. You can select from OCBC, UOB and POSB.In our view, it\u2019s better for you to choose a bank that you already have an existing internet banking relationship with. This will make it convenient for you to monitor the CDA, since the account will be tied to your name. This way, you wouldn\u2019t need another internet banking login to access the account.If you wish to sign up for both the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and the CDA, you can read our step-by-step guide to applying for the Baby Bonus Scheme.Read Also: 6 Ways For Singapore Parents To Maximise The Child Development Account (CDA)MedisaveNot everyone knows but all newborns will receive a $4,000 Medisave Grant into their Medisave Account. There is no need to apply for this grant as it will be automatically deposited into your child\u2019s Medisave Account once the birth is registered.Medisave monies can be used to pay for items such as MediShield Life premiums, private integrated shield plans premium and the cost of any hospitalisation required.Read Also: Why You Should Consider Paying For Your Child\u2019s MediShield Life Premiums From Your MediSave AccountPersonal Income Tax Relief And RebateIf you are already paying income tax, you will realise that having a child allows you to claim tax relief and tax rebate. Here\u2019s a quick look at what you may be entitled to.Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) Tax relief of $4,000.Handicapped Child Relief (HCR)Tax relief of $7,500. Do note, you can only claim for either the QCR or the HCR.Working Mother\u2019s Child Relief (WMCR)If you are a working mother, you can claim the WMCR at 15% of your earned income for your 1st child, 20% for the 2nd, and 25% per child for all subsequent children, with a maximum cap at 100% of your earned income. Do note that a personal income tax relief of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed for each Year of AssessmentParenthood Tax Rebate (PTR)The Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR) is a rebate that is given to parents who are paying income tax. Unlike tax relief, which only reduces a person\u2019s assessable income, the PTR is a tax rebate, which means you are given this rebate based on the income tax that you are liable to pay. You and your spouse will share the PTR based on an apportionment agreed by both of you.Any unutilised amount of PTR will be carried forward to offset against the income tax payable for subsequent years until the rebate has been fully utilised.

Ravi Philemon   27 March 2021 5 min read       In this article:  1972.HK            Former PAP MP expressed concern that locals will eventually be priced out of the private property market as Singapore continues to see a flood of foreign funds flow into Singapore EdgeProp reported earlier today that \u201cword on the street is that all 20 units at Swire Properties\u2019 luxury condo Eden at 2 Draycott Park have been sold to a single buyer\u201d. The apartments were sold for $293 million or $4,827 psf. The sale will be completed by May 26, 2021, subject to the fulfilment of the purchase agreements.  Guy Bradley, chief executive of Swire Properties, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to sell all 20 apartments at Eden, our phenomenal ultra-luxury residences in the heart of Singapore. The sale of the units is significant as it reflects Eden\u2019s distinct design, which has been combined with green living experiences, and also recognises the strength of our residential brand in this new market. Moving forward, we\u2019ll continue to explore Singapore for more opportunities that showcase our brand and fit our business strategy.\u201d Commenting on this news on his Facebook page, former Member of Parliament (MP) Inderjit Singh said, \u201cSingaporeans will be priced out of the private property market as we continue to see a flood of foreign funds flow into Singapore.\u201d   private property   Mr Singh, who was an MP with the ruling party expressed concern that this will have a spiral effect on cost of living in Singapore. Sharing Mr Singh\u2019s views, former Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Yee Jenn Jong expressed that property investment by itself will not stimulate the economy other than to pushing up property prices. Mr Yee, a member of Workers\u2019 Party, said: \u201cTrickle down economics was once popular, maybe still is for some. Billionaires coming useful only if they also invest in creating businesses and trade opportunities.\u201d Mr Paul Ho, chief officer at iCompareLoan, said, \u201cit is unlikely that locals will be priced out of private property market in the near future.\u201d He pointed out that the number of Singapore residents living in Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats dipped for the first time this year since 2003. Household sizes shrank as the number of HDB households continued to climb. The latest HDB Sample Household Survey showed that almost 8 in 10 Singapore residents, or a total of 3.04 million locals, lived in HDB flats in 2018, as compared to 3.06 million in 2013. They made up 1.01 million households, up from 0.91 million five years ago. One reason for this trend is that the size of household units living in HDB flats is shrinking, with an average of 3.1 people per household in 2018, down from 3.4 in 2013 and 2008.   Story continues Mr Ho said, \u201cIn the last 10 years, a substantial number of private apartments and executive condominiums were developed for the mass market. The shift downwards of the resident population living in HDB flats could be due to more residents upgrading to private property.\u201dMr Ho added, \u201cLet\u2019s also not forget that the luxury condo Eden at 2 Draycott Park is an ultra-luxury residential project, which means that it is out of reach for most people. So, I am not sure if the sale of all the units in that development to a single Chinese buyer is representative, or if it will have a knock-on effect in our residential property market.\u201dSwire Properties officially unveiled its first ultra-luxury residential project in Singapore in April 2018, \u201cEDEN\u201d, an exclusive apartment building inspired by Singapore\u2019s vision as a \u2018city in a garden\u2019 and designed by Thomas Heatherwick of Heatherwick Studio. Located at 2 Draycott Park in the prestigious District 10 Orchard Road neighbourhood, EDEN, offers 20 apartments in total, each occupying the entire floor. Each unit in the ultra-luxury residential project has a saleable area of over 3,000 sq ft, and comes with four en-suite bedrooms.Mr Ho said, \u201cthere is ample liquidity in Singapore and amid a low-interest environment we are likely to see more positive sentiment in the private property market. In such a climate, the ultra high net worth investors may be viewing Singapore more favourably.\u201dHe added, \u201cwith political stability, it is understandable why Singapore looks attractive to ultra high net worth investors. Singapore\u2019s business-friendly environment also attracts many ultra high net worth investors to park their assets here.\u201dUltra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) are defined as having a net worth of at least US$30 million in constant 2018 dollars. It is the wealth segment above very-high-net-worth individuals (>$5 million) and high-net-worth-individuals (>$1 million). Although they constitute only 0.003 per cent of the world\u2019s population (less than 1 in 33,000), they hold 13 per cent of the world\u2019s total wealth. By 2017 there were 226,450 individuals designated as UHNWI representing an increase of 3.5 per cent with their combined total wealth increasing to $27 trillion.According to Savills and Wealth-X, in 2014, UHNW individuals are particularly relevant the real estate sector, with the total UHNW population\u2019s real estate holdings accounting for over US$5 trillion by 2014, or 3 per cent of the world\u2019s real estate holdings. This is a huge proportion considering this population is only 0.003 per cent of the world\u2019s population.UHNW individuals are of crucial importance not only to the real estate, finance, banking and investment industry; but also to luxury companies who target UHNW individuals, charities, universities and schools amongst others. UHNW individuals are notable players in the field of philanthropy; many have their own private foundations and support a variety of causes, from education to poverty relief. Financial institutions are known to target UHNW individuals, having specific parts of their bank designed to manage the wealth of their UHNW clients.The post Will Singaporeans be priced out of private property in the future? appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

The fire, which broke out on Wednesday shortly after midnight at OVHcloud, destroyed one of four data centres in Strasbourg, in eastern France, and damaged another, the company said.  There was no immediate explanation provided for the blaze, which erupted just two days after the French cloud computing firm kicked off plans for an initial public offering. Europe's largest cloud services provider told clients including the French government, the Centre Pompidou and cryptocurrency exchange Deribit to activate their disaster recovery plans following the blaze. \"Firefighters were immediately on the scene but could not control the fire\" in the affected data centre, founder and chairman Octave Klaba said on Twitter. He said the plan for the next couple of weeks would include rebuilding the centres' equipment and checking their fiber optic connections. Some 100 firemen fought the blaze which sent a thick plume of black smoke into the night sky. Video images showed firefighters dousing one smouldering, multi-storey building in the early morning as they cooled down the site. Founded by Klaba in 1999, OVHcloud competes against U.S. giants Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp's Azure and Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud, which dominate the market.  \"OVH is a pretty important hosting company on the internet,\" said Mike Prettejohn, who directs UK-based network security company Netcraft. He said the affected servers hosted 3.6 million websites, including niche government platforms in France, Britain, Poland and the Ivory Coast. Prettejohn estimated that just under 2% of the sites with the French .FR domain extension had been affected. French politicians have championed OVHcloud as a possible alternative to U.S. cloud services providers, but it has so far lacked the scale and financial clout to dent their market share. The company said on Monday it had started the process for a potential IPO, without giving details. The Strasbourg centres were among OVHcloud's 17 data centres in France, and 32 globally. Several clients said their websites had gone offline or emails could not be accessed. There was no immediate news of any major data losses. The Centre Pompidou, one of France's best known art complexes, said its website was down. Cryptocurrency exchange Deribit said its blog was down but that trading had not been impacted, free chess server Lichess.org said it had lost 24 hours' worth of games history and news outlet eeNews Europe said its websites were offline.   Story continues PR agency Caroline Charles Communication said its data was held at another site but that it had lost access to emails in the middle of Paris Fashion Week.OVHcloud declined to comment on its fire safety protocols. The site did not pose a toxic risk, it added.(Reporting by Matthieu Protard and Mathieu Rosemain in Paris and Raphael Satter in Washington; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Mark Potter and Matthew Lewis)  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

CBRE being the exclusive marketing agent, will conduct the sale by way of a Public Tender exercise that will close on 6 April 2021 at 3 pm. The freehold elevated site of approximately 56,481 square feet currently accommodates The Bayron, a two-block condominium comprising 96 units that has a total strata floor area of 112,300 square feet. The Bayron, a residential development, enjoys dual frontages spanning approximately 24 meters along Devonshire Road and 64 meters along Saint Thomas Walk. Under the Master Plan 2019, The Bayron site is zoned \u201cResidential\u201d with a plot ratio of 2.8 and a height control of up to 36 storeys. The maximum allowable gross floor area for the site is approximately 159,893 square feet, which will increase to 169,218 square feet if the 7% bonus gross floor area allowed for balconies is included. The guide price for The Bayron is S$376 million, which works out to a land price of approximately S$2,377 per square foot per plot ratio. Taking into consideration the 7% bonus gross floor area allowed for balconies, the land price will be approximately S$2,287 per square foot per plot ratio. Mr Michael Tay Head of Capital Markets, Singapore at CBRE, said, \u201cThe Bayron presents a rare opportunity for developers seeking quality freehold sites at a strategic location to increase their land bank. As the site is located within the Central Area, the \u201885-sqm\u2019 rule does not apply in the calculation of the maximum number of dwelling units per development. This provides developers the flexibility in configuring the new development to accommodate units of a smaller size, which will be attractive and affordable to buyers who may be looking to downsize and retire, and millennials seeking smaller dwelling units in a prime yet extremely connected location.\u201d  Mr Tay added, \u201cWhile the previous launch of The Bayron in September last year attracted interest from developers, there were also uncertainty concerns surrounding the COVID-19 situation and the economy, as well as potential construction and development risks. This resulted in a more conservative approach to acquisitions by potential buyers.\u201d \u201cNotwithstanding, the residential market has demonstrated its resilience over the past few months. Additionally, as more countries are increasingly putting in place COVID-19 vaccinations, we envision a positive outlook for the residential sector with foreign buying expected to gradually return.\u201d    Story continues Located on an exclusive and elevated plot, The Bayron enjoys unblocked panoramic view of lush greenery, Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and even the CBD skyline. Surrounded by prime high-rise residential developments including The Metz, Saint Thomas Suites and New Futura, The Bayron enjoys the privacy and tranquillity of a prestigious residential enclave.At the same time, it is only a stone\u2019s throw on foot to Somerset MRT station and Orchard Road where one can access premier retail malls such as 313 Somerset, Orchard Central, Mandarin Gallery and Ngee Ann City, as well as medical services such as Paragon Medical Centre and 111 Somerset Medical Centre. Meanwhile, lifestyle amenities are also within walking distance at Singapore River and Fort Canning Park. Educational institutions that are in proximity include Chatsworth International School (Orchard Campus) and River Valley Primary School.Mr Paul Ho, chief mortgage officer at iCompareLoan, said, \u201csites like The Bayron will be sought after as property investments in Singapore will be among the top preferred financial tools for High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). Masterplan 2019 positions Singapore as a livable city, a global business gateway and tourist haven. With such positioning by the government, it is understandable why property investment volumes will be driven-up here. There is a lot of excess fluidity in the region and Singapore is seen as a safe haven for real estate investments.\u201dHe added, \u201cthe Singapore government is also proactive in keeping the property market here stable. More recently, it drew up a slew of measures to curb a property bubble from being formed here. Investors see all such activities by the Government in a positive light. Although it curbs excessive speculation, these measures assures investors their investment is safe in a country where the rule of law, especially in economic matters, is paramount.\u201dThe economic impact of the Coronavirus issue is expected to be short-lived based on the current situation, says a note from Cushman & Wakefield (C&W). The report said that the Singapore government has tried to put in place multiple lines of defence to minimize the chances of the virus spreading further.Any disruption to market activity is expected to be short-lived and so the real estate impact will be minimal said Ms Christine Li, C&W\u2019s Head of Research for South East Asia. Although the real estate impact will be minimal, the impact on the hospitality sector is more immediate said the report.Mr Ho believes that value buys in the property market right now are are landed inter-terrace house. He notes that the per square feet price on the built-up area in such properties are usually less than $1000. He also advises those that are looking for a property in District 9 to get help from property agents.If you are home-hunting in District 9, you should seek the help of a good panel of property agents and the mortgage consultants as they can help you with affordability assessment and a promotional home loan. The services of professionals like mortgage loan experts are free. Their analysis will give best home loan seekers better ease of mind on interest rate volatility and repayments.The post The Bayron, a freehold residential development, for sale at 376 million appeared first on iCompareLoan Resources.

(Photo Illustration: Thiago Prud\u00eancio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)  \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images By Eric Lam (Bloomberg) \u2014Bitcoin\u2019s retail investor-driven surge has nothing on its miners and trading firms. Just look at WallStreetBets, the freewheeling forum favored by amateur traders whose touts led to a frenzy in videogame retailer GameStop Corp.\u2019s stock. Reddit message board WallStreetBets has a \u201cNo Cryptocurrency\u201d rule, which forbids posts devoted solely to digital tokens like Bitcoin and their underlying technology \u2014 there are offshoots like SatoshiStreetBets for that. But it\u2019s littered with references to cryptocurrency miners. Posts and comments abound on RIOT, the ticker of Riot Blockchain Inc., and MARA, or Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. \u2014 two Bitcoin mining stocks whose rise of more than 7,600% in the past year as of March 12 has surpassed Bitcoin\u2019s 10-fold surge.  \u201cOh, we can talk about RIOT now? Nice, I guess I can show this 16-bagger,\u201d one user said using the investing forum\u2019s language in a February post to brag about a 16-fold return on their investment. Reddit didn\u2019t create the mania for miners and cryptocurrency brokerage shares which have ridden the rally in Bitcoin in the past year, but inclusion of those names in the message board does reflect the allure of big crypto stock winners when Bitcoin is booming. Crypto-linked stocks previously surged during the Bitcoin bubble in 2017, although at the time businesses like former iced-tea company Long Blockchain Corp. had little to do with Bitcoin and blockchain technology other than references in their names. These days, there are a multitude of listed crypto firms with legitimate ties to the industry. Canadian broker Voyager Digital Ltd., up some 8,900% in the last 12 months through March 12, is another stock that has captured investors\u2019 imagination as Bitcoin returned to the fore. Meanwhile, digital currency trading platform Coinbase Global Inc.\u2019s upcoming Nasdaq listing shows there\u2019s still more to come for the space. It was said to be valued at roughly US$90 billion in a private auction.  It\u2019s a craze that analysts say could backfire: Bitcoin is volatile enough \u2014 buying stocks that are once-removed from the digital asset run an even bigger risk. \u201cInvestors should consider whether the business model is sustainable in an environment where Bitcoin prices aren\u2019t quadrupling year over year,\u201d said Howard Wang, co-founder of New York-based investment advisory and market research firm Convoy Investments. \u201cBitcoin and miners are fundamentally different investments,\u201d Wang added, noting that returns \u201care related but will often diverge.\u201d Layers of Risk Investors in Bitcoin largely need to worry only about price swings, alongside security, storage and other fees. Investing in a company also adds additional layers to consider, including the quality of the business and management, and wider market forces.   Story continues \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to do better than just holding Bitcoin itself, frankly,\u201d said Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore. \u201cOwning an asset versus the business that produces that asset are quite different both from a cost and opportunity perspective.\u201dGold, the historical standard store of value, is a case in point. The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, made up of shares in producers of the yellow metal, has fallen by more than 40% in the past decade; spot gold has climbed 20%.Bitcoin miners also have to contend with sucking up more and more electricity to power the computer farms that produce the digital token. Regulatory and political scrutiny is another challenge.For instance, China\u2019s stock market largely missed out on the past year\u2019s Bitcoin-fueled trading bonanza after a series of government crackdowns, including a 2017 ban on transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. More recently, China\u2019s Inner Mongolia autonomous region banned cryptocurrency mining amid concern over energy consumption.A Bloomberg-curated basket of some key Chinese blockchain-related stocks \u2014 including Shenzhen Forms Syntron Information Co., Shenzhen Ysstech Info-Tech Co. and Brilliance Technology Co. \u2014 is down about 12% so far this year as of March 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.These companies are largely focused on using the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies rather than Bitcoin mining and trading. In contrast, Chinese Bitcoin mining rig maker Canaan Inc.\u2019s U.S.-listed depositary receipts are up about 10-fold.The attention on cryptocurrency stocks may get even hotter with the impending debut of exchange Coinbase. Coinbase\u2019s listing \u201cwill be the true test of the public market\u2019s appetite for the next Facebook and Twitter of technology,\u201d said Jehan Chu, partner with crypto advisory and investment firm Kenetic Capital.\u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

As of March 30th, 2021, Resizable BAR is supported for GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards and laptops.\nFor desktops to take advantage of Resizable BAR, users need a GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics card with a supported VBIOS, a compatible CPU, compatible motherboard, motherboard SBIOS update, and our newest GeForce Game Ready driver.\nFor GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops, please check with the manufacturer to see if Resizable BAR is supported on a specific model.\nFor instructions on how to enable Resizable BAR, continue reading.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is Resizable BAR?\nResizable BAR is an optional PCI Express interface technology. As you move through a world in a game, GPU memory (VRAM) constantly transfers textures, shaders and geometry via many small CPU to GPU transfers.\nWith the ever-growing size of modern game assets, this results in a lot of transfers. Using Resizable BAR, assets can instead be requested as-needed and sent in full, so the CPU can efficiently access the entire frame buffer. And if multiple requests are made, transfers can occur concurrently, rather than queuing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Steps\nTo successfully activate Resizable BAR on a desktop PC, please follow these steps in order, referring to the expanded installation instructions below:\n\nConfirm you have a compatible CPU & CPU chipset (see list below)\nConfirm you have a compatible motherboard (see list below)\nUpdate your motherboard SBIOS, if required, by installing an update from the manufacturer. Then enable Resizable BAR support in your motherboard\u2019s BIOS interface\nUpdate to the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver (version 465.89 WHQL at the time of writing,\u00a0released March 30th, 2021), or a later version \nIf you have a GeForce RTX 3060, you\u2019re good to go. If you have a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, 3080, or 3090, then you may require an updated VBIOS\nIf you have a Founders Edition graphics card from NVIDIA, get your VBIOS update tool directly from our website. If you have a custom partner card, get the update tool from their site (see list below)\nVerify Resizable BAR is enabled in the NVIDIA Control Panel (see instructions below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat CPUs and CPU Platforms Support Resizable BAR?\nResizable BAR requires CPU and motherboard compatibility, and a Resizable BAR SBIOS update. As of March 30th, 2021, the following CPU chipsets and CPUs officially support Resizable BAR on GeForce RTX 30 Series desktop GPUs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesktop CPU and Chipset Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Chipsets\n\n\nAMD 400 Series (on motherboards with AMD Zen 3 Ryzen 5xxx CPU support)\n\n\nAMD 500 Series\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD CPUs\n\n\nAMD Zen 3 CPUs\nRyzen 3 5xxx\nRyzen 5 5xxx\nRyzen 7 5xxx\nRyzen 9 5xxx\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel Chipsets\n\n\nIntel 10th Gen\nZ490\nH470\nB460\nH410\n\n\nIntel 11th Gen S\nAll 11th Gen chipsets available as of March 30th, 2021\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel CPUs\n\n\nIntel 10th Gen\nIntel 11th Gen S-Series\n\n\ni9-10xxx CPUs\ni9-11xxx CPUs\n\n\ni7-10xxx CPUs\ni7-11xxx CPUs\n\n\ni5-10xxx CPUs\ni5-11xxx CPUs\n\n\ni3-10xxx CPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMotherboard Support\nNVIDIA is working with motherboard manufacturers around the world to bring Resizable BAR support to compatible products. As of March 30th, 2021, the following manufacturers are offering SBIOS updates for select motherboards to enable Resizable BAR with GeForce RTX 30 Series desktop graphics cards:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard Manufacturers Supporting Resizable BAR\n\n\nASUS\nASRock\nCOLORFUL\nEVGA\nGIGABYTE\nMSI\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHead to the manufacturers\u2019 website to discover whether your motherboard is compatible, and to download and install updates if available. Additionally, please refer to the manufacturer\u2019s documentation for enabling Resizable BAR support in the BIOS after installation of new firmware.\nPlease note, some motherboard manufacturers have unofficially extended Resizable BAR support to prior generation products. Your mileage may vary utilizing these solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Resizable BAR On Your GeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Card\nHaving updated your motherboard, you\u2019ll need to update your GPU, and download and install a GeForce Game Ready Driver, released March 30th, 2021, or later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready Driver Update\nIn practice, the performance benefits of Resizable BAR can vary substantially from game to game. In our testing, we\u2019ve found some titles benefit from a few percent, up to 12%. However, there are also titles that see a decrease in performance, so NVIDIA will be pre-testing titles and using game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only when it has a positive performance impact. That way you won\u2019t have to worry about bugs or performance decreases, and won\u2019t have to rely on the community to benchmark each title and discover whether Resizable BAR is beneficial in the games you\u2019re playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular, graphically demanding titles can run faster and smoother with Resizable BAR, further improving your experience\nWith the release of our GeForce Game Ready Driver on March 30th, 2021, we\u2019re enabling Resizable BAR support on all GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, and expanding support to an additional 9 games, for a total of 17:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 30 Series Resizable BAR Supported Games\n\n\nAs of March 30th, 2021\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\n\n\nBattlefield V\n\n\nBorderlands 3\n\n\nControl\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n\nDeath Stranding\n\n\nDIRT 5\n\n\nF1 2020\n\n\nForza Horizon 4\n\n\nGears 5\n\n\nGodfall\n\n\nHitman 2\n\n\nHitman 3\n\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nMetro Exodus\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\n\nWatch Dogs Legion\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs we identify additional titles that benefit from Resizable BAR, we\u2019ll introduce support via Game Ready Driver updates.\nBefore proceeding further through the Resizable BAR process, please download and install the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, released March 30th, 2021, or later, and reboot your PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVBIOS Update\nGeForce RTX 3060 desktop graphics cards launched February 25th, 2021 with a pre-installed Resizable BAR VBIOS.

Many industries were affected due to the world's biggest outbreak necessitating total lockdown which impacted trade directly in the worst manner. The fashion industry was one of the worst hit as there were zero footfalls due to total closure of business. The business of many fashion and clothing brands which operated through the online medium were also affected to a large extent, ace fashion designer Megha Rao's clothing brand 'holiCHIC' being one of them.  Businesses had to completely restrategize themselves in order to keep up with the changing demands of the consumers which changed drastically right from the time the pandemic struck the globe. As the sales of traditional apparel businesses plunged downwards, business owners had to think of alternatives which would help sustain themselves in such times of crisis. \"we needed to completely rethink and restructure our strategies to keep the sales registers ringing and that's when the idea of coming out with products which were much in demand struck my mind,\" says Megha. There was a major financial crunch due to layoffs and salary cuts, so, Megha thought of coming out with an affordable fashion and lounge wear line which would not pinch the pockets of a common man. Simultaneously, with the production of easy on the pockets clothing wear, Megha came up with the innovative idea of introducing face masks which were the need of the hour during the trying times. Surprisingly the revenues of her brand shot up 40% more than compared to the previous year and above that 'holiCHIC' built strong community and a much larger client base by expanding their social presence by 45%. It was indeed a humongous task to sustain businesses in such times of distress, but Megha made it possible through her extraordinary survival instincts which made her brand achieve more success then ever.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Back in summer 2017 we noted one of the first Alienware desktop gaming machines to come packing AMD Ryzen technology (Threadripper CPU choices arrived at that time). Now it seems like AMD has split the much stronger bond between Alienware and Intel in the gaming laptop market.\n\nTwitter PC hardware enthusiast rogame has unearthed laptop benchmark listings featuring multiple Alienware m15 r5 laptops. If you head on over to the Alienware site today you will only find 'R4' generation Intel CML-H/Nvidia Ampere laptops listed, the m15 is the 15-inch version and m17 a similar 17-inch screen equipped variant. Benchmark info tables suggest that these Alienware m15 r5 laptops are Ryzen Edition variants and there are three base configurations evidenced as follows:\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics\nAMD Ryzen 9 5800H processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics\nAMD Ryzen 9 5800H processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics\n\n\nNotebookCheck reckons the top SKU listed includes a Max-P GPU option. From my own experience it seems like Alienware laptops often favour the max power GPU variants that it selects, so wouldn't be surprised if they all feature the max wattage GPU options here.\n\nOfficial Nvidia table reveals the wide range of power budgets laptop makers can set with its GPUs. This can mean there is significant overlap in the performance, and it isn't always obvious which laptop might be faster from just the headline GPU name. Though Nvidia is encouraging laptop makers to include this info in specs it is worth double-checking and always check the reviews.\nFurther expectations across the Alienware m15 Ryzen Edition laptops include a base config of 16GB system RAM, an NVMe SSD, plus a display panel of 15-inch FHD at 144Hz. Hopefully, better display options will be available, as there is with the Intel R4 models. There is no word about any 17-inch Ryzen Edition screen options for those that like a bigger portable display.\nIt looks like other gaming laptops are going to follow suit with rumours of Dell G-series, HP, and Razer preparing Ryzen powered models shortly where they haven't before.\n\nAlienware and Cherry recently revealed that laptops from the former feature the new Cherry MX ULP mechanical switches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\n\n                    After Apple's blockbuster reveal last week, the GPUs don't live up to the hype. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\nUpgraded MacBook Pro laptops come with M1 Pro and Max SoCs\n\n                    14.2- and 16.2-inch laptops have more ports, a Mini LED screen (notch), Function keys. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nApple Unleashed on 18th Oct to debut new MacBook Pros, M1X\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 8, Pro X, and Go 3 revealed\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nAMD sales up 54 per cent, beats analyst expectations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 3 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Yes, it is being installed at a facility in the UK, at the Kao Data data centre, but it isn't in Cambridge, it is 40 miles south in Harlow. Nevertheless, this location was chosen for its proximity to the cluster of life science tech companies in the vicinity of Cambridge.\n\nKao Data, Harlow\nAs touched upon above, the Cambridge-1 AI supercomputer will be largely tasked with simulations and problems that healthcare researchers are interested in solving. In the coming months it is expected to be running through programs designed by scientists from the likes of AstraZeneca, GSK, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London, and Oxford Nanopore. These companies and institutions have already announced their intent to use the Cambridge-1, but I'm sure others will follow.\nAI computing when applied to medicine is thought to be particularly adept at spotting patterns that can improve the detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In recent times some branches of medicine have become increasingly data driven (like radiology and pathology) and are very receptive to advancing with extra computational power.\nCambridge-1 focus areas\n\n\nJoint industry research \u2014 Solving large-scale healthcare and data-science problems which otherwise could not be tackled due to their size, resulting in improved patient outcomes, increased success rates and decreased overall healthcare costs.\nUniversity-granted compute time \u2014 Access to NVIDIA GPU time will be donated as a resource to specific studies to contribute to the hunt for cures.\nSupport AI startups \u2014 NVIDIA will provide opportunities to learn \u2014 and it will collaborate with startups to nurture the next generation and provide early access to AI tools.\nEducate future AI practitioners \u2014 The system will serve as a destination for world-class researchers and provide hands-on experiences to the next generation.\n\n\n\nThe Cambridge-1 will utilize the Nvidia DGX SuperPOD architecture for a whopping 400 petaflops of AI performance, and 8 petaflops of Linpack performance. Specifically, the Cambridge-1 will be powered by 80 Nvidia DGX A100 systems and connected with Nvidia Mellanox InfiniBand networking. It is expected to be the UK's most powerful supercomputer, enter the Top500 supercomputers list (at the current time it would be positioned at approx number 30), and be one of the most efficient supercomputers in the world (probably top 3, or position 3 in the Green500 list). On the topic of green credentials, another interesting nugget about the Cambridge-1 is that it will be running using 100 per cent renewable energy at Kao Data.\nMore information about Cambridge-1 is promised for GTC 2021 (starts 12th April). This UK-based supercomputer will be up and running \"in the coming months\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\n\n                    And you can spec up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, or an AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nCorsair Xenomorph PC system with AMD Ryzen 6000 APU spotted\n\n                    8C/16T 'Rembrandt' APU features an RDNA2 iGPU and is joined by DDR5-4800 memory. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\nHP lists AiO PCs with \"AMD Ryzen 7000 Series\" CPUs\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 10 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

(PHOTO: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images By Chanyaporn Chanjaroen (Bloomberg) \u2014 DBS Group Holdings Ltd.\u2019s private bank raised more than S$1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) from two in-house products, including a new one targeting sustainable investing. The Barbell Income Fund, which invests in stocks, bonds and cash, drew about S$970 million in less than six weeks after introduction, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest bank said Tuesday in an emailed release. The other product based on environmental, social and governance principles attracted another S$690 million since its October launch, it said.  Chief Investment Officer Hou Wey Fook is among those advocating the so-called \u201cbarbell strategy,\u201d which focuses on both growth and more conservative investments. The portfolio he runs is a combination of traditional asset classes like stocks with exposure to a digital economy, along with corporate bonds and real estate investment trusts. \u201cWe can expect rates to stay at ultra-low levels in the foreseeable future as a result of structural changes in global demographics, and the trend toward digitalization,\u201d Hou said. \u201cIn this new normal, investors cannot rely on a traditional portfolio strategy that utilizes bonds only \u2013 a more robust multi-asset strategy is better positioned to enhance portfolio yield.\u201d The Barbell fund focuses on high-dividend stocks and uses options to help enhance yield, Singapore-based DBS said. The Barbell Income Fund is an addition to the bank\u2019s investment products referencing the CIO Barbell Strategy Portfolio, which has returned 26% net of fees as March 10 since its August 2019 inception. DBS\u2019s ESG Outperformance Trade is a three-year warrant, which takes a long position on the MSCI Emerging Markets Asia ESG Leaders Index while simultaneously going short the MSCI Emerging Markets Asia Index from which it\u2019s derived. The first tranche of this product was introduced in 2018 and has returned close to 100% since its launch, the bank said. \u00a9 2021 Bloomberg L.P.

The Swiss bank has had to close around $10 billion of supply-chain finance funds that bought notes issued by Greensill, and which it marketed to clients. It is also trying to recoup a $140 million loan it made to the company last year.  \"While these issues are still at an early stage, we would note that it is possible that Credit Suisse will incur a charge in respect of these matters,\" it said. Greensill filed for insolvency last week after losing insurance coverage for its debt repackaging business. Credit Suisse's share price has fallen over 10% since it announced its supply-chain funds were suspended on March 1. It has paid investors about $3.1 billion in redemptions from the four funds so far, and said it would be announcing further cash distributions over coming months. The bank also said on Tuesday that, \"contrary to certain reports\", its chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, was not aware until Feb. 22 that insurance related to Greensill could expire on March 1. Greensill founder Lex Greensill said in a court filing last week that he kept senior individuals at Credit Suisse, including Warner, informed about the funds' insurance coverage in the \"weeks\" leading up to its insolvency application on March 8.  The collapse has put fresh pressure on Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein who has been trying to move the bank on from a string of bad headlines, spanning a spy scandal that ousted predecessor Tidjane Thiam to a $450 million write-down on a hedge fund investment. The level of oversight and risk management applied at the bank's asset management division is under scrutiny particularly as Gottstein had ordered a review of the Greensill funds last year. Supply-chain financing, or reverse factoring, is a method by which companies can get cash from banks and funds such as Greensill to pay their suppliers without having to dip into their working capital. See EXPLAINER: Greensill had large exposure to one client, GFG Alliance, which is controlled by steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta and has started to default on its debts, according to Greensill's insolvency application. Gupta said on Friday the conglomerate was in talks with Greensill's administrators on a standstill agreement to pause its debt payments to Greensill for an agreed period.   Story continues COSTS 'IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE'The saga overshadowed what was otherwise a strong start to the year for Credit Suisse, whose shares opened up 1.8% on Tuesday as it said it had achieved the highest level of pretax income in both January and February in a decade.Andreas Venditti, analyst at Bank Vontobel, said the bank was facing a loss of confidence among investors.\"The Greensill case has cost Credit Suisse around three billion francs in market capitalization. Investors have been reassessing the risks to which the bank is exposed. In a worst-case scenario the bank faces years of litigation,\" he said.\"It is currently virtually impossible to estimate how high the direct costs of the case will be for Credit Suisse. Investors don't like uncertainty.\"Three Credit Suisse investors told Reuters they were concerned about the fallout for the bank. They declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.An investor in Credit Suisse debt said the main financial risk was to the bank's reputation, which it said was a key asset for the wealth management business.One Credit Suisse shareholder said the bank should fully compensate investors in the supply chain funds. A second equity investor said that, as well as reputational risk, it was worried about the effect of the Greensill collapse on the bank's future asset-raising and its credentials in the growing business of socially responsible investing.Credit Suisse declined to comment beyond its statements.The bank has hired external firms to help deal with regulators and insurers amid questions over the contracts that underpinned Greensill's security. It has also recovered some $50 million of the $140 million bridge loan, it said, leaving its outstanding collateralised loan at $90 million.Credit Suisse said on Tuesday that its asset management division, which sold the funds to investors, was working closely with Greensill's administrator, Grant Thornton, and with other parties to facilitate the recovery of funds.Japanese insurer Tokio Marine, which provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes through an Australian unit, is investigating the validity of those policies. A person with knowledge of the matter has said these were directly linked to the Credit Suisse funds.(Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt in Zurich, and Carolyn Cohn in London; additional reporting by Simon Jessop in London and Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig in Frankfurt; Editing by Michael Shields and Pravin Char)  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

The world's largest contract electronics manufacturer has previously forecast strong demand for the new iPhone 12, saying its business will be supported by \"stronger than expected\" sales for smartphones and for telecommuting devices amid a coronavirus-induced work-from-home trend.  Taiwan-based Foxconn, in a short statement on Thursday, said it expects consumer electronics revenue, which includes smartphones and smart watches, to rise more than 15% in the January-March quarter from a year earlier. It did not elaborate. Foxconn said it saw revenue for cloud products that include servers and revenue for computing products such as laptops to rise about 10% in the first quarter, respectively. Foxconn's chairman said last month that he expects his company and its clients will face only \"limited impact\" from a chip shortage that has rattled the global automotive and semiconductor industries. Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has previously said it expects revenue to grow about 10% in 2021. Over the past year or so it has announced several deals on the production of electric vehicles with automakers including U.S. electric-car maker Fisker Inc, China's Byton and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group and Stellantis NV's Fiat Chrysler unit. Shares in Foxconn have risen more than 20% so far this year.  Tech-powerhouse Taiwan's economy is booming due to the pandemic because of global demand for tablets, computers and smartphones. Taiwan's January export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, surged 49.3% from a year earlier to $52.72 billion. Taiwan's government last month revised up its outlook for 2021, predicting the economy will grow at its fastest pace in seven years, seeing gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 4.64% on the jump in exports driven by tech demand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) the world's largest contract chip maker, in January posted its best-ever quarterly profit and lifted revenue and capital spending estimates to record levels as it forecast \"multiple years of growth opportunities\".

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

The latest report on Tuesday teased a vague bump in specs like clock speed and memory, which could make the Switch run better... but jumping all the way to 4K resolution would need a massive bump from the 2016 system's current specs.\nWhat made the report so interesting was that it had a technical answer to that seemingly impossible rendering challenge. Nvidia, Nintendo's exclusive SoC provider for existing Switch models, will remain on board for this refreshed model, Bloomberg said, and that contribution will include the tantalizing, Nvidia-exclusive \"upscaling\" technology known as Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).\nSince that report went live, I've done some thinking, and I can't shake a certain feeling. Nvidia has a much bigger plan for the future of average users' computing than they've publicly let on.\nMaking smoother gaming\u2014arguably easier than Tom Cruise\u2019s face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Here's an example of the latest build of Minecraft with ray tracing and DLSS upscaling to 4K enabled. This test ran at roughly 32 fps; with the RTX 3060, you can enjoy similarly clean DLSS upscales to 1440p with ray tracing on and enjoy performance closer to 60 fps.\n              \nMinecraft\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example of the latest build of Minecraft with ray tracing and DLSS upscaling to 4K enabled.

When you hear about \"AI-trained\" systems that, say, play video games or generate wacky names, they're usually working in the same way in order to reliably detect successful patterns. They study and duplicate existing data (dictionaries, Twitter conversations, Tom Cruise's face, videos of StarCraft competitions), then they go through double-, triple-, and sextuple-checking runs to confirm how well a computer can organically recreate that data before loosing their systems into real-world tests.\nBut those tests are usually run with a supercomputer managing those troves of data. This is where DLSS pivots sharply. As a consumer-grade offering, DLSS requires Nvidia's \"RTX\" graphics cards that (theoretically) cost as little as $329\u2014and nothing else. No extra CPU, RAM, or other peripherals required. The idea being, RTX cards come with a slab of \"tensor cores\" baked onto the silicon, and these are dedicated to the mathematical grunt work of tasks like image interpretation and translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works in part because DLSS is focused on a relatively nonvolatile prediction scenario: what a lower-resolution image would look like if it had more pixel depth. The shape of diagonal lines, the leaves on swaying tree branches, and even the letters and words on a street sign are all\u00a0arguably easier to predict\u2014at least when fueled by a lower-pixel base\u2014than a StarCraft player's reaction to a Zerg rush. While DLSS's initial launch left a few things to be desired, the system has matured to a point where moving 3D images with DLSS processing generally looks better than their higher-resolution, temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) counterparts.\nSide-by-side comparisons of lower-res DLSS and higher-res TAA show strengths and weaknesses, but as of 2021, it's become a wash. That wash has substantially higher frame rates and lower processing requirements for the DLSS side, since the traditional GPU grunt work is not only pixel-bound but also texture-bound. DLSS's savvy on upscaling doesn't just reduce needs for clock speed and processing cores; it also translates lower-resolution textures with more fidelity, so you can arguably hop, skip, and jump past high VRAM requirements.\nCalling BS on another BS Satellaview\nNintendo Switch doesn't have exclusive license on lower amounts of VRAM, lower clock speeds, and rendering scenarios with limited die sizes and thermal envelopes to work with. Where else might those all be useful? Hmm.\nThe Nintendo Switch is a genius platform as a starting point, especially since we've said the same thing time and time again: \"%GAMENAME% is amazing to play in Switch's portable mode, where it gets close to 720p resolution, but blowing the same action up on your 1080p TV looks like trash.\" You, the savvy gamer, shouldn't\u00a0seriously consider using your Switch for TV play, in spite of stats showing tons of people craving a good TV-gaming experience (and an ever-expanding market in which more people than ever are rushing to buy Xboxes, PlayStations, and Switches for their TVs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re 22 years past Nintendo\u2019s last stab at that\u00a0concept.\nA DLSS-equipped \"Switch Pro\" (not a final name), as described by Bloomberg, would reach resolutions of up to 4K when docked and connected to a television. Assuming that DLSS in this scenario requires dedicated tensor cores, we're currently left wondering where Nvidia will slap said cores. Are we looking at a \"split-motherboard\" scenario, as we've seen on both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, where the TV-plugged dock takes on certain heat-generating elements like a block of tensor cores? Or will the Switch Pro's base hardware include tensor cores on its own SoC?\nMy completely speculative guess is the latter for a couple of reasons. First, the rumor of higher CPU clocks and more RAM on the base unit suggests that Nintendo plans to roll out an entirely new system, as opposed to add-on hardware that would boost the base. Nintendo has experience shipping add-on hardware for its home consoles in Japan\u2014like the Famicom Disk System (which added more power and extra sound channels), the BS Satellaview (which added RAM), and the 64DD (which added a co-processor).\nBut we're 22 years past Nintendo's last stab at that concept, and after the mass confusion caused by the Wii U, I don't see modern-day Nintendo wading into the consumer confusion of questions like, \"can I put an older Switch into a Switch Pro dock for more power?\"\n\nPSA on ISA\nSecond, and more importantly, Nvidia has a vested interest in proving that DLSS can ship and function on a portable device. We don't know whether Nintendo will limit DLSS as a \"docked only\" mode on Switch Pro, and Bloomberg's sources point to its portable panel sticking to 720p resolution, albeit at a larger size (7\" compared to 6.2\") and higher build quality (OLED over LCD).\nEven if this is the case, Switch's highest-end games currently struggle to render at a native 720p resolution in portable mode, and they certainly drain its battery life. DLSS has yet to prove as convincing in RTX GPU tests on PC when they upscale from sub-720p resolutions, but Nvidia has been bullish about its upscaling ambitions. That's especially true for Nvidia with the RTX 3090's DLSS mode taking 1440p signals and ramping them all the way up to 8K resolution (as in, a 9x leap).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Switch Pro can stably upscale a 540p signal (a common pixel count for the current system's portable-mode games) to 720p via DLSS, the results may be a win-win: smoother, sharper images\u00a0and a reduced burden for Switch Pro's battery. Toggling those tensor cores for DLSS isn't\u00a0entirely free in terms of power and system bandwidth, but it's definitely cheaper than raw rendering.\nA new Nintendo Switch, on the other hand, is only the beginning of Nvidia's potential ambitions.\nFirst up, you may recall that Nvidia is barreling toward a megaton acquisition of Arm, with those negotiations beginning in September (and since then facing serious scrutiny). Currently, Arm's value comes from its IP, as opposed to owning a chip-production line; chip makers like Qualcomm, Samsung, and Apple take Arm's reference material, which is efficient and powerful enough to be worth their while, and go from there.\nAs my colleague Jim Salter wrote in February:\nOwning Arm outright would allow Nvidia much greater leeway to innovate upon the design. We've spoken to several vendors who described the sort of innovation that the RISC-V architecture allows as effectively impossible with Arm; the vendors have said \"they just won't let you\" make changes, like adjustments to the instruction set.\nIf Nvidia owns Arm, it will no longer face such restrictions. This could make it easier for the GPU manufacturer to innovate on the CPU side and free it from the necessary alliance it has had with Intel in the manufacture of world-leading supercomputers... which likely looks increasingly important, since Intel is encroaching deeper and deeper into Nvidia's territory with its\u00a0Xe GPUs\u00a0and its\u00a0oneAPI\u00a0initiative, which aims to decouple GPU-based machine from the underlying GPU hardware.\nSo far, so good\u2014and in fact, Nvidia describes its acquisition in just such terms, referring to it as \"creating [the] world's premier computing company for the age of AI.\" But it also potentially offers Nvidia leverage over the entire mobile computing industry, which is currently wedded to the Arm instruction set architecture (ISA).\nYou guys all have phones, right?\nNvidia's interest in Arm arguably revolves more around ditching Intel as a necessary partner in certain industries. But taking a mobile-processing lead in smoother, more battery-efficient graphics wouldn't be a bad side dish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControlling Arm would give Nvidia a radical amount of wiggle room to institute paradigm-changing systems for things like graphics rendering in a baseline smartphone spec. And that's interesting when you look at how many people in the world, particularly in emerging markets, favor smartphones and portable devices for 3D-intensive software like video games, as opposed to consoles or home computers. (Currently, many of the world's top gaming moneymakers are all on mobile storefronts.)\nWhat if an Nvidia sticker on a smartphone means longer Fortnite sessions on the\u00a0go?\nMaybe Nvidia simply takes Arm's ISA to its own factories and gets to work mass-producing a line of Nvidia-branded smartphones, all with DLSS built in on the ground floor. Or maybe Nvidia makes DLSS available as an instruction set to Arm's existing partners. Either way, that's a path to ensuring that Nvidia's proprietary DLSS systems land on more smartphones, which could thus guarantee better performance and better battery life. Unreal Engine 4, which runs a ton of high-earning software on mobile storefronts, has recently added baseline support for DLSS; if an Nvidia sticker on a smartphone means longer Fortnite\u00a0sessions on the go before having to recharge batteries, that's no small sales pitch. (And it'd certainly be a jolt to rival engines like Unity, which have yet to adopt DLSS as widely.)\nThat's not Nvidia's only reason to add robust pixel upscaling to mobile hardware. What if someone wants to play higher-end games, maybe designed with ray tracing and other GPU-busting effects, on a game-streaming service like Google Stadia or Microsoft's Project xCloud... but their Internet access is spotty? What if a cloud service could pump out resolutions in the 480p-560p range and get natively upscaled somewhere closer to 1080p?\nAnd doesn't Nvidia have its own burgeoning game-streaming service, GeForce Now, which has aggressively advertised support for\u00a0more regions across the world than its rivals?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2018 gamble, finally bearing mobile fruit\nDLSS was one of Nvidia's big bets after its mid-2010s GPUs began soundly crushing AMD in every metric imaginable. In 2018, I wrote that Nvidia's RTX 2000 series took advantage of this lead by devoting less attention to sheer rasterization jumps. By focusing on entirely new processing cores in its GPUs, Nvidia seemed to declare that AMD wouldn't catch up in other metrics, anyway, so why not do something funky with that lead?\nSure enough, AMD needed two generations to nail its sales pitch of sheer power, and depending on the software in question, AMD's Big Navi products can claim big wins. But that took long enough for developers to see and embrace Nvidia's progress on its proprietary RTX systems, and so far, the refrain in my own coverage has been: when DLSS is in the equation, Nvidia wins each showdown. Last year, AMD announced something called \"FidelityFX Super Resolution,\" but we're still waiting to hear exactly how it works, what hardware it requires, and whether it will scale to, say, portable hardware.\nShould DLSS indeed launch as an upscaling method for Switch Pro, there's zero reason to believe Nvidia will stop there. Its aspirations as a player in the mobile space have been laid bare\u2014and this Switch Pro leak could be a serious headache as Nvidia strives to complete the Arm acquisition, which already faces heavy scrutiny. Should Nvidia seal up that deal, however, prepare for much more mobile DLSS news to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            GeForce Now loses all Activision Blizzard titles weeks after launch\n          \n\nOverwatch, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and more affected.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    \n      Aurich Lawson / Ars Technica\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    89 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

During a recent investor conference call, ASUS confirmed that it received less shipments of Nvidia GPUs in Q1 than it did in the previous quarter.\nAs reported by Tom's Hardware, an ASUS executive confirmed the quarter-over-quarter decrease in supply, stating: \u201cThe most pressing issue for GPUs right now is the shortage of Nvidia's GPUs. There was a quarter-over-quarter decrease in shipments. Because of that shortage, we are seeing price hikes.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysts at Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia shipped just over nine million GPUs for desktop graphics cards in Q4 2020. However, this was not enough to meet the strong demand and as a result, prices are creeping up. Currently, many retailers are still trying to get enough supply to fulfil pre-orders of Nvidia RTX 30 series GPUs.\nOf course, cryptocurrency miners have also had an impact on supply, but ASUS does not know what percentage of its graphics cards went to the mining market versus the gaming market. However, the company does estimate that the yield rate for GPUs produced at Samsung's foundry are lower than expected, which exacerbates the supply situation.\nDespite these supply issues, Nvidia is apparently working on new GPUs, with the latest rumours indicating that we'll see the RTX 3080 Ti next month, followed by an RTX 3070 Ti in May.\nKitGuru Says: Are any of you still waiting to get your hands on a current generation graphics card? Will you upgrade when supply improves, or are you planning on waiting for the next generation of GPUs instead? \nBecome a Patron!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n Google +\n Stumbleupon\n Whatsapp\n Reddit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTags Asus asus ROG geforce news nvidia RTX RTX 30 supply\n \n\nPrevious DeepCool launches MATREXX 40 3FS mATX chassis with enhanced airflow\nNext Fallout 76 gets 2021 roadmap\n\n\n\n\nCheck Also\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAcer launches custom BiFrost and Nitro RX 9070 graphics cards\nAcer has been building up its position in the custom graphics card market for a few years now.

These architectures include three core technologies: software-defined-compute (or server virtualization), software-defined-networking and software-defined storage (SDS). Taken together, these enable a software-defined data center. Also widely adopted: high-performance Ethernet for server-to-server and server-to-storage communication.\nSDS aggregates local, direct-attached storage devices to create and share a single storage pool across all hosts in the hyperconverged cluster, utilizing faster flash storage for cache and inexpensive HDD to maximize capacity.\nvSAN\u00a0is VMware\u2019s enterprise storage solution for SDS that supports hyperconverged infrastructure systems and\u00a0is fully integrated with VMware vSphere as a distributed layer of software within the ESXi hypervisor.\nvSAN\u00a0eliminates the need for external shared storage and simplifies storage configuration through storage policy-based management. Deploying virtual machine storage policies, users can define storage requirements and capabilities.\nVMware vSAN-based HCI solution (Source: VMware)\nRDMA (remote direct memory access) is an innovative technology that boosts data communication performance and efficiency. RDMA makes data transfers more efficient and enables fast data move\u00adment between servers and storage without using the OS or burdening the server\u2019s CPU. Throughput is increased, latency reduced and the CPU is freed to run applications.\nRDMA technology is already widely used for efficient data transfer in render farms and large cloud deployments, such as Microsoft Azure, HPC (including machine/deep learning), NVMe-oF and iSER-based storage, NFSoRDMA, mission-critical SQL databases such as Oracle\u2019s RAC (Exadata), IBM DB2 pureScale, Microsoft SQL solutions and Teradata.\nCommunications over TCP vs. Communications over RDMA/RoCE\nThe chart above illustrates the efficient application-to-application communication that has led IT managers to deploy RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet). RoCE uses advanced Ethernet adapters to deliver efficient RDMA over Ethernet. Since 2015, it has enabled widespread deployments in mainstream data center applications.\nFor the last several years, VMware has been adding RDMA support to ESXi, including PVRDMA (paravirtual RDMA) to accelerate data transfers between virtual servers and iSER and NVMe-oF for remote storage acceleration. VMware\u2019s vSANoRDMA is now fully qualified and available as of the ESXi 7.0 U2 release, making it ready for deployments.\nThe test ran over an eight-node cluster running vSAN in a RAID1 configuration, with a total raw NVMe storage capacity of 76.8TB, NVIDIA ConnectX-5 100GbE SmartNIC and NVIDIA Spectrum SN2700 100GbE switch. Preliminary benchmark results show that vSAN over RDMA delivers up to 70 percent better CPU efficiency(1)\u00a0than vSAN over TCP/IP.\nvSAN over RoCE Efficiency CPU usage vs. vSAN over TCP/IP CPU Usage\nRunning vSAN over RoCE, which offloads the CPU from performing the data communication tasks, generates a significant performance boost that is critical in the new era of accelerated computing associated with a massive amount of data transfers. As a result, I expect that vSAN over RoCE will eventually replace vSAN over TCP and become the leading transport technology in vSphere-enabled data centers.\nTo learn more, check out these NVIDIA RDMA RoCE resources:\n\nHow RDMA Became the Fuel for Fast Networks\nNVIDIA Mellanox Ethernet Connectivity Solutions\nIntroducing VMware vSAN 7.0 U2\n\n(1) Running the FIO benchmark, the efficiency percentage boost has been calculated by dividing the difference between the CPU usage per IOP when running over TCP/IP vs. RoCE and the CPU usage per IOP when running over RoCE. Note that while CPU efficiency improved by up to 70 percent in these tests, that does not mean that IOPS or throughput will increase by a similar percentage.\n\n\nCategories: Networking \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom Leaders Call Up Agentic AI to Improve Network Operations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Graphics card availability is very much like attempting to locate a needle in the world's largest haystack. What made matters worse for NVIDIA fans is the performance boost with the RTX 30 series of GPUs compared to the previous Turing-based RTX 20 series cards.Take the NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti we've (finally) got here for review. Priced at $459 at launch, NVIDIA boasts increased performance to surpass even an RTX 2080 in some cases. That's a huge deal since it's one of the more affordable GPUs in the new RTX 30 series. This also makes it a target for GPU crypto miners who see the value in such a proposition.So, where does the RTX 3060 Ti fit into the PC gaming range? You will be able to crank up the resolution to 4K in some games after turning visual settings down a few notches. It's best suited to 1080p and 1440p screens, however. We'll focus on 1440p in this review since that's primarily what most people will be buying the GPU for. You'll soon see why it made our best graphic card collection.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n    \n\n\n $546.26 at Amazon $1,352.52 at Amazon Check Walmart\nBottom line: This is one impressive GPU from NVIDIA. DLSS and ray tracing support, performance to match an older (yet more expensive) RTX 3080 GPU, and a price tag that'll fit into most budgets. This is the RTX 30 series graphics card to get for 1080p and 1440p gaming.\n\nForImpressive performance \u2014 can match an RTX 2080Insane valueIdeal for 1440p gaming4K at lower settingsHDMI 2.1, PCIe 4.0Runs quietAgainst8GB of VRAMMediocre 4K performanceLimited availability\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Ampere at a glanceSource: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti I'll be testing for this review is the EVGA XC Gaming. It closely ties itself to the founder's edition. Benchmark results will largely be similar to other cards in this class, so I wouldn't worry too much about which model and vendor you choose. At this point in time, it's best you take advantage of any RTX 3060 Ti you can find at a reasonable price.For the specifications, we're looking at just 8GB of VRAM. It's GDDR6, but does fall a little short of the RTX 3080, which comes with 10GB, as well as the whopping 16GB found inside the AMD Radeon RX 6800. Inside the RTX 3060 Ti is 4,864 CUDA (or shader) cores, up from the 2,176 CUDA cores in the RTX 2060 SUPER.Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)The Ampere architecture brought improvements to the streaming multiprocessor (SM) used by NVIDIA, as well as new ray tracing (RT) cores and tweaked Tensor cores. All this results in better overall efficiency and performance. As covered in our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review, the biggest difference with the new RTX 30 series cards is the SM.Essentially, NVIDIA took all the gains made with floating-point (FP32) and integer (INT32) operations for Turing-based RTX 20 series cards and turned them up to 11 for even more performance with RTX 30. Instead of cramming yet more cores onto the card and calling it a day, NVIDIA instead changed how the cores work.All you (and I) need to know is all this magic leads to some significant gains over the last generation of RTX 20 series graphics cards. Recall how I noted NVIDIA touts the RTX 3060 Ti as equal to the older RTX 2080? They aren't joking and it also isn't clever marketing jargon. Ampere is the real deal.As well as better overall gaming performance, ray tracing is also improved in the 3060 Ti thanks to second-generation RT cores.Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategorySpecArchitectureAmpereProcess7nmCUDA Cores4,864RT Cores38Tensor Cores152Core clock1410 MHzBoost clock1710 MHzMemory8GB GDDR6Memory speed448 GB/sMemory interface256-bitBus standardPCIe 4.0TDP200WRecommended PSU600WPower connectors1x 8-pinPorts2x HDMI 2.13x DP 1.4aHDCP 2.3 supportDimensions110 x 201.8 mm(4.33 x 7.94 inches)The EVGA RTX 3060 Ti XC Gaming we have in for review has a core clock speed of 1,410MHz, which can comfortably boost up to and hold at 1,710MHz without any tinkering on our part. Because this is an Ampere GPU, there's also support for PCIe 4.0, which is already with numerous AMD CPUs and chipsets, as well as slowly rolling out on Intel's side.The 200W TDP rating isn't too far from the RTX 2060 SUPER's 175W, considering the significant performance boost. NVIDIA does recommend a 600W power supply, though you can easily power an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti with a 500W PSU if you're only using an AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5 series processor.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Design and featuresSource: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)Like most graphics cards, the EVGA RTX 3060 Ti XC we have here for review rocks a unique design. Most aftermarket options from vendors like EVGA offer their own look with different dimensions, modified clock speeds, and cooling. You will be able to check some of these options with our best NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPUs collection.EVGA's RTX 3060 Ti XC Gaming is a sleeper graphics card with understated looks.EVGA designed this RTX 3060 Ti with a premium look and feel. There are no flashing lights (sorry, RGB fans!), but you do get a solid build with an all-metal backplate. There are also two large fans that provide ample airflow to keep the card running well within a comfortable temperature range under heavy load. It's understated and more of a sleeper GPU.Measuring in at just 110mm (4.33 inches) by 201.8mm (7.94 inches), you can install the EVGA RTX 3060 Ti Gaming in even the smallest of small form factor cases. It's refreshing to see a dual-slot GPU that doesn't completely cover half the motherboard, providing easy access to the PCIe x1 slot just below.Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)On the rear of the GPU, you'll find three DisplayPort 1.4 ports with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You'll want to use DisplayPort to enjoy the full fruits of NVIDIA's G-Sync technology, which will work wonders with DLSS and ray tracing. As well as raw specifications, NVIDIA also bundled a few new features with the RTX 30 series that RTX 3060 Ti owners too will be able to take advantage of.NVIDIA Reflex is a new feature that's debuting on RTX 30 cards, and it's designed to deliver much better latency, particularly in FPS titles. NVIDIA was carried out several optimizations to the render queue and this handy feature will work in conjunction with the aforementioned G-Sync. Then there's RTX IO, which utilizes the Microsoft DirectStorage API to reduce load times by offloading some CPU tasks to the GPU.Finally, there's NVIDIA Broadcast, an evolution of RTX Voice, which offers background noise suppression for video calls. It's truly mind-blowing when you begin to use RTX Broadcast with a loud mechanical keyboard and see how others on your voice call are unable to hear you mashing the keys.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti PerformanceSource: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategorySpecOSWindows 10 HomeProcessorAMD Ryzen 9 5950X16 cores, 32 threadsUp to 5.0GHzGraphicsEVGA XC GamingNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti8GB GDDR6 VRAMMotherboardASUS X570-E GamingRAM2x8GB DDR4-4000MHzDual-channelCL16StorageSabrent Rocket PCie 4.0 1TBSabrent Rocket PCie 4.0 4TBCoolerCustom water-cooling loopPerformance is where things get really exciting for graphics cards like the RTX 3060. These GPUs are what's used by vendors like NVIDIA to push the boundaries for value PC gaming, allowing those building gaming rigs to save money in more important areas. Considering this is a $400 card (at launch), the performance on offer is simply astounding.We put the graphic card to the test on our recently completed Thermaltake Tower 900 build, which includes an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X and 16GB of 4,000MHz DDR4 RAM to allow the EVGA 3060 Ti XC Gaming GPU to run at its best on default settings. Games were loaded from a 4TB Sabrent Rocket PCIe 4.0 SSD running at maximum read speeds.Image 1 of 9As expected, the RTX 3060 sits comfortably behind the RTX 3070 in most tests, clearing the RTX 2070 SUPER in plenty of chosen titles. Interestingly, it can even trade blows with its more expensive sibling. Compared to the previous generation, the RTX 3060 leaves the RTX 2060 SUPER in the dust.If you're looking to upgrade from an older GTX 10 series GPU, you're going to get great value here. NVIDIA does state the 3060 Ti is better than the 2080 SUPER, though I'd say they're about the same with the 2080 SUPER taking the lead in more tests than not.Still, the 3060 Ti is able to pump out 67 frames (on average, with ray tracing disabled) in Metro Exodus, which is incredible considering the 2070 SUPER and 2080 SUPER GPUs come in a little behind. For temperatures, the EVGA RTX 3060 Ti does a good job at keeping the card cool with the two large fans. I didn't see readings past 70C (room and case temperatures were 23C and 34C, respectively).NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti CompetitionSource: Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Windows Central)NVIDIA worked some magic with the RTX 30 series of graphics cards. While AMD is hitting back strong with some excellent GPUs, like the Radeon RX 6800, the RTX 3060 Ti is a fantastic value proposition for PC gamers. The newer, less capable, and more affordable RTX 3060 is coming out isn't going to come close to this value beast.NVIDIA's RTX 3060 Ti is the best value offering for 1440p PC gaming right now.The next step up for NVIDIA and the closest competition to the RTX 3060 Ti is the RTX 3070, but at an additional $100, I would recommend against this decision if you're using a 1080p or 1440p monitor. The RTX 3060 Ti is more than enough for either resolution.On team AMD's front, we've got the Radeon 6700 XT, but we're not entirely sure how it's going to fare against the RTX 3060 Ti. Early leaked benchmarks may suggest AMD's card not having enough power to meet the performance offered by the RTX 3060 Ti, though we'd have to wait until we get our paws on one for testing.Regardless of which GPU you end up choosing as your next purchase, you're going to have a hard time tracking stock.Should you buy the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti?Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Rich Edmonds / Windows Central)Who it's forThose who want a high-end 1440p gaming experienceThose who want to try out ray tracing and DLSSThose who want to spend about $400Those who are looking for a generous upgrade over Turing GPUsWho it isn't forThose who want the best gaming experienceThose who have a 4K monitorThose who want to spend less than about $400Those who want a GPU todayIn short: yes, you should buy the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Will you be able to is the better question here as stock levels continue to be exhausted. NVIDIA made some serious gains with the RTX 30 series of graphics cards and while the RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and RTX 3090 are all incredibly powerful cards, it's the RTX 3060 Ti that really took my attention.For 1440p gaming, EVGA's RTX 3060 Ti XC Gaming was amazing. At such an affordable price, you'll be surprised just how fast this card is. Even in more demanding titles, we found the GPU to easily match the performance of the RTX 2080, even surpassing it in some cases. That's a testament to NVIDIA's work between the 20 and 30 series and the new Ampere architecture.Where the RTX 3060 Ti falls a little short is 4K. It's possible, but you're going to have to turn down numerous settings to achieve a stable frame rate. This GPU is simply not capable of 4K and that's okay. It's priced accordingly and one shouldn't expect such performance levels.If you do have a 4K monitor (or plan to buy one), I'd highly recommend the AMD Radeon RX 6800 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. For 1080p and 1440p screens, the RTX 3060 Ti is a brilliant purchase.\n\n\n\nBest Value GPU\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n    \n\n\n $546.26 at Amazon $1,352.52 at Amazon Check Walmart\nAmazing 1440p performance for the price.

A report earlier this week revealed some key features of the upcoming Switch Pro, which will reportedly support Nvidia's DLSS technology. Now according to another tech leaker, the new Switch GPU will be based on Nvidia's Lovelace architecture.\u00a0\nKopite7kimi, a leaker that has previously correctly predicted NVIDIA Ampere GPU details months ahead of launch, tweeted at Videocardz following reports of the Switch Pro, claiming that the new model will feature Nvidia's Lovelace architecture. The architecture is named after Ada Lovelace, a famed mathematician and computer programmer.\n\nLovelace is rumoured to be a direct successor to Nvidia's Ampere architecture, which powers the current RTX 30 series graphics cards.\nThe current version of the Nintendo Switch is using a Tegra X1 chip, which is based on the Maxwell architecture, so this would be a very significant upgrade. Nvidia may talk up its next-gen Tegra chip fairly soon too, as GTC is just around the corner, taking place on the 12th of April.\nKitGuru Says: We may hear details about Nvidia's new Tegra chip well before Nintendo actually announces a new Switch console. With that in mind, we'll be keeping a keen eye on GTC next month.\u00a0\nBecome a Patron!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n Google +\n Stumbleupon\n Whatsapp\n Reddit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTags gpu leak Lovelace news Nintendo Switch nvidia Switch Pro tegra\n \n\nPrevious You can play Watch Dogs Legion for free this week\nNext Amazon Game Studios hires Rainbow Six Siege devs to work on new multiplayer IP\n\n\n\n\nCheck Also\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTeam Ninja investigates disappearing save files in Rise of the Ronin\nRise of Ronin finally arrived on PC after many months of PS5 exclusivity.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover emerging technologies with a focus on infrastructure and AIFollow AuthorMar 23, 2021, 11:30pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.VMware and NVIDIA have announced an AI-ready enterprise platform based on vSphere and NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPU technology based on A100. This platform enables enterprises to run virtualized AI workloads that take advantage of NVIDIA GPUs\u2019 hardware acceleration.\u00a0\n\n\nA-100 GPUNVIDIA\n\nSince the announcement at VMworld in September 2020, NVIDIA and VMware have collaborated to improve the integration of their offerings. The recent release of vSphere Update 2 release is certified by NVIDIA to run its enterprise suite, NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\u00a0\nForbesVMware's Project Monterey Marks A Major Shift In Modern InfrastructureBy Janakiram MSV\n\nWhat is NVIDIA AI Enterprise?\n\nThe NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite includes the applications, frameworks, and tools used by AI researchers, data scientists, and developers. It is exclusively available on VMware vSphere for running virtualized AI workloads. NVIDIA and VMware claim that the GPUs exposed to vSphere 7 delivers bare-metal like performance to AI applications.\u00a0NVIDIA AI Enterprise SuiteNVIDIA\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise consists of the core building blocks of the GPU software stack. At the bottom of the stack are the NVIDIA GPU and NVIDIA DPU that provide hardware acceleration to workloads. The next layer has the drivers and libraries such as vGPU, CUDA-X and DOCA that expose APIs to workloads. For containerization and support for Kubernetes, NVIDIA is adding the combination of GPU operator and Network operator that brings the hardware acceleration to cloud native workloads. The topmost layer has GPU-optimized frameworks and tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NVIDIA TLT 3.0 and RAPIDS.\nForbesWhat Is A Data Processing Unit (DPU) And Why Is NVIDIA Betting On It?By Janakiram MSV\n\n\nML researchers and developers consuming the frameworks and tools running on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite don\u2019t realize that they are dealing with a virtualized instance of AI accelerator.\u00a0\nPowering the stack is NVIDIA\u2019s flagship A100 GPU based on the Ampere technology. Combined with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capabilities, the NVIDIA vGPU allows deep learning training to scale out to multiple nodes with a near bare-metal performance for even the\u202flargest\u202fdeep learning training workloads. RDMA features available in NVIDIA Bluefield DPU reduces the latency involved in moving data between a local network interface card (NIC) and remote GPU.\u00a0ForbesNVIDIA Announces Ampere - The Most Exciting GPU Architecture For Modern AIBy Janakiram MSV\nWhat\u2019s in it for VMware Customers?\nUnlike CPUs, virtualizing GPUs is a complex problem to solve. Through its partnership with NVIDIA, VMware has brought the most efficient GPU mechanism to its vSphere platform. The initial support came through vGPU, which didn\u2019t allow strict, hardware-level isolation between the VMS sharing the same GPU. With the latest release, vSphere 7 Update 2 supports Multi-Instance GPUs (MIG), which is considered an important milestone in GPU virtualization. A VM consuming a MIG-based GPU gets dedicated hardware resources such as streaming multiprocessors and framebuffer memory with strict isolation.\u00a0Multi-Instance GPUs on vSphereVMware\nAdministrators can allocate fine-grained resources from a MIG-backed vGPU. The NVIDIA A100 GPU can be exploited to run multiple AI workloads in parallel with no compromise in performance. Based on a Quality of Service (QoS) profile, administrators can define thresholds for the vGPU per workload.\u00a0\nNVIDIA A100 has become the gold standard for training AI models in the cloud. Hyperscalers including AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud and Google Cloud offer VMs based on this GPU.\nWith vSphere 7 Update 2 and NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite, the A100 GPU becomes available to VMware customers running AI workloads in the enterprise data center.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Despite initial 30 Series cards releasing as far back as September 2020, no card in the line is in stock as of March 2021. Further, Nvidia 30 Series card shipments continue to sell out near-instantly, only for resale cards to appear on eBay and other grey markets with their prices raised to the extreme. As if the status quo wasn't bad enough, it's being reported that shortages should be expected through 2021. \nA new report from Digitimes claims that 30 Series cards are going to remain in short supply through the third quarter of 2021. A specific reason for continued shortages isn't provided, but there are references made to Nvidia's issues supplying specific components required to produce 30 Series cards. Specifically, that Samsung is struggling to create enough graphics circuits to meet the demands of Nvidia for its 30 Series graphics cards.\nRELATED:\u00a0People Are Making Fake RTX 3080 Listings to Trick Scalpers\nThese shortages have previously been confirmed by Nvidia, but only in an ambiguous way. Nvidia said in January that it expected inventories to \"remain lean\" through the first quarter of 2021. That doesn't mean that it expected improvements going further into the year, of course. And if Digitimes' report is accurate, then the shortages Nvidia mentioned for Q1 will be lasting for at least another two quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, just because Digitimes' report says shortages are expected to last through the third quarter of 2021 doesn't mean that they'll improve afterward. And even if they do improve, it's unlikely to improve fast enough to meet demand through the entire year. Further, there's no guarantee that 30 Series production will improve in 2022, either. Exactly how long-term the shortages\u00a0will remain is completely unknown. Exactly what the problem is and how it gets solved is a mystery many would like to know.\nJust because shortages will likely remain in place through 2021 doesn't mean that new 30 Series cards won't be sold, however. Stock for the Nvidia GeForce 3080 RTX gets resupplied occassionally, as does stock for the 3090, 3070, 3060 Ti, and 3060. It just sells out so quickly that it may seem like no stock is being made available, but there's still a chance.\nWith the delays being what they are, some PC gamers are already questioning whether it would be best to settle for their current configuration until Nvidia's 40 Series cards eventually launch, the hope being that by then, Nvidia will have designed a card and established partnerships that won't face such severe limitations. At this point, anything seems more realistic than waiting for an Nvidia 30 Series graphics card to reliably become available.\nMORE:\u00a010 Games To Play With An Overpowered Gaming PC\nSource: Digitimes (via DSO Gaming) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWin a PlayStation 5 Pro With Game Rant\n\t\t\n\n\nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nBy participating in Game Rant's Threads, you can be in the draw to win a PS5 Pro.

On one hand, it's a bit of bad news, on the other, there's some good.Starting with the bad news, the GeForce Now Founders membership is going away and being replaced with a new Priority premium tier. The difference is mainly the price, it's now twice as expensive. A month will cost $10 and a year's subscription will run you for a cool $100.The good news, at least for some, is that the price increase only applies to new members. Existing Founders tier subscribers are being locked into their current rate as a thank you from NVIDIA for supporting the service in its first year.\"GeForce NOW wouldn't be what it is today without our Founders members. That's why we're adding the Founders for Life benefit, which continues the special $4.99 introductory rate as long the account is in good standing.\"Image 1 of 2Priority members will have access to the same features as Founders, including RTX in supported games as well as extended session length and priority access to servers. The free tier will remain as before, with a 1 hour limit on sessions.The Founders tier was always going to be a time-limited thing, but it's not as if NVIDIA is slowing down and simply trying to rake in some more coin. The latest update to the service is focusing on the streaming tech and making the experience better for its players.\"With the 2.0.28 update, currently rolling out to members and available to all in about a week, streaming quality takes the next step. One of the ways we do this is with a unique adaptive Vsync technology. The feature synchronizes frame rates at 60 or 59.94 Hz server-side to match the display client-side, reducing stutter and latency on supported games. A new adaptive de-jitter technology will enable us to increase bit rates for improved quality over choppy networks, too.NVIDIA is also adding capacity to its busiest data centers as well as opening new ones. First up will be Phoenix, followed by the first Canadian center in Montreal. Also on the slate for the coming months is account linking for key games to speed up the process of actually getting into a game, as well as changes to make general loading times faster.There are, of course, new games being added this week, too.

But does Nvidia produce a driver for Linux? \nThankfully, yes it does. But how do you install the latest drivers on Ubuntu? Whether you prefer to use the desktop environment or command line, installing and updating the Nvidia graphics driver on Ubuntu is straightforward. \n                        Check You're Using an Nvidia GPU\n               \nYou can install graphics card drivers in the terminal or using the desktop environment (or GUI, for graphical user interface). However, to check the specifics of your current graphics card, it's best to use the terminal.\nOpen the terminal from the menu or use Ctrl + Alt + T. \n        sudo apt install hwinfo\n    \nOnce installed, use hwinfo to check your graphics card using the --gfxcard option. \n        sudo hwinfo --gfxcard --short\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have identified an Nvidia GPU, use the lshw (list hardware) command to reveal further details of the card. \n        sudo lshw -c display | grep NVIDIA\n    \nAlternatively, for more specific details use lspci (list PCI) and grep \n        sudo lspci | grep -i --color 'vga\\|3d\\|2d'\n    \nFor the full set of relevant details concerning your Ubuntu system's Nvidia card use \n        sudo inxi -Gx\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this information to hand, you have everything you need to install the correct Nvidia driver in Ubuntu.\nRelated: AMD vs. NVIDIA GPUs on Linux: Which Should You Use? \n                        Update Your System\n               \nBefore proceeding, however, you should update your Ubuntu system. The steps in this guide are intended for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa). At the time of writing this is the current LTS release, so ensure you're using this version or later.\nNote that with Ubuntu 19.10 and later, Nvidia's proprietary drivers are included in the installation media. As such, you may already have the Nvidia drivers installed. Otherwise, upgrade to the latest Ubuntu version.\nUpdate and upgrade Ubuntu with \n        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n    \nAlternatively, open the Software Update Manager and wait for it to check for updates. Install any system updates it highlights.\nRelated: How to Update Ubuntu in the Command Line \n                        Install Nvidia Drivers on Ubuntu on the Desktop GUI\n               \nUsing the Ubuntu Software Updater, you can find and install the right driver for your Nvidia graphics card. \n\n                                        Open the Ubuntu app menu and scroll to Software Updater\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Alternatively, open the menu and type \"software updater\" to search for the tool\n                        \n\n                                        Select Software Updater to open, then wait while it checks for updates\n                        \n\n                                        Once done (you should have updated before starting) click Settings & Livepatch\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click the Additional Drivers tab\n                        \n\n                                        Select an Nvidia driver metapackage that is appended with (proprietary, tested)\u00a0\n                                            \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by author\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        Click Apply Changes and wait while the new driver is installed\n                        \n\nThe X.Org X server is typically the default option. It is also open source, so you may prefer this from a philosophical point of view. However, if you want the best gaming performance, the Nvidia driver is required.\nYou should notice a list of drivers, like the one illustrated above. You can use any of these, but it is safer to start with a version that has been tested. After restarting Ubuntu, the Nvidia driver will be in use. \n                        How to Install Nvidia Drivers on Ubuntu in the Terminal\n               \nIf you prefer to install an Nvidia graphics driver on Ubuntu from the command line, open the terminal and enter \n        sudo ubuntu-drivers devices\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will list all the currently available drivers for your graphics card. You'll notice the preinstalled option is listed as \"distro free builtin.\"\nTo choose the driver listed as \"recommended\", use \n        sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n    \nYou can also install a specific, named driver with \n        sudo apt install nvidia-driver-[version_number]\n    \nFor instance, to install nvidia-driver-450, use \n        sudo apt install nvidia-driver-450\n    \nConfirm the command and follow and further instructions displayed in the terminal. When you're done, restart Ubuntu. \n        sudo reboot\n    \nIn some cases, you may need to ensure that the Nvidia graphics card is active. This could be preferable to leaving it to the OS to decide to use the Intel graphics. To check which video card is selected, use \n        prime-select query\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select the Intel card, use \n        sudo prime-select intel\n    \nForce the Nvidia card with \n        sudo prime-select nvidia\n    \nYou may need to reboot for the alternate graphics card choice to take effect. Note that on laptops, the Nvidia card will be more demanding on your device battery than the Intel option. \n                        Configure and Manage the Nvidia Drivers on Ubuntu\n               \nTo quickly find out which GPU is active, what driver is installed, and what resources are in use, enter \n        nvidia-smi\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should give you all the information that you need and is a useful reference for configuring graphics in-game. For more granular management, open the settings screen with \n        sudo nvidia-settings\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis screen provides far more data than the nvidia-smi tool. Here, you'll find X server and OpenGL settings; of particular interest will be the Thermal Settings screen for checking the GPU temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also select enhanced performance modes in the PowerMizer screen, create and manage Application Profiles, and switch PRIME Profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last option is like the prime-select command, but gives you three options: \n\n                                        NVIDIA (Performance Mode)\n                        \n\n                                        NVIDIA On-Demand\n                        \n\n                                        Intel (Power Saving Mode)\n                        \n\nFor the best graphics performance, you'll naturally select the Performance Mode. \n                        How to Update Nvidia Graphics Card Drivers in Ubuntu\n               \nUpdating your Nvidia graphics card driver should happen whenever an update is available. Since Ubuntu 19.10, Nvidia drivers are included in the LTS repository.\nUpdating the drivers, therefore, is as easy as updating any other software in Ubuntu. Either run and update and upgrade in the terminal, or use the Software Updater on the desktop. \n                        Uninstalling Nvidia Drivers in Ubuntu\n               \nYou may prefer to remove the Nvidia drivers. This might happen if the driver is not performing to your expectations. Alternatively, you might have decided to abandon Nvidia and use an AMD card. \n            Uninstall Nvidia GPU Drivers on the Desktop\n    \nOnce again open the Software Updater. From here: \n\n                                        Wait for the update check to complete\n                        \n\n                                        Click Settings & Livepatch\n\n\n                                        Click Additional drivers\n\n\n                                        Select the Nouveau display driver option\n                        \n\n                                        Click Apply Changes\n\n\nA short wait is required; once the change has been made you should see a message informing you that \"No proprietary drivers are in use.\" \n            Uninstall Nvidia Drivers in the Terminal\n    \nTo uninstall the Nvidia graphic driver in the terminal: \n        sudo apt purge nvidia-*sudo apt autoremove\n    \nReboot your system before proceeding. By default, the system will switch to the Nouveau open source driver. \n                        Gaming on Linux: Use the Best Drivers For Your Distro\n               \nWith the Nvidia drivers installed on your Ubuntu system, you should be able to squeeze better graphics performance from your GPU. This is a massive advantage for Linux gaming, but Ubuntu might not be the best distro for gaming. If you're keen to make the most of gaming on Linux, be sure to use the best Linux gaming distro. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu\n\n\n\n\nGraphics Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support MakeUseOf.

The lengthy speculation may soon be over, as the mystery surrounding this GPU's release date, specification and even general existence is starting to lift.This latest information was provided by established leaker Uniko's Hardware, who claims the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti will feature Micron GDDR6X memory clocked at 19 Gbps, and offered in not just the 16GB we initially thought, but also 8GB.Here are the best gaming PCsCheck out the best gaming laptopsWe'll show you the best processorsRTX3070TiGA104-400-A18GB & 16GBMT61K256M32JE-19G pic.twitter.com/ySekgt7zzKMarch 26, 2021The 16GB of GDDR6 isn't new information as this has been circulating for a while, but the inclusion of an additional 8GB card certainly is. We have yet to see any dual-sided memory SKUs that would give any weight to these claims however, so as with all unofficial leaks, take it with a healthy pinch of salt.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5060 Ti GPU with 16GB rumored for March launch, followed by 8GB flavor in April \u2013 but where does that leave the vanilla RTX 5060?\n\n\n\n\nAre Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5060 GPUs about to arrive? Rumor hints they might be - with the RTX 5060 Ti potentially coming with 16GB VRAM\n\n\n\nDo we need an RTX 3070 Ti?If the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti does launch with a 16GB pool of GDDR6 memory, then it'll have more VRAM than all the other Ampere GPUs, save for the\u00a0RTX 3090 and potentially the unreleased RTX 3080 Ti.\n\nIt's unclear why Nvidia would opt to supply an 8GB variant of the card at all, but there is a possibility that the RTX 3070 Ti is intended as more of a general replacement for the original RTX 3070 given the small leap in overall power.\n\nWhen word of the RTX 3070 Ti first appeared, we initially assumed this was a planned rival to the AMD Radeon RX 6800, especially as it was initially rumored to have 10GB of VRAM with a 320W TGP (total graphics power), though this is likely no longer the case given recent information.The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is currently expected to arrive in May alongside the RTX 3080 Ti, though we don't have any pricing information for the cards. This is yet another GPU that will hit the shelves during the current global shortage, so the chances of actually getting your hands on one will be extremely slim.

It was a nice improvement over the RTX 2060, bringing in more memory \u2014 8GB vs. the 6GB on the RTX 2060 \u2014 as well as a wider memory bus. It's a solid 1080p GPU, and also does better at 1440p than the RTX 2060.\n\nForStill good enough for 1080p gamingHigher memory bandwidthAgainstSlightly higher power consumptionLimited availability\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n $386.43 at Amazon $499.99 at Newegg $699 at Walmart\nCheapest RTX 30 pick The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is currently the cheapest RTX 30 graphics card you can buy right now and a decent entry into ray tracing. It performs well at 1080p and can do some 1440p gaming. It outperforms the RTX 2060 SUPER, but the performance gap is quite thin. The RTX 3060 also doesn't offer a great price-to-performance ratio like its elder siblings and has a very limited availability right now.\n\nForGood 1080p performance12 GB GDDR6 memoryHDMI 2.1AgainstNot the best value for moneyLimited stock\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the new RTX kid on the block. It's an entry-level peek into the world of ray tracing and currently the most affordable of the RTX 30 GPUs. While it offers some performance boost over the RTX 2060 SUPER, it's definitely not worthy of being an upgrade. The availability and pricing issues combined with the thin performance gap mean that you should just stick to your RTX 2060 SUPER. Let's take a deeper look at why.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 SUPER: SpecsSource: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)Being from a newer generation, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 does have some improvements in comparison to the RTX 2060 SUPER. The RTX 2060 SUPER uses the same TU106 GPU as we saw in the RTX 2060, which was made with the 12nm TSMC process. In contrast, the RTX 3060 houses the Ampere GA106 GPU, which is made using Samsung's 8nm process. This gives it an edge with transistor count, with 13.25 billion transistors, against the RTX 2060 SUPER's 10.8 billion transistors. Let's look at the specifications of the two cards.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPERShader (CUDA) Cores35842176Core Clock1320MHz1470MHzBoost Clock1780MHz1650MHzMemory12GB GDDR6192-bit bus width8 GB GDDR6256-bit bus widthMemory Clock15Gbps14GbpsMemory Bandwidth360GB/s448GB/sRT Cores2834Tensor Cores112272Transistors13.25 billion10.8 billionNodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 12nm FFNArchitectureAmpereTuringTDP170W175 WPorts1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4a1 x HDMI 2.0b2 x DisplayPort 1.41 x DVI1 x USB CPower Connector1 x 8 pin1 x 8 pinNote: Some specifications of the RTX 3060 and the RTX 2060 SUPER, like the ports, may vary as per AIB models.Despite the transistor count difference, the RTX 2060 SUPER has a few advantages. First off, the RT core count on the RTX 2060 SUPER is higher than that on the RTX 3060. Additionally, the total memory bandwidth on the RTX 2060 SUPER is also higher. This means the RTX 3060 is not as more powerful than the RTX 2060 SUPER as it could have been. Let's look at the performance of the two cards.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 SUPER: Real-world performanceSource: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)The real-world performance comparisons of the two cards will vary depending on how the AIB variants are configured. The RTX 2060 SUPER is a beefed-up version of 2060, to begin with, but the overclock variants of the card will be able to shrink the performance gap even more, especially in comparison to the normal RTX 3060. Let's take a look at the performance comparison between the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 12GB XC and GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER 8GB, courtesy of the YouTube channel Benchmark.Swipe to scroll horizontallyGameRTX 3060 (avg.

The RTX 3060 is a decent purchase on its own, and it does manage to output some decent figures at 1440p, close to the 60 FPS mark. While it doesn't quite hit the 1440p 144 FPS figure, it's still a decent performer for the price, given you can find a decently-priced AIB card.However, the RTX 2060 SUPER isn't too far behind. While the benchmark shows 1440p Ultra figures, the 1080p performance will show margins that are very similar. The RTX 3060 is only a small step up from the RTX 2060 SUPER, and it gives a single-digit FPS gain. There's very little intensive to sell your RTX 2060 SUPER and pick up an RTX 3060.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 2060 SUPER is still a solid 1080p GPU, and as far as ray tracing performance goes, it will take you nearly as far as the RTX 3060 does. The card isn't due for an upgrade yet, and an upgrade to the new base 60 series card is probably the smallest GPU upgrade you can get right now.So should you upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 from RTX 2060 SUPER?No. The RTX 3060 is a decent entry-level RTX card, no doubt, but it's the farthest thing from being a logical upgrade from the RTX 2060 SUPER. The RTX 3060 is also plagued by the same stock and pricing issues as any new piece of silicon right now, which means you'll have a tough time getting your hands on one anyway.Even if you manage to find one in stock, the AIB model prices are expected to cost you way too much to justify such a small upgrade. The logical upgrade would be something like the RTX 3070, which is a great 1440p card that hits higher frame rates at that resolution, as we noted in our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review.The RTX 2060 series cards are also in heavy demand right now, like all the best graphics cards. The card is a sweet spot for RTX GPUs, so much so that NVIDIA itself is bringing them back to fill out the gaps in its RTX lineup that have been widened due to the GPU shortage. If you're still pressed for an upgrade from the RTX 2060 SUPER, and can grab an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPU at a reasonable price, you can look at the higher tier cards in the RTX 30 series. If you're not planning a major upgrade, however, then it makes sense to keep that RTX 2060 SUPER, which is a solid graphics card to own right now.\n\n\n\nLast-gen 60 series elite\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\n\n\n Check Amazon Check Walmart See at Amazon\nSolid last-gen performerThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER is the last-gen entry-level RTX card, and while it's no miracle-worker, it holds up well. It does an okay job at 1080p, and gives a peek into the ray tracing goodness. As such, it's not due for such a small upgrade as the RTX 3060, and worth owning right now, barring a big planned system upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost affordable RTX 30\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n $386.43 at Amazon $499.99 at Newegg $699 at Walmart\nSneak peek into ray tracingThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the most affordable new RTX GPU on the market as of now.

On the next-to-last day of the month, Team Green delivered. The newly available Game Ready driver version 465.89 unlocks Resizable BAR on every RTX 30-series desktop graphics cards.\nIt\u2019s not quite that easy though. While the new drivers activate Resizable BAR, you\u2019ll also need to wait for a new VBIOS from your graphics card\u2019s specific manufacturer to add support for your particular model. Nvidia is releasing a VBIOS with Resizable BAR for its own Founders Edition graphics cards, for example, while EVGA owners will need to grab one of its fresh VBIOS upgrades.\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n Nvidia\nYou\u2019ll also need a compatible CPU and motherboard, both of which will likely need BIOS upgrades of their own unless you\u2019ve lucked into a new Ryzen 5000-series or Intel 11th-gen Core processor. This Nvidia explainer covers the convoluted process.\nGoing to all the trouble seems like it\u2019ll be worthwhile\u2026eventually. AMD introduced Resizable BAR support (under its own Smart Access Memory branding) when it launched its Ryzen 5000 CPUs and Radeon 6000 GPUs last fall and allows the feature to work with any game. Resizable BAR lets your CPU access your GPU\u2019s entire memory buffer rather than limiting it to 256MB chunks. Flipping it on can lead to significant performance increases in some games, as our Smart Access Memory testing on the Radeon RX 6900 XT and 6700 XT shows, though many titles show more modest increases in the five-percent range. Actual results vary wildly depending on the game, GPU, resolution, and even the visual settings being tested\n\n\n\n Nvidia\n\nNvidia-supported games for Resizable BAR as of March 30, 2021.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s initial Resizable BAR support is limited to just 17 titles, on the other hand, and this first batch looks largely limited to games that reviewers test more than games that are wildly popular. Their performance should be easy to measure at least, because most offer a built-in benchmark. \u201cAs we identify additional titles that benefit from Resizable BAR, we\u2019ll introduce support via Game Ready Driver updates,\u201d the company says.\nNvidia strongly stresses that you should download and install Game Ready driver version 465.89 before you begin the process of unlocking Resizable BAR on your graphics card.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While many are quick to blame the crypto mining craze, GPU maker Asus suggests the problem is something else entirely: insufficient upstream yields. \nThe company floated this theory during a recent investor conference call, in which Asus discussed its successes and failures during Q4 2020. The biggest problem facing Asus \u2013 and undoubtedly other GPU companies \u2013 is a significant shortage of Nvidia cards.\n\"Our guess is that the gap might have been caused by lower yields upstream,\" Asus says in the call. \"As for when [Nvidia] can increase that yield is something hard for us to predict.\"\n\"Our guess is that the gap might have been caused by lower yields upstream,\" Asus says...\nThere are several potential reasons Nvidia may be producing fewer cards than anticipated. Perhaps the company is intentionally limiting production to wait out cryptominers, or maybe it's just accounting for lower post-holiday demand (one of the more popular theories out there).\nOr perhaps, as Asus hints above, the slow-down is tied to Nvidia's (relatively) recent switch to Samsung's 8nm manufacturing node for some of its Ampere GPUs. \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n Asus raises RTX 5090 and RX 9070 prices, making graphics cards even more expensive \n\n\n\n Asus introduces monitors with built-in air purifiers, because why not? \n\n\n\nThe purpose of that move was to reduce the burden on TSMC, which was already effectively at capacity, but if it is now resulting in lower yields \u2013 as in, fewer usable cards per wafer produced \u2013 Nvidia might be regretting its choice now.\n\n\n\n\n 24 comments\n \n231 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 GPUs \"unprecedented\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 specs and official performance benchmarks leaked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad Comments 24\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n User Comments: 24\n\n\n\n Got something to say?

The RTX 3080 sets a new standard for 4K gaming, and at $699 the GPU is an excellent value.But if you're looking for a more affordable option, the $499 RTX 3070 may just be the ideal GPU for you. What's particularly interesting about this card is that NVIDIA is touting performance on par with the RTX 2080 Ti, which debuted just two years ago for $999 \u2014 double the asking price of the RTX 3070.The RTX 3070 has the potential to be the best GPU in the RTX 30 lineup for its price-to-performance figures. After all, the RTX 2070 series sold incredibly well over the last two years, and the hardware gains with the RTX 3070 make it the ideal upgrade for gamers looking to pick up a new GPU in 2020.The RTX 3070 isn't just positioned as a card for 1400p gaming; the performance on offer makes it a great option for 4K gaming at high settings as well. Let's find out if the RTX 3070 delivers on these promises, and whether it is the upgrade you've been waiting for.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n    \n\n\n $889 at Amazon Check Walmart\nBottom line: The GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition delivers truly outstanding performance, with the card outmatching the RTX 2080 Ti for less than half the price. The RTX 3070 is ideal for both 1440p and 4K gaming, and the value you're getting here is unbeatable. Availability continues to be a big hurdle, but aside from that, the RTX 3070 is the obvious upgrade for most gamers.\n\nForOutstanding performance \u2014 on par with RTX 2080 TiInsane valueIdeal for 1440p gamingRuns 4K games at high settingsHDMI 2.1, AV1 decode, PCIe 4.0Runs quietAgainstAvailability issues8GB of video memory\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 SpecsSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)The RTX 3090 and 3080 are based on the GA102 silicon, but the RTX 3070 features a GA104 chipset that offers 17.4 billion transistors, nearly double that of the RTX 2070. Like its costlier siblings, the RTX 3070 is fabricated on a Samsung 8nm node, leading to significant gains in energy efficiency.The RTX 3070 has HDMI 2.1 and PCIe 4.0 connectivity, and is built on an 8nm node.As for the hardware on offer, the RTX 3070 Founders Edition features 5,888 CUDA cores along with 46 RT cores and 184 texture units, with a base clock of 1.5GHz and a boost of 1.7GHz. The RTX 3070 offers the same GDDR6 memory as its predecessor, while the RTX 3080 and 3090 feature the newer GDDR6X standard that NVIDIA co-created with Micron.GDDR6X offers higher frequencies, allowing the RTX 3080 and 3090 to deliver much more bandwidth than RTX 20 series cards. With the RTX 3070 relying on GDDR6, it misses out on these gains. The card has 8GB of 14Gbps GDDR6 memory over a 256-bit interface, translating to an effective bandwidth of 448GB/s. For context, the GDDR6X memory on the RTX 3080 goes up to 19Gbps, leading to a bandwidth of 760GB/s.It is understandable for NVIDIA to retain the GDDR6 standard for the RTX 3070 in lieu of GDDR6X or HBM2 memory, and while the effective bandwidth is on par with the previous generation, the RTX 3070 delivers huge upgrades in other areas.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Shader Cores5888Core Clock1500MHzBoost Clock1725MHzGPUGA104Memory8GB GDDR6X256-bit bus widthMemory Clock14GbpsMemory Bandwidth448GB/sRT Cores46Tensor Cores184Transistors17.4 billionNodeSamsung 8nmArchitectureAmpereTDP220WPorts1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4aPower Connector1 x 12-pin1 x PCIe 8-pin converter includedThe RTX 3070 offers the same HDMI 2.1 connectivity as the 3080 and 3090, and the card relies on PCIe 4.0 as well. You get three DisplayPort 1.4a ports, hardware-level decode for the new AV1 codec, and the new 12-pin power connector. The RTX 3070 has a TDP of 220W, or 45W more than the RTX 2070, and as a result NVIDIA is turning to the 12-pin power connector as standard.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ampere architectureSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)Thanks to the Ampere architecture, NVIDIA is touting significant gains over Turing-based RTX 20 cards. NVIDIA made a lot of changes to achieve these gains, including overhauling the streaming multiprocessor (SM) and updating the RT cores and tweaking the Tensor cores.The Ampere streaming multiprocessor is the key behind the performance gains with RTX 3070.But the biggest difference is down to the streaming multiprocessor. The GA104 silicon that powers the RTX 3070 has 46 streaming multiprocessors, which hold 128 CUDA cores each \u2014 that's how we get to the 5,888 cumulative CUDA cores for the card.NVIDIA introduced a lot of changes to the Ampere SM to eke out the gains. Without going into too much detail, what you need to know is that rasterization \u2014 the technique that GPUs leverage to render two-dimensional objects on your screen \u2014 is based on two factors, floating point (FP32) and integer (INT32) operations.NVIDIA GPUs traditionally focused on either floating point or integer tasks, but with Turing, NVIDIA enabled both tasks to be performed at the same time. The Turing SM had 64 CUDA cores for FP32 tasks and 64 INT32 cores for crunching integers, and this led to decent gains over Pascal.Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)With Ampere, NVIDIA is changing how these cores work. An Ampere SM has 128 CUDA cores divided into two clusters: the first 64-core cluster is solely for FP32 tasks (similar to Turing), but the second 64-core cluster can be used for either FP32 or INT32 tasks. That means that if the second cluster finishes its integer tasks, it can switch over to FP32 operations. This is at the heart of what gives the RTX 3070 a sizeable advantage over the RTX 2070, 2080, and even the 2080 Ti.Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)The RTX 3070 also includes sizeable gains in ray tracing, with NVIDIA making a few key changes here as well. The dedicated RT cores handle bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) and triangle intersection tests for real-time lighting and occlusion effects.The second-gen cores are more efficient, and triangle intersection tests are now handled by a dedicated unit. These cores also include a new feature that allows for motion blur at a hardware level. With ray tracing now a mainstay on the Xbox Series X, Series S, and the PlayStation 5, NVIDIA is looking to cement its lead with the second-gen RT cores.Source: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)NVIDIA is similarly delivering exciting gains for the third-gen Tensor gains, and while there are less cores than the RTX 20 series, the efficiency of the cores has more than doubled.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Design and featuresSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)NVIDIA hasn't just limited the changes to the architecture; it has also overhauled the design of its Founders Edition cards. The RTX 3080 introduced an innovative push-pull cooling system, and while the RTX 3070 has a traditional layout, it still manages to stand out.If you care about aesthetics, the RTX 3070 Founders Edition is the card to get.The RTX 3070 is a dual-slot card, with the dual fans sucking in air from the bottom of the case. The card is much more compact than the RTX 3080, but it retains the same design language: the color scheme is predominantly black, with a matte grey finish for the outer layer.The metal backplate takes up most of the back of the card, but there is a cutout on the right for the cooling system, allowing the secondary fan to vent air through the fins. You'll find the GeForce RTX logo on the right, and unlike the RTX 3080, the logo does not illuminate.NVIDIA says the new design is optimized to deliver better cooling, and that is indeed the case in real-world use. The fans on the RTX 3070 don't kick in when the GPU is under minimal load, and even when they're running they are quieter than the RTX 20 series fans.A big change with all the RTX 30 series cards is the 12-pin power connector, and NVIDIA includes an adapter to connect an existing 8-pin connector to the new system. Unlike the 320W requirement of the RTX 3080, the RTX 3070 needs up to 220W, so the adapter hooks up to a single 8-pin power cable. While the RTX 3070 introduces a lot of exciting features, it is missing a few ports: NVIDIA got rid of the USB-C port, and the NVLink connector for SLI is limited to the RTX 3090.Image 1 of 9The RTX 3070 isn't short on innovative tech. NVIDIA's Reflex is a new feature that's debuting on RTX 30 cards, and it is designed to deliver much better latency, particularly in FPS titles. NVIDIA was able to make several optimizations to the render queue to reduce system latency, and the Reflex tech works in conjunction with G-Sync to deliver refresh rates in excess of 360Hz and more.Another exciting addition is RTX IO, which sees NVIDIA leveraging Microsoft's DirectStorage API to reduce load times. It does so by offloading CPU tasks to the GPU, and with the new consoles touting significantly less load times for next-gen games, you can look forward to the same gains with the RTX 30 series.Then there's NVIDIA Broadcast, my favorite new feature. Broadcast is the evolution of RTX Voice, and it offers background noise suppression for video calls. The feature works incredibly well, and it does a great job tuning out any background noise. I use a keyboard with MX Brown switches, and Broadcast essentially tunes out the keyboard noise when I'm talking in a video call. It is one of those features that you have to use to truly understand how great it is, and with Broadcast NVIDIA is also adding video-based effects.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 PerformanceSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)The RTX 3070 forms the ideal middle ground in NVIDIA's launch series, and the card is the one that most gamers currently using the GTX 10 series or older will turn to when considering an upgrade.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryHardwareCPUIntel Core i9-10900KGPUNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070CoolingCorsair iCUE H115i RGB Pro XTMotherboardGigabyte Aorus Z490 MasterMemory32GB Corsair Vengeance ProStorage1TB Samsung 970 Evo PlusPSUCorsair RM850xThe RTX 3070 has three DisplayPort 1.4a ports that go up to 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 60Hz by leveraging Display Stream Compression (DSC) 1.2a. The big deal here is that the card also offers HDMI 2.1, bringing it on par with the likes of the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.HDMI 2.1 facilitates 4K at up to 240Hz and 8K at 120Hz, and while there aren't many monitors that offer the standard yet, it should go mainstream soon enough.The RTX 3070 is ideally suited for 1440p gaming, but that doesn't mean the card cannot handle 4K games. In my testing, I found that the card easily outmatched the RTX 2080 Founders Edition, and held its own against the 2080 Ti. NVIDIA isn't making idle claims here, and the RTX 3070 is every bit as outstanding as it is made out to be, and that's good news if you're in the market for a new card.Another area where NVIDIA is touting significant gains is Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). The tech essentially upscales games, but does so while retaining the visual quality. The end result is that you get much better frame rates while maintaining the same visual fidelity. Most AAA games now include DLSS, and the tech makes a drastic difference, particularly in the context of 4K gaming with the RTX 3070. So let's take a look at how the RTX 3070 holds up against the RTX 3080 at 1440p and 4K games.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 1440p gamingSwipe to scroll horizontallyGameRTX 3080 (avg. fps)RTX 3070 (avg. fps)RTX 2080 (avg. fps)Microsoft Flight Simulator484742Control987761Death Stranding164135102Far Cry New Dawn144136118Gears 512510278Metro Exodus174136105Red Dead Redemption 212910282Shadow of the Tomb Raider13010784Total War Saga: Troy1058267The RTX 3070 delivers a massive performance uptick over the RTX 2080 at 1440p, with the card holding its own against the RTX 3080 in a few games. I played all titles with the settings at Ultra or Very High, and the RTX 3070 shows just big a difference there is from the RTX 2080.The RTX 3070 is around 20 to 25% faster than the RTX 2080, and those figures put the card on an equal footing with the RTX 2080 Ti. The RTX 3080 delivers better performance as it has more shader codes, but for most users the RTX 3070 is more than adequate, particularly considering more than 90% of gamers still play on 1080p or 1440p.With high refresh rate monitors becoming that much more affordable, the RTX 3070 is the ideal upgrade if you want to unlock higher frame rates when playing games at 1080p or 1440p.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070: 4K gamingSwipe to scroll horizontallyGameRTX 3080 (avg. fps)RTX 3070 (avg. fps)RTX 2080 (avg. fps)Microsoft Flight Simulator423228Control523928Death Stranding1017458Far Cry New Dawn1028165Gears 5785946Metro Exodus987456Red Dead Redemption 2826348Shadow of the Tomb Raider755844Total War Saga: Troy614536Barring the outlier that is Microsoft Flight Simulator, the RTX 3070 holds up particularly well for 4K gaming as well. The RTX 3080 is faster by an average of 20% here, but you can get nearly 60fps in most titles with the RTX 3070. With the settings turned down to High, the card hits 60fps in titles like Control.What's noteworthy is just how big a lead the RTX 3070 carves out over the RTX 2080. There's a 25% difference on average between the two cards, and the card holds up to the 2080 Ti even at 4K. If you're coming from the GTX 1070 or the RTX 2070, you will easily see a performance uptick of 50 to 60% at 1440p and 4K with the RTX 3070.That's what makes the RTX 3070 such an exciting option in 2020. The card delivers outstanding performance at both 1440p and 4K resolutions, and the affordability makes it an easier upgrade choice than the RTX 3080. The level of performance that you're getting here is truly incredible, and when you consider the fact that the RTX 3070 costs just $499, it is the bargain of the year.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 The competitionSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)The RTX 30 series is in a league of its own right now, and the only cards that outmatch the RTX 3070 are the RTX 3080 and 3090. The RTX 3080 is the obvious alternative, offering better performance at 4K. The downside is that the RTX 3080 is power hungry, and at $699 it is $200 more than the 3070.AMD's RDNA 2-based Radeon RX 6000 series. The RX 6800 in particular goes up against the RTX 3070, offering 60 compute units, 16GB of GDDR6 over a 256-bit width and 16Gbps clock for a total bandwidth of 512GB/s, and 250W power requirement.The card also has HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, AV1 decode, and is set to go on sale shortly for $579. While it is costlier than the RTX 3070, you are getting double the amount of video memory. NVIDIA's inventory woes could mean AMD can take a lead here if it has better inventory of the RX 6000 series at launch.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Should you buy?Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)You should buy this if ...You want the best valueThe RTX 3070 is the runaway leader when it comes to value, with the card offering massive gains at both 1440p and 4K from the RTX 2070 and 2080. If you're interested in getting the most amount of performance for your money, this is the card to get.You want a GPU that can play 4K gamesThe hardware you're getting with the RTX 3070 makes it ideally suited for next-gen gaming, and the card should hold up for several years without any issues whatsoever. The card does incredibly well at 4K gaming as well, and with DLSS gaining momentum, it should be able to deliver 60fps in upcoming titles.You're looking to upgrade from the GTX 10 or RTX 20 seriesThe RTX 3070 delivers a 2x increase in performance from the RTX 2070 at 1440p and 4K resolutions. If you're on an RTX 2070, 2080, or an older GTX 10 series card, the RTX 3070 is the ideal upgrade path.You should not buy this if ...You want a card right nowThe RTX 30 series is hobbled by severe availability issues, with the RTX 3070 sold out at most retailers. That situation isn't likely to change for another month or so, so if you don't like waiting, you'll have to look elsewhere.The RTX 3080 and 3090 get all the attention because of the hardware on offer, but the RTX 3070 is the card that stands out in the RTX 30 series. The card delivers exciting performance gains across the board from the RTX 20 series, and in terms of price-to-performance figures, the RTX 3070 is unchallenged.Overall, the RTX 3070 is the ideal upgrade option if you're using an older GTX 10 series card, or even the RTX 2070 and 2080. The level of performance you're getting here is truly incredible, and the card delivers over 100fps at 1440p and up to 60fps at 4K without breaking a sweat.The Founders Edition in particular looks stunning, and right now, the only downside with the RTX 3070 is availability. We're constantly updating where you can buy the RTX 3070 and other RTX 30 series cards, but the fact of the matter is that availability will be limited for most of 2020. If you don't mind the added wait, the RTX 3070 Founders Edition is the card to get.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n    \n\n\n $889 at Amazon Check Walmart\nBottom line: The RTX 3070 is the new value leader, with the card delivering outstanding performance gains from the RTX 2070 and 2080. You're getting the same level of performance as the RTX 2080 Ti at less than half the price, and that makes the RTX 3070 the default option if you're looking to upgrade in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nHarish JonnalagaddaSocial Links NavigationSenior Editor - AsiaHarish Jonnalagadda is a Senior Editor overseeing Asia for Android Central, Windows Central's sister site.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorMar 18, 2021, 12:39pm EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.NVIDIA has been the most consistent and persistent player in on-line game streaming with its GeForce NOW service, in my opinion. Though GFN has undergone some re-branding and transformation over the years, and hasn\u2019t gotten the same type of initial fanfare as some competing services, it has been \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 arguably the best game streaming service in terms of performance, quality, game selection and flexibility for its users, especially if they game on multiple platforms. NVIDIA\u2019s consistency and its continued support for additional platforms with GeForce NOW is why the company\u2019s game streaming service is about to reach the 10 million user milestone.\nNVIDIA Just Announced Updates To Its GeForce NOW ServiceNVIDIA\n\nThis morning, NVIDIA announced some major updates and changes coming to GeForce NOW. In addition to bringing new servers on-line and forging partnerships in additional regions to expand the service, NVIDIA is enabling some new quality enhancements and introducing a new premium membership tier.\n\nGeForce Now Quality Enhancements\nWith an update that\u2019s set to roll-out over the course of the next week or so (v2.0.28), NVIDIA is enabling adaptive Vsync technology with GeForce NOW. Adaptive Vsync will synchronize frame rates at 60 or 59.94 Hz server-side to match the refresh rate of the client-side display. This technology will reduce stutter and latency on supported games. NVIDIA is also introducing a new adaptive de-jitter technology that will allow the company to increase bit rates (which increases video quality) for improved quality over sub-optimal network connections.\n\n\nNVIDIA also plans to enable account linking with GeForce NOW, so members can access key games more quickly, and the company is working on game preloading updates that it claims could cut load times by about 50%. These updates should hit over the course of the next 1 \u2013 2 months.\n\nGrowing The GeForce Now Network\nIn addition the new features coming to GeForce NOW, NVIDIA is expanding its reach and capacity as well. NVIDIA plans to have data centers in Phoenix, Arizona and Montreal on-line later this year. It just launched with a new partner in Turkey (Game+), and partners in Saudi Arabia (Zain) and Australia (Pentanet) will be enabled soon.\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nNVIDIA GeForce NOW Data Center MapNVIDIA\n\nSince it\u2019s \u201cGeForce NOW Thursday\u201d (the day NVIDIA typically launches new games on the platform), a handful of new titles are coming as well, including:\n\n\nGoNNER (Steam)\nLoop Hero (Epic Games Store)\nMonopoly Plus (Steam)\nSnooker 19 (Steam)\nSystem Shock: Enhanced Edition (Steam)\nWanba Warriors (Steam)\nDo Not Feed the Monkeys (Steam)\n\n\n\n\nNew GeForce Now Membership Tiers\nWhen NVIDIA officially launched GeForce NOW and took it out of beta last year, the company offered a limited Founders Membership tier for $4.99 monthly, that granted users priority access to gaming sessions, extended session lengths, and enabled RTX ray-traced graphics effects and DLSS in supported games. A free membership tier was available too, which granted users access to the service, but with 1-hour session limits. With today\u2019s announcements, newly-subscribing members to GeForce NOW will no longer have the option to join as a Founders member, and will have to choose between the existing free tier or a new Priority Membership tier for $9.99 monthly. A yearly Priority Membership option is available as well at a discounted rate of $99.99 yearly, which brings the monthly cost down to $8.33.NVIDIA GeForce NOW PricingNVIDIA\nExisting Founders Members need not worry, however. As long as their account remains in good standing, NVIDIA will keep the introductory pricing intact through what it\u2019s calling the Founders for Life benefit. The Founders for Life benefit grants users who started a paid Founders membership on or before March 17, 2021 the opportunity to continue to use their Founders membership at the $4.99 introductory price without a set end date, so long as NVIDIA continues to offer the GeForce NOW service in their country.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

There is no better place to see the future and how you can help shape it.\"\u00a0 Also:\u00a0AI on steroids: Much bigger neural nets to come with new hardware, say Bengio, Hinton, and LeCunHinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, and also a researcher with Google's AI division, along with Bengio of Canada's MILA institute, and LeCun of Facebook, have called themselves co-conspirators in the revival of the once-moribund field of \"deep learning.\" The three all received the prestigious Turing Award, named in honor of computing pioneer Alan Turing, in 2019 for their contributions to computing. The conference will also host the three scholars' arch-nemesis, NYU professor Gary Marcus, who has been a relentless critic of deep learning, and who sparred with Bengio during a 2019 debate. More on the conference is available on the Nvidia website.What has been labeled the deep learning revolution, the break-through in multi-layer perceptrons, or neural networks, circa 2006, is also the trend that made possible the huge expansion in Nvidia's data center business.\u00a0 During a meeting with journalists a year ago in New York, at the annual AAAI conference, Hinton recalled with Mirth how he had been turned down by Nvidia eleven years ago when he'd sought to get a free graphics card.\u00a0 \"I made a big mistake back in 2009 with Nvidia,\" Hinton recalled with a grin \"In 2009, I told an audience of 1,000 grad students they should go and buy Nvidia GPUs to speed up their neural nets. I called Nvidia and said, I just recommended your GPUs to 1,000 researchers, can you give me a free one, and they said, No.\" \"What I should have done, if I was really smart, was take all my savings and put it into Nvidia stock. The stock was at $20 then, now it's, like, $250.\" And today, Nvidia shares are trading for $496.17.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)\n\n\n\n\nRTX Voice is an exciting new feature that eliminates background noise from your voice chats \u2014 including everything from Twitch game streaming to Discord and Zoom, WebEx, or Slack calls. The feature leverages NVIDIA's AI capabilities to cut out ambient noise from your surroundings. Best of all, it is available to download on older GeForce GTX cards as well. If you stream regularly and have issues with loud ambient noise, RTX Voice is the solution you've been waiting for. Here's how to set it up on your NVIDIA GPU.What is RTX Voice, and why is it a big deal?RTX Voice relies on NVIDIA's AI smarts to eliminate background noise from your microphone. Basically, if you're streaming on Twitch or use Discord for voice chats when gaming, enabling RTX Voice makes a noticeable difference in cutting out ambient noise from your surroundings.The best part about RTX Voice is that you can use it for video calls on Zoom, Skype, WebEx, and Slack.But what makes the feature stand out is that it isn't limited to game streaming services. You can use RTX Voice on Zoom, Skype, WebEx, and Slack, and it does a fantastic job eliminating background noise when you're in a video call. With everyone working from home for the foreseeable future, RTX Voice could not have launched at a better time.The feature is particularly great at cutting out keyboard sounds, and if you use a mechanical keyboard, RTX Voice makes all the difference. It is astonishing just how well it works in real-world use: I used Audacity to record a few minutes' worth of audio and started clattering away on my mechanical keyboard (I'm using one with Cherry MX Brown keys) at the same time, and the feature eliminated all the keyboard chatter.That's not all, because RTX Voice works with incoming audio as well. So if you're a video call and you notice a lot of interference from someone else, you can toggle RTX Voice for incoming audio and you'll immediately see a difference. Basically, if you're attending a lot of meetings from home these days and have an NVIDIA video card, RTX Voice is a no-brainer.RTX Voice currently works with these appsRTX Voice works best on game streaming services like Twitch Studio and Discord, but it isn't limited to these clients. You can also use it on video calling services like Zoom, WebEx, Skype, and Slack. Here's the full list of services:OBS StudioStreamlabsXSplit BroadcasterXSplit GamecasterTwitch StudioDiscordGoogle ChromeBattle.net ChatWebExSkypeZoomSlackSteam ChatNVIDIA notes that WebEx, Skype, Zoom, and Slack users may see a few issues when using RTX Voice. The feature itself is still in beta (the current version is 0.5.12.6), and any potential issues should be ironed out in the coming weeks.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.How to enable RTX Voice on your NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUIt's pretty straightforward to install and get started with RTX Voice on your GeForce RTX GPU. Before you start, make sure you're running the latest Game Ready driver for your video card. If not, download the latest driver for your RTX card.Here's the breakdown:Download the installer for RTX Voice.Run the installer.Hit Agree and continue to start the installation.You'll see a message saying \"NVIDIA Installer has finished.\" Close the installer.It's as easy as that. I'll go into more detail on setting up RTX Voice down below.How to enable RTX Voice on your NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPUAlthough RTX Voice is designed for NVIDIA's GeForce RTX cards, you can install it on an older GeForce GTX video card. The workaround was first spotted on Guru3D forums, and I tested the feature on a GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, and it worked just fine. You don't need the dedicated Tensor cores on the Turing-based RTX cards; the CUDA cores on the older GTX series cards are more than adequate.That said, you will need to tweak a few settings to get RTX Voice working on your GeForce GTX video card. Before you start, make sure you're running the latest Game Ready driver for your video card. Download the latest driver from here.Got the latest driver on your GTX video card? Here's how to install RTX Voice:Download the installer for RTX Voice.Run the installer.You'll get an error message saying \"NVIDIA Installer cannot continue.\" Close the installer.Launch Windows Explorer and navigate to the C:\\Temp\\NVRTXVoice folder. That's where the NVIDIA installer extracts the files.Open the NvAFX folder within the main NVRTXVoice folder.Open the file RTXVoice.nvi with a text editor (I use Notepad++).Delete this section of code from the file: <constraints> <property name=\"Feature.RTXVoice\" level=\"silent\" text=\"${{InstallBlockedMessage}}\"/> </constraints>Save the file and close the text editor.Now Manually run the installer* by going to **C:\\Temp\\NVRTXVoice\\setup.exe.The installation should go through without any issues.How to set up and use RTX VoiceSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)After RTX Voice is installed, you'll be able to set up input and output options. You should see a window similar to the one above pop up on your screen. The input device should be your microphone, and the output should be your speakers or headset. You'll have to select the reduce background noise setting for NVIDIA's AI to kick in and tune out ambient noise, and you also have the option to adjust the level of noise suppression according to your needs.Once RTX Voice is set up, it will run in the background and you'll see a new virtual device in Windows' Sound settings called NVIDIA RTX Voice. The next time you're broadcasting on Twitch or Discord, you'll have to select the NVIDIA RTX Voice virtual device as both your input and output device. For the feature to work as intended, it needs to route all incoming and outgoing audio, so you have to set RTX Voice as the default option.You'll have to do the same on WebEx, Slack, Zoom, or any other video calling service you're using. If you need assistance with setting up RTX Voice on a particular service, head to the installation guide here.RTX Voice is still in beta, but it already makes a huge difference for streaming games and attending meetings. If you're using a machine with an NVIDIA video card, you should give it a try right now.

The situation has gotten to the point where the former is looking into launching a series of GPUs just for crypto mining to hopefully ease the low supplies. However, it's possible that this may not be the reason why supplies of hardware have been so low lately. \nAt the Raymond James Institutional Investors Broker Conference Call, which took place on Monday, Chief Financial Officer for Nvidia, Colette Kress, addressed the issue of crypto miners buying up the GPUs saying she doesn't believe this is the reason for the current hardware shortages. She added that the supply issues are likely down to Ampere as well as overall strong demand.\nRELATED: People Are Making Fake RTX 3080 Listings to Trick Scalpers\nKress has said that the company's quarter for gaming has proven to be popular and the situation that GPU manufacturers are in would have been the same even if crypto mining wasn't in the equation. While she said that Nvidia would ideally like to have more supply overall, the reality was that demand was extremely high. Given this, it's looking like GPU shortages could continue on into 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside that, Kress\u00a0mentioned the success of the Ampere-based 3000 series which was launched last year. In addition, she discusses the popularity of the company's most recent card, the RTX 3060, which she believes has an even balance of great performance and an affordable price. Unsurprisingly, the 3060 sold out in hours once it was launched. Of course, this is likely to be meaningless information for those who are still waiting to get hold of one, or any of the recent GPU ranges that have been hitting the market at lightning speed.\nWhile Kress is confident that crypto mining is not to blame for the low supply of hardware, some may be wondering why the company is manufacturing graphics cards for this specific purpose if not to stem what many see as a real issue. With the launch of the recent Nvidia midrange RTX 3060 and with Intel set to release their DG2 GPU, there's no doubt that there's a lot of choice out there for PC gamers. However,\u00a0it doesn't matter how many products are put out because without the ability to purchase any of it, all gamers and PC enthusiasts can do is twiddle their thumbs until stocks become available again.\nMORE: The Best Pre-Built Gaming PCs on the Market (2021)\nSource: WCCF Tech \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming News\n\n\n\n\nPC Gaming\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Microsoft is Not Releasing an Xbox Rival to the PS5 Pro\n\t\t\n\n\nXbox Series X\n\nThe PS5 Pro is set to become the most powerful gaming console.

That puts it 29th on the Top500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers and among the top three most-energy-efficient machines in the Green500, if it were scored today.For more breaking data center news, features, and opinions, be sure to subscribe to DCD's newsletterBuilding a supercomputer in a few months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\nNvidia's foray into supercomputer operations dates back to 2015, when the company was designing its own server architecture to compete with the HPs and Dells of the world.Its DGX platform, it says, operates as a reference architecture for how best to deploy its GPUs - but also serves as a healthy business venture in its own right.The DGX platform came into fruition just as Nvidia began to hire more and more AI researchers. \"We weren't a big user of AI yet,\" Marc Hamilton, Nvidia's VP of solutions architecture and engineering, told DCD.\"We want to attract more researchers. But if we're going to attract AI researchers, we have to give them the tools that they need.\"They settled on building a huge supercomputer out of DGXs. \"For AI researchers to pay attention, we want to be on the Top500 supercomputer list, but we don't want to be number 495.\"The first system, built out of 124 DGX-1s in 2016 came in the top 50. \"We have about a dozen different supercomputers across Nvidia of various sizes now,\" Hamilton said.The supercomputers are used for Nvidia's chip designs and growing software platforms. But a need to dominate rankings has also driven them.In competition with Nvidia, Google developed its own TPU accelerator series, following the chips up with a new benchmark to show what it could do - MLPerf. Nvidia quickly updated its most powerful supercomputer. \"And we have been number one in all 16 benchmarks,\" Hamilton said.That system, Selene, is the fifth-fastest supercomputer on November's Top500 list.Cambridge-1 also appears to have multiple benefits. Not only will the system prove useful in its own right, and top UK rankings, but it is also likely part of the company's wider charm offensive in the UK.The system was conceived in October 2020, a month after Nvidia announced its plans to acquire British chip designer Arm for $40bn. That acquisition faces intense regulatory reviews and is currently being challenged by Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and others.The new supercomputer - which Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock may be set to open - is an affirmation of Nvidia's potential to invest heavily in the UK.\"We've got a lot of supercomputers in California and most of our researchers are in California,\" Hamilton said. \"[We decided] why don't we build our supercomputer somewhere where we have a concentration of Nvidia employees - current or future - and customers?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, the company began looking at data centers around the Cambridge area, home to Arm's headquarters. Nvidia found nine potential data centers it thought could support its needs within the area, including providing renewable power.After an RFI and review process, Nvidia settled on Kao Data. \"They were the only one that was a UK company, a lot of these colocation providers are big international companies.\"Once Kao was chosen, Nvidia used in-house computational fluid dynamics simulations (as well as Kao's CFD) and digital twins to decide how to build its supercomputer.\"What we decided was sort of Lego blocks - four blocks of 20 DGX A100 systems.\"Currently, the company has only filled racks halfway. \"Kao had the room, and it's because colocation pricing is kind of funny - the number one factor is the power, space almost doesn't matter,\" Hamilton said. But, he said, Nvidia may expand the nearly-1MW deployment to take up the other half of the rack.Based in California, Hamilton had to manage the project remotely, with travel still limited by Covid-19. \"We were also right in the middle of building a Selene when the pandemic hit,\" Hamilton said. \"And when you're setting it up, and even running it, you want to know 'did that cable somehow get unplugged? Or is there a red light there?'\"So the company settled on basic telepresence robots - think an iPad on wheels - to patrol the facility checking out faults. That was fine for the cold aisle Selene layout, but for the hot aisle Cambridge-1 it meant that all the important parts of the racks were behind closed doors. The solution was to simply install motion-activated doors, like those found in shops.\"It's designed for our little robot, but I'm sure as a technician is walking in with arms full of parts, they'll appreciate it as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nvidia\n\n\n\nBeyond switching to cold aisle (as Kao airflow comes from the sides, and Selene from below), the design was incredibly similar to Nvidia's other deployments, with the company emphasizing the benefits of pre-built Lego-like systems.Where it differs is how it is operated. Every other Nvidia system is exclusively used by the company. Cambridge-1 will be available to a select group of partners. In another perhaps politically savvy move given the ongoing crisis, Cambridge-1 will be made available to healthcare partners GSK, AstraZeneca, King\u2019s College London, Oxford Nanopore, and Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 National Health Service Foundation Trust, among others.Nvidia will open up the supercomputer to the companies and organizations, helping them focus on \"grand projects,\" Hamilton said. All are currently DGX customers - a requirement to take part - but none operate systems at the scale of Cambridge-1. The hope is that it will serve as a showpiece, allowing the companies to test out large ideas without having to invest upfront. Should the results prove promising, perhaps it will encourage them to build DGX supercomputers of their own.But Hamilton was insistent that this does not mark Nvidia's entry into the supercomputing-as-a-service space.\"All the major public clouds around the world have GPUs - Microsoft lets you build a supercomputer exactly the way we did,\" he said. \"It would be foolish to try to compete with their scale and their pricing. This is very, very specific.\"No, we're getting more active in the supercomputer-as-a-Lego-block space.\"\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Aug 2020\n\n\n\n\nThe Earth's twin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08 Feb 2021\n\n\n\n\nChip start-up Graphcore asks UK government to block Nvidia's Arm acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Sep 2019\n\n\n\n\nEU biological data unit moves into Kao campus, London\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nKao Data\n\n\nCambridge-1\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nMarc Hamilton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

But rival AMD also offers powerful GPUs that present solid competition. As Nvidia releases its new Ampere architecture and AMD puts forth its MD100 GPU, the two vendors once again vie to dominate in the GPU market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPUs originated as fixed-function accelerators to speed demanding graphics calculations but have since evolved into fully programmable compute engines. Organizations now frequently use GPUs for tasks such as training machine learning models or high-performance computing (HPC).\nOrganizations hoping to accelerate graphics processing in their data centers should compare Nvidia vs. AMD's GPU offerings to determine which might suit their needs best.\n\nNvidia's GPU offerings\nOrganizations use Nvidia's GPUs for a range of data center workloads, including machine learning training and operating machine learning models. Nvidia GPUs can also accelerate the calculations in supercomputing simulations, such as financial modeling or extreme weather prediction. In addition, Nvidia's partner OmniSci has developed a platform with a GPU-accelerated database, rendering engine and visualization system that can deliver analytics results much faster than conventional alternatives.\nNvidia's A100 GPUs -- its most recent -- are based on Nvidia's Ampere architecture, which replaced its Volta and Turing architectures. The A100 GPU accelerator features 108 streaming multiprocessors, each of which contains four of Nvidia's third-generation Tensor Cores and 64 FP32 CUDA Cores. The Tensor Core is a specialized processing unit optimized for 4x4 matrix operations, which can significantly speed machine learning calculations. Tensor Cores also feature enhancements for the fine-grained sparsity common to AI and HPC workloads.\nThe GA100 chip at the heart of this GPU accelerator has a dozen 512-bit second-generation High Bandwidth Memory controllers that feed into six banks of HBM2 stacked memory. At launch, the A100 shipped with 40 GB memory, offering 1,555 GBps of memory bandwidth, but Nvidia unveiled a new version in November 2020 that doubles the memory to 80 GB and increases the memory bandwidth to 2 TBps.\nNvidia also offers CUDA software support for developers, such as the CUDA Toolkit that includes GPU-accelerated libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime. Organizations can build machine learning frameworks around CUDA for GPU accelerator support.\n\n\nAMD's GPU offerings\nAMD's Instinct MI100 GPU came out in 2020, targeting scientific computing workloads. AMD has effectively split its GPU portfolio into gaming-targeted models -- with its Radeon DNA architecture -- and data center performance models, such as the Compute DNA architecture in the Instinct MI100.\nThe Instinct MI100 implements 120 compute units (CUs), split into eight blocks and interconnected by an on-die fabric, meaning they're connected at the chip level. Like Nvidia's GPU, the CUs are made up of smaller functional units called stream processors, which number 64 per CU. Also like Nvidia, AMD uses HBM2 memory, and its GPU has four banks, providing a total of 32 GB of memory and 1.23 TBps of aggregate memory bandwidth.\nThe CUs in the Instinct MI100 feature Matrix Core Engines optimized for the matrix data types seen in machine learning. It also supports new numerical formats for machine learning and preserves backward compatibility for software written for the extant AMD GPU architecture.\nAMD offers a software development platform called ROCm. ROCm, an open platform, enables developers to write and compile code for multiple environments, including Nvidia GPUs. It supports common machine learning frameworks such as the open source TensorFlow and PyTorch. ROCm also provides pathways for porting Nvidia CUDA code to AMD hardware.\n\n\nNvidia vs. AMD GPUs: How do they measure up?\nA straight comparison between Nvidia and AMD's GPU performance figures gives AMD an apparent edge over Nvidia, with up to 11.5 teraflops in 64-bit floating point (FP64) and up to 23.1 teraflops in FP32, compared with Nvidia's 9.7 teraflops in FP64 and 19.5 teraflops in FP32. However, Nvidia's A100 GPU boasts key enhancements to accelerate AI functions and includes much more memory than AMD's GPU. AMD presents a serious rival for Nvidia when it comes to HPC, but Nvidia still maintains the edge for AI acceleration, according to Moor Insights & Strategy.\nNvidia has a more mature programming framework in CUDA, but AMD's ROCm works as a universal platform for GPU-accelerated computing on any GPU. Potential customers should evaluate performance for themselves, based on the applications and tools they wish to run.\nIT shops might have an additional choice when it comes to GPU accelerators. Intel intends to enter the GPU market with its own offerings -- the Intel Xe family, which focuses on a high-end device, codenamed Ponte Vecchio. Intel plans to deploy Ponte Vecchio in the Aurora supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory, in Lemont, Ill., in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on Data center ops, monitoring and management\n\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia?\n\n\n\n\nBy: Gavin\u00a0Wright\n\n\n\n\nAMD trims delivery time for MI350\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nHow Intel's new AI Gaudi 3 chip compares with Nvidia chips\n\n\n\n\nBy: Esther\u00a0Shittu\n\n\n\n\nAMD bets on India, doubles down on AI\n\n\n\n\nBy: Pratima\u00a0Harigunani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-Handbook: Programmable processor technology for next-gen data centers\n\nArticle3 of 4\n\n\n\nUp Next\n\n\n\nAn overview of programmable processors for data center servers\nThe right processing technology can benefit your data center.

The research firm has forecasted that the installed/shipped GPU base will increase to 419 million units during 2020-2025. The PC market, in general, is showing signs of recovery after the pandemic disrupted global operations. Overall GPU shipments increased by 20.5% from the previous quarter.\nRelated Story AMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 CoresThe overall PC market increased by 30.25% quarter-to-quarter and increased 35.76% year-to-year. via JPR\n\nIntel's overall shipments increased by 20.5%, AMD's shipments increased by 6.4% while NVIDIA saw a decline of 7.3%. These are overall GPU shipments and Intel/AMD both had some strong products to offer to users with their Renoir and Comet Lake-based products. Intel also managed to ship a lot more 14nm desktop processors which feature their own integrated graphics solutions & those are also accounted for in these figures.\nQuick highlights\n\nAMD\u2019s overall unit shipments increased by 6.4% quarter-to-quarter, Intel\u2019s total shipments rose by 33.2% from the last quarter, and Nvidia\u2019s decreased by -7.3%.\nThe GPU\u2019s overall attach rate (which includes integrated and discrete GPUs, desktop, notebook, and workstations) to PCs for the quarter was\n113%, down -9.2% from last quarter.\nThe overall PC market increased by 30.25% quarter-to-quarter and increased 35.76% year-to-year.\nDesktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs that use discrete GPUs) decreased by -3.90% from the last quarter.\nQ4\u201920 saw an increase in tablet shipments from last quarter.\n\n\nWhen looking at the discrete graphics segment, the market segment saw gains with NVIDIA gaining a 2 point market share lead over AMD. NVIDIA GeForce GPUs now account for 82% of the overall d GPU market share while AMD Radeon graphics cards account for 18%. That's a huge increase when compared to the previous year where NVIDIA was sitting at 73% discrete and AMD at 27%. NVIDIA not only released high-end GeForce RTX 30 GPUs but has also introduced more mainstream GPUs in Q1 2021 which should also help them raise the market share in the upcoming results.\nWhile NVIDIA and AMD both face severe supply and demand issues, the green team has been able to provide a slightly better flow of its discrete graphics cards compared to AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series. Another contributing factor to NVIDIA's higher market share gain is due to cryptocurrency mining. NVIDIA has taken measures to counter crypto mining operations by limiting hash rates on its upcoming GeForce graphics cards and also announced its CMP lineup which is dedicated to the crypto mining segment but we will have to see how that affects its market share growth in the few coming quarters.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan Believes AMD\u2019s AI GPU Business Would Grow By 60 Percent This Year, Highlights Oracle\u2019s Initial Order Of 30,000 MI355X GPUs\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D & 9900X3D 3D V-Cache CPUs Now Available \u2013 The Best Gaming & Content Creation Package Ever!\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndervolted AMD Radeon RX 9070 Retains 90% of Its Performance & Outperforms RTX 4070 Ti Super, On Par With 9070 XT At 3 GHz OC\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n106\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n101\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n67\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n50\nActive Readers\n\n\n\niPhone 17 Air Pricing Details Suggest It Will Occupy The Same Bracket As Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Plus, And Will Arrive With Better Battery Life, But At The Cost Of Extra Features\n\n\n\n46\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1478\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Cristiano Amon, the 50-year-old Brazilian president of Qualcomm, will become only the fourth CEO in the tech giant's 36-year history this June. He recently gave a far-reaching interview about the state of the industry, from the chip shortage to Nvidia's takeover of Arm. Here are some of the highlights. \nSpeaking to CNET, Amon didn't gloss over the seriousness of the problems caused by the current worldwide dearth of chips. \"If you asked me, 'what keeps me up at night?' right now [it] is this supply chain crisis we're having in the semiconductor industry,\" he said.\nQualcomm relies on companies such as TSMC and Samsung to build most of its chips. While that can be convenient, it also brings its own set of issues: Samsung is still in the process of getting its Austin, Texas, plant back to normal production levels after the extreme weather saw it close temporarily. The factory makes chips for its own LSI division, Tesla, and Qualcomm.\n\nWhen asked if Qualcomm would ever build its own fabs to produce the Snapdragon SoC, Amon said: \"We're very good at designing chips, and we're very good at implementing technologies for a very fast pace of innovation ... Manufacturing of semiconductors is a whole different expertise.\"\nWe know that everything from the automotive industry to PC hardware and gaming consoles have felt the effects of global semiconductor shortage. Reports claim it could last well into 2022, but Amon is more optimistic.\n\"This is going to get better as we get to the end of 2021,\" he said. \"But the importance of this is to call attention and make sure that we have ... [a] robust supply chain, and investments are made ... across a number of technologies.\" \n// Related Stories\n\n\n\n TSMC seeks Intel foundry stake in joint venture with Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm \n\n\n\n Vietnam wants to compete with Taiwan by establishing its first wafer fab \n\n\n\nElsewhere, Amon emphasized the importance of Arm remaining independent. Qualcomm is one of several companies to have publicly opposed Nvidia's $40 billion purchase of the UK chip designer and has urged regulators to look deeper at the deal's antitrust implications. Qualcomm is anxious that Nvidia could keep vital parts of Arm's intellectual property.\n\"The strength of the Arm roadmap is its independence,\" Amon said. \"Nvidia does not need to buy Arm to do what they said they're going to do.\" He believes Nvidia doesn't need to buy Arm to compete with Intel's x86 architecture.\n\"The Arm ecosystems thrives ... and creates incredible competition across the globe because it's independent,\" Amon added.\n\n\n\n\n\n 14 comments\n \n501 likes and shares\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on TechSpot\n\n\n\n\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Defender misidentifies key driver, disrupting popular PC monitoring tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n36 comments\n\n\n\nAMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one\n\n\n\n\n82 comments\n\n\n\nE-waste or Linux?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I help firms understand AI, mobile and cloud to improve their businessFollow AuthorMar 23, 2021, 07:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.AI impacts every industrySource: NVIDIA\nBest-in-class companies are data-driven with insights that are increasingly AI-powered. Effectively competing in this new world requires application modernization and AI adoption. Neither task is easy. Organizations spend too much time designing and maintaining the infrastructure to support applications and AI. Companies need to spend more time creating new employee workflows, products and customer experiences to succeed in a highly competitive environment.\n\n\n\n\nTechnology vendors play a crucial role in helping or hindering organizational transformation. Last year, NVIDIA and VMware discussed how they were creating an AI-Ready Enterprise platform. This month NVIDIA and VMware announced the platform has entered general availability. As part of the partnership:\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA extended its NVIDIA-certified program to vSphere infrastructure. NVIDIA spent more than a year working with numerous OEMs to certify bare-metal servers through a program called NVIDIA-certified. A bare-metal server is your traditional dedicated server where only one company uses it.\u00a0Bare-metal supports multiple types of operating systems on top of it and can run hypervisors.\u00a0The goal behind the NVIDIA-certified program is to simplify the process of discovering what infrastructure enterprises should buy to run AI in their data centers. The company worked with VMWare to optimize NVIDIA technology with vSphere infrastructure as part of an update to VMware's core virtual machine software. There is also a fully integrated Kubernetes native support.\n\u00a0NVIDIA shared an update on the suite of software to help fast-track enterprise AI efforts.\u00a0\u00a0The software provides toolkits help with the adoption of AI and simplifies scaling AI models in production.\u00a0The\u00a0AI software suite includes NVIDIA's transfer learning toolkit that allows enterprises to take pre-trained models, add a smaller set of data that they collect in their data centers, and train against the data they have. Using transfer learning, organizations can achieve a highly accurate model with a smaller data set and use the NVIDIA tools and models in early pilots and production use cases.\u00a0\nThe companies delivered optimizations that create performance improvement for virtualized environments. In the past, organizations ran bare-metal servers to ensure the best performance and eliminate crosstalk from other companies that could happen in a shared, virtualized server environment. While performance was good, it came at the cost of efficiency. Meanwhile, there was also a question as to whether a virtualized environment could deliver the right performance. NVIDIA and VMware said the newly optimized stack allows them to provide indistinguishable performance from bare-metal as you scale up to multi-node infrastructure.\u00a0VMWare said it achieved a 20x performance improvement using\u00a0the A100 Ampere GPUs.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's AI Enterprise software stack is certified and optimized to work with VMware's vSphereSource: NVIDIA\nWhy does it matter?\u00a0\nA set of predefined solutions, like what NVIDIA and VMware offered, simplify infrastructure purchases by helping IT leaders understand what products work together and what combination of components need to be purchased to run AI in their data centers. Everyone knows AI talent commands a premium. Rather than hiring specific talent to deploy and support AI-specific infrastructure, a certified solution allows companies to manage systems with existing core IT teams.\u00a0\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\nThe software stack provides foundational elements that help companies bootstrap efforts. For example, an organization can use its data with NVIDIA pre-trained AI vision models and transfer learning to compress its training cycle down to approximately eight weeks.\u00a0\u00a0In the past, this process could have taken up to 80 weeks as an organization installed new infrastructure, hired new AI research talent, and created its deep learning model.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, a multiple instance GPU infrastructure provides new levels of AI workload flexibility for VMware customers. NVIDIA announced a new architecture called the A100 that offers a multi-instance GPU last May. The NVIDIA-VMware solution fully exposes the A100 multi-instance GPU functionality to the vCenter control plane. The solution enables an organization to have seven virtual machines (VMs) share one piece of hardware in a secure and isolated way with guaranteed quality of service and response. It also offers the ability for the company to reaggregate the infrastructure into one big GPU for training performance.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLet's look at what that means in action. For example, a financial firm running production AI models for credit card fraud detection could use a multi-instance GPU to scale inferencing to meet peak demand. During the evening, when the demand drops, the company can re-aggregate the multiple multi-instance GPU instances into a single GPU to run AI model training workloads at night. Effectively, it allows a company to use the same infrastructure for training and inference by changing the profile of how it uses the GPU throughout the day.\n\nOverall, it's clear that AI will transform every industry and we're just at the beginning of integrating this insight into enterprise applications. Companies need technology solutions that can speed the pace of deployment, help IT leaders add new insights into applications and create new products. It's good to see new products and collaborations coming to market to support this.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Not only does this means the current shortage of Nvidia's 30-series GPUs isn't about to get better any time soon, but the increased graphics card pricing we're seeing is likely to continue.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restNvidia itself has only talked about component shortages, so Asus saying, \"Our guess is that the gap might have been caused by lower yields upstream [potentially indicating Nvidia's own production at Samsung]\", is surprising. The yield here refers to the number of working GPUs per wafer. If the Asus claim is true, it suggests that all is not well with Nvidia's decision to use Samsung's 8N manufacturing for its Ampere GPUs.\u00a0That has long been suggested by other outlets, but there has still been no proof to back up any of this conjecture. And we likely won't hear anything about it unless it materially affects Nvidia's revenue and it has to fess up to investors, as chip yields are always jealously guarded by companies.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nMSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia\n\n\n\n\nWhere the AF are all the graphics cards?! It's not just the new RTX 50-series that's impossible to buy, finding any decent GPU in stock at the major US retailers right now is like staring into an abyss of nothing\n\n\n\nAsus also suggested that Nvidia had ordered fewer wafers for the first quarter of the year, which would be the norm usually, as demand for graphics cards tends to fall off after the Holiday period. Such orders are planned a full quarter in advance, and Nvidia would have had no idea how popular Ampere would be or the impact Covid-19 would have on demand.\u00a0There's also the problem of cryptocurrency mining, putting even more pressure on the cards that are being made, although Asus doesn't know how many of its cards end up mining. Nvidia has tried to dissuade miners from buying its cards, and with the release of the RTX 3060, it introduced measures to stop the cards mining Ethereum, although a developer driver did slip out which undermined its efforts here somewhat.There are reports that Nvidia has already reached out to TSMC for additional production of Ampere chips, although given the demand on TSMC's own capacity, that's not necessarily going to bear instant fruit. Intel's decision to enter the contract foundry business sure looks like a wise move right now.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nAsus\n\n\nAlan DexterSocial Links NavigationAlan has been writing about PC tech since before 3D graphics cards existed, and still vividly recalls having to fight with MS-DOS just to get games to load.

It's the perfect choice in the RTX-30 series, bringing in a noticeable performance gain from the RTX 2080, along with improved ray tracing and DLSS. However, like all new PC hardware right now, it is in very short supply.\n\nForMuch better ray tracing performanceBetter frame rates at 1440p/4KCooler and quieter than the RTX 2080HDMI 2.1AgainstMuch higher power draw than the RTX 2080Availability issues\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\n\n\n $699 at Amazon $789.99 at Newegg Check Walmart\nThe best last-gen GPU The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 is the king of last generation GPUs. While it doesn't quite have enough power to go up to 4K 60 FPS and do ray tracing, it's still a solid GPU to have.

It has kept the same starting price of $700 but offers better performance at 4K, and with ray tracing. The upgrade from RTX 2080 to RTX 3080 is recommended, especially since it makes a clearer jump to the next generation of gaming.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 vs. RTX 2080 specsSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 comes with a new Ampere GA102 chipset, made with Samsung's 8nm fabrication process. On the other hand, the RTX 2080 has the Turing TU104 chipset, based on TSMC's 12nm process. The shift to a considerably smaller fabrication process means that the transistor count has jumped from 13.6 billion to a whopping 28.3 billion \u2014 which amounts to a significant gain in power as well. Let's take a look at the specifications of both cards.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Shader (CUDA) Cores87042944Core Clock1440MHz1515MHzBoost Clock1710MHz1710MHzMemory10GB GDDR6X320-bit bus width8 GB GDDR6256-bit bus widthMemory Clock19Gbps14GbpsMemory Bandwidth760GB/s448GB/sRT Cores6846Tensor Cores272368Transistors28.3 billion13.6 billionNodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 12nmArchitectureAmpereTuringTDP320W215 WPorts1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4a1 x HDMI 2.0b3 x DisplayPort 1.41 x USB CPower Connector1 x 12-pin2 x PCIe 8-pin converter included1 x 6 pin + 1x 8 pinThe RTX 3080 has a significantly higher number of shader cores as well.

The RTX 2080 is only sufficient and will require you to turn down a few settings to get to that magical 144 FPS figure at 1440p, but the RTX 3080 does it more comfortably, with fewer compromises. Let's look at 4K gaming performance.With 4K, RTX 2080 struggles to hit the 60 FPS baseline, but the RTX 3080 seems to do it with ease. The RTX 3080 will even let you hit 4K 144 FPS with a few settings turned down. The RTX 2080, on the other hand, would have to sacrifice a lot of the visual quality if it is to get to those figures.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Basically, an upgrade to the RTX 3080 will mean that you can play all the latest games at higher graphics settings. It will also mean your PC will consume a bit more power and might need upgrades to some of the other components to get the most of it.So should you upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 from RTX 2080?The clear answer: yes. RTX 3080 is a beast of a GPU and will serve you well in next-gen gaming perhaps the best graphics card on the market. Even though it's just a single-generation upgrade, it's still a solid one regardless. However, there is a catch. The RTX 3080 is currently very difficult to find, given the short supply and heavy demand.This has also led to price gouging, with some sellers pricing RTX 3080 cards over two to three times the actual retail price. While the card is a stellar value at its original price, you absolutely must not pay the inflated asking prices. The RTX 2080 should be able to carry you until you can find a reasonably priced RTX 3080.There are also a few things to consider while upgrading. First of all, you need to remember that an upgrade like this is only as good as the rest of the computer. An upgrade to the RTX 3080 does come with better performance in games, provided your PC can accommodate it. Your current components need to be compatible with the new card, especially the power supply unit (PSU) since the RTX 3080 consumes about 105W more power than the RTX 3080.However, if you have a powerful enough rig and can get your hands on one without burning a hole in your wallet, by all means, buy the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080.\n\n\n\nEnter the RTX 30\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n $749.99 at Newegg $799.99 at Amazon $2,480.99 at Walmart\nStep up to the next genThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 is a true next-gen gaming GPU.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorMar 17, 2021, 08:59am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 4 years old.AMD's Radeon RX 6700XTAntony Leather\nToday we're finally able to lift the lid on performance numbers for AMD's RX 6700XT - the company's new mid-range graphics card that's set to retail for around $479. Of course, while AMD's Radeon RX 6000-series has been generally well-received and is a welcome return to the high-end market of PC gaming, availability of its cards, as with a lot of tech items at the moment, has been a real issue.\n\n\nWhether the RX 6700 XT will be available in quantity or even anywhere near it's RRP remains to be seen, but there's not much we can do about that right now. At $479, it's a little cheaper than launch RRP of the RTX 3070 at $499, so what we're looking for here is a card that keeps up with the RTX 3070 and is significantly faster than the RTX 3060 Ti. Let's take a look at its performance.\nForbesAMD Announces The Radeon RX 6700 XT But Is It Worth Buying?By Antony Leather\n\nTest system and benchmarksMy CPU and GPU test systemAntony Leather\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nI used AMD's 20.50 release driver for the RX 6700 XT testing along with a fully up-to-date version of Windows 10. The benchmarks span 1080p to 4K, but not all graphics cards are tested at all resolutions. For example, the RTX 3060 isn't tested at 4K since you'd be well-advised to opt for a more powerful card if that's your chosen resolution. The RX 6700 XT is a mid-range card that's capable of 4K in some games so I've included results at 4K in all my game tests. In addition, I've also included results for ray tracing, DLSS and Smart Access Memory in certain titles to see the impact these features make.\n\n\nThe test system used an MSI MEG Z490 Ace, Intel Core i9-10900K, 16GB 3466MHz Corsair memory and an Intel 760p SSD along with a custom watercooling system.\n\nBenchmarks\n\n\nIn Metro Exodus at 1080p with ray tracing and DLSS enabled, the 6700 XT lags behind the RTX 3060 Ti, which is clearly not ideal given the latter has a lower price in normal times, but this is thanks to DLSS, which isn't available in all games and AMD will have its own version of the technology in due course.\nThe same was true at 1440p with the 6700 XT sitting some way behind the RTX 3060 Ti. Now less see what happens if we turn off ray tracing and DLSS.\nBelow you can see that without the benefit of DLSS, the RX 6700 XT has a similar 99th percentile to the RTX 3070, although the latter enjoys a noticeably higher average frame rate. It's also worth noting the proximity of the RTX 3060 Ti here too - it's not far behind either the RTX 3070 or RX 6700 XT.\nIt's no surprise to see the result at 4K re-enabling DLSS and ray tracing, with the RX 6700 XT sitting below the RX 6800. The trouble here is that if you're prepared to use DLSS, the RTX 3060 Ti is far cheaper (without a pandemic and cryptocurrency mining surge) and does manage playable frame rates at 4K.\nSwitch that advantage off and the two cards are actually quite similar and the RTX 3070 is again a fair way ahead of the RX 6700 XT in Metro Exodus at 4K.\nFor some reason at 1080p AMD cards really don't perform that well against their green counterparts and even the RX 6800 failed to topple the RTX 3060 Ti.\nAt 1440p, order is restored and the RX 6700 XT managed to beat the RTX 3070's minimum 99th percentile, but the latter had a higher average frame rate. Again, though, the RTX 3060 Ti wasn't far behind at all.\nAt 4K things lean more to AMD's favor, with the RX 6700 XT snapping at the heels of the RTX 3070 and sitting a long way ahead of the RTX 3060 Ti.\nNext up is Borderlands 3 and the RX 6700 XT doesn't really offer a compelling reason to chose it over the RTX 3060 Ti at 1080p, with the two fairly evenly matched.\nUpping the resolution to 1440p and the situation is transformed, again matching the more expensive RTX 3070 - great news for AMD and Borderlands fans.\nThe game was plenty smooth enough at 4K and once again, the RX 6700 XT sits where it should given the price difference between it and the RTX 3070 - just behind and noticeably faster than the RTX 3060 Ti.\nAMD doesn't support ray tracing in Wolfenstein so it's, standard mode here. It offers a decent lead over the RTX 3060 Ti on the minimum 99th percentile, but the average frame rate was a little disappointing, slipping behind the Nvidia card while overall performance was a long way off the RTX 3070.\nBelow we're running at 1440p and again the average frame rate is a little slow, while the minimum 99th percentile sits roughly equal between it, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070.\n4K saw the minimum 99th and average frame rates compressed further still and no real gains made on the RTX 3070, although the 99th percentile was significantly higher than the RTX 3060 Ti, even if the average was a little slower.\nTomb Raider was far kinder to AMD, with the RX 6700 XT sitting some distance behind the RX 6800, but with slightly better performance than the RTX 3070. Job done, at least at these settings.\n1440p was a similar story - the RX 6800 offers a lot higher performance, but the RX 6700 XT has the measure of the more expensive RTX 3070.\nSwitching up to 4K and things take a bit of a plunge with the RX 6700 XT only able to match the RTX 3060 Ti. I re-ran these numbers and got the same result.\nEnabling DLSS and ray tracing and it's clear why AMD needs some alternative to DLSS, especially when it comes to adding performance to cards that would struggle at higher resolutions anyway. The RTX 3060 Ti managed a reasonably smooth 34fps minimum 99th percentile thanks to DLSS but the RX 6700 XT manages 19fps.\nSmart Access Memory Performance\nSmart Access Memory is a new feature from AMD that can enhance performance if you have a Ryzen 5000 or select Ryzen 3000-series CPU, 500-series motherboard and RX 6000-series GPU. Clearly a niche setup, especially as buying these CPUs and graphics cards in the last few months has been extremely difficult. However, I've carried out performance in two games below. I'd liked to have done more but shipping-related gremlins and other factors meant I didn't have time. I'll revisit with more games in the near future. My test system differs from the one listed above and includes an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and MSI MPG B550 Gaming Carbon WiFi, but the rest of the hardware is the same.\nDirt 5 saw a definite uptick in performance, although this only edged it a little closer to the RTX 3070 rather than leapfrogging it. The standout result is the minimum 99th percentile leaping from 78fps to 81fps at 1440 while the average rose 5fps from 90fps to 95fps.\nWatch Dogs: Legion is relatively new and for now, ray tracing is disabled as it caused the benchmark to crash, so it's standard ultra settings in DX12. There was barely any difference between SAM mode and normal, though, but honestly didn't know what to expect as I haven't seen any other SAM benchmarks for this game.\nConclusions\nThe RTX 6700 XT mostly slots in nicely between the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, but just where it does depends on the game, whether DLSS or ray tracing are enabled and indeed whether you have a system capable of using Smart Access Memory. There are plenty more results out there from my fellow reviewers that point to decent gains with SAM enabled, but it's still a niche feature. In future I'll be including it more tests though, just as I do with DLSS. The cooler is very attractive, well made and super-quiet in games too. Absolutely no complaints from me here.AMD's RX 6700 XTAntony Leather\nThere were plenty of areas where the RX 6700 XT offers a compelling alternative to the RTX 3070 given its cheaper price and this is often at 1440p, which is the resolution AMD has been focussing on in press materials too. However, there are lots of instances where the RTX 3070 is a better buy and even the RTX 3060 Ti too, although the latter is arguably much better value than the RTX 3070 as well.\nEven if the RX 6700 XT slots neatly into your budget and gaming requirements, which is entirely possible for a lot of people, the biggest issue is availability. Mining performance sits around 45MH/s with Ethereum and tuning the card can easily get down to sub 120W levels, which means that it will ultimately be attractive to miners. I've not seen a single RX 6000-series card available here in the UK for weeks, if not months, so a recommendation would start with being able to buy it, and at a fair price, and it remains to be seen whether that will be the case.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The\u00a0GeForce GTX 1650,\u00a0RTX 2060, and RTX 3080 lead their generational ranges with +0.24%, +0.21%, and +0.11% respective monthly increase.Image 1 of 2Steam Hardware percentage changes for February 2021(Image credit: Steam)Steam Hardware percentage changes for February 2021Steam Hardware overall top ranking GPUs(Image credit: Steam)Steam Hardware overall top ranking GPUsThe increase for the older GTX 1650 Super is likely down to sales of gaming laptops and new PC builders starting with a lower budget, though we're not discounting that the current insane market for GPUs because of cryptomining and scalpers might have something to do with it.The GTX 1650 Super isn\u2019t made to blow games out of the water by running them at 4K and high frame rates after all; this is the entry-level graphics card simply to get you playing.The\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080\u00a0offers a great price-performance ratio that explains its immediate popularity, but it's unlikely to occupy a top 10 space any time soon unless stock issues are resolved. In fact, out of the 10 spaces Nvidia dominates in Steam's Hardware results, eight are still occupied by 1000 series GTX cards.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Can AMD get a seat at the table?AMD has found itself a devout fanbase with the release of its Ryzen CPU series, but if it wants to shake team green in the same way it has Intel then there's more work to be done. More inventory of the Radeon RX 6000 series (and older ranges) needs to be released into the hands of gamers.With AMD having desirable affordability over Nvidia's offerings, we could eventually see team red occupying a few spaces in Steams Hardware rankings, especially with graphically demanding game titles creating a need for upgrades to existing machines.Today's best Graphics Cards deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesBest budget gaming PC 2021: top gaming desktops for lessVia Notebook Check\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

It is capable of hitting acceptable performance at 1080, and can do some 1440p, and outperforms the RTX 2060 by a decent margin. However, it fails to offer as great a price-to-performance ratio as the 3060 Ti and 3070, and is also hard to find at a fair price.\n\nFor12 GB GDDR6 memorySolid 1080p gaming performanceHDMI 2.1AgainstNeeds more power than the RTX 2060Limited availability\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060\n\n\n $569 at Amazon $901.99 at Walmart $1,048 at Walmart\nLast-gen RTX entry point The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 is the predecessor to the RTX 3060. The RTX 2060 was the entry point for the RTX 20 series of GPUs, and offered an entry-level peek into ray tracing. It certainly holds up for that it was. It's a decent 1080p performer, making it a solid GPU to own right now.\n\nForHolds up well for 1080p gamingLower power consumptionAgainstEntry-level ray-tracing performanceCan't do very well at 1440p\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the new entry point for the RTX 30 series of GPUs. If you're looking for a ray tracing GPU, the RTX 3060 is the cheapest one you can buy. It starts at a slightly lower price than the RTX 2060 did, but despite having better performance with a lower starting price, it does not make for a significant upgrade if you're coming for the RTX 2060. Let's take a look at the reasons why.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 specsSource: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is a step up from the hardware of the RTX 2060, but not in all aspects. With the RTX 3060, you're getting the new Ampere GA106 GPU, which uses Samsung's 8nm process. The RTX 2060, on the other hand, used the 12nm TSMC process. This means a jump in the transistor count. The RTX 2060 packed in 10.8 billion transistors, while the RTX 3060 gets 13.25 billion transistors. Let's take a closer look at the specifications of the two cards.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060Shader (CUDA) Cores35841920Core Clock1320MHz1365MHzBoost Clock1780MHz1680MHzMemory12GB GDDR6192-bit bus width6 GB GDDR6192-bit bus widthMemory Clock15Gbps14GbpsMemory Bandwidth360GB/s336GB/sRT Cores2830Tensor Cores112240Transistors13.25 billion10.8 billionNodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 12nm FFNArchitectureAmpereTuringTDP170W160 WPorts1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4a1 x HDMI 2.0b2 x DisplayPort 1.41 x DVI1 x USB CPower Connector1 x 8 pin1 x 8 pinNote: Some specifications of the RTX 3060 and RTX 2060, like the ports, may vary as per AIB models.The tricky thing here is that while there's a transistor count jump, unlike most other successor cards, the RTX 3060 seems to have a lower ray tracing core count than its predecessor. The memory bandwidth also doesn't seem to have made a significant jump. This means that the performance boost isn't quite pronounced as the other successor comparisons have shown us. The jump from the RTX 2060 to RTX 3060 thus makes less sense than upgrading to a slightly higher-tier card. Let's take a look at the real-world performance.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. RTX 2060 real-world performanceSource: NVIDIA (Image credit: Source: NVIDIA)The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 doesn't have a Founders Edition card. The real world performance comparisons thus will vary as per the configuration of AIB models, but the difference will not be too much.

If you want to enter the RTX arena at the lowest point possible, the RTX 3060 could be your card, but it doesn't make sense as an upgrade from the RTX 2060.Looking at the performance differences, the difference is not pronounced enough to warrant an upgrade. You do see some performance boost here, but it's barely something that should make you want to sell your RTX 2060 and go hunting for an RTX 3060. Both the cards are 1080p cards, with the RTX 3060 giving a slight edge at 1440p.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 2060 still holds up well for a 1080p GPU that can do some ray tracing, so much so that NVIDIA is actually bringing it back into production to fill out the lower mid-range of GPUs, which is suffering due to the stock shortages. This is another indicator that the card is still relevant when it comes to decent mid-range performance.So should you upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 from RTX 2070?No. The RTX 3060 is a good card by itself, but it's not a worthy upgrade from the RTX 2060. The RTX 3060 is also very hard to get your hands on right now, due to supply issues, just like any of the best graphics cards out there right now.The other thing to consider here is that even if you were to find an RTX 3060 in stock, you would have to spend so much for an AIB card that you could just get an RTX 3060 Ti, or even an RTX 3070. Given the amount of effort needed to track restocks and be able to grab an RTX 30 GPU at an acceptable price, the RTX 3060 just doesn't seem like a worthy upgrade.The performance jump from the RTX 2060 to the RTX 3060 isn't worth the upgrade, but if you badly want an upgrade to the RTX 2060, you should be looking at the RTX 3070 instead. In our NVIDIA RTX 3070 review, we called it the perfect 1440p card, which makes it an ideal upgrade from the RTX 2060. If you're set on a 3060 Series card, you might want to pick the 3060 Ti instead, which is a better upgrade by all means.All of this is provided you can grab an NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU at an acceptable price. If you're still on 1080p and not planning a major upgrade, you should be holding on to that RTX 2060 until the demand and supply situation for new silicon gets sorted.\n\n\n\nRTX 30 budget pick\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060\n\n\n $386.43 at Amazon $411.45 at Amazon $699 at Walmart\nDecent entry into the world of ray tracingThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 is the cheapest RTX 30 graphics card you can buy right now, and it does make a decent value proposition. However, it isn't nearly as good of a value as the RTX 3060 Ti or the RTX 3070, nor does it offer enough performance jump from the RTX 2060 to be a recommended upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast-gen budget RTX\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060\n\n\n $569 at Amazon $901.99 at Walmart $1,048 at Walmart\nHolds up wellThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 is the last-gen entry-level RTX card, and while it's no miracle-worker, it holds up well. It does an okay job at 1080p, and gives a peek into the ray tracing goodness. As such, it's not due for such a small upgrade as the RTX 3060, and worth owning right now, barring a big planned system upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nCPU GPU Components\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nPalash VolvoikarSocial Links Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST ARTICLES1Intel's new XeSS 2 tech includes an answer to AMD and NVIDIA's \"Frame Generation\" GPU techniques that boost in-game FPS2I upgraded a million-dollar live streaming camera setup with this $50 game controller3I just found 7 top game deals cheaper than the Steam Spring Sale \u2014 Save money on these must-play titles4Xbox's new gaming Copilot AI would have been better with Kinect \u2014 there, I said it5The day is almost here when every gaming handheld can be a Steam Deck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Central is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The latest to join the ranks is AMD's Radeon RX 6700 XT, which you can read about over in our Radeon RX 6700 XT review. Most of what I'm talking about in this article is really coming from there through the power of paraphrasing anyways, but I wanted to give a quick and easy answer to the most pressing question facing a prospective PC gamer with $500 to spend: Should I buy an AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070?Both cards have an MSRP under $500, the RX 6700 XT arrives at $479 and the RTX 3070 a little more at $499, but to quote my grandmother: 'chance would be a fine thing'. Indeed, we're all snapping up any opportunity to pick up a graphics card, no questions asked, due to the rarity of pixel-pushing silicon.So I'll get this out of the way early on: If you're in the market and lucky enough to spot a Radeon RX 6700 XT available to purchase you should absolutely go for it. It's a really solid performer and its generous 12GB GDDR6 VRAM will see you happily gaming for years to come. It's worth taking a punt at launch, at least, if only because the launch window is your best chance of finding this card listed at MSRP.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT review (Asus Prime OC)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Founders Edition review\n\n\n\nIf you're reading long after the RX 6700 XT launch, when all semblance of MSRP is out of the window and you're unsure which graphics card you should commit time to chasing down, let's get into the price and performance to see where your money is best spent.There are third-party options available for both of these cards, and that'll see the price disparity between the two entirely close up model-to-model. It's nominally $20 between the MSRP of the two but if you're prepared to spend $500 on a graphics card, or near enough, I'm going to guess that another $20 may not be a deal-breaker for you anyways. So let's say the price isn't a huge factor when deciding between these two.(Image credit: Future)Swipe to scroll horizontallyAMD Radeon RX 6700 XT vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 specsHeader Cell - Column 0 RX 6700 XTRTX 3070GPUNavi 22GA104ArchitectureRDNA 2AmpereLithographyTSMC 7nmSamsung 8nmBoost clock2,581MHz1,725MHzMemory capacity12GB GDDR68GB GDDR6Memory bus192-bit256-bitTGP230W220WPrice$479$499So ultimately it comes down to a question of performance (when does it not). I've picked out a few key battlegrounds to highlight where these cards roughly line up across 1080p, 1440p, and 4K. You can check out even more comparisons in the aforementioned review, but you should be able to piece together a good idea of what to expect here.F1 2020The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Total War: Three KingdomsImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)Shadow of the Tomb RaiderImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)As you can see in the graphs above, the RTX 3070 is the faster of the two cards by some margin. The Radeon manages to keep hot on the RTX 3070's tail for the better part of 1080p, and even jump past it in the more favourable F1 2020, yet as soon as you creep up to 1440p and 4K the gap between the two grows. The GeForce is out in the lead by some 15 percent in a few games.It's worth considering a few other factors when it comes to performance. The first one\u2014the impact of which will vary on your graphical preferences and choice of game\u2014is when considering real-time ray tracing workloads Nvidia's finessed ray tracing solution actually proves itself even more capable than AMD's. Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is another victory for the green team here as well, as while AMD has its library of FidelityFX features, such as Content Adaptive Sharpening, DLSS is widely supported and able to significantly improve framerates for a rather minimal loss in fidelity (depending on the game at hand).Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)There's something on the way from AMD in this department, though, a true competitor to DLSS. The company has promised it will arrive this year, 2021, it's just not ready yet. So if you opt for the red team card, you will find some improvements in what AMD calls FidelityFX Super Resolution, we just don't know when or to what extent.What AMD has in its quiver that Nvidia does not at this price is 12GB of GDDR6 memory. That's what you'll find on the Radeon RX 6700 XT, while the RTX 3070 has only 8GB of VRAM.This is a bit of a sticking point. While we can't say what a 6GB RX 6700 XT may perform like, we're certainly not seeing that 12GB of memory be some magical salve for 1440p and 4K performance. It will certainly help to some degree but how much, we don't know. What it might be important for, though, is the future of gaming. Yes, that ephemeral promise of future-proofing and planning for games that have not yet been announced. You've got to love it.The 12GB of VRAM on the RX 6700 XT is certainly a more comfortable bet for the next few years of gaming than the 8GB found on the RTX 3070. Although it relies on accessing that larger stash of memory via a smaller 192-bit bus and a new feature with RDNA 2 called Infinity Cache. Meanwhile, the RTX 3070 sticks to a more traditional, larger 256-bit bus. I won't dive into the specifics of all of this (once again, all in the review) but just know it's not quite a cut-and-dried case.More memory is welcome, however, so the RX 6700 XT takes the win.A look at the features on offer with either card and it's safe to say that both Nvidia and AMD offer a lot with their software package. AMD's Adrenalin Software is extensive and its latest overhaul has more of that at your fingertips than ever. I'm currently using an AMD card in my personal PC and the Instant GIF functionality built-in to the AMD software has made sharing throwaway gaming clips a breeze.(Image credit: Future)On the other hand, Nvidia has kitted out its GeForce Experience software bundle over the years, what with ShadowPlay and all that. It recently added a few new features, too, such as Broadcast, a collection of tools useful for beaming your voice and face onto the internet.It's a pretty handy tool, especially if you find yourself gaming in loud spaces or just have an overly eager to hoover housemate.So there are positives both ways here. I really don't feel like I've been missing much since switching from Nvidia's software to AMD's software, beyond the automatic replay function in some games, so I'm calling this one a tie\u2014before I end up spending 4,000 words nailing down the pros and cons of both.\u00a0Both Nvidia and AMD also offer support for cutting-edge APIs and game dev tools, so that's pretty neat.Decisions, decisions. Well, no, I think we have a clear victor here, and I'm sure you took one look at those graphs and came to the same conclusion. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 is the better buy. We're suckers for PC performance above all else here at PC Gamer, and it's the card that delivers the most bang for your buck at its intended price.That's not to diminish what the Radeon RX 6700 XT offers for the right price and, most importantly, if you can get one anything close to MSRP. It's still a superb card with one of the best architectures AMD's delivered in recent memory. It's great, it's just pipped to the post by the more performant Nvidia option. At least they're close enough that you could easily opt for the AMD card without buyer's remorse should you have good reason to.(Image credit: Future)AMD RX 6700 XT vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\u00a0Just wanted to drop in a small mention of how the RX 6700 XT fares versus the cheaper RTX 3060 Ti.\u00a0At $399, you'd expect the card to fall quite a bit behind the Radeon RX 6700 XT, a $479 card, but it tends to stick within single digits of the pricier Radeon. So if you're wondering whether you should skim some off your build elsewhere and put it towards the RX 6700 XT, that decision is probably not going to net you the biggest gains. You'd be better off saving for the RTX 3070 in that case or making sure you're building a more balanced, well-rounded PC build with the cheaper card.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nRadeon\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

That feature will allow the upgraded Nintendo Switch to output 4K visuals when docked and plugged into a TV, the report says.The new Switch, which has not been officially announced by Nintendo, will reportedly include a 7-inch OLED screen with 720p resolution, and could cost upward of $399.99, analysts told Bloomberg. The current version of the Nintendo Switch sells for its original launch price of $299.99, while the Switch Lite (pictured above) sells for $199.99.The addition of DLSS would be a boon for new games and developers. Nvidia\u2019s technology uses AI to accelerate graphics rendering through image reconstruction, maintaining high image quality while delivering improved frame rates. Put simply, it allows a video card to render a game at a lower internal resolution \u2014 reducing the load on the GPU \u2014 as it uses Nvidia\u2019s AI algorithm to generate a reconstructed image that looks as good as (or, in some cases, better than) the game rendered at native resolution.Previously, developers had to work directly with Nvidia to support DLSS in their games, leading to limited support of the feature. But a recent change to Epic Games\u2019 widely used Unreal Engine added support for the technology as a plug-in for the game development toolkit.Nintendo\u2019s new Switch revision will reportedly be released later this year, in time for the holidays.See More: GamingNewsNintendoMost PopularBrandon Sanderson shared a list of his 10 favorite games, and they make perfect senseBring back the 2000s-era sci-fi flopbusterThere will likely never be a Hunger Games sequel, says Suzanne Collins\u2019 editorThe Lord of the Rings illustrated box set is on sale for its lowest price everWorld of Warcraft players are flocking to taverns with their altsPatch NotesThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

This is completely in contradiction to another filing made by Gigabyte last year that initially mentioned the 20GB VRAM.AMD vs Nvidia: which should be your next graphics card?Where to buy Nvidia RTX 3080: find stock hereWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCThe listing was published to Twitter by established leaker @KOMACHI_ENSAKA, which also seemingly confirms the cards will use GDDR6X memory.[EEC] GIGABYTE RTX 3080Ti Series. https://t.co/WTTOyKFlcT>12GB. pic.twitter.com/NzrHlGb3EzMarch 29, 2021As usual, take speculated information with a seriously healthy amount of skepticism. Rumors have been floating around about the RTX 3080 Ti for months with no official announcement from Nvidia, so until we hear confirmation from the official source we shouldn't get our hopes up.\n\nIn fact, there is still suspicion that the RTX 3080 Ti has been scrapped entirely \u2013 hardly the biggest conclusion to leap to, given GeForce RTX 3090s have been spotted with scratched out RTX 3080 Ti SKUs.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5060 Ti GPU with 16GB rumored for March launch, followed by 8GB flavor in April \u2013 but where does that leave the vanilla RTX 5060?\n\n\n\n\nIgnore that Nvidia RTX 5060 rumor claiming 16GB VRAM \u2013 it\u2019s fake, and I\u2019m still worried about how the purported 8GB GPU will perform\n\n\n\nWill 12GB be enough?If 12GB sounds disappointing then it may be worth remembering that the RTX 3080 Ti is likely going to be marketed as a gaming GPU rather than something for productivity. After all, 20GB is a lot of VRAM, much more than what's required for even the most demanding AAA games right now.\n\nThe RTX 3090 \u00a0is something of a replacement (or at least an additional choice) for the Nvidia Titan range of graphics cards aimed at creative professionals, so matching the Nvidia Titan RTX's 24GB of VRAM makes sense. It would seem the upcoming RTX 3080 Ti isn't intended as a hybrid gaming/professional GPU now that the memory is being dropped, but hopefully, this will at least keep the price affordable.Anyway, 12GB is still better than the 10GB of VRAM on the original GeForce RTX 3080, but pricing will be what makes or breaks this launch \u2013 if the product is even going to be released. Let's keep our fingers crossed that the ongoing shortage is somewhat alleviated by then so we actually have a chance to get our hands on one.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for youVia Tom's GuideGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

Please enable Javascript in order to access all the functionality of this web site. Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is taking visual fidelity in computer graphics to a new level, and spearheading this revolution is NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling technology.\nDLSS uses AI to turn lower resolution rendered images into higher resolution ones. It gives users the performance of rendering at lower resolution while maintaining the visual quality of higher resolution.\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs feature dedicated AI processors, called Tensor Cores, that enable DLSS to run on rendered images in real time.\nThe gaming industry quickly adopted DLSS with titles such as Minecraft RTX, Fortnite and Cyberpunk 2077 seeing up to 2x frame-rate boosts from the technology.\nNow, the content creation industry is deploying this technology to enhance all kinds of workflows, including virtual production, architectural visualization, animated films, product design, simulations and data generation.\nLeading creative developers such as 51 World, Goodbye Kansas Studios, Hyundai Motors, Lucasfilm\u2019s Industrial Light & Magic, Orca Studios and Surreal Film Productions are taking advantage of DLSS to boost performance and realize their creative visions.\nTaking Virtual Productions to the Next Level\nFilm, TV and YouTube projects are increasingly using virtual production techniques as studios and artists are under immense pressure to iterate as quickly as possible and keep the cameras rolling.\nBy adding DLSS to the virtual production pipeline of HYPERBOWL, NSYNK has seen big increases in render performance, nearly doubling frame rates even with real-time ray-tracing effects, a previously impossible combination. DLSS also provided a cleaner and more stable image compared to even full-resolution anti-aliasing techniques.\n\u201cDLSS is game-changing, as it improves render results while lowering performance cost. It has become an integral part of our render pipeline,\u201d said Dennis Boleslawski, head of virtual production at HYPERBOWL.\n  \nCourtesy of Parasol Island GmbH and HYPERBOWL.\nAt Orca Studios, DLSS has also become an essential part of the real-time rendering setup for virtual production. With the high resolution of their LED walls and the ray-tracing-based renders needed for realistic lighting, DLSS is Orca Studios\u2019 go-to render configuration.\n\u201cDLSS is a really powerful way in which we\u2019re bringing the more demanding Unreal Engine renders to a high enough performance/noise ratio needed for live virtual production,\u201d said Adrian Pueyo, virtual production supervisor at Orca Studios.\n \n  \nCourtesy of Orca Studios.\nBringing Architectural Visualizations to Life\nWith DLSS and RTX-accelerated ray tracing, architects can showcase designs in full fidelity before construction even begins, reducing the stress and uncertainty that formerly surrounded projects.\nDLSS has allowed Away Digital Home to increase their frame rates by up to 50 percent and elevate the visual fidelity of their interactive walkthroughs by using full ray tracing for their Porter Davis homes. This dramatically speeds up their workflow by eliminating the time consumed by light baking.\n\u201cDLSS enables higher quality and faster frame rates to create an unprecedented visual experience for homebuyers with almost no extra development time at our end,\u201d said Paul Hellawell, project lead at Away Digital Home.\n\nWaldorf Grange 44. Courtesy of Away Digital Home.\nD5 Render was the first application focused on architectural visualization to integrate DLSS. With this free toolkit, architects and designers can easily import and modify their models, create light studies using ray tracing, and render high-quality images or video flythroughs of scenes accelerated by NVIDIA RTX and DLSS.\n\u201cDLSS fundamentally enhances the performance of D5 Render\u2019s ray-traced features, doubling the frame rates in the real-time interactive mode while expediting the final render exporting speeds by 100 percent,\u201d said Zeping Niu, founder of D5 Render. \u201cIt allows architects to handle large building models smoothly so they can design efficiently.\u201d\n\nYuase digital art studio. Courtesy of D5 Render.\nBringing Product Design to Life\nCar design is a complex and lengthy process, one that needs to take into account every little detail. Hyundai tested DLSS in their simulator running on an NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPU and found a sizable performance increase without any visible quality deterioration. Incorporating DLSS into their product development process will allow the vehicle maker to make more informed decisions and save valuable resources in the long run.\n\u201cOur car configurator and driving simulator uses real-time ray tracing and DLSS,\u201d said HongYong Kim, senior research engineer in the virtual vehicle verification team at Hyundai Motors. \u201cDLSS allowed us to pixel stream our application at a steady 60 frames per second while maintaining quality, which is a 50 percent boost in performance.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Hyundai Motors.\nARCWARE built a 3D configurator called ArcStation for Conform, a Swedish furniture brand specializing in a line of chairs that are highly configurable with hundreds of different fabrics, leathers and wood. By implementing DLSS, ArcStation users can see ray-traced reflections on a 4K screen at 60 frames per second, and ARCWARE no longer needs to cut back on the visual fidelity and output resolution.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s game-changing DLSS technology enables high-fidelity 3D non-gaming experiences. These range from POS and digital signage solutions, to the ability to stream previously impossible 3D experiences to customers over the web,\u201d said Manolis Emmanouilidis, chief technical artist at ARCWARE. \u201cDLSS enables ARCWARE to deliver stunning 3D experiences to our customers. It is most exciting, enabling a visual quality that was once thought as impossible.\u201d\n\nArcStation. Courtesy of ARCWARE.\nThese are just a few examples of how the rapid adoption of DLSS across industries is revolutionizing content creation. See what other adopters are saying here.\nFor app developers, DLSS is now available in mainline Unreal Engine as a plugin, compatible with UE 4.26 on the Unreal Engine Marketplace. To access the full DLSS SDK for custom engine integrations, visit the NVIDIA DLSS developer page.\nDLSS is accelerated by a broad range of NVIDIA products, from professional design and visualization solutions for enterprises to Studio PCs and laptops for creators.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nMore potential evidence has emerged to support the rumors that Nvidia will announce a GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, this time in the form of a leaked benchmark, supposedly testing a Samsung 760XDA laptop with an Intel Core i7-11800H CPU.A well-known leaker by the Twitter handle TUM_APISAK discovered the benchmark in Geekbench that seemingly reveals the existence of the currently-unannounced GPU, and gives some insight into what specifications we could expect from the product.Where to buy Nvidia RTX 3080: find stock hereThese are all the\u00a0best PC gamesWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PCIt was previously hinted that the RTX 3050 Ti would have 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM, something seemingly backed up this latest batch of information, with this latest leak also alleging the GPU will have 2560 CUDA cores. \n\nAs with any unsubstantiated rumors, we need to take this with an unhealthy portion of salt, but if proven true then we could shortly see the arrival of a fourth addition to the Nvidia 3000 series mobile GPU lineup alongside the RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 laptop graphics cards.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAsus gaming laptops leak with RTX 5090, 5080 and 5070 Ti GPUs, sparking excitement about a CES 2025 reveal\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5050 spotted in HP Victus 15, another hint that Nvidia has a mobile GPU to pep up affordable gaming laptops\n\n\n\nRTX 3050 Ti LaptopOpenCL Score - 60559https://t.co/djQR6mBcRC pic.twitter.com/sbERp4W10ZMarch 17, 2021Affordable mobile ray tracingRumors about both Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 have been floating around for quite some time now, but given this is a laptop benchmark it's unclear if the desktop counterpart of this anticipated GPU will follow the same specifications.\n\nThis will potentially give some extra variety for the budget end of gaming laptops that have been long dominated by the Nvidia GTX 1660, and could offer up a ray-tracing capable mobile GPU that won't break the bank. This would also be the first graphics card to include ray tracing to a GPU below the usual 60 series, with the previous baseline being the RTX 2060.\n\nThis is sadly unlikely to solve the overall GPU shortage we're seeing, with everything from production problems to cryptominers being blamed for the lack of available hardware. Indeed, it does raise the question of why these cards are being created at all in this current climate when so few gamers are likely to get their hands on one?\n\nThe appeal of a new budget GPU for both desktop and mobile is certainly apparent, but we'll have to hold our breath until Nvidia officially announces them.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $38.99View $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesFind the best Nvidia GPU for youGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

See our ethics statement.Image: NvidiaNick Statt is a Senior Producer on Decoder. Previously, he reported on the technology and gaming industries for more than a decade.Nvidia on Thursday announced a new subscription tier for its GeForce Now cloud gaming service called Priority that will replace its existing paid Founders tier and contain the same perks like extended session length and RTX support. The catch: the change will come with a price increase, from what used to be a $4.99-per-month subscription to what will now be a $9.99-per-month one for new subscribers. Nvidia will also start offering a $99.99-per-year Priority subscription.However, those who had active memberships as of yesterday, March 17th, will be eligible for the Founders pricing for life, Nvidia says, which comes out to a little less than $60 per year. The company still plans to offer a free tier of GeForce Now, too, but that tier restricts you to a one-hour session length. Nvidia says the price hike is meant to represent the platform\u2019s evolution since it launched in beta way back in 2015 and entered what Nvidia has referred to as a public testing phase a year ago.\u201cAs GeForce Now enters year two, and rapidly approaches 10 million members, the service is ready to kick things up a notch,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cGeForce Now launched out of beta last February with Founders memberships \u2014 a limited time, promotional plan. On Thursday, Founders memberships will close to new registrations and Priority memberships, the new premium offering, will be introduced.\u201dImage: NvidiaThose who have tried out GeForce Now with a Founders subscription but let that subscription lapse may be displeased to find out that Nvidia does not intend to give the $4.99-per-month pricing to anyone who may have been a paying subscriber in the recent past, even if you let your subscription lapse a few days ago. You\u2019ll need to have been an active, paying Founders member as of yesterday, and you\u2019ll also need to keep the membership active to continue paying the reduced price. If you cancel, you\u2019ll lose the promotion for good.\u201cMembers need to be subscribed to the Founders membership as of 3/17/2021, and keep their membership in good standing, to be eligible for the benefit. If you were previously a Founders member but downgraded, unfortunately you\u2019re not eligible,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson clarified to The Verge.To its credit, Nvidia hasn\u2019t sold monthly memberships for some time now, instead selling a promotional six-month bundle for $24.99. That makes it less likely that someone who subscribed any time in the last few months will find themselves ineligible for this Founders pricing perk.Nvidia intends to continue upping its investment in the platform as it\u2019s proved quite successful, with close to 10 million members, in the otherwise struggling cloud gaming scene. Most recently, Google closed down its in-house game development studios creating titles for its Stadia service, while Amazon\u2019s Luna platform remains in beta.The Founders is gone for good, replaced by the $9.99 Priority subscriptionGeForce Now differs from those platforms by letting members stream games they\u2019ve already purchased from Epic, Steam, and other digital distributors over the cloud. The service\u2019s paid tier launch last year was a bumpy one after high-profile publishers like Activision Blizzard and 2K Games pulled their libraries, the dispute caused by Nvidia streaming those companies\u2019 games without explicit permission.Since then, Nvidia has switched to an opt-in model to court game makers to the platform on friendlier terms, a strategy that\u2019s paid off as Nvidia has added roughly 10 new games to the platform every week. The company now has a full list of supported titles on its website, a welcome addition after the rocky licensing fallout of last spring.Nvidia says the tech will keep improving over time, while its \u201cGFN Thursday\u201d new game onboarding will jump from 10 new titles added per week to 15 by the end of the year. GeForce Now will later this month get support for Adaptive Vsync, which \u201csynchronizes frame rates at 60 or 59.94 Hz server-side to match the display client-side, reducing stutter and latency on supported games,\u201d the company explains. Nvidia says it\u2019s also releasing a \u201cnew adaptive de-jitter technology\u201d to increase bit rates for games streamed over slower networks. (Nvidia could not, however, provide a timeline for when the platform will support 4K streaming when asked.)Other benefits coming soon include account linking for games with cross-platform support and improvements to preloading to cut down load times by half, both coming in the next one to two months. Nvidia says it\u2019s also adding data center capacity in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as bringing online its first Canadian data center in Montreal later this year, both of which will help reduce wait times.As for the company\u2019s iOS beta, which launched back in November, Nvidia didn\u2019t have much new to share. But a company spokesperson did say that \u201call previously announced projects continue to be on the roadmap in collaboration with the team at Epic,\u201d referencing the ongoing work to bring Epic\u2019s Fortnite back to the iPhone and iPad via GeForce Now on the mobile web after it was banned by Apple and Google last summer.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nTake one look at the Nvidia RTX 3060 12GB and Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti and you'd assume some parity between the two. They both share a name, an architecture, and reside under $400 (just). But make no mistake, these cards couldn't be much more different, at least not while still flying under the same 30-series banner.If you're familiar with the specifications of these two chips, you'll already know where this will end up. But if you're just starting to look into your next GPU upgrade, you might be a little uncertain as to which of these two cards is your best bet.The RTX 3060 Ti is a $399 card that comes with the GA104 GPU, which is effectively the same silicon as the desktop RTX 3070 but pared back for the cheaper option. The top configuration of this chip, with a heady 6,144 CUDA Cores, is found in the mobile RTX 3080. So we're talking about a chip that exists, in some fashion, from the RTX 3060 Ti to the RTX 3080.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nAn ode to the RTX 4090 and why high-end GPUs can sometimes be the best value\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti review (MSI Ventus 3X)\n\n\n\nFor our humble RTX 3060 Ti we're looking at a more modest 4,864 CUDA Cores. Yet even coming in at the lower end of the spectrum does have its benefits. Namely memory bandwidth, TMUs, and ROPs. I won't get into all the specifics, but this is all stuff that the RTX 3060 Ti has in swathes, and more than you might expect for a card of its price.The 256-bit bus attached to the larger GA104 die allows the RTX 3060 Ti to offer 448GB/s bandwidth total.Which brings me onto the brand new RTX 3060 12GB for $329. This graphics card is built atop the new GA106 GPU, which comes with a maximum of 30 SMs and 3,840 CUDA Cores. That full specification is available only in the mobile RTX 3060, while we're looking at a trim 3,584 CUDA Cores on desktop.Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia RTX 3060 12GB vs Nvidia RTX 3060 TiHeader Cell - Column 0 RTX 3060 12GBRTX 3060 TiCUDA Cores3,5844,864SMs2838Boost Clock (GHz)1.781.67Base Clock (GHz)1.321.41Tensor Cores112152RT Cores2838ROPs4880TMUs112152Memory12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6Memory bus192-bit256-bitMemory bandwidth360GB/s448GB/sPrice (MSRP)$329$399The memory bandwidth is also a slimmer 192-bit configuration, which makes for 360GB/s in available bandwidth.\u00a0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.So while we're looking at 8GB of GDDR6 on the RTX 3060 Ti, a slight reduction on that found on the RTX 3060 12GB, the greater bandwidth of the Ti card means the memory is more widely available to the GPU in operation.The two cards offer vastly different performance as a result, too. In our testing, at 1440p, we're seeing the RTX 3060 Ti delivering 35 percent higher frame rates on average. That's not a bad return for a card with a 21 percent higher price tag.Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)With the arrival of the RTX 3060 12GB, we're steadily drifting away from the expensive high-end graphics cards and into some more affordable garb. Creeping ever closer to that point where no matter your budget, you can pick up the latest silicon.And that's absolutely a much better position to be in for all PC builders, at least once GPUs aren't so hard to come by and prices no longer inflated.But when it comes to a choice between the two, don't be fooled by the larger memory capacity on the cheaper card. It's not a golden goose for gaming performance at that grade, even if it's a nice touch for a card that may have felt a little slim with only 6GB of VRAM.I appreciate that 'buy the better graphics card' hardly seems like expert advice, and even less so at a time when you'll have to move quick to secure either option at MSRP. But if you're not sure whether your next upgrade should be the 12GB RTX 3060 or 8GB RTX 3060 Ti, saving that little bit more, or smartly pulling $70 from elsewhere in your budget, for the RTX 3060 Ti will go a long way in increasing your gaming PC's overall gaming performance.\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

I've also volunteered with a cat rescue for over 15 years doing adoptions, designing marketing materials, managing volunteers and, of course, photographing cats. Expertise Photography | PCs and laptops | Gaming and gaming accessories   See full bio    Lori Grunin    \n  March 18, 2021  6:19 a.m. PT             Lori Grunin/CNET   For the one-year anniversary of its cloud \n  gaming\n service, GeForce Now, \n  Nvidia\n has settled on post-promotional pricing for its subscription plan. Dubbed \"Priority membership,\" the plan replaces the existing $5-a-month Founders membership with the identical benefits. Members get priority access in the queue to reach the servers, support for Nvidia's RTX ray-tracing and continuous sessions longer than an hour for $10 a month or $100 a year. Existing Founders subscribers will be able to continue at the $5 monthly rate with a renamed Founders for Life plan.At a time when graphics cards are harder to buy than a PS5 (and for a lot more money), GeForce Now is looking more attractive than usual. Because it works with \n  PC games\n rather than proprietary ports of them (a la Google Stadia), you can buy and play games while waiting for GPU prices and stock to return to normal without losing progress, achievements or other important gameplay time investments. As long as your game is supported by GeForce Now, that is.The company is also rolling out some updates it says will improve quality, such as compensating for inconsistent network performance and implementing a server-side adaptive sync technology which can set the frame rate to match either 60Hz or 59.94Hz monitor refresh rates. Nvidia also says account linking for important games is coming within the next two months (no tedious, repetitive logins!) along with much faster game loading.See also Best Gaming Laptops for 2022Best Cheap Gaming Laptop Under $1,000 to Get in 2022Best Gaming Desktops for 2022    \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                         Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

That feature, of course, is Resizable BAR (Base Address Register), a PCI Express technology that promises to give gaming a boost in framerates on supported platforms.\n\n\nIn simple terms, Resizable BAR allows the CPU and system to tap into a graphics card's full memory frame buffer over the PCIe bus, instead of capping it to 256MB increments. The technology has actually been around for several years, but was not really utilized until AMD introduced its Radeon RX 6000 series, with Smart Access Memory (SAM) support. The caveat is that AMD's implementation only works with its own CPUs.\n\n\nNVIDIA's implementation, however, is CPU agnostic\u2014it works with both AMD and Intel platforms. You do need a compatible motherboard and graphics card, either or both of which might require a BIOS update, depending on the vendor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\"As you move through a world in a game, GPU memory (VRAM) constantly transfers textures, shaders and geometry via many small CPU to GPU transfers.\r\nWith the ever-growing size of modern game assets, this results in a lot of transfers. Using Resizable BAR, assets can instead be requested as-needed and sent in full, so the CPU can efficiently access the entire frame buffer. And if multiple requests are made, transfers can occur concurrently, rather than queuing,\" NVIDIA explains.\nGeForce RTX 30 Series Graphics Cards Support Resizable BAR With A BIOS Update\nNVIDIA kicked off the Resizable BAR party with its regular (read: non-TI) GeForce RTX 3060, which shipped with a BIOS already supporting the feature. Anyone who purchased one of those cards need only pair it with a compatible motherboard and motherboard BIOS, and the latest Game Ready GPU driver, to take advantage of the feature.\n\n\nOther GeForce RTX 30 series cards, however, require a BIOS update, and both Gainward and Galax have begun rolling them out. There are some things to keep in mind, though. One is that updating a graphics card's BIOS can be a little scary if you have never done it before. Just as with updating your motherboard BIOS, you want to be sure not to power off your system in the middle of the process. Your best bet is to utilize a battery backup, just to avoid a power outage bricking your GPU in the middle of a BIOS update.\n\n\nYou also have to be sure you are grabbing the correct BIOS for your precise graphics card model. The BIOS updates being served up at the moment apply to certain models offered in China, and not international SKUs.\n\n\nThat said, here are the download links (proceed at your own risk)...\n\n\nGainward GeForce RTX 3090: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\nGainward GeForce RTX 3080: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\nGainward GeForce RTX 3070: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\nGainward GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\n\n\nGalax GeForce RTX 3090: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\nGalax GeForce RTX 3080: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\nGalax GeForce RTX 3070: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\nGalax GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: BIOS w/ Resizable BAR\n\nA user on Reddit (El-Maximo-Bango) claims to have flashed the BIOS on their Galaxy GeForce RTX 3090 SG with success, and shared the following screenshot showing Resizable BAR is activated...\n\n\nSource: Reddit (El-Maximo-Bango)\n\n\n\nWe've highlighted the relevant field in the lower-right section of the the GPU-Z screenie, showing Resizable BAR is working. If everything goes as it should, that is what you should see after updating your graphics card's BIOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also check that it is working by opening up the NVIDIA Control Panel and clicking on System Information in the bottom-left corner.

They tend to be the best-selling card of a GeForce generation. This time around, graphics cards are mired in a months-long shortage driven by a mixture of sky-high demand, logistics woes caused by the pandemic, a cryptocurrency boom that\u2019s driving miners to gobble up GPUs, and some component shortages. Nvidia also priced this card higher than historical norms (the beloved GTX 1060 this card hopes to replace launched at $80 less). It\u2019s a perfect storm, and things are so bad that Nvidia brought the ancient GTX 1050 Ti out of retirement.\n\nBut put all that aside. How does Nvidia\u2019s new GPU actually handle? The company sent us an EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming to determine just that. This entry-level spin on the GPU is priced at the RTX 3060\u2019s $329 MSRP (again, in theory).\u00a0If we had to describe the graphics card in one word? It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay. That said, there are some key under-the-hood features definitely worth noting.\nBefore we wade into pages of benchmark results, if you want a faster, easier-to-read analysis of the card, be sure to check out our complementary coverage, GeForce RTX 3060: 5 key things you need to know about Nvidia\u2019s new GPU. Now let\u2019s dig in.\n\n\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nGeForce RTX 3060 specs, features, and price\nIn an unusual turn of events, Nvidia released the step-up GeForce RTX 3060 Ti before the base RTX 3060, and that Ti version is a spectacular 1440p gaming option. The more affordable (in theory) GeForce RTX 3060 more closely targets no-compromises 1080p gaming, though 1440p gaming is certainly possible in most cases. The non-Ti RTX 3060 uses a totally different GPU\u2014the smaller GA106 graphics chip, rather than the beefier GA104 chip found in the Ti model and the $500 RTX 3070. Because of that, while the RTX 3060 and 3060 Ti share the same name, they\u2019re wildly different under the hood.\nHere\u2019s how the GeForce RTX 3060 stacks up technically against the RTX 3060 Ti\u2026 \n Nvidia\n\u2026and last-generation\u2019s $350 GeForce RTX 2060.\n Nvidia\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 sports a slightly higher boost clock than its Ti cousin\u2014which matters during gaming sessions that load up the GPU\u2014but dramatically fewer CUDA cores. That drags the overall gaming performance far below the 3060 Ti\u2019s level, though the new graphics card remains competitive for the segments it targets.\n\nThe most interesting part of the RTX 3060\u2019s design is its memory. This GPU is paired with an ample 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, besting the 8GB of GDDR6 in the RTX 3060 Ti and 3070, and even the 10GB available in the beastly GeForce RTX 3080 (although that\u2019s of the much-faster GDDR6X variety). It\u2019s clear that AMD\u2019s decision to load up its new Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards with plenty of memory caught Nvidia by surprise. The 192-bit memory bus on the RTX 3060 can handle either 6GB or 12GB capacities, and we suspect the RTX 3060 was originally intended to receive 6GB before AMD struck.\n Nvidia\n\nResizable BAR lets the CPU tap fully into the GPU\u2019s memory, offering performance gains in some scenarios.\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably the right choice from a marketing perspective\u2014AMD\u2019s forthcoming Radeon RX 6700 XT will indeed come with 12GB of its own\u2014but practically, it\u2019s a bit weird. The big 12GB memory buffer is overkill for the 1080p gaming Nvidia claims this card was built for. If you nudge games up to 1440p, you\u2019ll often need to reduce graphics settings to achieve 60 frames per second at that resolution, which similarly reduces memory demands. If this wasn\u2019t a rushed response to AMD\u2019s moves, 8GB of memory would suffice\u2013and cost less. Going with 6GB of memory would\u2019ve been too little now that some games are pushing the 8GB barrier more regularly, however, so as-is, we\u2019re glad to see the RTX 3060 ship with 12GB. Overkill is better than undershooting!\nThe GeForce RTX 3060 is also Nvidia\u2019s first desktop graphics card to support the PCIe Resizable BAR feature, following in the footsteps of AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory (which is based around ReBAR). Resizable BAR lets your CPU see your graphics card\u2019s memory, rather than accessing it in 256MB chunks, which can result in performance gains on compatible systems. Most of those gains are modest, as we discovered testing Smart Access Memory on the RX 6900 XT, but they can go all the way to 10 percent or more in the right games, running the right graphics settings and resolutions. ReBAR\u2019s uplift is highly variable.\n Nvidia\nYou\u2019ll need a compatible CPU and motherboard to enable Resizable BAR support, however. AMD kicked it off with its Ryzen 5000 processors and X570/B550 motherboards, though compatibility has also come to a variety of Intel platforms via BIOS updates. The image above, taken from Nvidia\u2019s ReBAR explainer, shows which PC hardware currently supports the technology. Support varies from vendor to vendor and even motherboard to motherboard. If you want to use it, look for a compatible BIOS update for your specific motherboard. Currently, Nvidia activated ReBAR compatibility for only eight titles, so its usefulness is very limited. Nvidia says it will whitelist new games quickly. (AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory works with all games.)\n\nNvidia also added a hashrate limiter that cuts the performance of Ethereum mining in half, which should hopefully discourage cryptocurrency miners from snatching this up in droves. We\u2019ll see if it lasts.\nOf course, as a modern GeForce GPU, the RTX 3060 includes the latest ray tracing and tensor cores inside (we\u2019ll dig into that later), as well as support for all of Nvidia\u2019s wide range of value-adding features, such as Shadowplay, DLSS, Nvidia Broadcast, Nvidia Reflex, G-Sync, and more. For a deeper look at what\u2019s new in the RTX 30-series \u201cAmpere\u201d GPU architecture, check out our much more detailed explanation in the beginning of our RTX 3080 review.\nEVGA RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming design\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia isn\u2019t rolling out one of its snazzy Founders Edition models for the RTX 3060, relying instead on custom cards from its partners to carry the load in today\u2019s scorching-hot graphics card market. (GTX 1060 and RTX 2060 FE models hit the streets, for reference.) So the company sent over EVGA\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming for us to test.\nThe XC Black Gaming sticks to the RTX 3060\u2019s reference specs under the hood, which helps it hit the GPU\u2019s $329 retail price. That helps us evaluate the RTX 3060\u2019s baseline performance, though if previous RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series launches are any indication, we expect graphics card makers to put most of their focus (and manufacturing output) on pricier custom models, like EVGA\u2019s own overclocked, $390 RTX 3060 XC Gaming (no \u201cBlack\u201d). Most of the early custom RTX 3060 models available in stores cost closer to $500 even before scalpers get their hands on them. Don\u2019t expect to be able to find RTX 3060 cards on sale for $330 in reality while the current GPU crunch remains in effect.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nEVGA designed the XC Black Gaming well despite its MSRP pricing. As you\u2019ll see later, the card runs very cool and very quiet. Unlike most other custom RTX 30-series graphics cards, the XC Black Gaming sticks to a traditional two-slot thickness that should have no problem fitting into most PC cases, especially because the card measures a mere 7.94 inches in length\u2014well shorter than the usual 10.5 inches-plus. It also requires just a single 8-pin power connector, hooked up to a recommended power supply of 550 watts or more.\nCost-cutting measures can easily be spotted. The shroud is plastic, there\u2019s no RGB lighting to be found, and there\u2019s no backplate to hide circuitry. There is a cut-out in the PCB to allow air to flow through the heat sink and out of your card, however, following the new RTX 30-series trend. The lack of a backplate makes the EVGA XC Black Gaming a bit of an eyesore in an era where backplates have largely become the norm, but it\u2019s otherwise inoffensive aesthetically, with a blacked-out design. You\u2019ll find the standard RTX 30-series connection loadout\u2014one HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPorts\u2014on EVGA\u2019s card.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nEVGA supports its hardware with a warranty and customer service representatives beloved by the gaming community. If you want to put the dual-axial fans and four copper heatpipes to more work, the company\u2019s sublime Precision X1 GPU management software contains everything you need to monitor and overclock the card. The slickly designed program is one of our favorites.\nBut now the stage is set. Let\u2019s get to the benchmarks.\n\nNext page: Our test system, gaming benchmarks begin\n\n\nOur test system\nWe\u2019re in the process of moving to a new AMD Ryzen 5000-series test rig to be able to benchmark the effect of PCIe 4.0 support on modern GPUs, as well as the performance-boosting AMD Smart Access Memory and Nvidia Resizable BAR features (which are both based on the same underlying PCIe standard). Currently, we\u2019re testing it on an open bench with AMD\u2019s Wraith Max air cooler; in the future, we\u2019ll be moving the setup into a case and adding an NZXT Kraken liquid cooler to the mix. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settings\nAMD Wraith Max cooler\nMSI Godlike X570 motherboard\n32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory\nEVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply ($352 on\u00a0Amazon)\n1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti FTW3 Ultra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$699 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re comparing the $330 EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming against last generation\u2019s $350 Nvidia RTX 2060 Founders Edition, as well as the Founders Edition model of the newer $500 RTX 3070. We also included EVGA\u2019s overclocked, custom FTW3 Ultra version of the $400 RTX 3060 Ti as we didn\u2019t have Nvidia\u2019s FE card immediately on hand. Rounding things out, we also show benchmarks for AMD\u2019s $350 Radeon RX 5700 and $400 Radeon RX 5700 XT. We didn\u2019t have time to fully benchmark the $400 RTX 2060 Super FE and $500 RTX 2070 on the new system yet, alas.\nWe test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, and Vulkan). Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We\u2019ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits. We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test.\n\nWe won\u2019t be providing commentary for each game\u2019s results. For overall performance evaluations, check out our final \u201cShould you buy it?\u201d section of this review.\nGaming performance benchmarks\nWatch Dogs: Legion\nWatch Dogs: Legion\u00a0is one of the first games to debut on next-gen consoles. Ubisoft upgraded its Disrupt engine to include cutting-edge features like real-time ray tracing and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS. We disable those effects for this testing, but\u00a0Legion\u00a0remains a strenuous game even on high-end hardware with its optional high-resolution texture pack installed. The game allocates more than 8GB of memory even at 1440p. Oof.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nHorizon Zero Dawn\nYep, PlayStation exclusives are coming to the PC now.\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0runs on Guerrilla Games\u2019 Decima engine, the same engine that powers\u00a0Death Stranding. It launched in a rough state but handles much better now, and it\u2019s a looker.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\n\nGears Tactics\nGears Tactics\u00a0puts it own brutal, fast-paced spin on the\u00a0XCOM-like genre. This Unreal Engine 4-powered game was built from the ground up for DirectX 12, and we love being able to work a tactics-style game into our benchmarking suite. Better yet, the game comes with a plethora of graphics options for PC snobs. More games should devote such loving care to explaining what flipping all these visual knobs mean.\nYou can\u2019t use the presets to benchmark\u00a0Gears Tactics, as it intelligently scales to work best on your installed hardware, meaning that \u201cUltra\u201d on one graphics card can load different settings than \u201cUltra\u201d on a weaker card. We manually set all options to their highest possible settings.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\nWolfenstein: Youngblood\u00a0is more fun when you can play cooperatively with a buddy, but\u00a0it\u2019s a fearless experiment\u2014and an absolute technical showcase. Running on the Vulkan API,\u00a0Youngblood\u00a0achieves blistering frame rates, and it supports all sorts of cutting-edge technologies like ray tracing, DLSS 2.0, HDR, GPU culling, asynchronous computing, and Nvidia\u2019s Content Adaptive Shading. The game includes a built-in benchmark with two different scenes; we now test Riverside.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro Exodus\nOne of the best games of 2019,\u00a0Metro Exodus\u00a0remains one of the best-looking games around, too. The latest version of the 4A Engine provides incredibly luscious, ultra-detailed visuals, with one of the most stunning real-time ray tracing implementations released yet. The Extreme graphics preset we benchmark can melt even the most powerful modern hardware, as you\u2019ll see below, though the game\u2019s Ultra and High presets still look good at much higher frame rates.\n\nWe test in DirectX 12 mode with ray tracing, Hairworks, and DLSS disabled.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nBorderlands 3\nBorderlands\u00a0is back! Gearbox\u2019s game defaults to DX12, so we do as well. It gives us a glimpse at the ultra-popular Unreal Engine 4\u2019s performance in a traditional shooter. This game tends to favor AMD hardware.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nStrange Brigade\nStrange Brigade\u00a0is a cooperative third-person shooter where a team of adventurers blasts through hordes of mythological enemies. It\u2019s a technological showcase, built around the next-gen Vulkan and DirectX 12 technologies and infused with features like HDR support and the ability to toggle asynchronous compute on and off. It uses Rebellion\u2019s custom Azure engine. We test using the Vulkan renderer, which is faster than DX12.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: gaming benchmarks continue\n\n\n\nTotal War: Troy\nThe latest game in the popular\u00a0Total War\u00a0saga,\u00a0Troy\u00a0was given away free for its first 24 hours on the Epic Games Store, moving over 7.5 million copies before it went on proper sale.\u00a0Total War: Troy\u00a0is built using a modified version of the\u00a0Total War: Warhammer 2\u00a0engine, and this DX11 title looks stunning for a turn-based strategy game. We test the more intensive battle benchmark.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nF1 2020\nThe latest in a long line of successful racing games,\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0is a gem to test, supplying a wide array of both graphical and benchmarking options, making it a much more reliable (and fun) option that the\u00a0Forza\u00a0series. It\u2019s built on the latest version of Codemasters\u2019 buttery-smooth Ego game engine, complete with support for DX12 and Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. We test two laps on the Australia course, with clear skies on and DLSS off.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0concludes the reboot trilogy, and it\u2019s still utterly\u00a0gorgeous a couple of years after its debut. Square Enix optimized this game for DX12 and recommends DX11 only if you\u2019re using older hardware or Windows 7, so we test with DX12.\u00a0Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u00a0uses an enhanced version of the Foundation engine that also powered\u00a0Rise of the Tomb Raider\u00a0and includes optional real-time ray tracing and DLSS features.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRainbow Six Siege\nRainbow Six Siege\u00a0still dominates the Steam charts years after its launch, and Ubisoft supports it with frequent updates and events. The developers have poured a ton of work into the game\u2019s AnvilNext engine over the years, eventually rolling out a Vulkan version of the game that we use to test. By default, the game lowers the render scaling to increase frame rates, but we set it to 100 percent to benchmark native rendering performance on graphics cards. Even still, frame rates soar.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: RTX 3060 ray tracing performance\n\n\nRTX 3060 ray tracing performance\nWe also benchmarked the RTX 3060 in a handful of titles that support cutting-edge real-time ray tracing effects. While the newer AMD Radeon RX 6000-series GPUs now support ray tracing, older models don\u2019t, so we excluded the Radeon RX 5700 and 5700 XT from these results.\nNvidia holds a key advantage in ray-traced games thanks to its Deep Learning Super Sampling technology (DLSS), which leverages AI tensor cores embedded in RTX GPUs to internally render games at a lower resolution, then uprez them to your desired resolution using machine learning to fill in the gaps. DLSS 2.0 works like black magic and gives Nvidia a strong lead in ray tracing performance. Without it, you usually can\u2019t run ray-traced games above 1080p resolution.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Nvidia GPUs we included below all support DLSS, however, and we\u2019ve shown three results for each card: native performance with ray tracing off, native performance with ray tracing on, and performance when both ray tracing and DLSS are active.\n\nWe plan to expand our ray-traced game suite soon, but for now we\u2019re giving Watch Dogs: Legion, Metro: Exodus and Shadow of the Tomb Raider a whirl to put the capabilities to the test, with ray tracing options set to Ultra in each title. Legion packs ray-traced reflections, Tomb Raider includes ray-traced shadows, and Metro features more strenuous (and mood-enhancing) ray-traced global illumination.\nLet\u2019s kick things off with Shadow of the Tomb Raider\u2019s ray-traced shadows. The game includes the first-generation version of DLSS, which doesn\u2019t support 1080p resolution, so we\u2019ve stuck to raw ray tracing performance only there.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nMetro: Exodus uses ray tracing for global illumination. It also uses DLSS 1.0 and doesn\u2019t support the upscaling feature at 1080p, so we\u2019ve only included raw ray tracing performance on that chart.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWatch Dogs: Legion hammers your system regardless of whether you have ray tracing on, at least with the high-resolution texture pack installed. Activating the ray-traced reflections exacerbates the issue. Unlike Tomb Raider and Metro, Watch Dogs uses the faster, better DLSS 2.0 technology. We test it with DLSS Balanced mode active. Balanced lets you hit higher frame rates than the Quality mode, but the even faster Performance mode starts to introduce visual differences you can notice in some scenes. Balanced hits the sweet spot.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNext page: Power, thermals, and noise\n\n\nPower draw, thermals, and noise\nWe test power draw by looping the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we\u2019ve benchmarked everything else and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you\u2019re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming draws a bit more power than the RTX 2060, which makes sense given its slightly higher power requirements. This GPU\u2019s energy requirements aren\u2019t as staggering as they are for the higher-end RTX 30-series GPUs. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how AMD\u2019s eventual Radeon rivals will compare.\n\nInterestingly, Nvidia GPUs prevent the computer from fully going into idle in the five minutes of downtime we use for this test, though it does so after a longer duration. That\u2019s new to this Ryzen 5900X platform; we didn\u2019t see it on our old Intel-based testbeds, nor with AMD Radeon graphics cards installed. We\u2019ll have to change our methodology going forward and poke around the behavior to understand it more fully.\u00a0\nWe test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the\u00a0F1 2020\u00a0power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nEVGA\u2019s XC Black Gaming runs very quiet and impressively cool, taming the modest RTX 3060 GPU with ease. No complaints whatsoever. The blower-style coolers on the last-gen Radeon cards sure are warm and loud, though.\nNext page: Should you buy the GeForce RTX 3060?\n\n\n\nShould you buy the GeForce RTX 3060?\nIt\u2019s hard to recommend buying any graphics card right now. Overwhelming demand, supply woes, tariffs, scalpers, and cryptocurrency miners have sent availability plummeting and prices skyrocketing. Currently, a couple of weeks after launch, there is no stock available at any major etailer. Most custom models cost closer to $500 even before scalping begins. You can\u2019t blame the manufacturers for hopping on the gravy train, but if you wind up seeing any RTX 3060 going for $330 in the wild anytime near the publication date of this review, hop on it pronto.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nNvidia\u2019s pitching this as a replacement for the popular GTX 1060, which remains the most popular card on Steam\u2019s Hardware Survey. The GeForce RTX 3060 would be a significant upgrade over the GTX 1060.\u00a0That card launched at $250 though. Asking $330 for this upgrade is a big price increase even with ray tracing and DLSS capabilities added. Back in the day, the GTX 1060 could also play 1080p games without compromise, with the ability to play games at 1440p with some visual tweaks\u2014just like the RTX 3060.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe RTX 3060 Ti provides much more value\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,098 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nPaying $500-plus for a 60-class GeForce GPU is just madness. Go stream some games over GeForce Now instead, if you have a good Internet connection, and wait out this bloodbath. Nvidia\u2019s cloud gaming service hooks into existing PC platforms so you don\u2019t need to buy new games for it.\nIgnoring the terrible modern GPU market, if we evaluate the RTX 3060 based on MSRP alone, it\u2019s an uninspiring upgrade to the $350 RTX 2060. Its performance lands it in roughly the same territory as the $400 RTX 2060 Super or $500 RTX 2070. In many games, AMD\u2019s older Radeon RX 5700 XT beats it, while the non-XT 5700 hangs tough in several titles (though it\u2019s also smashed in others). Those launched at $400 and $350, respectively.\n\nAfter seeing how far the pricier RTX 30-series pushed performance past their predecessors, the RTX 3060\u2019s results are a bit deflating. We would\u2019ve liked it much more at $300 or even less, but given today\u2019s surging market, it makes sense for Nvidia to price the GPU higher to bolster its own bank account.\u00a0At MSRP, the $400 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is a much more powerful, much more compelling option.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThe RTX 3060 is fine though, as we said at the beginning. It\u2019s okay. But unlike the other RTX 30-series offerings, it\u2019s nothing special. If you need a graphics card for 60-fps gaming at 1080p Ultra quality, this will scratch that itch, and the RTX 3060 can push even higher refresh rates in some games. You can also dabble in 1440p gaming if you don\u2019t mind bumping the visual settings down a bit in modern titles. With an ample (read: overkill) 12GB of VRAM onboard, you\u2019ll never have to worry about running out of memory. That\u2019s great! And Nvidia\u2019s DLSS and latency-reducing Reflex technologies remain a massive difference maker in games that support it.\nTurning our attention to this specific graphics card, the EVGA XC Black Gaming lacks fancy extras like a backplate, RGB lighting, and a secondary BIOS, but it should fit into almost any system\u2013and it runs cool and quiet. There\u2019s no need to spend up for a more expensive model simply for better cooling performance. The price is certainly right for today\u2019s insane GPU market\u2014if you can find one.\nDon\u2019t expect many of the baseline-cost RTX 3060 models to be made. Most vendors will focus their attentions on far pricier hot-rodded models for which they can charge significantly more, even before scalpers swoop in.\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t spend $500 or more on a graphics card like this. I wouldn\u2019t personally spend $400 on an RTX 3060\u2014even a luxurious high-end model with every bell and whistle you can think of. They\u2019re already being sold for $600 or more on resale sites. The GeForce RTX 3060 is just a good-enough graphics card in a time where even okay, fine GPUs sell out instantly for staggering amounts.\nPay up if you must, but sit on the sidelines for now if you can.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRetailer\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$299.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$469.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nView Deal \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

One is destined for desktop PCs, and the other is a gaming laptop. But they don't even get close to delivering the same performance. What's going on here? Is this a problem? Let's get benchmarking!\n\nToday we are checking out Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU, a product that's already available in a handful of gaming laptops, and is the faster and more expensive sibling of the RTX 3060 Laptop GPU we reviewed a few weeks ago.\nSpecification wise, the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU doesn't follow the exact same core configuration as its desktop counterpart. Both use GA104 silicon but the desktop GPU features 5888 CUDA cores, compared to just 5120 on the laptop version. Boost clock speeds are also over 100 MHz lower for the laptop variant in the best cases, while the 8GB GDDR6 memory configuration remains the same.\nUltimately, to take a 220W desktop GPU and shove it down into a 80-125W realm, some things need to be sacrificed, and for this generation it's both the GPU core configuration and clock speeds.\n\nSpeaking of power, the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU is available in a range of power options that OEMs can use depending on the cooling provided by a given laptop. The minimum TGP is 80W \u2013 which is equivalent to the former Max-Q variant, a moniker which Nvidia is no longer using \u2013 the maximum is 125W, with lots of options in-between. Additional power can be sent to the GPU through Dynamic Boost 2.0 as well, so most RTX 30 Laptop GPUs have a power range they operate within.\nThis naming convention can be a bit confusing for laptop buyers as the 80W and 125W variants will produce different levels of performance, however in the last few weeks Nvidia has mandated that OEMs display the GPU's TGP on laptop's spec sheets, a considerable improvement.\n\nToday we're benchmarking two laptops that use the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU - one with a base power rating of 80W, and another with 115W, giving us a good look at the range of possible performance you can get out of this GPU.\nDynamic Boost 2.0 provides up to an additional 15W of power in both systems when CPU utilization is light, so the TGP ranges are 80-95W in the lower power model, and 115-130W in the higher power model, although typical power usage falls in the middle of that range while gaming.\nOur 80-95W configuration is found inside the Gigabyte Aorus 15G, a slim and premium gaming system. The Aorus 15G is also capable of running the RTX 3070 at 90-105W but to avoid making this review overly long, we're sticking to the base default configuration, which will show a practical range of how the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU can perform - but buyers should note that the Aorus 15G is a little faster when you set a higher mode in Gigabyte's software utility.\n\nI'm a big fan of the build quality on this Aorus 15G laptop, the finish has a nice texture and the keyboard is great. While it is portable, it's not the slimmest chassis. It also uses a Core i7-10870H instead of AMD's newer and faster Ryzen 5000 APUs, although this could be due to availability - Intel's 10th-gen CPUs are shipping now, while Ryzen is in a stock shortage.\n\nThe RTX 3070 115-130W laptop we have in for testing is the XMG Apex 17, an upcoming laptop that you saw in our Ryzen 9 5900HX review. So inside is that Ryzen APU, plus 16GB of dual-channel DDR4-3200 memory and the RTX 3070 with Dynamic Boost and Resizable BAR.\n\nIn today's review we'll also compare these laptops to a typical desktop gaming system with a full GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card inside. The desktop test system is kitted out with a mid-range Core i5-10600K processor, which actually has fewer CPU cores than the laptops we're testing \u2013 six against eight-cores for the laptops \u2013 although of course the desktop CPU can clock higher and use more power. There's also 16GB of DDR4-3600 memory in a dual-channel configuration. This will give us a good idea how close these laptop variants come to the desktop part with essentially the same name.\nWe are testing at two resolutions. The primary configuration is 1080p running using Optimus, which is the default on most laptops today despite some progress towards smart MUX solutions. This means the discrete GPU signal is passed through the integrated GPU to the display. We've also tested at 1440p using an external display with a direct to discrete graphics connection for some of the comparison charts later in the review. This removes the small performance penalty from Optimus and also emulates what you'd get on a laptop with a 1440p display and a smart MUX solution like Advanced Optimus.\nOur usual laptop test notes apply here, not going to run through it all yet again, so let's get straight into the benchmarks.\nBenchmarks\nIn Metro Exodus, the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU does a reasonable job of providing more performance than previous generation GPUs. This new variant at a 115W TGP is over 40 percent faster than the RTX 2070, and a healthy 21% faster than the RTX 2070 Super.\nIt also manages a 14% lead over the new RTX 3060. However it's not in the same league as the desktop GPU, which is 34% faster than this laptop variant.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower power 80W variant of the 3070 is actually a fair bit slower than the 115W model of the RTX 3060.\nThis will present a problem for buyers comparing across different laptop designs (and well, that's the reason why this review is ever more useful). However, it holds its own against other lower power variants: 9% faster than the RTX 3060 and 23% ahead of the RTX 2070 Max-Q.\n\nIn Control, the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU at 115W is the fastest mobile GPU we've tested in a reasonable form factor. 15% faster than the RTX 3060 and RTX 2070 Super, and 35% faster than the RTX 2070. However it falls short of the desktop RTX 2070 Super and isn't close to the full RTX 3070, which is the only GPU to average over 100 FPS in this title.\nIn the lower power class, it's a tight battle. The RTX 3070 80W is slightly faster than the RTX 3060 115W, but ends up quite a bit ahead of other Max-Q designs: it's 24% faster than the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q for example.\n\nIn Borderlands 3, the desktop GPUs end up a bit CPU limited at 1080p, so the gains relative to the laptop parts are less notorious. The RTX 3070 at 115W pushes 12% in front of the RTX 3060 and 28% ahead of the RTX 2070, although cannot match the performance of a desktop RTX 2070 Super in a configuration that also benefits from a desktop CPU.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 saw some of the smallest gains moving from the RTX 3060 to the RTX 3070 in the 115W power class: the RTX 3070 was just 7 percent faster. This allowed the desktop variant to produce 35% higher performance in this game. However, gains relative to previous generation parts are still impressive, with 36% higher performance relative to the RTX 2070.\nIn the lower power class, we see a strong result for the RTX 3070: 15% faster than the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q at 90W, and just 9% ahead of the RTX 3060\n\nRainbow Six Siege running at 1080p gives us a good idea of what a game looks like when CPU limited trying to push out as many frames as possible.\nUltimately, there isn't much difference between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 here, so people that enjoy playing on quality settings in competitive games don't have an incentive to buy the faster configuration as the CPU performance simply isn't there.\nThe RTX 3070 on a desktop with a power unlimited Core i5-10600K absolutely destroys the laptop configurations with at least 65% better performance.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the RTX 3070 is a healthy 15% faster than the RTX 3060 within the same power level, although this performance difference shrinks to single digits when comparing in the lower power class.\nWhile the RTX 3070 80W is about 10% faster than the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, that's one of the less impressive gains we've seen so far, and in this game the desktop RTX 3070 is 30% faster or more.\n\nWhile the RTX 3070 doesn't deliver unplayable performance on laptops in Cyberpunk 2077, it is more like a 60 FPS experience versus the 90 FPS you'll get with this GPU in a desktop.\nThe 3070 is over 20% faster than the RTX 3060 in this game in both power classes, which is one of the larger margins we've seen so far.\n\nIn Watch Dogs Legion, the RTX 3070 performs well relative to the RTX 3060. Not only is the GPU faster, but it also has a larger VRAM buffer: 8GB vs 6GB explaining the extra oomph.\nIn this particular title, more than 6GB of VRAM is used at 1080p ultra settings, which causes one of the largest performance discrepancies we've seen: at 115W the RTX 3070 is 38 percent faster. 6GB is looking tight in some titles. Another example would be Cyberpunk with ray tracing enabled, so 8GB gives you more breathing room for 1080p gaming today.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, the RTX 3070 at 115W is just 10 percent faster than the RTX 3060. With this power limit, the laptop variant also falls considerably behind the RTX 2070 Super and the RTX 3070 desktop variants, so there is no doubting a desktop is superior for playing this sort of game.\n\nIn Hitman 3's Dartmoor benchmark at 1080p we are somewhat CPU limited again, so the RTX 3070 on laptops don't pull that far ahead of other variants, ending up 5% faster than the RTX 3060 on our AMD laptops, and equal on our Intel systems. With the extra CPU power available to us on desktop platforms, our 10600K desktops are able to pull ahead.\n\nDirt 5 shows one of the larger margins between the laptop and desktop variants, at 47% comparing the desktop GPU to the 115W variant. But outside of that, laptop performance is as expected, coming in 13% ahead of the RTX 3060 in the higher power class, and 6% ahead in the 80W range.\nThe 3060 does well here all things considered, with the 115W model outperforming our 80W RTX 3070 configuration.\n\nPerformance Comparisons\nWe have a whole suite of performance comparisons to get through, so let's get started.\nRTX 3070 vs the RTX 3060 @ 115W\nFirst up is a direct look at the RTX 3070 vs the RTX 3060 at the same 115W power level. So this might be a comparison between the same laptop model, just with a different GPU in its base spec and higher spec. The RTX 3070 ends up 15% faster on average at 1080p.\n\nWhen we remove CPU bottlenecks and the Optimus performance penalty by benchmarking at 1440p instead, this margin grows to 20 percent on average. While the RTX 3070 Laptop is more of a 60 FPS GPU at 1440p compared to higher frame rates at 1080p, it's still quite playable even on ultra settings, so those after an RTX 3070 Laptop may find that one with a 1440p display is a better choice.\n\nRTX 3070 vs the RTX 3060 @ 80W\nThe margins are much narrower comparing the RTX 3070 to 3060 at 80W, indicating that the sweet spot for the RTX 3070 is its higher power configuration. On average the 3070 here was just 10 percent faster, so in most instances the 3060 will be better value.\n\n\nIn some instances you may find yourself with a choice between the RTX 3070 in a laptop at 115W, versus the RTX 3060 at 80W. In these situations the RTX 3070 is going to be much faster, 27% faster on average, which depending on the price difference could swing much more in favor of the higher tier GPU.\nRTX 3070 80W vs the RTX 3060 115W\n\nOn the flip side, if you have an 80W RTX 3070 up against a 115W RTX 3060, on average these GPUs produce basically the same performance. The RTX 3070 with its larger GA104 die is clearly more efficient, however depending on what laptops are available to you, you may be better off with the RTX 3060 model.\nRTX 3070 80W vs. 115W\nOverall the delta between the 115W and 80W variants of the RTX 3070 is significant: 15% on average at 1080p, and that grows to 20% at 1440p as we remove more potential bottlenecks. This gives you a good indication of the range of possible performance you can get with the 3070 in laptops, and why looking at that power rating is so crucial. OEMs that have enough cooling to handle 115W or 125W are going to deliver a much better gaming experience.\n\n\n\nRTX 3070 80W vs RTX 2070 Super Max-Q\nThe RTX 3070 is faster than previous generation laptop GPUs. Comparing the 80W model to the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q at 90W reveals the RTX 3070 to be 12 percent faster on average.\n\n\nMeanwhile in a smaller selection of games, at 115W the RTX 3070 is a decent 30 percent faster on average than the RTX 2070, which is a good sign considering these two parts are a similar price.\nGeForce RTX 3070 Desktop vs RTX 3070 Laptop 115W\nWhen comparing the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU to its desktop counterpart, it's a bit of a bloodbath.\nAt 1080p, the desktop is 35% faster on average than the 115W laptop variant. That margin does reduce to 30% on average at 1440p without Optimus, but it's undeniable that the desktop GPU is significantly faster and not really in the same performance class.\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Desktop vs RTX 3070 Laptop 80W\nAs expected, it gets worse for the 80W model. This GPU really isn't an RTX 3070, with the desktop card producing 53% higher frame rates on average at 1080p and 1440p.\nIt's a hard task to convert a 220W GPU into an 80W GPU, and the results show us just that. While the laptop variant is technically more efficient and delivers better performance per watt, 80W is just too slim for an RTX 3070 to show what it's capable of.\n\n\nGeForce RTX 2070 Super Desktop vs RTX 3070 Laptop 115W\nIn reality, the RTX 3070 at 115W is closer to an RTX 2070 Super desktop - and even then the RTX 2070 Super is 10% faster on average. Hopefully that will give buyers a sense of where their RTX 3070 laptop sits in the overall graphics market.\n\n\nWhat We Learned\nThere are two distinct ways to look at the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU. One is purely from the perspective of the laptop market, and the other is looking at the gaming landscape as a whole, also factoring in desktop cards.\nFrom a gaming laptop perspective, the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU is a decent but not earth shattering GPU upgrade for 2021 gaming notebooks. Compared to its predecessors, the 3070 is up to 15% faster than the RTX 2070 Super, and around 30% better than the RTX 2070 at the same power level.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Ampere design on Samsung's 8nm process is more efficient, so laptops that have the same cooling capacity - e.g. a refresh of the same design - should be a respectable amount faster. The gains aren't as significant as we saw comparing Turing to Ampere on the desktop, but it's hard to eek out more performance when power constrained.\nAnother big positive is for laptop buyers is that Nvidia has made RTX 30 series laptops a bit cheaper than the Turing generation in this tier. The RTX 3070 is essentially replacing the RTX 2070, so these laptops should be cheaper than previous generation RTX 2070 Super systems, and that's basically what we've seen so far. Whether you look at it as being 15% faster than the 2070 Super for a lower price, or 30% faster than the 2070 at the same price, either way that's a pretty good outcome and similar to the performance per dollar gains we saw with the RTX 3060 vs 2060 in laptops.\n\nThere are some drawbacks though. The RTX 3070 Laptop GPU does benefit more than usual from a higher power configuration, so buyers should probably avoid 80W \"Max-Q\" configurations as the gains relative to the RTX 3060 are small. In general the RTX 3070 is also not as good value as the RTX 3060 - in the Aorus 15G, for example, the 3070 configuration is 20% more expensive for what we expect 10-15% better performance. That's not unusual as you move up the product stack, but it's something to keep in mind.\nIt's also important to look out for those power configurations. We're thankful Nvidia are forcing OEMs to make this information public, because there is the possibility for an RTX 3070 low power config to perform below that of an RTX 3060 in a higher power config.\nIt's also hard to ignore the elephant in the room: this GPU does not provide RTX 3070 desktop-like performance. We do believe the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU is quite decent overall in its own little laptop bubble, but against a desktop, it's not even close. At 115W, the desktop variant is 30% faster, and honestly the difference between a low power RTX 3070 Laptop GPU and the full desktop card is embarrassing. Two products with a larger than 50% performance delta simply should not have a name that's so similar.\n\nThe main concern here is a laptop buyer that's seen all the hype around a desktop RTX 3070 (the card that launched last year), and is looking at buying a laptop expecting that level of performance. The RTX 3070 is a bit of a beast, but with over 200W of power consumption it can't be put into a reasonably-sized laptop. There's plenty of room for fast gaming laptops, but it's just not realistic to believe the two GPUs will perform the same, and thus perhaps they should be named more appropriately.\nUltimately our recommendation for gaming laptops is the same that it's always been. Buying a gaming desktop is going to be faster and/or cheaper for a given level of performance. But laptops are still a good product if you require something portable, and Nvidia is pushing performance further ahead with the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU.\nYou just need to make sure you are genuinely moving your laptop from place to place, because if it's just sitting on your desk hooked up to a monitor all the time, what we've seen again today is that a laptop is no match for a true desktop-class product.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptops on Amazon\nGigabyte Aorus 15G RTX 3070 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptops on Amazon\nRyzen 9 5980HS Laptops on Amazon\nIntel Core i7 Tiger Lake Laptops on Amazon\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 26\n\n\n Got something to say?

Here's a detailed beginner's guide that explains plenty of things around installing Nvidia drivers on Linux Mint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAnkush Das\n\n08 Sep 2023\n6 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux Mint is a fantastic Ubuntu-based Linux distribution that aims to make it easy for newbies to experience Linux by minimizing the learning curve.Not just limited to being one of the best beginner-friendly Linux distros, it also does a few things better than Ubuntu. Of course, if you\u2019re using Linux Mint like I do, you\u2019re probably already aware of it.We have many beginner-focused Mint tutorials on It\u2019s FOSS. Recently some readers requested help with Nvidia drivers with Linux Mint and hence I came up with this article.I have tried to mention different methods with a bit of explaining what\u2019s going on and what you are doing in these steps.But before that, you should know this:Nvidia has two categories of drivers. Open source drivers called Nouveau and proprietary drivers from Nvidia itself.Most of the time, Linux distributions install the open source Nouveau driver and you can manually enable the proprietary drivers.Graphics drivers are tricky things. For some systems, Nouveau works pretty well while for some it could create issues like blank screen or poor display. You may switch to proprietary drivers in such cases.The proprietary driver from Nvidia has different version numbers like 390, 450, 460. The higher the number, the more recent is the driver. I\u2019ll show you how to change between them in this tutorial.If you are opting for proprietary drivers, you should go with the latest one unless you encounter some graphics issue. In those cases, opt for an older version of the driver and see if that works fine for you.Now that you have some familiarity with the terms, let\u2019s see how to go about installing Nvidia drivers on Linux Mint.How to Install Nvidia Drivers on Linux Mint: The Easy Way (Recommended)Linux Mint comes baked in with a Driver Manager which easily lets you choose/install a driver that you need for your hardware using the GUI.By default, you should see the open-source xserver-xorg-video-nouveau driver for Nvidia cards installed, and it works pretty well until you start playing a high-res video or want to play a game on Linux.So, to get the best possible experience, proprietary drivers should be preferred.You should get different proprietary driver versions when you launch the Driver Manager as shown in the image below:Basically, the higher the number, the latest driver it is. At the time of writing this article, driver version 460 was the latest recommendation for my Graphics Card. You just need to select the driver version and hit \u201cApply Changes\u201c.Once done, all you need to do is just reboot your system and if the driver works, you should automatically get the best resolution image and the refresh rate depending on your monitor for the display.For instance, here\u2019s how it looks for me (while it does not detect the correct size of the monitor):Troubleshooting tipsDepending on your card, the list would appear to be different. So, what driver version should you choose? Here are some pointers for you:The latest drivers should ensure compatibility with the latest games and should technically offer better performance overall. Hence, it is the recommended solution.If the latest driver causes issues or fails to work, choose the next best offering. For instance, version 460 didn\u2019t work, so I tried applying driver version 450, and it worked!Initially, in my case (Linux Mint 20.1 with Linux Kernel 5.4), the latest driver 460 version did not work. Technically, it was successfully installed but did not load up every time I booted.What to do if drivers fail to load at bootHow do you know when it does not work? You will boot up with a low-resolution screen, and you will be unable to tweak the resolution or the refresh rate of the monitor.It will also inform you about the same in the form of an error:Fortunately, a solution from Linux Mint\u2019s forum solved it for me. Here\u2019s what you need to do:1. Access the modules file using the command:xed admin:///etc/modules2. You\u2019ll be prompted to authenticate the access with your account password. Once done, you just need to add the following lines at the bottom:nvidia \nnvidia-drm\nnvidia-modesetHere\u2019s what it looks like:If that doesn\u2019t work, you can launch the Driver Manager and opt for another version of Nvidia driver. It\u2019s more of a hit and try.Install Nvidia Driver Using the Terminal (Special Use-Cases)For some reasons, if you are not getting the latest drivers for your Graphics Card using the Driver Manager, opting for the terminal method could help.It may not be the safest way to do it, but I did not have any issues installing the latest Nvidia driver 460 version.I\u2019ll always recommend sticking to the Driver Manager app unless you have your reasons.To get started, first you have to check the available drivers for your GPU. Type in the following command to get the list:ubuntu-drivers devicesHere\u2019s how it looks in my case:non-free refers to the proprietary drivers and free points at the open-source nouveau Nvidia drivers.As mentioned above, usually, it is preferred to try installing the recommended driver. In order to do that, you just type in:sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstallIf you want something specific, type in:sudo apt install nvidia-driver-450You just have to replace \u201c450\u201d with the driver version that you want and it will install the driver in the same way that you install an application via the terminal.Once installed, you just need to restart the system or type it in the terminal:rebootTo check the Nvidia driver version and verify the installation, you can type the following command in the terminal:nvidia-smiHere\u2019s how it may look like:To remove the driver and its associated dependencies, simply mention the exact version of the driver:sudo apt remove nvidia-driver-450\nsudo apt autoremoveAnd, simply reboot. It should fallback to use the open-source nouveau driver.install the open-source driver using the following command and then reboot to revert to the default open-source driver:sudo apt install xserver-xorg-video-nouveauInstalling Nvidia Drivers using the .run file from Official Website (Time Consuming/Not Recommended)Unless you want the latest version of the driver from the official website or just want to experiment the process, you can opt to download the file (.run) and install it.To proceed, you need to first disable the X server and then install the Nvidia driver which could turn out to be troublesome and risky.You can follow the official documentation if you want to explore this method, but you may not need it at all.Wrapping UpWhile it\u2019s easy to install Nvidia drivers in Linux Mint, occasionally, you might find something that does not work for your hardware.If one driver version does not work, I\u2019d suggest you to try other available versions for your Graphics Card and stick to the one that works. Unless you\u2019re gaming and want the latest software/hardware compatibility, you don\u2019t really need the latest Nvidia drivers installed.Feel free to share your experiences with installing Nvidia drivers on Linux Mint in the comments down below.\n\n\nLinux Mint\nTutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n\n\n\n\n Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Feedback\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnkush Das\nA passionate technophile who also happens to be a Computer Science graduate.

It's priced well, too, but unfortunately short in supply right now.\n\nForSolid ray tracing performanceBetter frame rates across the boardDoes great at 1440p and 4KHDMI 2.1AgainstHigher power consumption than the GTX 1080Limited stocks for now\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080\n\n\n $499 at Amazon $695 at Newegg Check Walmart\nThe former flasghip GPU The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 is the last GTX flagship GPU from NVIDIA. While it was a great performer for its time, it was also one of the last NVIDIA flagship GPUs without ray tracing capabilities. It holds up well for 1080p, but for higher resolutions and next-gen gaming, it isn't quite the GPU to have right now.\n\nForHold up well for 1080p gamingCan do some 1440p and 4K gamingLower power consumptionAgainstNo ray tracingStruggles to hit higher frame rates, especially at 1440p and 4K\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 is the new budget entry point for NVIDIA GPUs, striking a great balance between price and performance. It started at a lower price than the GTX 1080 did, while offering better performance across the board. With a much better gaming experience at higher resolutions, coupled with ray tracing, an upgrade to the RTX 3070 from a GTX 1080 is a no-brainer if you want one of the best graphics cards around.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 vs. GTX 1080 specsSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 is a serious hardware upgrade from the GTX 1080. The new Ampere GPU under the hood, the GA102, is made with the 8nm process from Samsung. The GTX 1080, on the other hand, has the GP104 chip, which was made with the 16nm TSMC process. This jump actually means a lot in terms of raw power, since the RTX 3070 has 17.4 billion transistors, as opposed to the 7.2 billion transistors on the GTX 1080. Here are the rest of the specifications of the two cards.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Shader (CUDA) Cores58882560Core Clock1500MHz1607MHzBoost Clock1725MHz1733MHzMemory8GB GDDR6256-bit bus width8 GB GDDR5X256-bit bus widthMemory Clock14Gbps10GbpsMemory Bandwidth448GB/s320GB/sRT Cores460Tensor Cores1840Transistors17.4 billion7.2 billionNodeSamsung 8nmTSMC 16nmArchitectureAmperePascalTDP220W180 WPorts1 x HDMI 2.13 x DisplayPort 1.4a1 x HDMI 2.0b3 x DisplayPort 1.41 x DL-DVIPower Connector1 x 12-pin1 x PCIe 8-pin converter included1 x 8 pinThe RTX 3070 includes RT and Tensor cores, which are exclusive to the RTX lineup. This, in addition to the transistor count, means that the RTX 3070 is a lot more powerful than the GTX 1080, which shows in real-world performance as well.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 vs. GTX 1080 real-world performanceSource: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Windows Central)In our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 review, we compared it to the RTX 2080, which it clearly outperformed. It has an even clearer performance jump when compared to the GTX 1080, with huge frame-rate gains in 1440p and 4K performance. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 is a clear choice for an upgrade hence, especially if the goal is better frame-rates, and a next-gen gaming experience. Here are some real-world gameplay FPS comparisons, courtesy of PC Benchmarks.Swipe to scroll horizontallyGameRTX 3070 (avg. FPS, 1440p)GTX 1080 (avg. FPS, 1440p)RTX 3070 (avg. FPS, 4K)GTX 1080 (avg.

However, the RTX 3070 has it beat in all aspects, plus it brings in ray tracing. Not to forget that it features a host of other next-gen gaming features that the GTX 1080 is simply incapable of.With 1440p, the GTX 1080 struggles to reach the 60 FPS mark with some more intensive titles, while the RTX 3070 does so with ease. The RTX 3070 can even hit the 144 FPS figure with some adjustments, while the GTX 1080 requires the graphics settings to be tuned down quite a bit in order to do so.While the RTX 3070 is a solid 1440p performer, it doesn't stop there. It also performs quite well at 4K. The GTX 1080, however, clearly struggles to achieve what we would call smooth gameplay at 4K. An upgrade to RTX 3070 means you'll have a much better 1440p and 4K gaming experience, and improved visuals thanks to ray tracing.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.So should you upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 from GTX 1080?Yes, you should. While the GTX 1080 is a great card, it is not built to handle higher resolutions, and shows its age with newer titles. The RTX 3070 is a great upgrade option, with noticable performance gains. In the span of two generations, NVIDIA's GPU lineup has packed in a lot of power, and it shows in real world performance.The one big issue with the RTX 3070 however, is its availability. New GPUs are very hard to find thanks to the short supply and heavy demand, and this means that many RTX 3070 cards are being sold at exorbitant prices that are marked up way above the actual retail price.While the jump from a GTX 1080 to an RTX 3070 is recommended, it is not worth shelling out extra cash over the retail price, especially since the attractive intended price tag is a huge reason for this upgrade being a lucrative one. Buying a RTX 3070 at an acceptable price will require some waiting and planning on your part.An upgrade to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 may also require some other upgrades to your system. The card consumes 40W more power than the GTX 1080. This means that if your current power supply unit (PSU) was already at its limit, you might want to consider an upgrade to it. You may also not be able to get the best of your RTX 3070 if the rest of the system, especially the CPU, isn't powerful enough to run alongside it.If you have a good enough system, however, and can play the waiting game, then the RTX 3070 should serve as just about the perfect upgrade from your GTX 1080.\n\n\n\nRTX 30 galore\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\n\n\n $889 at Amazon Check Walmart\nTrace those raysThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 is a great entry point into the world of next-gen gaming. A solid upgrade from the GTX 1080, it does better at 1440p and 4K, and brings in a host of next-gen gaming enhancements. Although it's available in very limited quantities, if you can get your hands on it, it makes for a solid upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer champion\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080\n\n\n $499 at Amazon $695 at Newegg Check Walmart\nGood for 1080p but not much elseThe NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 is a former flagship GPU which still does 1080p well. However, it's very last-gen, and can't quite come close to the RTX 3070 at higher resolutions. The GTX 1080 also completely lacks ray tracing capabilities. While it should be enough until you can buy an RTX 3070 at an acceptable price, the GTX 1080 is starting to show its age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nNvidia\nHardware\nComputers Desktops\n\n\nPalash VolvoikarSocial Links Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST ARTICLES1ASUS ROG Flow Z13 (2025) review: For the nerds, not for you2Horizon actress responds to AI-powered Aloy, raises concerns3Podcast: Could we see the future of Windows and Copilot next month?4Helldivers 2 players find secret messages amid destruction5I spoke with Intel in search of the \"killer AI app\" at MWC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Central is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

According to the information, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will retain the same specifications that were detailed last month but will also get the same GPU hash rate-limiting treatment as the GeForce RTX 3060 to counter crypto miners.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Could Be Launching Soon With 12 GB GDDR6X Memory, 19 Gbps Pin Speeds & The Hash Rate Limiter To Counter Crypto Miners\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has been doing the rounds in the rumor mill for quite some time. It has disappeared and reappeared several times with different GPU configurations but as we get closer to April, things are getting clear. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti may indeed be launching and will retain the same core configuration as the ones rumored before and will also come with a new feature that was first introduced on the GeForce RTX 3060.\nRelated Story GPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total CostNVIDIA had already stated that existing GPUs will not be affected by the hash rate-limiting tech but upcoming SKUs will definitely be receiving modifications to counter cryptocurrency miners. As such, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will also limit its hash rate in several cryptocurrency algorithms, making it pretty useless and not a great investment for miners. The GeForce RTX 3080 for example features a mining hash rate of around 95-100 MH/s in Ethereum using the Daggerhashimoto algorithm.\n\nIf we use the same 50% hash rate limit as the RTX 3060 and apply it to the RTX 3080 Ti, we get around 45-50 MH/s which is the same mining rate as the RTX 3070 while you're paying a vastly higher sum for the Ti variant. This will mean that more cards can end up in gaming PCs than mining platforms however we can't say if the availability of the card will be that great to begin with since the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 based on the GA102 GPU are still short in supply.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB 'Rumored' Graphics Card Specifications\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB FE (Founders Edition) graphics card is expected to feature the PG133-SKU15 PCB design and the GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core. The GA102-250 GPU has also changed since the last time we saw them and will now feature 10240 CUDA cores within a total of 80 SM units. Since the main core configuration is entirely brand new, the previously leaked clocks & TMU/ROP counts should now be dismissed.\n\nNVIDIA_DEV.2208?\n\u2014 \ud3ec\uc2dc\ud3ec\uc2dc (@harukaze5719) March 4, 2021\n\nAs for memory, the card will feature 12 GB of GDDR6X memory. Unlike the 19.5 Gbps speeds of the RTX 3090, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is said to retain the same memory speeds as the RTX 3080 at 19 Gbps. Since we are getting 12 GB memory, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be using a 384-bit bus interface which equals a total bandwidth of 912 GB/s. So while we see an 8 GB VRAM reduction over the previous spec, the larger bus interface should drive higher memory bandwidth.\nThe TGP for the card is set to be the same as the RTX 3080 at 320 Watts.

But what do they do and should you be bending over backwards to get them running in your shiny new laptop?\u00a0With such a slew of features, it's no wonder some of us are feeling overwhelmed by the sheer breadth of toggles and tweaks now laid before us. So we've created this handy guide so you know what they do, when to tamper with the settings, and what to expect from each feature.While many of us will happily go about installing our favourite games on our new laptops straight out of the box, without a second thought for these (often convoluted) configuration settings, Nvidia has added some features we think are definitely worth trying out for yourself.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI'll say it: The best thing I saw from Nvidia at CES wasn't its sweet new GPUs, but some tasty AI every RTX gamer can enjoy\n\n\n\n\nBest graphics card for laptops in 2025: the mobile GPUs I'd want in my next gaming laptop\n\n\n\nSome even utilise AI to automatically tune your machine as and when necessary, which is at least worth a look, right?There has been some confusion recently about the Max Q branding. With the listing of GPU specs now being up to the manufacturer and whether they list laptops as such. So you may find yourself wondering what you're actually getting when you buy a new laptop.\u00a0It's all about the different max GPU power levels of the individual chips. One RTX 3080 machine may perform very differently compared to another RTX 3080. Make sure to check the product support page for any prospective purchases, before dropping large sums of money\u2014an 85W RTX 3080 will almost always be slower than a 110W version, for example.Cooling is the big thing, with performance being so dynamic within GPUs today, and so if you're picking up a thin and light machine it will perform differently to a more chunky laptop with the same graphics card.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.With that out of the way, let's go through a quick overview of each of these latest features and when's best to turn each one on, what the prime setting configurations are, as well as whether switching them on is actually worth it at all.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia Whisper Mode 2.0\u00a0Whisper mode is an Nvidia feature for the considerate souls among us. Say you want to take your laptop on a train, or are otherwise trying to sneak in a gaming session while others around you are trying to concentrate. When pushed to its limits, a Max Q laptop might exceed 30 decibels\u2014that might be the level of noise a light smattering of rain registers at, but is still noticeable. Yet with Whisper Mode 2.0 enabled you can shave a good 10 decibels off that, bringing it down to the level of, well... a whisper.\u00a0The pitch might still upset your pets, but at least you can hear yourself think and the turbine whirring of your fans won't anger people around you.\u00a0Of course, there's an inevitable trade-off when you switch this mode on. First there's the build-up of heat as a result of suppressing the cooling system, though in our MSI test machine we were still looking at a maximum GPU temp of around 77\u00b0C (170.6\u00b0F), though what that looks like for you depends on your laptop's ability to dissipate heat. \u00a0But Whisper Mode is designed to deal with that, because you also have the reduced frame rates to deal with.\u00a0When you toggle the feature on in the GeForce Experience app it asks if you'd like to optimise your games for this mode (make sure you click optimise, it's easy to miss). The caveat being that not only does it override your current system settings, it may also knock your resolution down a notch. Depending on the game, Whisper Mode 2.0 will also generally nerf your other graphics settings in favour of performance and low noise.\u00a0(Image credit: Nvidia)There are two sliders to play with: the 'Fan volume' and 'Minimum frame rate target'. The first is a very simple three step slider from 'Quieter' to 'Balanced' and the second \u00a0allows you to select a target fps level for you games.Whisper Mode 2.0 then uses those sliders to optimise your installed games to ensure quiet gaming that still hits those frame rates. Dragging the fan slider to the quietest setting and pushing the fps target up to 60 fps will result in the game settings being dropped more considerably than if you were just chasing 45 fps, for example.You may not have the in-game fidelity of an unleashed laptop, but you will still be able to play at decent frame rates without having your machine sound like you have a hovercraft atop your desk. And it means you'll be able to game around other humans without punishing their ears.It's an impressive feature, and is incredibly simple and effective. The one-touch optimisation takes seconds from when you enable Whisper Mode 2.0 and will put everything back the way it was when you disable it too.The only real drawback is that it can only be used when you're plugged into the wall for power, otherwise you only have Battery Boost's own dumb frame rate limiter to keep things moving away from the plug.We're big fans (pun 100 percent intended) of Whisper Mode 2.0, but it's not the sort of feature you would want to use all the time. If you've spent big on an RTX 3080 gaming laptop you want to use that power, and sometimes you just have to sacrifice a little noise for the high-end ray traced pretties. But when you want to remain stealthy, and still game at high frame rates, Whisper Mode 2.0 is ace.(Image credit: Nvidia)Battery BoostBattery Boost hasn't seen an overhaul with the new Max-Q setup for Ampere gaming laptops, but it's still something to keep in mind as a feature that can extend your gaming life away from the plug.\u00a0Laptop batteries and discrete graphics cards do not make the greatest of bedfellows, \u00a0but with Battery Boost enabled you can at least squeeze a little bit of extra game time out of your powerful machine. Sadly it's not quite as smart a system as Whisper Mode 2.0, in that it doesn't adjust your in-game settings, but it does still offer a simple frame rate limiter which can lower power demands on the system.From within GeForce Experience you can set an frame rate limit in 5 fps increments from 30 fps to 60 fps, where the bottom end of the slider will deliver greater battery life.In many machines Battery Boost is enabled by default, but it's something to keep in mind if you're trying to figure out why you're only getting 30 fps out of your RTX 3080 machine when you pull the cable out.Honestly, gaming on a laptop battery is rarely a positive move in terms of gaming performance, but Battery Boost can be useful if you're playing a less graphically intensive game, such as a turn-based strategy.Nvidia DLSS\u00a02.0DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, uses a deep neural network that intelligently extracts 'multidimensional features' of a scene, then combines multiple frame details into a final image, per frame.\u00a0Sounds like Voodoo, but it's one of Nvidia's most impressive recent GPU features and means your system will run games at a lower resolution, while using AI power to translate each frame into something that looks higher resolution than it actually is. It sharpens each pixel, allowing performance to take priority without much loss of detail.\u00a0And it's the feature which makes the performance hit of enabling ray traced visuals one that's actually palatable.It uses the AI-focused Tensor cores from within RTX GPUs to enhance the look of your games, but does still need to be trained from the get-go. So DLSS is something that has to be enabled by game developers and isn't something that will magically work on every title in your Steam library.But where it works, it works incredibly well. The first implementation had a tendency to muddy the image a little, but with the DLSS 2.0 update we're now at the point where an upscaled image can actually look better than at native resolution. Yes, the robots are getting that good.It was initially something tied into ray tracing, but we're seeing more and more games enable the feature on its own in order to boost gaming frame rates for normal rendering.I've found that in most cases, turning DLSS on does provide a good boost in frame rates, in plenty of top games, and manages to seriously improve rendering scores in real-time, ray-traced environments. I recommend trying it out where you can.(Image credit: Nvidia)Advanced Optimus\u00a0Advanced Optimus is the evolution of Optimus mode. It automatically switches the display connection from GPU to your machine's integrated graphics using a 'dynamic hardware switch' to reduce the load on your GPU when unnecessary. The idea is to reduce system overhead and increase performance, while supposedly increasing battery life.In Nvidia's initial employment of Optimus mode, the GPU was not directly connected to the display, meaning it didn't work with G-Sync. That restriction has since been fixed with Advanced Optimus so, as long as your FPS doesn't supersede your monitor's refresh rate, you can enable G-Sync for a smoother experience.\u00a0It's also necessary for the new wave of high refresh rate 1440p laptop panels too. Without it you're not going to get 240Hz out of your high-res display.\u00a0Not only does Advanced Optimus give you access to G-Sync capability, it should help make games playable for longer as your battery wanes. And in combination with DLSS, those numbers might give you a fighting chance as you battle through those last dregs of juice.\u00a0And, plugged in, it makes your beautiful high refresh rate screen shine. So why not give it a try?\u00a0To turn it on, simply right click your desktop and enable it in the Nvidia Control Panel, under the 'manage display mode' tab. Strangely it's not actually listed as 'Advanced Optimus,' instead it's labelled as 'Automatic Select' with the original 'Optimus' option still present, which looks like the default.I would recommend making sure you dive into the Nvidia Control Panel and ensure that you have the 'Automatic Select' option enabled instead of the old-school version of Optimus. Way to make things clear, Nvidia...Nvidia Reflex\u00a0Nvidia Reflex is supposed to improve latency to\u2014as the title suggests\u2014bolster your in-game reflexes. Though it's only available for certain games, and works best when paired with Reflex compatible mice such as the Razer Deathadder V2, or SteelSeries Rival 3. With a focus on fast-paced, competitive games such as those played in esports, this mode seeks to reduce the trade-off between high graphic settings and low latency, so you shouldn't have to sacrifice looks for frames, in theory.\u00a0It essentially has the power to boost GPU clocks, and give the CPU a significant hand in reducing the render queue. Since it works by controlling CPU render submissions through the game engine, Reflex produces better results than just the \"Ultra Low Latency\" tech hosted within the drivers.In aiming, particularly in fast paced games that involve a ton of flick shots, higher latencies mean more variance in accuracy, as you're unable to predict where your flicks are going to land. So by reducing latency, your accuracy should improve too, right?I'm too bad at competitive FPS to test accuracy with any authority, but I found Reflex was able to shave off a good dozen or more milliseconds off the machine's latency scores, so it should, in theory make a difference. Though, I couldn't quite get the 33 percent Nvidia claims it can achieve over having Reflex turned off. Combining Reflex with DLSS and Optimus however is likely to yield better results, especially when paired with a good reflex mouse.There's something to be said about the innovation of this feature. And it does reduce latency, but there are a lot of factors that can contribute to your terrible performance in game as well, so don't think this is going to solve all your problems. Bad aim might just be the issue.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia Dynamic Boost 2.0This one replaces outdated, fixed, static GPU and CPU power budgets with an AI-operated power balancing system. Nvidia claims Dynamic Boost can optimise your gaming experience on a frame-by-frame basis, with version 2.0 now able to intelligently shift power between the CPU and GPU. Previous versions only allowed power to be routed from the CPU to the GPU but now it works both ways, intelligently diverting power in order to keep the overall power consumption at a consistent level.The tech is powered by multiple AI networks, which makes it sound like it'll solve all our problems, but is it really doing your machine any good? Nvidia has it pegged with the potential to increase performance by upwards of 16 percent according to the documentation.(Image credit: Nvidia)Unfortunately, there's no way to turn Dynamic Boost off for testing, but Nvidia listed some of its own FPS averages and scores before enabling it. We'll just have to take the company's word for it on this one. And it's not like you can turn it off, anyway so... er, deal with it?But it should help boost performance without you having to lift a finger. Which is always nice.(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia Resizable BARResizable BAR (Base Address Register) is Nvidia's equivalent to AMD's Smart Access Memory, or SAM for short. This one's on by default, so there's no need to fiddle around in the settings to switch it on.\u00a0The Resizable BAR basically increases the buffer between your machine's CPU and GPU. Where previously data exchange between these constantly interacting components was limited to just 256MB, the Resizable BAR feature simply unlocks the bandwidth limit between the two. Rather than exchanging data little and often, which can cause latency issues, your components can communicate freely as needed and means that the larger frame buffers of modern GPUs can actually be fully utilised.This has the potential to give your machine a passive advantage that speeds up the data retrieval process, which in turn can bolster performance in certain games.\u00a0There have been only a few games that really sing with this new technology in place, though, with most upticks in framerate being relatively negligible\u2014most are seeing performance increases under 10 percent. Still, every little helps.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nKatie WickensSocial Links NavigationHardware WriterScrew sports, Katie would rather watch Intel, AMD and Nvidia go at it.

Its development efforts are focused on applying AI in areas such as medical diagnostics, treatment, prediction and prevention, management and operational efficiency to enrich the quality of life of people everywhere.\nBy using AI advanced technologies such as deep learning, it aims to help radiologists detect diseases and abnormalities more accurately and consistently and at a faster speed. This is particularly impactful when 4.7 billion people in the world do not have adequate access to radiologists.\nThe firm has attracted a number of talented applied scientists with expertise in machine learning, computer vision, NLP and large-scale product and service development. Working in teams, these scientists reside in different parts of the world, including Vietnam, Australia, South Korea, and the United States.\nSolving tougher problems\nAfter using the previous generation NVIDIA DGX systems built on NVIDIA V100 GPUs for about a year to develop its solutions, the AI firm was among the first in the region to upgrade to the next generation NVIDIA DGX A100 toward the end of 2020.\nNVIDIA DGX A100 is the world's first five petaFLOPS AI system built on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Featuring the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, it lets enterprises consolidate training, inference and analytics into a unified, easy-to-deploy AI infrastructure.\n\u201cWe want to utilise the DGX A100 to build more sophisticated models with faster training time to solve tougher problems in relation to medical diagnosis, treatment and prevention in healthcare. Using the NVIDIA DGX A100 helps us to accelerate the development process. The system also provides us with more GPU memory and computation capacity than the previous generation NVIDIA AI system,\u201d said Steven QH Truong, CEO, VinBrain.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping solutions faster\nIts applied scientists are working on a number of healthcare and smart city/smart home projects using the new system. These include DrAid Diagnosis, DrAid Treatment, DrAid Smart Assistant, Smart City, and Smart Home.\nThe DGX A100 provides the immense processing power needed to develop AI models for:\n\nChest X-ray image classification and segmentation problems for DrAid Diagnosis\nMRI registration and segmentation problems for DrAid Treatment\nSpeech recognition and text-to-speech problems to perform voice command and/or editing medical reports for DrAid Smart Assistant\n\n\u201cSo far, our applied scientists have found that training and inference workloads for computer vision and natural language processing tasks on the NVIDIA DGX A100 server is about 30 to 50 percent faster compared to the prior generation. \u00a0The eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 320GB total GPU memory enables them to perform large-scale training of speech recognition tasks. This helps greatly in speeding up the model training convergence, resulting in shorter turnaround time for model development,\u201d said Truong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruong: NVIDIA DGX A100 shortens turnaround time for model development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaster training and evaluation are extremely helpful when VinBrain\u2019s applied scientists experiment with new ideas, enabling them to develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) in a short time.\n\u201cFor example, when we need to do a PoC within a few days or explore new directions to improve a model's performance, our applied scientists need fast GPU with large amounts of memory where they can run multiprocessing in parallel. The system helps to save model development time for them\u201d he explained.\nLeveraging existing platforms\nBeyond the NVIDIA DGX A100, the Vietnam developer is also leveraging the NVIDIA Clara healthcare application framework for AI-powered imaging and speech-to-text streaming inference. This platform provides full-stack GPU-accelerated libraries, SDKs and reference applications for developers, data scientists and researchers to create real-time, secure and scalable solutions.\nFor its smart city/smart home projects, VinBrain is trying out NVIDIA Jarvis, a fully accelerated application framework for building multimodal conversational AI services that use an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. With Jarvis, developers can fine-tune state-of-art-models on their data to achieve a deeper understanding of their specific context. They can also optimise for inference to offer end-to-end real-time services that run in under 300 milliseconds and deliver 7x higher throughput on GPUs compared with CPUs.\n\u201cVinBrain is a classic example of a forward-looking company that believes in leveraging advanced technologies to drive breakthroughs. The NVIDIA DGX A100 supercomputer is designed to help researchers expedite scientific discoveries and develop AI solutions that advance healthcare and make the world a better place,\u201d said Raymond Teh, Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations (Asia Pacific), NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVu Hoang, VinBrain\u2019s AS Lead is training AI model for Speech Recognition Using DGX A100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing these platforms from NVIDIA helps VinBrain to reduce development time as well as give it access to more intuitive solutions from the NVIDIA community.\nForging ahead\nHaving experienced success in its use of the NVIDIA DGX A100, VinBrain plans to use the system for upcoming projects involving conversational AI and advanced big models.\nAnother project in the pipeline is an AI-based system to provide prognosis recommendation that can be used by both doctors and non-doctors in healthcare.\n\u201cWe have gained much productivity improvement by using the NVIDIA DGX A100 to build more sophisticated models with faster training. It is a worthwhile investment -- powerful computing hardware at a reasonable cost\u201d said Mr Steven QH Truong.\nPlease find Vietnamnese media alert\u00a0here.\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0NVDA) is the AI computing company.

This news has been further validated by Uniko's Hardware which confirmed not only the chip specificaitons but the memory variatns as well. We also now know that the memory will be clocked at 19 Gbps.\nNVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti to come with 8GB and 16GB GDDR6X VRAM buffers clocked at 19 Gbps\nThe NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti will be based on the GA104-400 GPU and hafve 6144 CUDA cores divided into 48 GPU clusters. This means it has exactly 2 more clusters than its non-Ti variant and 20 less than the RTX 3080. It will feature 48 RT cores (cor comparison the RTX 3080 has 68) which is also 2 more than the RTX 3070 and 20 less than the RTX 3080. ROPs will be 96 for this segment of NVIDIA's lineup and the clock speed is syet to be confirmed. It will feature a 256-bit memory bus with 8 GB or 16 GB GDDR6X memory clocked at 19 Gbps. It is currently scheduled for release in May 2021 alonside the RTX 3080 Ti but this could change considering the volatile supply situation.\n\n\nGiven below is the tweet confirming Videocard's exclusive details on the RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti:\n\nRTX3070TiGA104-400-A18GB & 16GBMT61K256M32JE-19G pic.twitter.com/ySekgt7zzK\n\u2014 UNIKO's Hardware \ud83c\udf0f (@unikoshardware) March 26, 2021\n\nYou can use the memory ID given to trace the full specifications of the memory used:\nSpec sheet from Micron showcasing the details of RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti memory.\nInterestingly, the RTX 3070 Ti is positioned as something of a replacement of the RTX 3070 because its not *that* powerful compared to its name sake. With just a difference of 2 GPU clusters, theres only so much performance to be gained. The RTX 3080 Ti on the other hand rocks a massive difference when compared to its namesake.\nThe RTX 3080 Ti has 12 more GPU clusters compared to the RTX 3080 for a total of 10240 cores (2 less than the RTX 3090). It has 80 RT cores and 112 ROPs. It will be coupled with a 12 GB GDDR6X vRAM buffer and a 384-bit bus for a total of 912 GB/s.\u00a0 It is clearly a monster of a card and from the specifications, it appears to be a very slightly, less-powerful, replacement of the RTX 3090 and the true flagship of NVIDIA's ampere lineup. It is also currently scheduled to launch in May 2021.\nIn another world, where cryptocurrencies did not exist, I would have been very excited for this launch, but not it feels as if I am writing for another card that will likely never end up in gamer's hands and will spend its many digital cycles toiling away in a cryptocurrency mine somewhere. The supply and demand situation is very unlikely to improve within a month and with the global chip and NAND shortage, it is unlikely this card will be anywhere its MSRP anyways (whatever that may be). Still, gamers can still hope to get their hands on these by signing up for AIB's waiting lists and staying put for a few months.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti?\n\n\n They look amazing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n I prefer Radeon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Who cares if you cant buy em.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Readies RTX 3060 8 GB, RTX 3060 Ti With GDDR6X & RTX 3070 Ti With GA102 GPU To Clear Away Ampere Inventory\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian warehouse employees imprisoned after the theft of 20 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Graphics Cards\n\nJason R.
