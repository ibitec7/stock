Trading is expected to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on July 20.\nNVIDIA\u2019s 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will take place virtually at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.

If approved, each NVIDIA shareholder will receive three additional shares for every share held as of Jun 21. These dividend shares will be distributed after the market closes on Jul 19.NVIDIA\u2019s shares are expected to start trading on a stock split-adjusted basis from Jul 20.The motive behind the stock split is to make the company\u2019s stock more affordable to employees and retail investors, thus boosting demand for NVIDIA\u2019s shares. This, in turn, should push share prices up again.Notably, the company\u2019s shares have returned a massive 1227.5% in the past five years, strongly outperforming the industry\u2019s five-year growth of 270.3%. 5-Year Price Performace     NVIDIA\u2019s efforts to boost shareholder value are noteworthy. Notably, it is a cash-rich company with a strong balance sheet. As of Jan 31, 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents of nearly $11.56 billion, which is significantly higher than its total debt of $5.96 billion. Since it has net cash available on its balance sheet, the existing cash can be used for pursuing strategic acquisitions, investment in growth initiatives and distribution to shareholders.NVIDIA boasts a sturdy cash-flow generating ability. The company\u2019s accelerated revenue growth along with improving operating efficiency is bringing in higher cash flows. The higher cash flow generating ability lends NVIDIA the flexibility to invest in long-term growth prospects and return money to its shareholders. Notably, the company returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks in the last five fiscals. In fiscal 2021, NVIDIA paid out dividends of $395 million. Moreover, NVIDIA is evaluating the timing of resuming share repurchases. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to $7.24 billion in shares through December 2022. Conclusion NVIDIA's stock trades at a one-year forward P/E of 42.3X compared with its five-year average of 38.5X. Nonetheless, NVIDIA trades at a massive premium to the semiconductor industry\u2019s forward P/E multiple of 23.5X. Therefore, many would argue that the stock is a risky bet. However, we beg to differ due to its consistent financial performance and strong growth opportunities in various untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing over the long term.

The proposed split will increase the chipmaker\u2019s outstanding common shares to 4 billion. Shares of the company jumped 2.6% to close at $599.67 on May 21.  Nvidia is a global technology company that designs and manufactures computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. The split is conditional on approval from shareholders at the company\u2019s Annual Meeting to be held on June 3. Upon approval of the split, each shareholder of Nvidia as of June 21, will receive a stock dividend of 3 additional common shares for every share held. The shares are to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, and trading on the newly split shares will begin on July 20. (See Nvidia stock analysis on TipRanks) In its most recent Q4 earnings report, the company reported full-year 2021 revenue and earnings of $16.68 billion and $10 per share, up 53% and 73% year-over-year respectively. Anticipating a robust performance in the upcoming Q1 report, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $700, which implies 16.7% upside potential to current levels. Schafer said, \u201cNvidia has transformed from a graphics company to becoming a premier leading AI computing platform company. The GPU was initially used to create graphics for video games and film. Today, its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores are essential for deep learning AI algorithms in data centers. Through its Mellanox acquisition, NVDA expanded its DC footprint from AI-accelerators to providing highspeed networking interconnects. We see several structural tailwinds driving sustained outsized top-line growth: gaming, data center/ AI accelerators, and autonomous vehicles.\u201d  Nvidia\u2019s shares have gained 72% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target is $685.43, which implies 14.3% upside potential to current levels. TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 92% Bullish on NVDA, compared to a sector average of 69%.

It\u2019s a beautiful turn of events bringing leadership to an area that has been shut out for weeks. Momentum traders will tell you a market led by tech is usually more fun and profitable. Today is a perfect example. In celebration of the newfound strength and in hopes of more gains to come, this week\u2019s top stock trades focus on technology.\nSpotting the muscle-flexing was a simple matter of sorting my ETF watchlist by percentage change. The top three performers are ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH), and Technology Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK). All of them are up 2% to 3%.\nWith the rally, XLK was able to vault back above the 50-day and 20-day moving average. Chart watchers are cheering the return to bullish territory and hoping it signals an end to the correction that lowered the sector as much as 9%.\n\n\n7 Best Blue-Chip Stocks Under $20 for Your Buy List\n\nI scoured the sector in search of the best breakouts. Here are my three favorites.\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX)\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nRead on for a brief rundown of each price chart and an options trade idea to capitalize.\n\nTop Stock Trades: Roblox (RBLX)\n\n\nSource: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade\n\nRoblox spent the first two months of its public life carving out a trading range. The whippy price action gave little reason for trend followers to participate. What smart traders were waiting for was a breakout and the start of a trend. Additionally, the passage of time allowed for the 20-day and 50-day moving averages to develop.\nToday\u2019s 7% pop is signaling the breakout is here. This is the best buy signal we\u2019ve had since the IPO. The volume surge is confirming I\u2019m not the only bull excited by the action.\nI think a quick run to $100 could be in store. Call spreads offer a cheap way to play.\nThe Trade: Buy the June $90/$100 bull call for $2.90.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\n\nSource: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade\n\nTwo semiconductors made this week\u2019s list. Nvidia demanded a mention because it announced a 4-for-1 stock split. The news comes ahead of the company\u2019s earnings report Wednesday. Rather than wait to see what the numbers look like, buyers are swarming. NVDA stock is up 5% in late-day trading. Barring a complete disaster on the announcement, I suspect the looming split will continue to provide a tailwind for the stock.\nThe fact that the tech sector is returning to an uptrend at the same time is simply icing on the cake.\n\n7 Best Blue-Chip Stocks Under $20 for Your Buy List\n\nRather than selling put spreads for their high probability of profit, I prefer buying upside call spreads to get a higher payout if the stock pushes higher. You can widen or shrink the spread width if you want to modify the trade cost and potential profit. I like the following structure.\nThe Trade: Buy the July $650/$570 bull call for $6.70.\n\nTop Stock Trades: Applied Materials (AMAT)\n\n\nSource: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade\n\nApplied Materials rounds out our trio of top stock trades with a delicious trendline breakout. It didn\u2019t need a stock split as an excuse to buy. The price action was tempting enough. As the chart shows, AMAT is blasting through the descending trendline that defined its movement for the past six weeks. It\u2019s simultaneously pushing above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages.\nThe move comes following last week\u2019s earnings report, which was snatched up after a down open. A trip back to its $146 high seems likely. Buy call spreads to capitalize.\nThe Trade: Buy the July $135/$145 bull call for $3.90.\nOn the date of publication, Tyler Craig held a long position in NVDA.

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates, nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials, despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1,500-2,000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials, according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials, with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals, BoA reported. The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive, since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks, despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus, the impact of the ongoing chip shortage\u00a0is not limited to semiconductor stocks, since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle, BoA noted. Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Aided by 5G, Broadband and U.S. Chip MakingAdvertisement. Similar to industrial stocks,\u00a0semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus\u00a0in 5G, broadband and domestic chip\u00a0manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist\u00a0in semiconductor stocks, they are\u00a0offset\u00a0by \u201csolid visibility\u201d that is driven by non-cancellable orders, product customization and broad-based demand, BoA concluded. Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in\u00a0gross margins\u00a0signaling that semiconductor companies\u00a0are\u00a0\u201cvery effective\u201d in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a\u00a0positive\u00a0driver for the sector, BoA noted. As a result, the SOX\u00a0index has benefitted from\u00a0rising rates historically. \u201cOver the past five years, chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X, while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X,\u201d\u00a0said Hilary Kramer, who hosts the nationally aired \u201cMillionaire Maker\u201d\u00a0radio program and heads the GameChangers and\u00a0Value Authority\u00a0advisory services. Valuations of Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Gain Money Manager\u2019s AttentionAdvertisement. Value investments had been trouncing growth stocks heading into trading on May 11, with the Russell 3000 Value Index up 19.1% in 2021, compared to a gain of 4.3% for the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested \u201ca rest\u201d would be overdue and healthy for the market. The six best semiconductor stocks\u00a0to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates, suggesting the market growth will last beyond\u00a02022, Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage, semiconductor stocks have not performed\u00a0well since early April. Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is \u201cnot great,\u201d but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well, Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm, she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Exclusive\u00a0 ETF Talk: Crypto on the HorizonThe top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT), a Santa Clara, California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA\u2019s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS), above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x, but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers. Potential catalysts for AMAT\u2019s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity, lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle, a delay in memory capacity upgrades, market share loss in key segments, merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds, BoA noted.  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com AMAT and two other large U.S.-based semiconductor vendors \u2014 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), a Fremont, California-based provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to help chipmakers build smaller and faster electronic devices, and KLA Corp. (NASDAQ:KLAC), a semiconductor capital equipment company in Milpitas, California, trade at 20x average forward P/E. That P/E is two turns below the broad market, despite solid multi-year visibility, strong balance sheets and potential double-digit-percentage sales and EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next 3-5 years, BoA noted.Advertisement. Lam Research Ranks Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now BoA gave Lam Research a $725 price target, based on 20x cash adjusted 2022E P/E, within the stock\u2019s historical range of 8x-24x and based on LRCX\u2019s 20%-plus EPS growth rate. Amid a multi-year wafer fabrication equipment growth cycle, LRCX is well positioned to benefit, the investment firm wrote. Potential upside catalysts to LRCX\u2019s price objective are stronger-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity, increased semiconductor equipment sales and improved market share. Downside risks are a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle, a delay in memory capacity additions and a market share loss.  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Include U.S.-based KLA Corp. KLA Corp. gained a $400 price objective from BoA based on 22x 2022E P/E, within KLAC\u2019s historical range of 10x-26x. The investment firm envisions KLAC as a key enabler of semiconductor manufacturing technology, offering a less cyclical topline, industry leading profit margins and best-in-class shareholder returns. Risks to BoA\u2019s price objective for KLAC are the cyclical nature of semiconductor capital spending and its impact on earnings, as well as competitive price and market share issues, particularly against Applied Materials. Another vulnerability would occur if trouble arose in bringing new products and technologies to market, BoA cautioned.  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com Nova Measuring Instruments Gets Berth as One of Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI), a Rehovot, Israel-based provider of metrology devices for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing, received a $108 price objective from BoA, based on 34x a 2022 estimated non-GAAP EPS that includes stock compensation and adjustments for net cash. The valuation is within its peer range of 20x-40x and is justified, BoA noted, due to Nova\u2019s superior gross margin profile and its potential to outgrow the market in the next three years. Exclusive\u00a0 Cryptocurrency Investments to Consider Amid PullbackDownside risks for the stock could include an inability to earn share in new X-Ray metrology market, stiff competition from large rivals such as KLA Corp. and historically cyclical semiconductor capital spending. Nonetheless, BoA lists NVMI among the six best semiconductor stocks.  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Feature Teradyne Another of the six best semiconductor stocks to buy now is Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), a North Reading, Massachusetts-based maker of automatic test equipment. BoA\u2019s $155 price objective on TER is based on 25x P/E, applied to a fiscal year 2022 estimated Non-GAAP EPS. The expected P/E is at the high end of Teradyne\u2019s long-term trading range of 12x-26x, given TER\u2019s recent and unique exposure to 5G/automation, cyclical recovery in auto and industrial markets and market share gains in core semiconductor testing. Downside risks to the investment firm\u2019s price objective are cyclicality and potential loss of market share in the core semiconductor test market, along with increasing competition in the robotics segment, BoA cautioned.  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com NVDA Gains Place Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now A BoA buy recommendation, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a Santa Clara, California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day, with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%. In addition, BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale, data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU), as well as its software and development ecosystem, BoA added. Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target, based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E, excluding cash, at the higher-end of NVDA\u2019s historical 20x-54x P/E range, showing NVIDIA\u2019s superior long-term growth profile in large, underpenetrated markets, according to BoA. Risks to achieving BoA\u2019s price objective include NVDA\u2019s exposure to the personal computer market, competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors, \u201clumpy and unpredictable sales\u201d in new enterprise, data center and auto markets, potential reduced capital returns, possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman \u201cThe semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology,\u201d said Bob Carlson, chairman of\u00a0the Board of Trustees of Virginia\u2019s Fairfax County Employees\u2019 Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. \u201cAsian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security, competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.\u201d Exclusive\u00a0 ETF Talk: Securing Our Crypto \u2018Spot\u2019The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns, combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage, said Carlson, who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks, particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF), such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).  Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com The top holdings in PSI recently were Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM), Carlson said.\u00a0  Pension fund and Retirement Watch leader Bob Carlson answers questions from\u00a0Paul Dykewicz\u00a0prior to COVID-19-related social distancing. Six Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Dodge Worst of COVID-19 Crisis COVID-19 vaccination progress in recent weeks offers optimism that new cases and deaths due to the virus will keep slowing. Additional hope comes from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowing a third COVID-19 vaccine to be put in to use. Worldwide, COVID-19 cases have jumped to 159,697,341, with deaths of 3,317,685, as of May 12, according to Johns Hopkins University. Also on that date, U.S. COVID-19 cases have totaled 32,778,621 and led to 582,845 deaths. America has the dreaded distinction as the country with the most COVID-19 cases and deaths. The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now provide investors with ways to pursue profits from a $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package, increased COVID-19 vaccine availability and an ongoing economic reopening. Those catalysts seem destined to build momentum for the six semiconductor stocks to buy now.

Among the highlights are firm's new Omen 16 and Omen 17 gaming laptops (both with up to QHD screens), and the Victus by HP 16 laptop. HP also introduced some new software, in beta - community gaming with Omen Oasis Beta feature in its Omen Gaming Hub.\n\nThe HP Omen 16 has processing power provided by your choice of up to an Intel Core i7-11800H or AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX mobile processor. For the discrete GPU, HP is offering configurations with up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB or \"AMD RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics\". That latter graphics option is obviously referring to the as yet unannounced AMD Radeon RX 6000M series. Sadly, the press release and downloadable materials divulged nothing further. Users also get choice of configurations with up to 32GB DDR4 3,200MHz and 1TB PCIe Gen 4x4 SSD.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen machine has a lower base model spec with the new GeForce RTX 3050 Ti instead of the RTX 3060 in the Intel version.\nHP's Omen 17 is Intel-only in the CPU department, with an up to 11th Gen Intel Core i9-11900H processor. Graphics are Nvidia exclusive here, with up to a GeForce RTX 3080 with 165W TGP. Again you configure the machine with up to 32GB DDR4 3,200MHz and 1TB PCIe Gen 4x4 SSD.\n\nWhether you get the Omen 16 or 17 HP touts the qualities of its latest Omen Tempest cooling technology which uses new thinner fans with higher blade counts, significantly larger vents, and a 3 to 5\u00b0C cooler keyboard deck when under load \u2013 compared with a previous gen Omen 15. In other comparisons, the new Omen 16 is said to be \"almost the same size\" as the previous Omen 15. Both the Omen 16 and 17 feature TKL backlit keyboard layouts with a macro key row, with the Omen 17 featuring per-key RGB optical mechanical switches for the first time in any HP laptop.\nThe Victus by HP 16 gaming laptop is the first product of a new series of \"accessible, yet elevated,\" PCs from HP. Here you will have options for up to an Intel Core i7-11800H or 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H Mobile processor. Graphics are catered for by up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU 6GB, or an AMD Radeon RX 5500M GPU.\n\nYou will see that the Victus carries over lots of HP Omen gaming tech, and this 16-inch machines, like its HP Omen brother, has been created in a near 15-inch form factor. HP hopes to appeal beyond gaming with this brand too, and has decided to offer the machine in Mica Silver, Performance Blue, Ceramic White with backlit keyboards (as standard). HP has squeezed keyboards with numpads into these more generalist/lifestyle machines. Up to QHD display options are available again, but as per above the max GPU spec is on a par with the Omen series lowest specs. Meanwhile, the lowest GPU spec for this Victus 16 laptop appears to be an Nvidia GeForce MX350.\n\nLastly, on the software front, HP is introducing Oasis as a destination in its Omen Gaming Hub software. Oasis adds community features to the hub, which features to help organise game nights for up to 16 friends, with either high-quality voice or simple text chat, as well as live-streaming of real-time gameplay in high definition and low latency. It is a US beta only for now but will roll out worldwide soon.\n\nSome UK pricing and availability was relayed to me by HP, as below:\n\nOmen 16 is expected to be available in August for a starting price of \u00a31,299.99.\nOmen 17 is expected to be available in August for a starting price of \u00a31,499.99.\nVictus by HP 16 is expected to be available in August for a starting price of \u00a3799.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\n\n                    After Apple's blockbuster reveal last week, the GPUs don't live up to the hype. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\nUpgraded MacBook Pro laptops come with M1 Pro and Max SoCs\n\n                    14.2- and 16.2-inch laptops have more ports, a Mini LED screen (notch), Function keys. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nApple Unleashed on 18th Oct to debut new MacBook Pros, M1X\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 8, Pro X, and Go 3 revealed\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 1 Comment\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Zen 3 CPUs (the 5000 HX series are Zen 3, right?  It's confusing how some of the 5000 series are Zen 2), some potentially interesting screen options (wish the article said what the aspect ratio was), and it looks like HP is even releasing it with full-height arrow keys - hallelujah!  The Mobile RX 6000 GPUs are also interesting, even if it's too early to say if it will make sense over the GeForce options.  At least more RX 6000 GPUs will be showing up in the wild.I wonder if the 3050 Ti instead of 3060 in the AMD model is so they can be offered at the same starting price, e.g. the AMD CPU costs more than the Intel one, so the entry level option on the GPU is a bit lower?It's disappointing that the Omen 17 is Intel-only.  Doesn't matter to me as I have no need for something as powerful as a GTX 3080, but it would be nice for those who do want the most powerful GPU to also be able to get the most powerful CPU.\n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin |\n                Register\n\nA\nA\nA\n\nFull HEXUS Site\n\nAbout Us -\n                Contact Us -\n                Advertise -\n                T&Cs \n\n\n\n\n        Copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2025, HEXUS.net.

In fact, NVIDIA stock is up 6%, while AMD shares have fallen over 19% as of this writing.\nThe GPU giant has continued to maintain its lead in graphics processing by spending far more on research and development (R&D) than AMD. NVIDIA has spent more than $24 billion on R&D over its history.\u00a0But greater financial resources don't tell the whole story.\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 3050 gaming laptop. Image source: NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA's R&D budget is more than double AMD's\nLast year, AMD spent $1.98 billion on R&D, an increase of 38% over the last two years.\u00a0However, NVIDIA spent $3.92 billion, up 65% over the last two years.\u00a0\nStill, AMD's new gaming chips have compared favorably with NVIDIA's RTX 30 series, especially on performance-per-watt efficiency.\u00a0However, user benchmark tests still show NVIDIA's RTX 30 series GPUs beating AMD's Radeon chips on raw performance, excluding power consumption.\u00a0\nIn November, AMD launched its new gaming cards based on its RDNA 2 chip architecture.\u00a0The Radeon 6000 series are the fastest graphics cards AMD has ever designed and represented \"years of R&D focused on bringing the best of AMD Radeon graphics\" to the gaming market, as corporate vice president Scott Herkelman said in a statement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD's computer and graphics segment, which includes sales of desktop gaming products, posted a revenue increase of 46% year over year in the fiscal 2021 first quarter -- the first full quarter of results for the Radeon 6000 series.\nNVIDIA won't report its fiscal first quarter earnings until May 26, but it got off to a faster start with the Ampere RTX 30 series that launched in September as the company posted a revenue increase of 67% in its gaming segment during the fiscal fourth quarter.\u00a0\nJon Peddie's most recent report showed NVIDIA increasing its market share in the add-in board market to 83% during the fourth quarter, while AMD slipped six percentage points to 17%.\nNVIDIA overtook AMD in R&D spending within the last decade, and the gap has continued to widen over the last few years. Still, AMD acknowledges there is more to NVIDIA's competitive advantage\u00a0than financial resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts.\n2.2 million developers use NVIDIA's CUDA software\nAMD is second in market share in x86 processors. Intel is its primary competitor in the CPU market, where AMD has been gaining market share in recent years.\u00a0\nAMD also trails NVIDIA in supplying GPUs in the data center. Last year, NVIDIA generated $6.7 billion in revenue from sales of data center chips, which amounts to roughly two thirds of AMD's entire business. The data center segment is on track to eventually become NVIDIA's largest segment, overtaking gaming.\nIn its annual report, AMD reveals a key advantage NVIDIA has in this market: \"In the data center, our principal competitor is NVIDIA as the adoption of its proprietary CUDA software platform established its market share in high-performance computing and machine learning.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA introduced CUDA in 2006, which coincided with the period when NVIDIA started to pull ahead of AMD in market share.\u00a0CUDA opened the door for NVIDIA to apply its GPU technology to the growing demands of high-performance computing, including self-driving cars and other AI-related applications.\nNVIDIA has a vast network of over 2.2 million developers around the world that use CUDA. This gives NVIDIA a major lift when launching new chip products, since it already has an extensive base of professional customers that use its software and hardware. As for gaming, NVIDIA claims it has an installed base of 140 million GeForce gaming GPUs.\u00a0\nNVIDIA is pushing forward\nIt's the close relationships that NVIDIA has with developers and gamers worldwide that explains why NVIDIA continues to lead AMD\u00a0in the GPU market.\nThe latter says the \"growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent a high and growing barrier to entry in this market.\" With its widening lead in R&D spending, this speaks more to NVIDIA's advantage than AMD's at this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd NVIDIA continues to invest for the future. It recently announced its first data center CPU (Grace), which it plans to ship in 2023.\u00a0It's also now supplying a cryptocurrency mining processor (CMP) to capitalize on the growing demand for alternative currencies.\u00a0\nThe ability to adapt to new market trends and introduce new products reflects NVIDIA's strong financial strength and why it should continue to\u00a0drive growth for investors.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends NVIDIA. The Motley Fool recommends Intel and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel and short January 2023 $57.50 puts on Intel.

There are some obvious omissions like the premium ROG Strix Scar series (would be a mismatch with the RTX 3050), but 11 laptop series have been updated in all. Updated highlights include the eminently portable and flexible ROG Flow X13 2-in-1, the ROG Zephyrus M16 featuring a 16-inch WQHD 16:10 screen with minimal bezels, and those on the tightest budgets can consider the updated TUF gaming laptops with up to 17-inch screens.\n\nSome of the new Asus machines also come packing options for Intel's newest mobile processors, the 11th Gen Core 'Tiger Lake' H chips that were announced just yesterday. The AMD options in the Asus gaming laptop range sport up to the Ryzen 9 5900HS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Model\n\n\nCPU Wattage\n\n\nGPU Wattage\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nz-Height\n\n\n\n\nROG Flow X13\n\n\n35+19W\n\n\n35+5W\n\n\n60Hz 4K 120Hz FHD\n\n\n1.3kg\n\n\n15.8mm\n\n\n\n\nROG Zephyrus M16\n\n\n45+35W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\n165Hz WQHD  144Hz FHD\n\n\n1.9kg\n\n\n19.9mm\n\n\n\n\nROG Zephyrus G14\n\n\n45+35W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\n120Hz WQHD Up to 144Hz FHD\n\n\n1.6kg\n\n\n17.9mm\n\n\n\n\nROG Zephyrus G15\n\n\n45+35W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\n165Hz WQHD 144Hz FHD\n\n\n1.9kg\n\n\n19.9mm\n\n\n\n\nROG Strix G15\n\n\n45+35W\n\n\n80+15W\n\n\nUp to 300Hz FHD\n\n\n2.1kg\n\n\n20.7mm\n\n\n\n\nROG Strix G17\n\n\n45+35W\n\n\n80+15W\n\n\nUp to 300Hz FHD\n\n\n2.3kg\n\n\n21.4mm\n\n\n\n\nTUF Dash F15\n\n\n35+29W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\nUp to 144Hz FHD\n\n\n2.0kg\n\n\n19.9mm\n\n\n\n\nTUF Gaming A15\n\n\n45+20W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\nUp to 144Hz FHD\n\n\n2.3kg\n\n\n22.8mm\n\n\n\n\nTUF Gaming A17\n\n\n45+20W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\nUp to 144Hz FHD\n\n\n2.6kg\n\n\n22.1mm\n\n\n\n\nTUF Gaming F15\n\n\n45W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\nUp to 240Hz FHD\n\n\n2.3kg\n\n\n22.8mm\n\n\n\n\nTUF Gaming F17\n\n\n45W\n\n\n60+15W\n\n\nUp to 144Hz FHD\n\n\n2.6kg\n\n\n22.1mm\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOne of the new attractions sporting updates to both the CPU and GPU options in the wake of yesterday's announcements is the ROG Zephyrus M16. As mentioned above in the intro this is built around a 16-inch WQHD 16:10 screen and Asus has reduced the bezels to make this laptop more compact than last year's 15-inch Zephyrus. Other key display qualities are the 165Hz/3ms and 100 per cent DCI-P3 gamut. Despite the bezel reduction it still features a Windows Hello webcam. This new 1.9kg machine packs the Intel Core i9-11900H with up to 48GB DDR4 RAM and 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD storage. GPU options include the GeForce RTX 3070, 3060, and 3050 Ti.\n\nAnother new/refresh device grabbing my attention among the announcements from Asus in on Tuesday is the premium ROG Zephyrus S17 gaming laptop. This doesn't come with a GeForce RTX 3050/Ti option (RTX 3060, 3070, and 3080 versions are available) but it does feature a new Intel TGL-H CPU \u2013 your choice of Core i9-11900H or Core i7-11800H.\nOne of the unique features of the Zephyrus S17 is its ROG Intelligent Cooling tech which leverages; Asus latest Arc Flow fans, six heatpipe, liquid metal thermal compound, and the innovative AAS Plus technology. AAS Plus can be seen in action in the above image where, as you lift the lid, the keyboard rises to a 5\u00b0 angle, opening broad vents that increase intake airflow by 25 per cent. Asus says that AAS Plus \"brings outsized cooling and performance to the super-slim system,\" which is commendable \u2013 it also keeps the keyboard deck cool in this sub-20mm thick system.\n\nIf you want to read about any of the above laptops in greater depth, hit the official links I have inserted above. Hopefully we will get some of these tasty gaming portables in the labs in the coming weeks to test the appeal of new components like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050/Ti GPUs and the six- and eight-core 11th Gen Core 'Tiger Lake' H CPUs.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\n\n                    After Apple's blockbuster reveal last week, the GPUs don't live up to the hype. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\nUpgraded MacBook Pro laptops come with M1 Pro and Max SoCs\n\n                    14.2- and 16.2-inch laptops have more ports, a Mini LED screen (notch), Function keys. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nApple Unleashed on 18th Oct to debut new MacBook Pros, M1X\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 8, Pro X, and Go 3 revealed\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 0 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

That includes articles today covering Carl Icahn potentially buying Bitcoin\u00a0(CCC:BTC-USD), the news HODL\u00a0(CCC:HODL-USD) getting extra attention today, as well as what\u2019s happening with crypto miner SOS\u00a0(NYSE:SOS).\nMore Thursday Crypto News\n\nCarl Icahn Crypto News: Is the Bearish Billionaire Really About to Buy Bitcoin?\nHODL Crypto News: 11 Things to Know About the Red-Hot HODL Token\nSOS Stock: How Redditors Are Fueling the Rise in SOS Today\n\nOn the date of publication, William White\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2021/05/what-is-quant-crypto-11-things-for-potential-qnt-investors-to-know/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday    Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

Angela Koo   1 June 2021 6 min read             As part of the support measures to help Singaporeans affected by Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has introduced the COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T). Unlike the other measures such as the Job Support Scheme, the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund or the Rental Support Scheme, this grant is meant for affected individuals (not businesses) across all sectors.  For freelancers / self-employed persons working in affected sectors (especially the hard-hit F&B, retail, sport and performing arts sectors), this is perhaps the best news since the suddenCOVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary announcement of closures and tightened safe management measures. Particularly of note for those working in the sport and fitness industry, the CRG-T replaces the Sport and Fitness SEP Support Fund component of the Sports Resilience Package. Read Also: COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG): Are You Eligible And Alternative Support Measures If You Are Not Eligible Individuals Can Receive Up To $700 Under The COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T)) Both affected employees and self-employed persons can receive support under the CRG-T: Employees who are placed on involuntary NPL for at least one month can receive up to $700. Employees who face salary loss of at least 50% for at least one month can receive up to $500. Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) facing Net Trade Income (NTI) loss of at least 50% for at least one month, compared to their average monthly NTI in 2019 or 2020.  COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T) Is A One-Off Assistance Compared To The COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) The COVID-19 Recovery Grant -Temporary (CRG-T) is a temporary scheme that is targeted at individuals affected by the sudden closures and revenue loss due to the tightened measures of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). This grant complements the existing COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) which has been in place since January 2021 to support individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In essence, the CRG-T only provides one month of support while the CRG provides 3 months of support for each tranche (up to a maximum of 2 tranches or a total of 6 months of support).  COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T) (from 3 Jun 2021 to 2 Jul 2021)COVID-19 Recovery Grant (from 18 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021) Employees who are unemployed due to retrenchment or involuntary contract terminationN.A.Can receive up to $700 for 3 months Employees placed on involuntary no-pay leave (NPL)For at least 1 month: Can receive up to $700 one-off payoutFor at least 3 consecutive months: Can receive up to $700 for 3 months Employees who are facing salary loss of at least 50%For at least 1 month: Can receive up to $500 one-off payoutFor at least 3 consecutive months: Can receive up to $500 for 3 months SEPs who are facing loss in their net trade income (NTI) of at least 50%, compared to their average monthly NTI in 2019 or 2020For at least 1 month: Can receive up to $500 one-off payoutFor at least 3 consecutive months: Can receive up to $500 for 3 months  COVID   Story continues As the grants are meant to be complementary, current recipients of the existing CRG are not eligible for the new CRG-T. However, you can receive the CRG-T if you have received the CRG in the past and are no longer receiving CRG support in June 2021.In total, eligible individuals can receive up to 2 tranches of CRG (for a total of 6 months of support) and one tranche of support of CRG-T. This means that If you successfully applied for CRG-T, you can still apply for CRG in the future.Eligibility Criteria For COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T) Is Similar To The COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T) (from 3 Jun 2021 to 2 Jul 2021)COVID-19 Recovery Grant (from 18 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021) Citizenship and AgeSingapore Citizen or Permanent Resident, aged 21 and above Job / Income loss \u2013 Involuntary NPL for at least one month; or \u2013 Salary loss of at least 50% for at least one month  \u2013 Loss in NTI of at least 50% for at least one month, compared to average monthly NTI in 2019 or 2020, NPL/ salary loss/ income loss must have taken place between 16 May and 30 Jun 2021\u2013 Involuntarily unemployed (due to retrenchment/contract termination);  \u2013 Involuntary NPL for at least three months in a row; \u2013 Salary loss of at least 50% on average for at least three consecutive months from all jobs as a part-time or full-time employee (e.g. Jan \u2013 Mar 2021) Job loss/NPL/salary loss must have taken place after 23 Jan 2020 Prior household incomeHousehold income of not more than $7,800 or per capita household income of not more than $2,600 before job or income loss or involuntary NPL Annual Value (AV) of PropertyLiving in a property with AV not more than $21,000.

Essentially, it acts as an income supplement for individuals (e.g. fitness instructors affected by the gym closures, F&B workers affected by the cessation of dine-ins) who are hit by the sudden Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) tightened measures. Thus, the support given under the CRG-T is limited. If you are more severely affected by the pandemic, the CRG is probably a better option to apply under as it provides 3 months of support.Likewise, other government support measures such as ComCare may provide more comprehensive support for those who need more assistance. Sector-specific support such as the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund may also provide more support for eligible drivers.Read Also: Needy Singaporeans\u2019 Guide To ComCare Fund Public Assistance Schemes And EligibilityThe post COVID-19 Recovery Grant \u2013 Temporary (CRG-T): Who Can Apply And Should You Apply For This Or The COVID-19 Recover Grant (CRG)? appeared first on DollarsAndSense.sg.

Reuters \u2022 yesterday  Investors want India to lower long-bond supply in fiscal year 2026, sources say Indian bond market participants want the government to lower supply of ultra-long debt in the fiscal year that starts April 1, five treasury officials said on Monday.  India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\r\nNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, mark to market adjustments of our publicly traded equity securities, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\n\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

While systems with NVIDIA GPUs are already available now with the option of adding BlueField-2 DPUs, many applications and customer use cases may not require a GPU but can still benefit from a DPU.\nThe new servers from ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, QCT and Supermicro are ideal for enterprises seeking the additional performance, security and manageability that NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs offer.\nThe NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU is the world\u2019s leading data processing unit.\nServers that primarily run software-defined networking (for example, a stateful load balancer or distributed firewall), software-defined storage or traditional enterprise applications will all benefit from the DPU\u2019s ability to accelerate, offload and isolate infrastructure workloads for networking, security and storage.\nSystems running VMware vSphere, Windows or hyperconverged infrastructure solutions also benefit from including a DPU, whether running AI and machine learning applications, graphics-intensive workloads or traditional business applications.\nNVIDIA BlueField DPUs shift infrastructure tasks from the CPU to the DPU, making more server CPU cores available to run applications, which increases server and data center efficiency. The DPU places a \u201ccomputer in front of the computer\u201d for each server, delivering separate, secure infrastructure provisioning that is isolated from the server\u2019s application domain. This allows agentless workload isolation, security isolation, storage virtualization, remote management and telemetry on both virtualized and bare-metal servers.\nAsus, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, QCT and Supermicro have announced plans to offer servers accelerated by NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs.\nCustomers and software makers can program BlueField DPUs easily using the NVIDIA DOCA SDK, the data-center-on-a-chip architecture that simplifies application development and ensures forward and backward compatibility with the NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU, expected in 2022, and all future BlueField DPUs.\nEnterprise customers are interested in deploying DPUs in many or even all of their data center servers. The availability of DPU-accelerated servers from leading system builders makes it simple and easy for customers to buy the market-leading BlueField-2 DPU pre-installed and pre-configured with their favorite servers.\nBlueField-2 DPU-accelerated servers are expected this year, with several anticipated to submit to the NVIDIA-Certified Systems program when DPU server certification becomes available.\nMore information is available in the BlueField-2 DPU data sheet.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | NetworkingTags: Computex | NVIDIA BlueField \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

CAPE Analytics can use AI to produce detailed data on the vegetation density, roof material and proximity to surrounding structures. This provides a better way to calculate risk, as well as an avenue to help homeowners take actions to cut it.\n\u201cFor the first time, insurers can quantify defensible space- the removal of flammable material, such as vegetation from around a home- with granular analytics,\u201d said Kevin Van Leer, director of Customer Success at CAPE Analytics. \u201cCAPE allows insurance carriers to identify the vulnerability of a specific home and make recommendations to the homeowner. For example, our recent study shows that cutting back vegetation in the 10 feet surrounding a home is the most impactful action a homeowner can take to reduce their wildfire risk. It\u2019s also much easier to achieve in comparison to the frequently recommended 30-to-100 foot buffer.\u201d\nAs fire seasons grow longer and deadlier each year, and wildfires are driven by hotter, drier, and faster winds, the risk area widens into newer areas, not found on older maps. This makes up-to-date insights especially crucial.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about this dataset is that it\u2019s very recent, and it\u2019s high resolution,\u201d said Kavan Farzaneh, head of marketing at the Mountain View, Calif., based company. \u201cUsing AI, we can analyze it at scale.\u201d\nInsights from such analysis extend beyond weather risk to \u201cblue sky,\u201d or day-to-day risk, as well. Whether that means determining the condition of a roof, factoring in new solar panels or detecting the presence of a trampoline, CAPE\u2019s software seeks to optimize the underwriting process by helping insurers make more informed decisions about what policies to write.\nAnd given that the six-year-old company already boasts more than 40 insurance industry customers and is backed by investments from several large insurance carriers, including the Hartford, State Farm and CSAA, CAPE Analytics appears to be on to something.\nCreating More Accurate Records\nFor some time, insurance companies have used aerial imagery for claims verification, such as reviewing storm damage. But CAPE Analytics is converting that imagery into structured data that underwriters can use to streamline their decision-making process. The company is essentially creating more up-to-date property records, which traditionally come from tax assessor offices and other public records sources.\n\u201cWe zeroed in on property underwriting because there was a void in accuracy, and data tends to be old,\u201d said Busy Cummings, chief revenue officer at CAPE Analytics. \u201cBy using AI to tap into this objective \u2018source of truth,\u2019 we can improve the accuracy of existing data sources.\u201d\nAnd that means more efficiency for underwriters, who can avoid unnecessary inspections altogether thanks to having access to more current and complete data.\nCAPE Analytics obtains its datasets from multiple imagery partners. Human labelers tag some of the data, and the company has trained algorithms that can then identify elements of an aerial image, such as whether a roof is flat or has gables, whether additional structures have been added, or if trees and brush are overgrowing the structure.\nThe company started training its models on several NVIDIA GPU-powered servers. It has since transitioned the bulk of its training activities to Amazon Web Services P3 instances running NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nInferencing is running on the NVIDIA Triton inferencing server. CAPE Analytics relies on multiple Triton instances to run its models, with a load balancer distributing inferencing requests, allowing it to scale horizontally to meet shifting client demand. The company\u2019s infrastructure makes it possible to do live inferencing of imagery, with geospatial data converted into actionable structured data in two seconds.\nIn Pursuit of Scale\nThanks to its membership in NVIDIA Inception, the company has recently been experimenting with the NVIDIA DGX A100 AI system to train larger networks on larger datasets. Jason Erickson, director of platform engineering at CAPE Analytics, said the experience with the DGX A100 has shown \u201cwhat we could potentially achieve if we had unlimited resources.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very fortunate to be a part of NVIDIA\u2019s Inception program since 2017, which has afforded us opportunities to test new NVIDIA offerings, including data science GPU and DGX A100 systems, while engaging with the wider NVIDIA community,\u201d said Farzaneh.\nCAPE Analytics has every motivation to pursue more scale. Cummings said it has spent the past year focused on expanding from insurance underwriting into the real estate and mortgage markets, where there is demand to integrate property condition data into the tools that determine home values. The company also just announced it\u2019s powering a new automated valuation model based on geospatial data.\nWith so many potential markets to explore, CAPE Analytics has to keep pushing the envelope.\n\u201cMachine learning is such a fast-moving world. Every day there are new papers and new methods and new models,\u201d said Farzaneh. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to stay on the bleeding edge.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s work with the financial services industry.\u00a0\nFeature image credit: Paul Hanaoka on Unsplash.\n\n\nCategories: Deep LearningTags: Computer Vision | Inception | NVIDIA DGX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In tandem with the monumental growth of data, Apache Spark from Apache Software Foundation has become one of the most popular frameworks for distributed scale-out data processing, running on millions of servers\u2014both on premises and in the cloud. This chapter provides an introduction to the Spark framework and explains how it executes applications.\u00a0\nApache Spark is a fast and general purpose analytics engine for large-scale data processing, that runs on Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud. Spark offers high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel applications in Scala, Python, R, or SQL, using an interactive shell, notebooks, or packaged applications.\u00a0\nOn top of the Spark core data processing engine, there exist libraries for SQL and DataFrames, machine learning, GraphX, graph computation, and stream processing. These libraries can be used together on massive datasets from a variety of data sources, such as HDFS, Alluxio, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, or Apache Hive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Spark Executes on a Cluster \nA Spark application runs as parallel tasks inside of executor processes on cluster nodes, with execution coordinated between the SparkSession object in the driver program and the Resource or Cluster manager (either Standalone, Mesos, YARN, or Kubernetes) on the cluster.\n\nSpark can also run on a single machine, called local mode. In local mode, the driver program and the tasks run in threads in the same Java Virtual Machine.\u00a0 Local mode is useful for prototyping, development, debugging and testing.\u00a0 However local mode is not meant for running production applications.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a DataFrame from a File \nA Spark DataFrame is a distributed Dataset of org.apache.spark.sql.Row objects, that are partitioned across multiple nodes in a cluster and can be operated on in parallel. A DataFrame represents a table of data with rows and columns, similar to a DataFrame in R or Python, but with Spark optimizations. A DataFrame consists of partitions, each of which is a range of rows in cache on a data node.\n\nDataFrames can be constructed from data sources, such as csv, parquet, JSON files, Hive tables, or external databases. A DataFrame can be operated on using relational transformations and Spark SQL queries.\u00a0\nThe Spark shell or Spark notebooks provide a simple way to use Spark interactively.\u00a0 You can start the shell in local mode with the following command:\u00a0\n$ /[installation path]/bin/spark-shell --master local[2]\nYou can then enter the code from the rest of this chapter into the shell to see the results interactively.\u00a0 In the code examples, the outputs from the shell are prefaced with the result.\nFor execution coordination between your application driver and the Cluster manager, you create a SparkSession object in your program, as shown in the following code example:\nval spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Simple Application\").master(\"local[2]\").getOrCreate()\nWhen a Spark application starts, it connects to the cluster manager via the master URL. The master URL can be set to the cluster manager or local[N] to run locally with N threads, when creating the SparkSession object or when submitting the Spark application. When using the spark-shell or notebook, the SparkSession object is already created and available as the variable spark. Once connected, the cluster manager allocates resources and launches executor processes, as configured for the nodes in your cluster. When a Spark application executes, the SparkSession sends tasks to the executors to run.\n\nWith the SparkSession read method, you can read data from a file into a DataFrame, specifying the file type, file path, and input options for the schema.\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._ import org.apache.spark.sql._ import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._  val schema = \u00a0\u00a0StructType(Array( \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"vendor_id\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"passenger_count\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"trip_distance\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"pickup_longitude\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"pickup_latitude\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"rate_code\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"store_and_fwd\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"dropoff_longitude\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"dropoff_latitude\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"fare_amount\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"hour\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"year\", IntegerType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"month\", IntegerType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"day\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"day_of_week\", DoubleType), \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StructField(\"is_weekend\", DoubleType) \u00a0\u00a0))  val file = \"/data/taxi_small.csv\"  val df = spark.read.option(\"inferSchema\", \"false\") .option(\"header\", true).schema(schema).csv(file)  result:\u00a0 df: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [vendor_id: double, passenger_count: double ... 14 more fields]\nThe take method returns an array with objects from this DataFrame, which we see is of the org.apache.spark.sql.Row type.\u00a0\ndf.take(1) result:\u00a0 Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([4.52563162E8,5.0,2.72,-73.948132,40.829826999999995,-6.77418915E8,-1.0,-73.969648,40.797472000000006,11.5,10.0,2012,11,13.0,6.0,1.0])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataFrame Transformations and Actions\nDataFrames provide a domain-specific language API for structured data processing, known as transformations. Transformations create a new transformed DataFrame from the current DataFrame and are lazily evaluated. Transformations are executed when triggered by an action, which returns a result to the driver program or writes to disk. Once an action has run and the value is returned, the DataFrame is no longer in memory, unless it is cached. Spark can cache DataFrames using an in-memory columnar format by calling dataFrame.cache().\n\nHere is a list of some commonly used DataFrame transformations.\n\nselect\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Selects a set of columns\njoin\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Join with another DataFrame, using the given join expression\ngroupBy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Groups the DataFrame, using the specified columns\n\nThis groupBy transformation example groups the taxi DataFrame by hour of the day, then the\u00a0 count action totals the number of taxi trips for each hour. The show action prints out the resulting DataFrame rows in a tabular format.\u00a0\ndf.groupBy(\"hour\").count().show(4)  result:\u00a0 +----+-----+ |hour|count| +----+-----+ | 0.0| \u00a0 12| | 1.0| \u00a0 49| | 2.0|\u00a0 658| | 3.0|\u00a0 742| +----+-----+\nFollowing is a list of some commonly used DataFrame actions.\n\nshow(n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Displays the first n rows in a tabular format\ntake(n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returns the first n rows in the DataFrame in an array\ncount\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Returns the number of rows in the DataFrame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataFrame Transformation Narrow and Wide Dependencies\nThere are two types of DataFrame transformations, those with narrow dependencies and those with wide dependencies. Transformations with narrow dependencies do not have to move data between partitions when creating a new DataFrame from an existing one. An example narrow transformation is filter() which is used to filter the rows from a DataFrame based on the given SQL expression. The following example filters for the hour value = 0.\n\nMultiple narrow transformations can be performed on a DataFrame in memory, using a process called pipelining, making narrow transformations very efficient. Narrow transformations like filter and select are used in the example below to retrieve taxi fare_amounts for the 0 hour of the day.\n// select and filter are narrow transformations df.select($\"hour\", $\"fare_amount\").filter($\"hour\" === \"0.0\" ).show(2)  result: +----+-----------+ |hour|fare_amount| +----+-----------+ | 0.0| \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 10.5| | 0.0| \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 12.5| +----+-----------+\nTransformations with wide dependencies have to move data between partitions, when creating a new DataFrame from an existing one, in a process called a shuffle. Shuffles send data across the network to other nodes and write to disk, causing network and disk I/O. Example wide transformations are groupBy, agg, sortBy, and orderBy. The wide transformation shows groups by the hour value.\n\nFollowing is a wide transformation to group by the hour value and count the number of taxi trips by hour.\u00a0\ndf.groupBy(\"hour\").count().show(4)  result:\u00a0 +----+-----+ |hour|count| +----+-----+ | 0.0| \u00a0 12| | 1.0| \u00a0 49| | 2.0|\u00a0 658| | 3.0|\u00a0 742| +----+-----+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Please fill out the form below to keep reading this E-book\n\n\nWelcome back.\n\t\t\tNot you?

Following on from their decision to reduce the hash rate of the RTX 3060 in February, Nvidia will now be doing the same with all newly manufactured RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 cards to make them less desirable for crytpocurrency miners.\n\nThe new \"Lite Hash Rate\", or LHR, models of their RTX 30 series will start shipping in late May, according to a new blog post from Nvidia. Graphics card manufacturers will also be labeling these new cards as \"Lite Hash Rate\" or \"LHR\" on their box and retail product listings online to help make it clear which version you're actually buying. \n\n\n\nIntroducing the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti | The Ultimate Play\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nThe hash rate is what miners use to measure the speed of any cryptocurrency mining device, so reducing this figure will make these GPUs a lot less efficient when it comes to doing the actual mining. This reduction in hash rate only applies to newly manufactured versions of these cards, though, so any RTX 30 cards already out in the wild will still have a full-fat hash rate.\n\"We believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere,\" Nvidia's vice president of global GeForce marketing Matt Wuebbling said. \nIt's definitely a welcome step in the right direction, but whether these new LHR models will actually alleviate the current graphics card shortage remains to be seen. It certainly didn't stop the RTX 3060 from selling out in minutes when it launched back in February, and Nvidia themselves aren't expecting things to return to normal until 2022 at the very earliest.

Here's everything you need to know about Nvidia Reflex, which just got added to Rust, Rainbow Six: Siege and Overwatch.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n By Brad Chacos  \n\nMay 6, 2021 1:14 pm PDT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nImage: Nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFrames win games,\u201d Nvidia likes to say, but there\u2019s more to esports domination than raw frame rates. How those frames get delivered matters too. Latency\u2014the time it takes for an on-screen action to happen after you press a button\u2014reigns supreme in the blink-and-you\u2019re-dead competitive esports scene. If your game looks beautiful but feels sluggish, you\u2019ll find yourself outgunned by rivals playing with crummy visual settings to increase responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGeForce RTX 3080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Read our review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$1,494.68 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Nvidia Reflex, introduced alongside the GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090.\u00a0If you\u2019ve heard of it before, you probably associate it with low-latency features being added to games like Call of Duty: Warzone, Valorant, and Fortnite. But Reflex is actually Nvidia\u2019s overarching brand name for a wide range of new latency-obsessed tools. Yes, the Low Latency Mode being added to games is part of it, but on Tuesday, Nvidia and its partners are also rolling out blisteringly fast 360Hz G-Sync Esports monitors with Reflex Latency Analyzer built in. If you\u2019ve invested in compatible accessories, Reflex Latency Analyzer keeps tabs on the entire pipeline from the millisecond you click your mouse to the millisecond the game renders your gun shooting, helping you identify which parts of your system are acting as a bottleneck.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Reflex Latency Analyzer and the Reflex Low Latency Mode being introduced to leading esports games are two very different technologies, with two very different use cases, and perhaps two slightly different audiences. But they\u2019re both focused on the same underlying goal: making your games more responsive. You don\u2019t need one to use the other. And better yet, Reflex Latency Analyzer\u2019s powers let us evaluate the effectiveness of both, as well as measure how much faster your reactions would be if you invested in a pricier graphics card or a high refresh rate monitor.\nStudies have shown that lower latency can improve your shot accuracy and kill-to-death ratios in competitive esports. Today, we\u2019re going to quantify responsiveness across a wide range of scenarios. Buckle up. \n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article is updated as needed to mention the Reflex API feature coming to new titles. The most recent additions are Rust, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six: Siege.\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\n\n\n \n\n\nNvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode\nFirst, let\u2019s dig into the Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode you may already be seeing in the games you play. (For brevity, we\u2019ll call the software SDK \u201cNvidia Reflex\u201d from here on out.) If you\u2019re just interested in raw benchmark results for a wide variety of scenarios, consider jumping straight to our benchmarking section instead.\nNvidia Reflex is an optional set of APIs that developers can choose to implement in their game to reduce latency. It works particularly well in heavily GPU-bound scenarios\u2014if you\u2019re playing an esports game on a higher-resolution monitor, or crank up all the eye candy, you\u2019ll see the most significant responsiveness improvements, as you\u2019ll see in our benchmarks section.\n Nvidia\n\nHow Nvidia Reflex improves latency in games.\n\n\nTechnically, the Nvidia Reflex SDK works by zeroing out the render queue, allowing the game engine to tell the CPU to submit render work to the GPU just-in-time. That keeps your game from feeling sluggish. Because the CPU isn\u2019t under stress to supply a render queue, it can keep an eye out for mouse clicks until the last possible second, too.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nASUS ROG Chakram Wireless Aura Sync RGB Gaming Mouse Optical Sensor 16000 DPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$191.90 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nWe witnessed Reflex\u2019s increased click responsiveness when playing Valorant at 60Hz on a GeForce GTX 1660 with visual settings cranked. With Reflex active, our mouse delivered a blistering 0.5-millisecond response time across 100 clicks, comprised of mostly 0.4ms and 0.5ms clicks. With Reflex disabled, it averaged 0.6ms, with mostly 0.6ms and 0.7ms clicks. That\u2019s the most noticeable example, but across the board, we witnessed slightly better mouse latency with Reflex on. This particular benefit might be a bit hidden with the mouse we used for testing, though, as the Asus ROG Chakram Core is ludicrously fast. Most mice take several milliseconds to register a click, but this one averages 0.5ms. Hot damn.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nYou need to activate the various Nvidia Reflex features in the visual options of games that support it, like Fortnite.\n\n\nNvidia supplements Reflex with an optional \u201cBoost\u201d feature that you can choose to enable. Boost, appropriately, keeps your GPU boost clocks higher so that frames hit your display faster. That may help Reflex provide a benefit even if you\u2019re already playing with low visual settings. In games, the Nvidia Reflex menu setting has three options: Off, On, and On + Boost. Because activating Boost doesn\u2019t have any drawbacks aside from a higher power draw, there\u2019s no reason to leave it disabled if you\u2019re using Reflex.\n Nvidia\n Nvidia\nNvidia Reflex is already supported by many of the most popular shooting games around. You can use Nvidia Reflex in Fortnite, Overwatch, Rainbow Six: Siege, Valorant, Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Destiny 2,\u00a0Rust,\u00a0CRSED, Mordhau, Enlisted,\u00a0and\u00a0Warface. Better yet, the feature works with GeForce graphics cards going all the way back to the GTX 900-series. You don\u2019t need a pricey RTX 30-series GPU to use it.\nNext page:\u00a0360Hz G-Sync esports monitors with Reflex Latency Analyzer\n\n\n360Hz G-Sync esports monitors with Reflex Latency Analyzer\nThe Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode feature helps the majority of gamers out there\u2014people who want their games to both look good and feel good. The other half of Nvidia\u2019s Reflex suite focuses on esports obsessives: people who play their games on low visual settings to eke out every drop of responsiveness, and who don\u2019t mind spending money to optimize their setup.\n\n Asus\n\nThe\u00a0Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR we used for testing.\n\n\nThe Reflex Latency Analyzer comes integrated in four 360Hz G-Sync Esports monitors being unveiled Tuesday. These monitors are built around a new G-Sync processor that includes a USB pass-through port that was itself carefully tuned to avoid adding latency. Nvidia also worked with peripheral makers to create Reflex-compatible mice that send packets with exact click-timing information.\nWhen you plug a Reflex-compatible mouse into the designated USB port on the rear of your display, and configure an on-screen box to identify your muzzle flash, Reflex Latency Analyzer can measure mouse latency, PC and display latency, and an overall system latency.\n Nvidia\n\nThe Reflex Latency Analyzer found in 360Hz G-Sync Esports displays lets you measure all this.\n\n\nThat\u2019s very helpful info for latency optimization while you\u2019re tinkering with game settings or hardware upgrades. Previously, you needed a 1000fps camera or specialized testing equipment to measure overall system latency. With Reflex Latency Analyzer, it\u2019s displayed in real time via a new on-screen display in GeForce Experience.\nThe RLA overlay displays not one, not two, but ten different metrics. It\u2019s topped by FPS and render latency stats, but we\u2019re most interested in the items further down: Mouse Latency, PC + Display Latency, and System Latency. Mouse Latency speaks for itself and is tied to your Reflex mouse\u2019s left click. PC + Display Latency is \u201cMeasured from the moment the mouse click is received by the OS to the end of display latency,\u201d per Nvidia. This measurement also displayed by your monitor\u2019s on-screen display. System Latency combines the other two metrics to measure full end-to-end responsiveness. In all three items, the \u201cAverage\u201d measurement displays the average of the last 20 clicks and is more useful for analysis than the pure frame-to-frame numbers.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nNvidia\u2019s Reflex Latency Analyzer overlay in the upper-right corner of\u00a0Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.\n\n\nReflex Latency Analyzer is kicking off with four Reflex-compatible mice: The Asus ROG Chakram Core we used for testing, the Logitech G Pro Wireless, the Razer DeathAdder v2 Pro, and the SteelSeries Rival 3. You may need to download new firmware to enable Reflex support. If you don\u2019t have a Reflex-compatible mouse, Nvidia\u2019s setup can\u2019t measure your mouse latency, which prevents the full system latency from being measured as well. That said, if you have one of the most commonly used esports mice, RLA still works. From Nvidia\u2019s reviewer\u2019s guide:\n\n\u201cFor mice that have not gone through our validation process to become Reflex Latency Analyzer Compatible, there is a mouse database that stores the average latencies of known mice as well, making full System Latency analysis still possible. We will be adding new mice to the database as well as continuing to validate new per-click Reflex Latency Analyzer Compatible mice.\u201d\n\nEven if your mouse isn\u2019t supported whatsoever, you can still track PC + Display Latency with Nvidia\u2019s tools. That can be very helpful while you\u2019re optimizing your game settings or hardware setup.\n Nvidia\n\nThe monitors and mice currently compatible with Nvidia\u2019s Reflex Latency Analyzer.\n\n\nFour monitors are kickstarting the RLA ecosystem: the Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR, the Acer Predator X25, the MSI Oculux NXG253R, and the Alienware AW2521H. These are all high-end 1080p, 360Hz G-Sync monitors, rocking the same advanced G-Sync processor and even the same AU Optronics panel. While bleeding-edge refresh rates typically kick off with faster, but less vibrant (TN) panels, these debut 360Hz monitors feature dual-driver IPS panels that maintain face-melting speeds without sacrificing color. Hallelujah.\u00a0 We\u2019re testing the Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR, and the almost tactile smoothness of a 360Hz refresh rate can\u2019t be overstated. From games to mousing around the desktop, everything runs like butter, and Asus\u2019s hardware and software polish is top-notch.\nBecause these displays all use the same underlying hardware, Nvidia was able to create a new G-Sync Esports feature that provides an identical experience across monitors. Activated via your display\u2019s options menu, G-Sync Esports puts the display into high-power mode, disables variable backlighting, activates Nvidia\u2019s Dark Boost technology, and increases the gamma rating to show shadowy areas more clearly. That can impact contrast ratio aesthetics, but competitive gamers will appreciate the tactical advantage. Nvidia says it can help provide a uniform experience in high-end competitions.\n\nSetting up Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer\nGetting the Reflex Latency Analyzer running takes some work.\n Nvidia\nNvidia is releasing a new version of GeForce Experience this week that supports the technology. To see the new RLA overlay, you\u2019ll need to enable experimental features in GFE, as well as the \u201cin-game overlay\u201d option.\n Nvidia\n\nClick the gear icon\n\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, you need to press Alt + Z to summon the GFE overlay. Select the Performance option, and in the Performance tab that appears, click the tiny gear icon next to the \u201cPerformance overlay\u201d option.\n Nvidia\n\nHow to set up Nvidia\u2019s Reflex Latency Analyzer overlay.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll see a lot of options. Select Performance, choose your overlay position, and select Latency. Now, when you press Alt + R the Reflex Latency Analyzer overlay will appear onscreen.\n\n Nvidia\n\nThis Nvidia-supplied screenshot shows the Reflex Latency Analyzer monitoring box over a muzzle flash in\u00a0Destiny 2.\n\n\nYou also need to use your monitor\u2019s menu tools to tailor the technology to your specific games, and the specific animations you\u2019re tracking to measure latency. Reflex Latency Analyzer works by tracking the luminance of a specific part of the screen\u2014typically a muzzle flash. It then calculates how long it takes for that area to change after you click your mouse, to determine overall system latency. Nvidia\u2019s Reflex SDK for games includes a \u201clatency marker\u201d option that displays a flashing box on the edge of the screen to make measurements easy and universal, but currently, only Fortnite supports it. In other games, you\u2019ll need to position the monitoring rectangle\u00a0manually over your gun\u2019s muzzle flash (or whatever other animation you\u2019re measuring).\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use your monitor\u2019s OSD to move the monitoring box around.\n\n\nTo do so, head into your monitor\u2019s menu and head to the G-Sync Processor option, then the Nvidia Reflex Latency Analyzer section. From there you\u2019ll see all the options you need to resize the monitoring rectangle and move it around as needed. Get it right over the center of your muzzle flash, and make it as small as possible in the center of the action. You don\u2019t want light bloom at the edges of the flashes affecting measurements if you can help it.\nNext page: Our test setup, benchmarks begin\n\n\nOur test setup\nPhew! Now that you know everything you need to know about Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode, the Reflex Latency Analyzer tool in new 360Hz G-Sync Esports monitors, and how they\u2019re totally unrelated to each other, let\u2019s use Latency Analyzer to measure metrics that we couldn\u2019t before. Are the Nvidia Reflex options in supported games worthwhile? Does upgrading to a more powerful GPU or faster monitor truly matter? How does dropping visual options to low affect responsiveness? Now we can measure it.\n\nWe benchmarked Nvidia Reflex on our standard graphics card testing system, which includes 32GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7-8700K overclocked to 5GHz on all cores. You can find the specifics here. We tested the GeForce RTX 3080 as a high-end option, and the original GeForce GTX 1660 for a more mainstream comparison. We tested Valorant and Fortnite with Nvidia Reflex + Boost enabled.\n Nvidia\n\nThe Asus ROG Chakram Core.\n\n\nWe hooked two mice up to the system: The Reflex-capable Asus ROG Chakram Core was plugged into the G-Sync module to measure mouse latency, and we put tape over the sensor to keep it from moving during testing. A secondary mouse was used for navigation to the testing spots. We set up repeatable testing scenarios in custom matches for each game, clicked the left mouse button to trigger an action, then waited for the animation to reset completely before doing it again. We did that 20 times, jotted down the average Mouse, PC + Display, and System Latency results, then repeated the process four more times. Each result below is the average of 100 clicks, in other words.\nWe kept an eye on the monitor\u2019s real-time latency metrics throughout the process. If any given click resulted in an abnormally high latency far outside of the norm, we stopped the measurements and restarted the 20-click process over. Variables in the game, like Fortnite\u2019s day/night cycle or Counter-Strike\u2019s random chickens, can introduce small, but noticeable variations in latency results if you aren\u2019t careful.\nThe numbers below show results from the PC + Display measurement. Part of Reflex Latency Analyzer\u2019s appeal lies in its mouse metrics and the overall system latency metrics those help provide, which isn\u2019t easily measurable with other means, but they\u2019re not especially helpful unless you have multiple mice to compare against each other. Our Asus ROG Chakram Core averaged a face-melting 0.5 millisecond latency time pretty much across the board, and in the two tests where it averaged higher, it only bumped up to 0.6ms. The real latency changes across our benchmarks occurred in the PC + Display measurement, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on.\n\nNvidia Reflex latency benchmarks\nLet\u2019s start with Fortnite. Epic worked closely with Nvidia around the RTX 3080 launch, and Fortnite now supports the full Reflex SDK as well as real-time ray tracing and DLSS. The Nvidia Reflex SDK works best in GPU-bound scenarios, and activating ray tracing without DLSS makes your graphics card sweat even at 1080p. First, let\u2019s take a look at how Nvidia Reflex can help with responsiveness.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nWith the RTX 3080, using ray tracing to move the bottleneck from the CPU to the GPU can severely affect latency, but activating Nvidia Reflex claws back much of the pain. Flipping on Reflex results in a whopping fifty-plus percent latency improvement with RTX on, and it\u2019s a difference you can truly feel in the game. That\u2019s great news if you like playing with all the eye candy on, or prefer to use a higher 1440p or 4K resolution, which are more likely to become GPU-bound. With Reflex, you can have your cake and eat it too, at least to some degree.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nReflex doesn\u2019t deliver such sterling results if you aren\u2019t GPU-bound, however. With ray tracing turned off, the staggeringly powerful GeForce RTX 3080 becomes identically responsive with Reflex on or off.\nStepping down to the much more common GTX 1660 reveals Reflex\u2019s ongoing utility. That graphics card is nowhere near as powerful as the RTX 3080, and it can become GPU-bottlenecked at 1080p even with ray tracing disabled using the Epic visual preset. Turning Nvidia Reflex on significantly reduces latency with the GTX 1660 once again, bringing us down into the roughly 20-millisecond range considered optimal for competitive esports.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nRiot\u2019s Valorant has taken the world by storm, and it\u2019s an incredibly well-optimized game. Even with visual settings maxed out at 1080p, Valorant remains incredibly responsive regardless of whether you have Nvidia Reflex on or off. To put these numbers in greater context, they\u2019re roughly twice as fast as the 20ms latency mark considered the competitive esports gold standard. If your game refreshes at 60 frames per second, that works out to a new frame every 13.3ms. These results are faster than that. Damn.\nI\u2019d expect there to be more effect if the resolution were boosted to 1440p or 4K, where the GPU comes more into play, but this is a 1080p panel. I was hoping to be able to use Nvidia\u2019s Dynamic Super Resolution feature to increase the render output to 4K, but Nvidia\u2019s experts warned me that doing so wouldn\u2019t create wholly accurate metrics, due to the slight overhead that DSR imparts. Alas.\nNext page: Benchmarking refresh rates and visual settings impact\n\n\nRefresh rates and visual settings impact\nBut we can test more stuff. Those Fortnite and Valorant metrics were taken on a blistering 360Hz panel. Latency improves with higher refresh rates. Most people have a 60Hz display. How does using that more common refresh rate affect Reflex\u2019s capabilities? We locked the Asus ROG Swift PG259QNR\u2019s refresh rate to 60Hz using Nvidia Control Panel to find out. (We consulted with Nvidia to confirm that doing so wouldn\u2019t affect the Reflex Latency Analyzer\u2019s reliability.)\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nThere are a handful of takeaways here. First, note how much less responsive these games become moving from a 360Hz to a 60Hz panel\u2014there\u2019s a marked downgrade across the board compared to previous results. (We\u2019ll dive into that more later.) Reflex continues to help significantly for the GTX 1660 in Fortnite, as well as the RTX 3080 with ray tracing enabled. Valorant\u2019s responsiveness remains largely unaffected with Reflex active at 1080p.\nLet\u2019s keep that train of thought choo-chooing. We also tested Fortnite and Valorant with the monitor locked at 60Hz, 144Hz, and 360Hz refresh rates to illustrate the advantage that faster displays provide. We also threw in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive because it\u2019s massively popular\u2014and to drive home the fact that Nvidia Reflex and Reflex Latency Analyzer are mutually exclusive. CSGO doesn\u2019t support the Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode APIs, but you can still measure its latency (and the latency of any game) with Nvidia\u2019s tools. We tested all three games with the highest visual settings possible, with Reflex off and ray tracing disabled in Fortnite.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nLatency scales down as refresh rates go up, as you\u2019d expect. While upgrading to a 360Hz monitor definitely provides more responsiveness, 144Hz seems like the sweet spot, with diminishing returns thereafter\u2014especially if you\u2019re playing esports games with an ultra-potent GPU like the RTX 3080.\nNow let\u2019s do something completely different. We\u2019ve been testing these titles with maxed-out graphics settings to test the effectiveness of Nvidia Reflex, which kicks in harder the heavier your GPU is being utilized. But many competitive esports players play the exact opposite way, cranking down all the visuals to improve frame rates and response times. How does Nvidia Reflex hold up versus that standard? We tuned back Fortnite (with ray tracing off) and Valorant to find out, using the panel\u2019s full 360Hz speeds.\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\nAs you can see, playing with low visual settings remains the most responsive option. With the CPU being the bottleneck at that point, Nvidia Reflex\u2019s benefits are essentially null in standard circumstances. It even seemingly adds a bit of latency with the GTX 1660 on a 360Hz panel in Fortnite\u2014though 18.8ms remains firmly in the \u201ccompetitive-grade esports\u201d category.\nThere are two considerations to keep in mind, though. First, the bottom-rung visuals are ugly: jagged edges, low-res textures, you name it. Boosting the visuals up higher to get rid of that is worthwhile for everyone but the most competitive gamers, and Nvidia Reflex helps you claw most of the responsiveness back.\nSecond, even when you drop all visuals to low to make the CPU your bottleneck, some scenes in some games can still become GPU-bound. Nvidia\u2019s Seth Schneider highlighted a close circle toward the end of an Apex Legends map. When people start chucking thermite grenades, the game can suddenly flip to being GPU-bound, and having Nvidia Reflex on can greatly help with responsiveness in that scenario, he says.\nNext page: Bottom line\n\n\n\nBottom line\nThat was a long ride full of interesting findings. Hopefully you understand the differences between the Nvidia Reflex feature found in games and the Reflex Latency Analyzer found in monitors now. Like I said, they\u2019re two very different tools with two very different uses, but both can help you become a better esports player.\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss the Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode feature in games. It won\u2019t help you across the board, but it can improve latency significantly if you become GPU-bound, roughly doubling responsiveness in situations where your graphics card is stressed. That\u2019s huge for casual esports gamers. Nvidia Reflex can let you bump up visual details while keeping your games responsive. That\u2019s an all-around win for your gaming experience. Better yet, activating Reflex never really hurts responsiveness. There\u2019s no reason not to turn it on. This is a fantastic technology that can give you a real edge over your competition, as studies have shown that player accuracy and kill-to-death rates improve as latency goes down.\n\n\n \n\n\nI suspect Reflex would be even more beneficial at 1440p and 4K resolutions, but the panel we used for testing is a 1080p display, and we need its analyzing tools to measure latency metrics. (We\u2019d love to see 1440p, 144Hz monitors with Reflex Latency Analyzer inside.) Definitely try it though; since they\u2019ve integrated the Reflex API, both Fortnite and Valorant now include an option to show some latency metrics onscreen in the game itself. You can use those to see if turning Reflex on makes a difference on your system even if you don\u2019t have a 360Hz G-Sync Esports display, and to be honest, you\u2019ll probably feel it if Reflex drops latency significantly. It\u2019s very noticeable in the\u00a0Fortnite\u00a0scenarios that show the biggest improvements.\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\nYou can see\u00a0Valorant\u2019s native latency monitoring graphs underneath the RLA overlay in this screenshot.\n\n\nSpeaking of those 360Hz G-Sync Esports monitors, they\u2019re also very useful, but aiming for a very different crowd\u2014very competitive and deep-pocketed esports fanatics. Asus hasn\u2019t announced pricing for the luxurious ROG Swift PG259QNR display we used for testing, but the non-\u201cR\u201d ROG Swift PG259QN model that lacks Reflex Latency Analyzer capabilities costs $700. Expect to pay more for this fancier model.\n\nYou get a lot for your money, though. Playing on a 360Hz IPS monitor is simply sublime. Everything feels so\u00a0smooth. Both the visual quality of the panel and the build quality of Asus\u2019s monitor are top notch. This thing rocks. Reflex Latency Analyzer is almost just a value-adding cherry on top.\n Asus\n\nYou need to plug your mouse into a specific USB port on the rear of your monitor to use Nvidia\u2019s Reflex Latency Analyzer.\n\n\nThat\u2019s generally where I fall on Reflex Latency Analyzer for actual gamers. The technology is wonderful for reviewers like myself, allowing us to test the variety of latency scenarios we walked through earlier. For normal people and casual gamers, it\u2019s overkill.\nBut if you\u2019re the sort of person who is willing to invest hundreds and hundreds of dollars into a 360Hz display for peak competitive performance anyway, you\u2019ll probably find Reflex Latency Analyzer invaluable. Being able to see the latency impact created by hardware changes and by tweaking specific visual settings in games can help you fine-tune things so your game looks good and feels great, especially if you\u2019re using the Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode in games. There\u2019s a lot you could play with. Nvidia\u2019s Reflex Latency Analyzer is a godsend for optimization geeks.\nA big part of the appeal lies in Reflex Latency Analyzer\u2019s ability to measure mouse responsiveness for true end-to-end system latency, but that\u2019s the least compelling reason to buy in, at least for now. Yes, measuring system latency used to take much more equipment. But today, only four mice support Reflex Latency Analyzer. Once I realized the Asus ROG Chakram Core mouse included in my reviewer kit delivered 0.5ms of average latency across the board, I couldn\u2019t really do anything else with the information. It just is what it is. Once more mice add Reflex Latency Analyzer support, or once Nvidia adds a wider array of average latency data for unsupported mice to its database, the feature will be more compelling. (Currently, Nvidia\u2019s database provides average click latency data for the top 30 esports mice, as tabulated by ProSettings.net, with plans to add more.)\n\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n Brad Chacos/IDG\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nASUS ROG Chakram Wireless Aura Sync RGB Gaming Mouse Optical Sensor 16000 DPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n$191.90 at  Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\nThis ROG Chakram Core is just as potent as the 360Hz ROG Swift monitor, though. Top-tier gaming mice, including the others with Reflex Latency Analyzer support, take several milliseconds to register a click. The ROG Chakram Core sends its signals in half a millisecond. It\u2019s insane, and you can feel it in moment-to-moment gameplay. If you\u2019re a competitive esports gamer, check it out even if you aren\u2019t interested in the 360Hz G-Sync Esports display ecosystem.\nBottom line? Nvidia Reflex can help make you a better esports gamer, regardless of which facet you\u2019re examining. The Nvidia Reflex Low Latency Mode feature can drastically improve responsiveness if you like games to both look good and feel great. There\u2019s no reason not to turn it on. The Reflex Latency Analyzer in 360Hz G-Sync Esports monitors serves a much more niche crowd and needs fuller ecosystem support to truly shine, but if you\u2019re invested in esports enough to even consider picking up a 360Hz panel, you\u2019ll find it an invaluable tool in your tinkering. We\u2019re excited by what Nvidia\u2019s trying to nurture here.\nIf you want to go even deeper down the latency rabbit hole, this highly technical Nvidia explainer describing the Reflex suite of technologies is highly recommended.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Notice\nEuropean Privacy Settings\nMember Preferences\nEditorial independence\nLicensing & Eprints\nCalifornia: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nAd Choice\nContact Us\nFoundry Careers\nGamePro\nSmart Answers\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPCWorld Categories \n\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nStorage\nDeals\nTechHive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe \n\n\n\n\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nDigital Magazine - Info\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 IDG Communications, Inc. \n\n\n\nExplore the Foundry Network +\nTech AdvisorMacworld \n\n\n\n\nTop Of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell My Info\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy Settings\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The NVIDIA Kepler GPU architecture has been supported for generations but as time goes by, older GPU architectures are removed from official support lists.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Enters The AI PC Realm With DGX Spark & DGX Station Desktops: 72 Core Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, Up To 784 GB MemoryNVIDIA ended driver support for its Fermi (GeForce 400 / 500 Series) back in 2018, moving it to legacy status. The same is expected to happen with the Kepler-based GeForce 600 / 700 series when NVIDIA moves beyond R470 drivers. The last DRV drivers (regular driver release branch) are going to ship for the next few months before a new driver/feature brand is introduced & support finally ends for the Kepler generation.\n\nLooking back at Kepler, the GPU architecture brought NVIDIA back in the fight with mainstream chips competing against flagship parts from AMD. NVIDIA also focused a lot on efficiency which made it win in latter generations such as Maxwell and Pascal. The Kepler series did take a huge blow when AMD fired back with its Hawaii GPUs in 2013 but lept back in the game with Maxwell, a year later. The following chart from NVIDIA shows the CUDA and driver support plan for current GPU architectures:\nNVIDIA GPU driver branches roadmap.

We are going to be covering the NVIDIA Computex 2021 keynote live ahead of a big NVIDIA GPU server review a few hours later. Please excuse typos as this is being done live for the keynote to end a long Memorial Day holiday weekend in the US.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 Keynote Coverage\nNVIDIA started this keynote off by, delaying about 15 minutes. More to come as the presentation starts.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 Keynote Troll\nSince we were pre-briefed on the enterprise news, there is a good chance that this is going to be a GeForce-heavy presentation. Kicking off, some fun numbers in terms of NVIDIA\u2019s gaming TAM:\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 Keynote Favorite Entertainment Activity\nAs expected, the NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Ti just made its debut.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Ti\nNVIDIA says that the new card is roughly equivalent to 1.5x\u00a0GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\u2018s.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Ti Performance\nIn terms of key specs, we get 12GB of GDDR6X memory and NVIDIA says it will be \u201cavailable\u201d on June 3 for $1199.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Ti Specs\nBeyond the 3080 Ti, there is a lower-end card, the NVIDIA GeForce 3070 Ti which the company says is around 1.5x a RTX 2070 Super at $599 with 8GB of GDDR6X memory.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 NVIDIA GeForce 3070 Ti Specs\nFor many STH readers, this is going to sound great, except it will do little to help availability. We are very excited for the RTX 3080 Ti with 12GB of memory as that may be a very useful SKU for our lab. We can also see that NVIDIA is keeping the 3000 series design language with the coolers which means that these will be less useful in higher-density scenarios with the Founders Edition cooler so we will have to hope for blower-style coolers to hit the market.\nOn the enterprise side, NVIDIA is pushing more into its model with support offerings. Here is an interesting slide with some of NVIDIA\u2019s AI ecosystem.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 AI Stats\nNVIDIA is discussing the DPU. Since we just covered\u00a0A Quick Look at Logging Into a Mellanox NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU and\u00a0DPU vs SmartNIC and the STH NIC Continuum Framework we are going to point our readers there.\n\nNVIDIA has its Base Command tool to make the management of AI clusters and jobs easy. This is similar to the Inspur AIStation for AI Cluster Operations Management Solution that we took a look at last year, but NVIDIA is offering this and will be bringing it to the DGX along with AWS and GCP.\nNVIDIA Computex 2021 NVIDIA Base Command\nThe NVIDIA DGX SUPERPOD is not available as a subscription model. NVIDIA will host the DGX Superpod infrastructure and then lease the infrastructure to customers, similar to its public cloud customers that also resell hosted chips.

Porsche Engineering finds out the key to Nvidia\u2019s success, why it is a leader in the AI \u200b\u200bfield and its vision for the future.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen\n\n\n\nclose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDrivers who are guided by a navigations system will be familiar with a problem: if the lanes of a road are close together, the system cannot recognise which lane the vehicle is in. GPS is not precise enough for this \u2013 it can only determine the position to within two to 10 metres \u2013 but Porsche Engineering is working on a system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to calculate a more precise position from GPS data. \u201cThis makes it possible, for example, to identify the ideal line on a race track,\u201d says Dr. Joachim Schaper, Senior Manager of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data at Porsche Engineering. The necessary calculations can be performed in the vehicle itself, in a compact computer equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs). \u201cThis brings AI functionality to the vehicle,\u201d says Schaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara: around 13,800 people work for the California-based company.\n\nThe hardware platform is manufactured by Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California. \u201cWhen you hear the name, you don\u2019t necessarily think of the automotive sector,\u201d says Schaper. Most PC users associate Nvidia primarily with graphics cards. Or rather: especially fast graphics cards, such as those required for gaming. This reputation dates back to the early 2000s, when the first games with elaborate 3D graphics came onto the market. Those who wanted to play games like Quake 3 or Far Cry without their screen jerking needed powerful hardware. Among gamers, a favourite quickly crystallised: the GeForce graphics card from Nvidia. It became a best-seller and catapulted the company, founded in 1993, into the top ranks of hardware manufacturers. At the turn of the millennium, the company was turning over three billion US dollars.\nAI researchers as\u00a0new group of customers\nIn the early 2010s, Nvidia noticed that a completely new group of customers had appeared on the scene who were not interested in computer games: AI researchers. Word had spread in the scientific community that GPUs were perfectly suited for complex calculations in the field of machine learning. If, for example, an AI algorithm is to be trained, GPUs that perform computing steps in a highly parallel fashion are clearly superior to conventional sequential processors (central processing units \u2013 or CPUs) and can significantly reduce computing times. GPUs quickly developed into the workhorses of AI research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology for autonomous driving: Nividia's Drive-AGX Pegasus hardware enables robotics, among other things. The company also trains neural networks in its own data centres.\n\nNvidia recognised the opportunity earlier than the competition and brought the first hardware optimised for AI to the market in 2015. The company immediately focused on the automotive sector: the company\u2019s first computing platform for use in cars was presented under the label Nvidia Drive. The PX 1 was able to\u00a0process images from 12 connected cameras and simultaneously execute programmes for collision avoidance or driver monitoring. It had the computing power of more than 100 notebooks. Several manufacturers used the platform to bring the first prototypes of autonomous vehicles to the road.\nSteady growth in the automotive sector\nInitially, Nvidia relied on a pure hardware strategy and supplied the OEMs with processors. Currently, business in the automotive sector has two pillars: cockpit graphics systems and hardware for autonomous or computer-assisted driving. Sales in the automotive sector grew steadily between 2015 and 2020, but still represent a low share of overall sales. Last year, Nvidia\u2019s sales in the automotive sector amounted to 700 million US dollars, which corresponds to a good six percent of total sales; however, sales are increasing by nine percent per year. Jensen Huang, Founder and CEO of Nvidia, sees great market opportunities here. \u201cThe cars of tomorrow are rolling AI supercomputers. Only two of the numerous control units will remain: one for autonomous driving and one for the user experience,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen Huang, CEO and founder of Nvidia\n\nTo gain an even stronger foothold in the automotive world, Nvidia has changed its strategy: the company no longer focuses solely on chips, but offers a complete package of hardware and software. \u201cCustomers can put together their own solution and save on basic development,\u201d explains Ralf Herrtwich, Senior Director Automotive Software at Nvidia. An OEM that wants to offer a semi-autonomous vehicle, for example, can obtain both the hardware for evaluating the camera images and pre-trained neural networks from Nvidia \u2013 for example, one that automatically recognises traffic signs. Unlike other manufacturers, this modular system is open. \u201cAll interfaces can be viewed. The OEM can thus adapt the system to its own requirements,\u201d explains Herrtwich. In theory, a manufacturer can use pre-trained neural networks from Nvidia and then combine them with in-house developments.\nNvidia products are System-on-a-Chip\nThrough this strategy of openness, the American company aims to gain as many OEMs as possible as users, which ultimately also drives the development of the products. \u201cWe can best optimise our hardware if we know how it is used,\u201d explains Herrtwich. He offers an example: most Nvidia products are System-on-a-Chip (SoC). This means that a processor is combined with other electronic components on a semiconductor.\u00a0The automotive sector uses chips with built-in video inputs to which external cameras are connected. But how many inputs are needed? And how should the network connection be designed? Such questions can only be answered in close contact with the users, says Herrtwich. AI expert Schaper has a similar view: \u201cThe input from other OEMs is important.\u201d In the current phase, it is crucial to jointly accelerate the development processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRalf Herrtwich, Senior Director Automotive Software at Nvidia\n\nIn addition to hardware and software, Nvidia also offers closely cooperating OEMs access to its own infrastructure. For example, manufacturers can collaborate on training neural networks in Nvidia data centres, where thousands of GPUs work in parallel. After all, a self-driving algorithm must first learn to recognise a pedestrian, a tree, or another vehicle. To do this, it is fed millions of images from real traffic on which the corresponding objects have been manually marked. Through trial and error, the algorithm learns to identify them. This process requires a lot of work (such as labelling the objects) and requires high computer capacities. Nvidia handles both. Car manufacturers can thus access an artificial intelligence that has virtually been in school for several years.\nThree questions to Ralf Herrtwich\nWhen does artificial intelligence (AI) arrive in the car?\nIt\u2019s already in the cockpit, for example. Many manufacturers offer voice control based on AI. The performance of these systems has improved noticeably in recent years. In addition, the vehicle is increasingly expected to perceive its environment and react appropriately, as is the case in assistance systems. Here, too, AI is playing a growing role. Such vehicle applications are among the most demanding of all. We expect this area to advance AI as a whole.\nWhen will autonomous driving become a reality?\nRobotic vehicles are already being used in localised areas, especially in places where the weather is good. However, for the time being we see the main market for regular vehicles with support functions, that is autonomy levels one to three. Overall, the coming years will be characterised by a competition between such systems \u2013 that is by the question of which manufacturer\u2019s system can master most situations. It is less about the aspiration of being completely self-controlled.\nHow does artificial intelligence change the automotive ecosystem?\nThe more important software functions become, the more the role of tier one suppliers changes. Their traditionally strong ties to manufacturers are weakening. In the future we can imagine a triangular constellation: OEMs work with technology companies like Nvidia on processors and software modules, and tier one builds the control unit. Some OEMs already attach importance to keeping software functions in their own hands.\nWhy GPUs are the better AI computers\nGPUs are specialised in performing geometric calculations: rotating a body on the screen, zooming in or out. GPUs (graphics processing units) are particularly good at performing the matrix and vector calculations required for this. This is an advantage in the development of neural networks. They are similar to the human brain and consist of several layers in which data is processed and passed on to the next layer. To train them, matrix multiplications are key\u2014in other words, exactly the specialty of GPUs.\nIn addition, these computer architectures have a lot of memory to store intermediate results and models efficiently. The third strength of GPUs is that they can process several data blocks simultaneously. The processors contain thousands of so-called shader units, each of which is quite simple and slow. However, these computing units can process parallelisable tasks much faster than conventional processors (central processing units, CPUs). When training neural networks, for example, graphics processors reduce the time required by up to 90 per cent.\nInfo\nText: Constantin Gillies\nContributor: Dr. Joachim Schaper\nText first published in the Porsche Engineering Magazine, issue 1/2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Porsche Engineering\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Download\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload text\n\nPDF\n1 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Media enquiries\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederic Damk\u00f6hler\nSenior Manager Corporate Communications Porsche Engineering\n\n\nfrederic.damkoehler@porsche.de\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                                                Show contact\n                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen\n\n\n\nclose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Related Content\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Innovation\n                    \n22/01/2021\n\n\n\n\n                            Oliver Seifert: \u201cThere are no limits to your imagination\u201d\n                        \n\n\n                        Dr. Oliver Seifert and Dirk Lappe in conversation about the future of E/E development.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Innovation\n                    \n25/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n                            Porsche demonstrates autonomous driving in the workshop\n                        \n\n\n                        The demonstration in Ludwigsburg is part of a collaboration with \u201cKopernikus Automotive\u201d.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Innovation\n                    \n13/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n                            Autonomous driving: Booster for AI calculations\n                        \n\n\n                        The computing capacity required for AI is provided by special chips specialized in parallel computing. \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Innovation\n                    \n07/02/2020\n\n\n\n\n                            Consequences of software decisions: The conscience of artificial intelligence\n                        \n\n\n                        Professor Christoph L\u00fctge heads one of the world\u2019s first research institutes for the ethics of artificial intelligence. \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Contact\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                        Newsletter\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                        Legal notice\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                        Privacy Policy\n                    \n\n\n\n\n                        Consumption/Emissions\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nChina\n\n\nCzech Republic\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nItaly\n\n\nLatin America (Spanish)\n\n\nMiddle East & Africa\n\n\nRomania\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nSwitzerland (French)\n\n\nSwitzerland (German)\n\n\nSwitzerland (Italian)\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Dr. Ing. h.c.

They can no longer afford to spend time designing and building custom hardware every time they need to deploy another accelerated application.\nThe NVIDIA-Certified Systems program answers this need by bringing together NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA networking in systems from leading vendors. The systems conform to NVIDIA\u2019s design best practices and pass a set of certification tests that validate the best configurations for performance, manageability, scalability and security.\nBy choosing an NVIDIA-Certified System, enterprises can confidently choose preconfigured, performance-optimized servers to power accelerated computing workloads at any scale.\nNew Partners, GPU Choices\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA-Certified Systems program has seen tremendous uptake since first announced in January. New systems have been certified from partners such as ASUS, Atos, BOXX Technologies, Fujitsu, New H3C Information Technologies, Lenovo, Nettrix and QCT.\nCertifications also now include the NVIDIA A40, for the best graphics capabilities, and the NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU, for more economical, lower-powered systems. These are in addition to the NVIDIA A100, for customers seeking the best compute performance. For a complete list of supported GPU and networking components, see the NVIDIA-Certified Systems page.\nSome of the newest NVIDIA-Certified System vendors\nTo date, we have almost 40 NVIDIA-Certified Systems from nearly a dozen partners, with more being added every month. Consult the Qualified Server Catalog page to see which servers and GPUs have been certified, or ask your preferred vendor which certified servers they have available. We\u2019ll be adding new NVIDIA GPUs to the certification program in the future, including the recently announced A30 and A10.\nExpanded Workload Coverage\nOne of the main benefits of using an NVIDIA-Certified System is the configuration that allows for a wider variety of accelerated workloads. The certification test suite checks the performance and functionality of each server design by running a set of software that represents real-world applications of many types.\nSince the introduction of this program, we\u2019ve expanded the certification test suite to encompass a greater range of representative workloads and exercise the servers in even more ways. Some of the applications that are part of the testing include:\n\nDeep learning training with TensorFlow and PyTorch, including multi-node training\nAI inference with TensorRT and Triton Inference Server\nData science with RAPIDS and Apache Spark\nCore acceleration algorithms with CUDA and the NVIDIA HPC SDK\nBatch rendering with Blender, Octane, Redshift and V-Ray\n\nThe tests also include end-to-end AI application workflows, which can exercise a system in multiple ways and validate good configurations for real-life use. These tests are performed using NVIDIA AI frameworks from the NVIDIA NGC catalog such as: NVIDIA DeepStream for intelligent video analytics, NVIDIA Clara for healthcare applications and NVIDIA Riva\u00a0for conversational AI.\nIn addition, there are a number functional tests designed to ensure that servers are configured for best manageability, security and scalability. These tests include:\n\nRemote management with Redfish\nHost security with TPM, ChipSec and UEFI\nNetwork performance\nAccelerated data transfer using GPUDirect RDMA and GPUDirect Storage\n\nIn summary, the test suite simulates the applications and use cases that enterprise customers will encounter in data centers. The systems must pass the performance threshold for all these different tests and only then are they certified.\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems test suite areas\nFully Supported Enterprise Software\u00a0\nFor companies looking to bring modern accelerated computing from the realm of data science and developers into their mainstream applications, NVIDIA is now offering fully supported, enterprise-grade software packages.\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems provide the server platform for running these applications. The systems\u2019 optimized design, predictable performance and ability to scale out make them the best choice for businesses that want to implement an enterprise-grade accelerated computing solution.\nAnnounced last month at NVIDIA GTC:\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise \u2014 an end-to-end, cloud-native suite of\u202fAI and data analytics software that is optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA to run on VMware vSphere with NVIDIA-Certified Systems. It includes key enabling technologies\u202fand software from NVIDIA for\u202frapid deployment, management and scaling of AI workloads\u202fin the modern hybrid cloud\u00a0 NVIDIA runs tests of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to validate optimal performance and functionality on vSphere with NVIDIA-Certified Systems.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise \u2014 a revolutionary platform for virtual collaboration and true-to-reality simulation. Globally dispersed teams can accelerate their workflows with one-click interoperability between leading software tools and seamlessly collaborate in a shared virtual world. The platform includes licensable software and full enterprise support. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise is optimized to run on NVIDIA-Certified Systems in the data center, as well as NVIDIA RTX laptops and workstations.\n\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems Configuration Guide\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems are validated to have the best base configuration for running general accelerated computing workloads. Customers can adjust this configuration to better match the primary workload they intend to run on these systems. For example, if they plan to do deep learning training on large models, then they might want to add more GPUs to their servers.\nTo assist customers with this process, the NVIDIA-Certified Systems Configuration Guide provides the server topology and system configuration recommendations for inference and deep learning training, with other workloads to be added in the future. The guide details component sizing and balancing, PCIe topology, storage and more. When a customer wishes to adjust the base configuration of an NVIDIA-Certified System, they can use this new guide to ensure they maintain an optimized design.\nLearn more about NVIDIA-Certified Systems with these resources:\n\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems web page\nOn-demand webinar\u00a0\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems data sheet\nFind an NVIDIA Certified System\n\n\n\nCategories: Data Center \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia's Tuesday announcement confirmed that most consumer-grade GPUs coming out of the company's factories, ranging from the RTX 3060 Ti to the RTX 3080, will ship with a new sticker to indicate a \"Lite Hash Rate,\" or \"LHR,\" on the hardware, driver, and BIOS level.\nIf this move sounds familiar, that's because Nvidia already took a massive swing at the cryptomining problem, only to whiff, with February's RTX 3060. That GPU's launch came with promises that its Ethereum mining rates had been cut in half from their full potential rate\u2014a move meant to disincentivize miners from buying up limited stock. And in the GPU's pre-release period, Nvidia PR Director Bryan Del Rizzo claimed on Twitter that \"it's not just a driver thing. There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.\"\nYet shortly after that card's commercial launch, Nvidia released\u00a0a developer-specific beta firmware driver that unlocked the GPU's full mining potential. Remember: that's firmware, not a BIOS rewrite or anything particularly invasive. With that cat out of the bag, the RTX 3060 forever became an Ethereum mining option.\n\u201cA different device hardware ID\u201d\nAll of this brings us to this week's news and Nvidia's\u00a0new assurance that this time, scout's honor, a beta driver leak won't do the same thing to LHR versions of the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, or RTX 3080. The $1,499 RTX 3090 isn't slated to receive an LHR version as of press time, and Nvidia has not indicated that existing RTX GPUs will be affected.\nThe company's blog post doesn't go into technical details on what's different this time around. Instead, Wccftech delivers additional context, albeit without any citations to either Nvidia representatives or other leakers, about the new, mildly tweaked SKUs for these GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Wccftech's estimation, the biggest difference is a \"different device hardware ID\" on these SKUs that will give Nvidia \"an additional parameter\" to block older, crytpo-friendly BIOS firmware versions. In our estimation, without another errant beta firmware leak, this will leave miners with a difficult\u2014but not impossible\u2014challenge to overcome.\nWccftech also points to the new RTX 3000 series' SKUs, including one welcome perk out of the box: the cards' VBIOSes\u00a0are all pre-patched to support Resizable BAR. Current GPU owners who want to take advantage of the IO-minded update must take the unusual step of updating their own GPUs' VBIOS.\nBut Nvidia has once again only mentioned Ethereum in its anti-mining appeals, which is a reminder that other algorithms are out there in the wild and arguably not as affected by Nvidia's top-level hardware update. [Update, 2:18 pm EDT: In an email interview with Ars, Del Rizzo clarifies that \"Ethereum represents more than 90 percent of GPU-mineable coin rewards, so that's our focus currently.\" He also points to the new SKUs' hashing rate being affected by \"a similar process to what we announced with the original RTX 3060, in that the lite hash rate uses a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX GPU silicon, and the BIOS (firmware).\"]\nToday's announcement also leaves out the fact that Nvidia is happy to sell crypto-unlocked versions of the same GPUs, which they've dubbed Cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMPs), albeit at higher prices and with their video-out functionality stripped out. While Nvidia hasn't formally announced the CMP cards'\u00a0prices and availability, TechRadar spotted an entry-level Nvidia CMP with a hash rate comparable to a hobbled RTX 3060 (whose MSRP is $329) priced at approximately $720 at a Romanian reseller.\nTuesday's Nvidia blog post concludes with an assurance that \"we believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere.\" But in a marketplace savaged by chip shortages and aggressive scalpers, and with a product line that has already taken one botched stab at crypto-halving measures, we're not convinced that miners won't swoop in to buy Nvidia's LHR models and take their chances. Either way, with CMPs on the rise in Nvidia's sales portfolio, we're confident this isn't the last of Nvidia's assurances about anti-mining efforts in consumer-grade cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The chip shortage is driving up tech prices\u2013starting with TVs\n          \n\n            Some high-end televisions already cost 30% more than they did last summer.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Sam Machkovech\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    178 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

A GPU, of course. Who knew, though, that these parallel processing powerhouses could have a way with words, too.\nFollowing a long string of victories for computers in other games \u2014 chess in 1997, go in 2016 and Texas hold\u2019em poker in 2019 \u2014 a GPU-powered AI has beaten some of the world\u2019s most competitive word nerds at the crossword puzzles that are a staple of every Sunday paper.\nDr.Fill, the crossword puzzle-playing AI created by Matt Ginsberg \u2014 a serial entrepreneur, pioneering AI researcher and former research professor \u2014 scored higher than any humans last month at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament.\nDr.Fill\u2019s performance against more than 1,300 crossword enthusiasts comes after a decade of playing alongside humans through the annual tournament.\nSuch games, played competitively, test the limits of how computers think and help researchers better understand how people do, Ginsberg explains. \u201cGames are an amazing environment,\u201d he says.\nDr.Fill\u2019s edge? A sophisticated neural network developed by UC Berkeley\u2019s Natural Language Processing team \u2014 trained in just days on an NVIDIA DGX-1 system and deployed on a PC equipped with a pair of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPUs \u2014 that snapped right into the system Ginsberg had been refining for years.\nA way with words: A pair of NVIDIA RTX 2080 Tis powered a sophisticated neural network developed by UC Berkeley\u2019s Natural Language Processing team.\n\u201cCrossword fills require you to make these creative multi-hop lateral connections with language,\u201d says Professor Dan Klein, who leads the Natural Language Processing team. \u201cI thought it would be a good test to see how the technology we\u2019ve created in this field would handle that kind of creative language use.\u201d\nGiven that unstructured nature, it\u2019s amazing that a computer can compete at all. And to be sure, Dr.Fill still isn\u2019t necessarily the best, and that\u2019s not only because the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament\u2019s official championship is reserved only for humans.\nThe contest\u2019s organizer, New York Times Puzzle Editor Will Shortz, pointed out that Dr.Fill\u2019s biggest advantage is speed: it can fill in answers in an instant that humans have to type out. Judged solely by accuracy, however, Dr.Fill still isn\u2019t the best, making three errors during the contest, worse than several human contestants.\nNevertheless, Dr.Fill\u2019s performance in a challenge that, unlike more structured games such as chess or go, rely so heavily on real-world knowledge and wordplay is remarkable, Shortz concedes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing they have programmed a computer to solve crosswords \u2014 especially some of the tricky hard ones,\u201d Shortz said.\nA Way with Words\nGinsberg, who holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Oxford and has 100 technical papers, 14 patents and multiple books to his name, has been a crossword fan since he attended college 45 years ago.\nBut his obsession took off when he entered a tournament more than a decade ago and didn\u2019t win.\n\u201c\u2018The other competitors were so much better than I was, and it annoyed me, so I thought \u2018Well, I should write a program,\u2019 so I started Dr.Fill,\u201d Ginsberg says.\nOrganized by Shortz, the American Crossword Tournament is packed with people who know their way around words.\nDr.Fill made its debut at the competition in 2012. Despite high expectations, Dr.Fill only managed to place 141st out of 600 contestants. Dr.Fill never managed a top 10 finish until this year.\nIn part, that\u2019s because crosswords didn\u2019t attract the kind of richly funded efforts that took on \u2014 and eventually beat \u2014 the best humans at chess and go.\nIt\u2019s also partly because crossword puzzles are unique. \u201cIn go and chess and checkers, the rules are very clear,\u201d Ginsberg says. \u201cCrosswords are very interesting.\u201d\nCrossword puzzles often rely on cryptic clues that require deep cultural knowledge and an extensive vocabulary, as well as the ability to find answers that best slide into each puzzle\u2019s overlapping rows and columns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a messy thing,\u201d Shortz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not purely logical like chess or even like Scrabble, where you have a word list and every word is worth so many points.\u201d\nCrossword puzzles often rely on cryptic clues that require deep cultural knowledge and an extensive vocabulary.\nA Winning Combination\nThe game-changer? Help from the Natural Language Processing team. Inspired by his efforts, the team reached out to Ginsberg a month before the competition began.\nIt proved to be a triumphant combination.\nThe Berkeley team focused on understanding each puzzle\u2019s often gnomic clues and finding potential answers. Klein\u2019s team of three graduate students and two undergrads took the more than 6 million examples of crossword clues and answers that Ginsberg had collected and poured them into a sophisticated neural network.\nGinsberg\u2019s software, refined over many years, then handled the task of ranking all the answers that fit the confines of each puzzle\u2019s grid and fitting them in with overlapping letters from other answers \u2014 a classic constraint satisfaction problem.\nWhile their systems relied on very different techniques, they both spoke the common language of probabilities. As a result, they snapped together almost perfectly.\n\u201cWe quickly realized that we had very complementary pieces of the puzzle,\u201d Klein said.\nTogether, their models parallel some of the ways people think, Klein says. Humans make decisions by either remembering what worked in the past or using a model to simulate of what might work in the future.\n\u201cI get excited when I see systems that do some of both,\u201d Klein said.\nThe result of combining both approaches: Dr.Fill played almost perfectly.\nThe AI made just three errors during the tournament. Its biggest edge, however, was speed. It dispatched most of the competition\u2019s puzzles in under a minute.\nAI Supremacy Anything But Assured\nBut since, unlike chess or go, crossword puzzles are ever-changing, another such showing isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that the constructors will throw some curveballs,\u201d Shortz said.\nGinsberg says he\u2019s already working to improve Dr.Fill. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who makes more progress.\u201d\nThe result may be out to be even more engaging crossword puzzles than ever.\n\u201cIt turns out that the things that are going to stump a computer are really creative,\u201d Klein said.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Matt Ginsberg on Building a GPU-Powered Crossword Solver to Take on Top Word Nerds \u2013 Ep. 146\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Only nine months after its launch, NVIDIA Reflex has launched in top titles including Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, and Valorant.\nNow, we\u2019re announcing that Reflex is coming to Escape From Tarkov, CrossFire HD, War Thunder and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT. Soon, 12 of the top 15 competitive shooters will support NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75% of GeForce gamers play competitive games - we invented NVIDIA Reflex for them. The difference between winning and losing is a matter of milliseconds. On average, Reflex reduces system latency by 20 milliseconds, getting the PC out of the way so a gamer\u2019s real skill can come into play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019re announcing that 5 new G-SYNC monitors, and 6 mice are adding support for the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer. This enables competitive players and esports professionals to precisely measure input end-to-end system latency, and if the number\u2019s too high for their liking, tweak their system. When championships and sponsorships are on the line, every millisecond counts.\nFor all the details, keep on reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Games Are Introducing NVIDIA Reflex\nEscape From Tarkov\nBattlestate Games\u2019 Escape From Tarkov is an extremely popular, hardcore first-person tactical action game, with RPG, simulation and MMO elements. During Raids, players risk it all, potentially losing hard-fought-for gear to other players, and significant progress if they fail to insure their possessions before challenging others online. With death lurking around every corner, and stakes being so high, reducing system latency is key.\nIn the near future, players with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU will have the opportunity to enable NVIDIA Reflex. The difference between success and failure, life and death, is mere milliseconds, and with NVIDIA Reflex players get a significant boost to their competitiveness.\nTake a first look at NVIDIA Reflex in Escape From Tarkov in our new video, below, and stay tuned to GeForce.com to learn when exactly this game-changing technology will be available in-game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWar Thunder\nGaijin Entertainment\u2019s War Thunder is an extremely popular free-to-play, cross-platform PvP game, dedicated to aviation, armoured vehicles, and naval craft from World War II and the Cold War. Players use aircraft, attack helicopters, tanks and naval ships to compete in battle, and with a single well-placed shot enemy vehicles can be eliminated, making fast performance and low system latency key to success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the addition of NVIDIA DLSS in November, War Thunder has now added support for NVIDIA Reflex, decreasing system latency by up to 43%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable NVIDIA Reflex in War Thunder, go to Options --> Graphics, and enable NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossFire HD\nTencent Games\u2019 CrossFire franchise is one of the most popular multiplayer first-person shooters on the planet, with an especially large following in South Korea and China. CrossFire HD is the newest version of the game, bringing remastered graphics and updated gameplay to the title\u2019s 560 million-plus registered gamers.\nIn an upcoming patch, players with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU will be able to enable NVIDIA Reflex in CrossFire HD, reducing system latency in the game\u2019s fast-paced matches, where a single headshot is lights out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNARAKA: BLADEPOINT\n24 Entertainment's NARAKA: BLADEPOINT was one of the first Unity-powered games to incorporate NVIDIA DLSS, when its developers introduced support in April. And now, they\u2019re bringing NVIDIA Reflex to the game when they launch a new beta in June, making players more competitive in its multiplayer battle royale and death match modes, which feature action-focused combat and fast grappling hook-accelerated traversal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhostRunner\nOne More Level\u2019s Ghostrunner is a unique high-stakes first-person single-player game where a single hit leads to death. Navigate high-fidelity ray-traced worlds, accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS, and tackle combat arenas with nothing more than your sword, your wits, and some special abilities. As you play, you\u2019ll soon find yourself gracefully dashing and sliding, deflecting bullets with well-timed sword slashes, and speed running like a pro.\nIn case you missed it, in a recent game update, the developers introduced support for NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency by up to 54%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith GeForce, you can now experience Ghostrunner at its absolute best, enhanced with NVIDIA Reflex, NVIDIA DLSS, and ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflex Ecosystem Continues to Grow\nTo help competitive gamers measure and optimize end to end system latency, we created the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer (RLA). Using hardware and software built into mice and G-SYNC monitors, and GeForce Experience, input lag can be easily measured, allowing players to optimize their setup for the lowest possible system latency. Now, 13 partners are offering a total of 15 G-SYNC monitors and 21 compatible mice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitors\nG-SYNC monitors are the gold standard for gaming displays. They eliminate tearing, ensure excellent image quality, feature hand crafted esports settings, and in recent years have offered faster and faster refresh rates, culminating in the latest 360Hz models.\nFor competitive players, high refresh rates provide lower system latency and a smoother gameplay. Plus, the faster refresh rates and pixel response times make for clearer, more detailed viewing, which helps with enemy detection and aiming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the clear competitive benefits, everyday gamers are adopting high refresh rate displays in droves, and manufacturers are responding, launching dozens of new models, many with support for the Reflex Latency Analyzer. In addition to the 9 previously announced G-SYNC NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer-equipped gaming monitors, today we\u2019re announcing 5 more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get a full list of all G-SYNC high refresh rate Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible gaming monitors here, and peruse our complete list of G-SYNC monitors here. With models of all resolutions, sizes, and refresh rates, you\u2019re bound to find a monitor perfect for your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMice\nPeripheral latency is a critical component in the system latency equation. Each mouse also has its own unique peripheral latency, and with the launch of the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer, this can finally be measured.\nAnd to ensure total precision, manufacturers can add support for the Analyzer into their mice, enabling them to work in sync with our GeForce Experience software, allowing a player to discover the end-to-end system latency from their compatible mouse, to their GeForce PC, to their Reflex Latency Analyzer G-SYNC monitor.\nTo date, 21 mice have incorporated this tech, and today we\u2019re announcing 6 new NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible mice from Corsair, EVGA, and ASUS ROG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Tuned For More NVIDIA Reflex Announcements\nWe\u2019re working with developers far and wide to incorporate NVIDIA Reflex, and more manufacturers are bringing the Reflex Latency Analyzer to their monitors and mice.

The keys to this end-to-end strategy include a clarity of vision, massive chip design skills, new Arm-based architectures that integrate memory, processors, I/O and networking, and a compelling software consumption model.\nEven if Nvidia is unsuccessful at acquiring Arm Ltd., we believe it will still be able to execute on this strategy by actively participating in the Arm ecosystem. However, if its attempt to acquire Arm is successful, we believe it will transform Nvidia from the world\u2019s most valuable chip company into the world\u2019s most valuable supplier of integrated computing architectures.\nIn this Breaking Analysis we\u2019ll explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world\u2019s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that Intel Corp. x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. We\u2019ll also share some\u00a0Enterprise Technology Research\u00a0data that will put AI spending and the competitive dynamics in context.\nA data center market in transition\nThere is only a handful of megaclouds, but there are lots of data centers. Even though the number of data centers worldwide is consolidating, there are still more than 7 million, according to IDC. The cloud, like the universe, is expanding at an accelerated pace and millions of data centers are being interconnected via the internet \u2013 the world\u2019s new, (not so) private network.\u00a0This new cloud is becoming hyperdistributed and run by software.\n\nOpen application programming interfaces, external applications, sprawling digital supply chains and this expanding cloud increase the threat surface and vulnerability to the most sensitive information that resides within data centers around the world. Zero trust has gone from buzzword to mandate seemingly overnight.\nWe\u2019re also seeing AI injected into every application and it\u2019s the technology area we see with the most momentum coming out of the pandemic. We believe the architectures that are powering AI will be the linchpin of Nvidia\u2019s strong entry into the datacenter market.\nTo wit, we believe this new world will not be solely powered by general-purpose x86 central processing units. Rather it will be supported by an ecosystem of Arm-based providers that are affecting an\u00a0unprecedented increase in processor performance.\nNvidia in our view is sitting in the pole position and is currently the favorite to dominate the next era of computing architecture for global data centers, public clouds as well as the near and far edge.\nJensen Huang\u2019s clarity of vision\nBelow is a graphic that underscores some of the fundamental assumptions Nvidia\u2019s CEO is banking on to expand his market. The first is that there\u2019s lots of waste in the data center. He claims that only half the CPU cores deployed in the data center today actually support applications. The other half are processing the infrastructure around the applications that run the software-defined data center. And they\u2019re terribly underutilized.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Bluefield-3 DPU, or data processing unit, was described in a blog post by analyst\u00a0Zeus Kerravala\u00a0as a complete mini-server on a card with software-defined networking, storage and security acceleration built in. This product has the bandwidth, according to Nvidia, to replace 300 general-purpose x86 cores.\nJensen believes that every network chip will eventually be intelligent, programmable and capable of this type of acceleration to offload compute from conventional CPUs. He believes that every server node will have this capability and enable every packet and every application to be monitored in real time, all the time, for intrusion. And as servers move to the edge, Bluefield will be included as a core component. He claims 25 million servers are shipped each year, and that\u2019s his target.\nThat last statement by Jensen is critical in our view:\u00a0\u201cAI is the most powerful force of our time.\u201d\u00a0And whether you agree with that or not, it\u2019s relevant because AI is everywhere and Nvidia\u2019s position in AI and the architectures the company is building are the fundamental linchpin of its data center and enterprise strategy.\nAI tops the spending momentum list\nLet\u2019s take a look at the ETR data to see where AI fits on the chief information officer priority list.\u00a0Below is a set of data in a view we often like to share. The horizontal axis is Market Share or pervasiveness in the ETR data. But we want to call your attention to the vertical axis, which is Net Score or spending velocity.\nExiting the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen AI capture the No. 1 position in the last two surveys. And we think this dynamic will continue for quite some time as AI becomes a staple of digital transformations and automation. And AI will be infused in every single dot you see on this chart.\n\nThe \u201caha\u201d is that Nvidia\u2019s architectures are tailor-made for AI workloads and virtually every segment in the above graphic will be using Nvidia\u2019s technology.\nWorkloads are trending toward Nvidia\u2019s wheelhouse\nLet\u2019s quantify what this means and lay out our view of how Nvidia, with the help of Arm, will go after the enterprise market.\n\nIn the graphic above we show projections from from\u00a0Wikibon Research\u00a0that depict the percent of worldwide spending on server infrastructure by workload type. Here are the key points:\n\nThe market last year was around $78 billion and is expected to approach $115 billion by the end of the decade \u2013 perhaps a conservative figure.\nWe\u2019ve split the market into three broad workload categories. The blue is AI and other data-intensive applications that we\u00a0define here. The orange is general-purpose apps such as enterprise resource planning, supply chain, human capital management, collaboration \u2013 basically think about the applications from Oracle Corp., SAP SE, Microsoft Corp. and hundreds of general-purpose applications.\u00a0The gray is the area that Huang called wasted cycles that offload work for networking and storage and all the software-defined management in the data centers around the world.\nOur view is that the general-purpose workloads are getting squeezed as investments move toward AI+ workloads and the offload work goes to alternative processors that are embedded into storage and networking solutions.\u00a0The latter trend reminds us of spinning disk drives. For years, organizations were forced to buy more spindles and underutilize storage just to get better performance. It was wasteful and inefficient and eventually new technologies came along to solve the problem.\n\nNvidia, with Arm, in our view is well-positioned to attack the offload market and, logically, the AI-based work. But even portions of the orange general purpose segment can go to Arm-based systems. As we\u2019ve reported, for example, companies such as Amazon Web Services Inc. and Oracle use Arm-based designs to serve general purpose workloads.\nWhy are they doing that? Cost. Because x86 generally and Intel specifically are not delivering the price/performance and efficiency required to keep up with the demands to reduce data center costs. So these companies are working with independent software vendors to ensure that general purpose apps run on Arm-based processors with no changes required by the customer.\nThought exercise: What would happen if Intel didn\u2019t respond?\nIf Intel didn\u2019t respond to this obvious dynamic, we think it would get 50% of the general-purpose workloads by the end of the decade. And with Nvidia, it will dominate the blue AI+ and the gray offload work \u2014 dominate as in capture 90% of the available market.\nNow Intel isn\u2019t going to sit back and let that happen. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is well aware of this and is moving Intel toward a new strategy that can better manage memory resources and accommodate offload processing and greater programmability by the ecosystem. But Nvidia and Arm are way ahead in the game. In addition, Nvidia is increasingly partnering with storage leaders such as NetApp Inc., DataDirect Networks Inc., VAST Data Inc., WekaIO Inc., Pure Storage Inc. and others, which we believe will align with its strategy for portions of their portfolio.\nNvidia is no longer a gaming company\nNvidia made its name as a gaming company. Even today, nearly half of its revenue comes from that segment. Ask any gamers what they think of Nvidia and they\u2019ll go on and on about Nvidia\u2019s incredible performance, its amazing drivers, its smoother coloration, cleaner image presentation, superior resource allocation and other features such as screen recording capabilities. The only thing they don\u2019t absolutely love is the price \u2013 nice problem to have.\nBut Nvidia has expanded its total available market by going after enterprise markets.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a quick look at what Nvidia is doing with parts of its enterprise portfolio that we feel are relevant to this discussion.\n\nAbove is a slide from Nvidia\u2019s investor deck that highlights the company\u2019s three-chip strategy. Importantly, Nvidia is aggressively moving to Arm-based architectures, which we\u2019ll describe in more detail later. The slide shows on the top line Nvidia\u2019s Ampere architecture, not to be confused with the company\u00a0Ampere Computing. Nvidia is taking a graphics processing unit-centric approach for obvious reasons \u2014 that\u2019s its wheelhouse \u2014 but we think over time it may rethink this and diversify more into alternatives such as NPUs for cost and flexibility reasons. But we\u2019ll save that for another day.\nIn the middle line, Nvidia has announced its Grace CPU, in a nod to the famous computer scientist\u00a0Grace Hopper. Grace is a new architecture that doesn\u2019t rely on x86 and much more efficiently uses memory resources.\nAnd the bottom line shows the roadmap for Nvidia\u2019s Bluefield DPU, which as Zeus Kerravala described is essentially a complete server on a card.\nThe last point on the above chart is super-important and often overlooked. Moving to Arm will reduce the elapsed time to go from chip design to production by 50%.\u00a0We\u2019re talking shaving years down to 18 months or less. This will give Nvidia a significant time-to-market advantage in the enterprise.\nDoubling down on AI workloads and setting the edge\nWe\u2019re not going to do a deep dive into Nvidia\u2019s enterprise product portfolio. There\u2019s plenty of information on the web if you\u2019re interested. However, we believe the graphic below highlights some things we think are\u00a0important as it relates to Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end strategy.\n\nThe graphic above shows selected details of Nvidia\u2019s Jetson architecture, which is designed to accelerate those AI+ workloads that we showed earlier in the blue bar chart. The reason this is important in our view is that the same software supports small to very large, including edge, systems. We think this type of architecture is well-suited for AI inference at the edge as well as core data center applications that use AI.\u00a0So this is a good example of leveraging an architecture across a wide spectrum of performance and cost that we think will serve Nvidia well.\nSpecifically as it relates to edge workloads, we believe today\u2019s traditional server vendors are missing the larger opportunity \u2013 mainly because it\u2019s currently small and they can\u2019t justify the investment. These players are rightly staying close to their customers and networking with industrial giants to identify ways they can reorient their existing x86 architectural investments toward what they see as \u201cthe edge.\u201d\nWe believe they largely view their edge opportunity as a mini-data center or aggregation point for data. They want to provide horizontal infrastructure at scale to take advantage of their operating leverage. And they\u2019re prudently circumspect about not going to the \u201cfar edge\u201d and get too deep into specialized applications.\nWe believe Nvidia and Arm see the bigger picture. When vendors throw out TAM figures that the edge will be trillions of dollars in value, we believe the real opportunity is with real-time AI inferencing deep within the instrumented edge. This will require lots and lots of processing and it won\u2019t look like anything like traditional x86 servers. These servers will be space-efficient, low-power, tightly packaged or embedded, high-performance, programmable and super-cheap. And that\u2019s where we believe Nvidia and Arm are headed.\nNvidia\u2019s move to Arm addresses its biggest technical bottleneck\nWe want to take a moment to explain why we think the move to Arm-based architectures is so important to Nvidia.\n\nOne of the biggest cost challenges for Nvidia today is keeping the GPU utilized. Typical utilization of GPUs is well below 20%. The graphic above is an attempt to explain why.\nImagine that the lefthand side of the chart shows racks of traditional compute. It underscores the bottlenecks Nvidia faces. The processor and DRAM are tied together in separate blocks. Imagine there are thousands of cores in a rack. Every time the system needs data that lives in another processor it has to send a request and go retrieve it, which is overhead-intensive. Technologies such as RoCE are designed to help, but that doesn\u2019t solve the fundamental architectural bottleneck.\nBecause every GPU, as shown on the left at the bottom, also has its own DRAM, it has to communicate with the processors to get to the desired data \u2013 that is, they can\u2019t communicate with each other efficiently.\nThe future architecture\nThe righthand side shows where Nvidia is headed. Start in the middle with systems-on-chip or SoCs. CPUs are packed with NPUs, IPUs (image processing units) and XPUs (other alternative processors). These are all connected with SRAM, which is a high-speed layer, such as an L1 cache. The operating system for the SoC lives inside and this is where Nvidia has a killer new pricing model.\nThe company is licensing the consumption of the OS that\u2019s running the system and effecting a new and really compelling software subscription model that aligns with the way enterprise buyers are increasingly buying software. In theory Nvidia could give away the chips for free and just charge for the software, like the razor blade model.\nThe outer layer on the righthand side is the DPU and shared DRAM and other resources (such as Ampere Computing \u2013 the company this time \u2013 along with CPUs, solid-state devices and other resources). These are the processors that will manage the SoCs together.\nThis design is based on Nvidia\u2019s three-chip approach using the Bluefield DPU, leveraging Mellanox (that\u2019s the network). The network enables shared DRAM across the CPUs, which will eventually be all Arm-based. Grace lives inside the SoC and also on the outside layers. And of course the GPU lives inside the SoC in a scaled-down version (for example, a rendering GPU) and we show some GPUs on the outer layer as well for AI workloads \u2013 at least in the near term. Eventually we think they may reside solely in the SoC, but only time will tell.\nSo as you can see, Nvidia is making some serious moves by teaming up with Arm and leaning into the Arm ecosystem. This is how it plans to improve the efficiency of its solutions dramatically, reduce its reliance on x86 and support those emerging AI-based workloads we described earlier.\nWho competes for compute leadership?\nBelow is that same XY chart showing Market Share or pervasiveness tracking against Net Score or spending momentum. And we\u2019ve cut the ETR data to capture compute, storage and networking segments for some of the leading players that we feel are vying for compute data center leadership.\n\nAWS is in a very strong position. We believe more than half of its revenue comes from compute, so we\u2019re talking about more than $25 billion on a run-rate basis. Huge. The company designs its own silicon and is working with ISVs to run general-purpose workloads on Arm-based Graviton chips. Microsoft and Google LLC are big consumers of compute and they sell a lot. Microsoft in particular is likely to continue to work with original equipment manufacturing partners to attack the on-prem data center opportunity, but it\u2019s really Intel that is the provider of compute to the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Dell Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and the original design manufacturers that are not shown here.\nHPE\u00a0has historically developed architectures. We hate to bring it up, but remember \u201cThe Machine?\u201d We realize it\u2019s the butt of many jokes from competitors and HP deserves some heat for all the fanfare and then quietly putting The Machine\u00a0out to pasture. But HPE has a strong position in high-performance computing, which is AI- and data-intensive. And the work it did on new computing architectures and shared memories from its lab experiment might still be kicking around and could come in handy some day in this future we\u2019re describing here. HPE has also been known to design its own custom silicon, so we would not count them out as an innovator in this race.\nCisco\u00a0is interesting because it not only has custom silicon designs but its entry into the compute business with its Unified Computing System a decade ago was notable in that it created a new way to think about integrating data center resources. Cisco invests in architectures and we expect the next generation of UCS will mark another notable milestone in the company\u2019s data center business. As well, the company has serious security chops and has made numerous acquisitions to shore up its position in the data center, such as\u00a0 AppDynamics, ThousandEyes, Banzai, Meraki and others.\nDell\u00a0just had an amazing quarterly earnings report. The company grew top-line revenue by about 12% and it wasn\u2019t attributable to an easy compare relative to last year. Dell is simply executing, despite continued softness in the legacy EMC storage business. Laptop demand continues to soar and Dell\u2019s server business is growing again. But we don\u2019t see Dell as an architectural innovator in compute. Rather we think the company will be content to partner with suppliers, whether Intel, Nvidia, Arm-based partners or all of the above. We predict Dell will rely on its massive portfolio, excellent supply chain and execution ethos to squeeze out margins by integrating core architectural innovations developed by others. We do expect, however, especially in storage, that the company will tap lower-cost alternatives to better service those offload workloads we discussed earlier.\nIBM\u00a0is notable for historical reasons. With its mainframe, IBM created the first great compute monopoly before unwittingly handing it to Intel along with Microsoft. We don\u2019t see IBM aspiring to retake the compute platform mantle it once held with mainframes. Rather Red Hat and the march to hybrid cloud is the path in our view.\nThe elephants in the room: Intel, Nvidia and China Inc.\nNow let\u2019s get down to the big dogs: Intel, Nvidia and China Inc. China is relevant because of companies such as Alibaba, Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and the Chinese government\u2019s desire to be self-sufficient in semiconductor technology.\nBut our premise here is that the trends are favoring Nvidia over Intel in the above picture and hence the relative positioning we chose for the logos. Nvidia is making moves to further position itself for the new workloads in the data center and compete for Intel\u2019s stronghold. Intel will attempt to remake itself, but it should have initiated the moves Pat Gelsinger is making today five to seven years ago.\u00a0Intel can\u2019t change that and is simply far behind. It will take the company years to catch up.\nNvidia by the numbers\nLet\u2019s stay on the Nvidia-versus-Intel comparison for a moment and take a snapshot of the companies\u2019 financials.\n\nAbove is a quick and dirty chart we put together with some straightforward key performance indicators. Some of these figures are approximate or rounded, so don\u2019t stress over it too much. But you can see Intel is about an $80 billion company \u2013 four times the size of Nvidia. Yet Nvidia\u2019s market value far exceeds that of Intel. Why? Because of the growth line. And in our view it\u2019s justified thanks to Nvidia\u2019s stronger strategic positioning.\nIntel used to be the gross margin king, but Nvidia has much higher margins. When it comes to free cash flow, Intel still is dominant. As it pertains to the balance sheet, Intel, especially with its new foundry strategy, is a way more capital-intensive business than Nvidia. As Intel starts building out more manufacturing capacity for its foundries, it will pressure the company\u2019s cash position.\nIn the third column we put together a back-of-napkin pro forma for Nvidia + Arm circa end of 2022. We think they could get to a run rate that is about half the size of Intel\u2019s revenue. And that could propel the company\u2019s market cap to well over a half-trillion dollars if they get any credit for Arm. The risk is that because the Arm deal is based on cash plus tons of stock, it could put pressure on the market capitalization for some time.\nArm has 90% gross margins because it pretty much has a pure license model, so it helps gross margin a bit\u2013 but Arm is relatively small at around $2 billion in revenue, so it doesn\u2019t move the needle that much. The balance sheet data is a swag. Arm has said it\u2019s not going to take on debt to do the transaction, but we haven\u2019t had time to figure out how it can do that without taking on some debt, so we took a guess as to how we\u2019d approach it\u00a0with today\u2019s ultra-low cost of capital.\nThe point is that, given the momentum and growth of Nvidia, its strategic position in AI, its deep engineering aimed at all the right places and its potential to unlock huge value with Arm, on paper it looks like the horse to beat if it can execute.\nSummarizing Nvidia\u2019s attack on the enterprise\n\nThe architectures on which Nvidia is building its dominant AI business are evolving. The workload mix and future demand is heading right at these new architectures, in our view. Nvidia is well-positioned to drive a truck right through the enterprise, in our opinion.\nThe power has shifted from Intel/x86 to the Arm ecosystem and Nvidia is leaning in, whereas Intel has to preserve its current business while recreating itself. That will take time. But Intel potentially has the powerful backing of the U.S. government.\nThe wild card is: Will Nvidia be successful in acquiring Arm? Certain factions in the U.K. and the EU are fighting the deal because they don\u2019t want the U.S. dictating to whom Arm can sell technology \u2013 such as the restrictions placed on Huawei for many suppliers of Arm-based chips.\u00a0In addition, Nvidia\u2019s competitors such as Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. are nervous that if Nvidia gets Arm, they\u2019ll be at a competitive disadvantage.\u00a0And for sure China doesn\u2019t want Nvidia controlling Arm for obvious reasons and it will do what it can to block the deal or put handcuffs on how business can be done in China.\nWe can see a scenario where the U.S. government pressures U.K./EU regulators to let the deal go through in exchange for commitments to help fund plants in Europe. AI and semiconductors: You can\u2019t get more strategic than that and we think the U.S. military has every reason to support this deal.\u00a0In exchange for facilitating the deal, the government pressures Nvidia to feed Intel\u2019s foundry business, along with our\u00a0previous scenario with Apple. At the same time, governments could impose conditions that secure access to Arm-based technology for Nvidia\u2019s competitors.\nWe don\u2019t have any inside information as to what\u2019s happening behind the scenes, but on its earnings call, Nvidia said it\u2019s working with regulators and is on track to complete the deal in early 2022.\nLots is at stake and there are multiple constituents to serve in this chess game. Strategic national considerations are clashing with calls to break up or limit big tech. Meanwhile, China acts with clarity and certainty. The door is open for Nvidia to grab a big prize in data center markets and, even without owning Arm, we think the company is better-positioned than any other firm to serve the future needs of enterprise tech.\nWays to keep in touch\nGive us your thoughts, data or insights on this and other topics we cover.

These vehicles, equipped with DiDi\u2019s Gemini self-driving hardware platform, will eventually be deployed in robotaxi services.\nVolvo Cars teams up with world\u2019s leading mobility technology platform DiDi for self-driving test fleet\nThese self-driving test vehicles are significant progress towards commercial robotaxi services.\nRobotaxis are autonomous vehicles that can operate on their own in geofenced areas, such as cities or residential communities. With a set of high-resolution sensors and a supercomputing platform in place of a driver, they can safely operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nAnd as a safer alternative to current modes of transit, robotaxis are expected to draw quick adoption once deployed at scale, making up more than 5 percent of vehicle miles traveled worldwide by 2030.\nWith the high-performance, energy-efficient compute of NVIDIA DRIVE at their core, these autonomous driving systems developed by DiDi are poised to help accelerate this landmark transition.\nDoubling Up on Redundancy\nThe key to DiDi\u2019s robotaxi ambitions is its new self-driving hardware platform, DiDi Gemini.\nAchieving fully autonomous vehicles requires centralized, high-performance compute. The amount of sensor data a robotaxi needs to process is 100x greater than today\u2019s most advanced vehicles.\nThe complexity in software also increases exponentially, with an array of redundant and diverse deep neural networks running simultaneously as part of an integrated software stack.\nBuilt on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus, DiDi Gemini achieves 700 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance, and includes up to 50 high-resolution sensors and an ASIL-D rated fallback system. It is architected with multi-layered redundant protections to enhance the overall safety of the autonomous driving experience.\nThe Gemini platform was designed using Didi Chuxing\u2019s massive database of ride-hailing data as well as real-world autonomous driving test data to deliver the optimal self-driving hardware experience.\nA New Generation of Collaboration\nDiDi\u2019s test fleet also marks a new era in technology collaboration.\nDiDi and Volvo Cars plan to build a long-term partnership, expanding the autonomous test fleets across China and the U.S. and scaling up commercial robotaxi operations. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform enables continuous improvement over the air, facilitating these future plans of development and expansion.\nThis collaboration combines long-held legacies in vehicle safety, ride-hailing expertise and AI computing to push the bounds of transportation technology for safer, more efficient everyday mobility.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Metro 2033 featured a raft of 2010-era cutting-edge tech, including DirectX 11 tessellation and GPU PhysX acceleration, 2013\u2019s Metro: Last Light improved upon everything while making great strides in the fields of environmental destruction, post processing and particle effects, and 2019\u2019s Metro Exodus was one of the first games to implement real-time ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS, kick starting a new generation of gaming.\nIn the two years since 4A Games pioneered the use of real-time ray tracing, new research, tools, and middleware have led to massive strides in image quality and performance, inspiring the team at 4A to create a new, upgraded version of the game entitled Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition.\nFree to everyone who already owns Metro Exodus, the PC Enhanced Edition primarily improves lighting by introducing a suite of new, ray-traced dependent features. Gone are rasterized lighting fall backs and clever hacks - now, all lighting is calculated in real-time with superior accuracy using ray tracing, necessitating the use of a GeForce RTX graphics card for NVIDIA gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet an overview of Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition\u2019s ray tracing and DLSS 2.0 enhancements in this must-watch video\nAdditionally, 4A has improved existing effects, while also introducing ray-traced reflections and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, improving upon the original game\u2019s implementation with superior image quality, faster performance, and the ability to be used at every resolution with multiple user-selectable quality presets.\nTo learn more about all of this, and to see how the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition performs on GeForce RTX graphics cards with NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, keep reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0: Accelerate Performance By Up To 2X\nNVIDIA DLSS 1.0 in the original Metro Exodus release boosted GeForce RTX players\u2019 performance by up to 30%. In the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, 4A Games has incorporated NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, which uses AI to produce images that are even better than native resolution with Temporal Anti-Aliasing alone, while only conventionally rendering a fraction of the pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 improves image quality in our comparison video\nThe result is a clearer, cleaner, smoother picture, that runs 2X faster at 4K, giving GeForce RTX users a substantial performance boost, and the headroom to activate all of the PC Enhanced Edition\u2019s ray-traced effects.\nIn-game, NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 enables owners of the GeForce RTX 3060, 3060 Ti, 3070, 3080 and 3090, and previous-gen cards of equivalent speed, to max out Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition at 4K at over 60 FPS. At 2560x1440, all GeForce RTX gamers can play at max settings at over 60 FPS, and at 1920x1080, all GeForce RTX gamers can play at over 80 FPS, with owners of top-end cards running at over 150 FPS. All with superior image quality than native resolution when using Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition\u2019s Temporal Anti-Aliasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 2.0 in the PC Enhanced Edition can be enabled at any resolution, and gamers can select any quality mode. Here at NVIDIA, we recommend Quality for 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, and Performance for 3840x2160.\u00a0\nFor third-party testing of NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 in the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, check out Digital Foundry\u2019s video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Global Illumination Lighting\nPrior to the introduction of real-time videogame ray tracing in 2019, when GeForce RTX GPUs launched with dedicated RT Cores that enabled ray tracing at playable frame rates, game lighting was achieved with a slate of ingenious and inventive rasterized hacks. However, each solution had a compromise, and no matter how many effects and workarounds a developer combined, none could approach the quality and realism of the ray tracing seen in animated movies and Hollywood visual effects.\nWith ray tracing, powered by GeForce RTX GPUs, 4A Games introduced gamers to ray-traced Global Illumination lighting (RTGI) in Metro Exodus, simulating how light naturally floods in through windows and damaged surfaces, brightening interiors. Compared to the game with ray tracing disabled, the difference in quality was staggering, giving players their first taste of next-gen gaming.\nIn the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, 4A Games has completely overhauled RTGI, introducing a new generational leap in image quality and immersion that finally rivals that of Hollywood\u2019s biggest blockbusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, all shadowed lights in the game now contribute to ray-traced global illumination. Previously, only sunlight could naturally illuminate environments, limiting the tech\u2019s usefulness in many of the game\u2019s locations. Now, light from the sun, moon, sky, man-made lights, and all other light sources can brighten interiors, exteriors, characters, enemies, and weapons, dramatically improving the game\u2019s appearance. Dark interiors are bathed in light, materials glisten and subtly shine when struck by light, and the color of light is realistically transmitted throughout each scene.\nTo make this a reality, every single rasterized light has either been removed from the game, or upgraded to a new and improved ray-traced version, necessitating the use of a ray tracing-capable GPU, like the GeForce RTX series of graphics cards. This fundamental change also enabled the developers to eschew time-consuming testing, tweaking, rendering, and baking associated with the use of rasterized workarounds, greatly accelerating their work on the PC Enhanced Edition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world, light bounces until its energy dissipates, enabling a room to be illuminated through even a small gap when bright direct sunlight streams in. Simulating this in a game is computationally expensive, and back in 2019 Metro Exodus only accounted for a single bounce of light to keep frame rates playable. Now, the PC Enhanced Edition can simulate \u2018infinite\u2019 bounces by sampling and caching a number of rays each frame into a world-space grid of light probes. In other words, the additional bounces are calculated in less than a second, rather than instantaneously, and the results blended together to create a performant jaw-dropping effect that comes close to the quality of lighting seen in even-more intensive path-traced games.\nThis Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI) technique, based on and using much of the same shader technology as our RTXGI SDK, occurs seamlessly, and is surely the model other developers will adopt moving forward. As Digital Foundry demonstrates, the quality is unmatched, and the improvement over Metro Exodus\u2019 original single bounce technique is incredible. As you play, bright lights will fill entire spaces, light will radiate and bounce naturally, and scenes will come alive with real-time, dynamic, super realistic illumination.\nAs it stands, DDGI and RTXGI deliver the best lighting seen to date in any ray-traced game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Emissive Lights\nThe Two Colonels was Metro Exodus\u2019 first DLC expansion, set almost exclusively underground with a new flamethrower weapon. To convey the intensity of the weapon\u2019s heat, fire and visuals, 4A Games introduced a new ray-traced emissive lights effect (also known as area lights), which enabled fire to illuminate the environment, and for dynamic soft shadows to be cast as a result.\nThe PC Enhanced Edition brings this technology to the main game and the other DLC expansion, Sam\u2019s Story, while also extending its application to all light sources. So now, fluorescent tube lights, candles, lamps, LEDs, molotovs, and more, emit ray-traced light that realistically illuminates the environment and causes natural shadowing and shading of scenery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese emissive ray-traced lights further enhance the PC Enhanced Edition\u2019s visuals, increasing realism and immersion at every opportunity. To see the tech in action, check out Digital Foundry\u2019s video and the video at the start of this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Reflections\nMetro Exodus occurs over 20 years after an apocalyptic nuclear war. The surface is obliterated, and what materials and resources remain are recycled or damaged beyond repair. As a result, very few of the game\u2019s materials are untarnished and capable of clearly reflecting sharp detail be that by using ray tracing or screen space effects. Where applicable however, reflective shine and subtle detail is added via a combination of the game\u2019s ray-traced specular global illumination, ray-traced reflections, and supported by the occasional screen space reflection where that data is deemed to still be accurate enough.\nFor bodies of water, which are capable of reflecting full-quality detail, 4A Games has introduced hybrid ray-traced reflections, that are combined with screen space detail to improve image quality without upping the performance impact. For examples, head on over to Digital Foundry and check out the video at the start of this article, but needless to say, these further improve the PC Enhanced Edition\u2019s graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver, Download Now\nFor the optimum experience in the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, download and install our newest Game Ready Driver.

Simply login, click PLAY, and enjoy an optimal cloud gaming experience.\nHere\u2019s an overview on how the service keeps your library game ready at all times.\nUpdating Games for All GeForce NOW Members\nWhen a gamer downloads an update on their PC, all that matters is their individual download.\nIn the cloud, the GeForce NOW team goes through the steps of patching or maintenance and makes the updated game available for millions of members around the world.\nDepending on when you happen to hop on GeForce NOW, you may not even see these updates taking place. In some cases, you\u2019ll be able to keep playing your game while we\u2019re updating game bits. In others, we may need to complete the backend work before it\u2019s ready to play.\nPatching in GeForce NOW\nPatching is the process of making changes to a game or its supporting data to update, fix or improve it.\nIt typically takes a few minutes, sometimes longer for a game to patch on GeForce NOW.\nWhen a developer releases a new version of a game, work is done on the backend of GeForce NOW to download that patch, replicate each bit to all of our storage systems, test for the proper security features, and finally copy it back onto all of our data centers worldwide, becoming available for gamers.\nGeForce NOW handles this entire process so gamers and developers can focus on, well, gaming and developing.\nDifferent Types of Patching\u00a0\nThree types of patching occur on GeForce NOW:\n\nOn-seat patching allows you to play your game as-is while the patch is downloading in the background. Meaning you\u2019re always game ready.\nOffline patching happens for games that don\u2019t support on-seat patching. Our automated software system downloads the patch on the backend then updates. Offline patching can take minutes to hours.\nDistributed patching is a quicker type of patching. Specific bits are downloaded and installed, instead of the entire game (100 GB or so). We then finish updating and copy them onto the server. Typically this takes 30 minutes or less.\n\nGeForce NOW continues to work with game developers requesting patch updates before releasing on PC, allowing for real-time preparations in the cloud, resulting in zero wait for gamers, period.\nMaintenance Mode Explained\u00a0\nMaintenance mode is the status of a game that\u2019s been taken offline for bigger fixes such as bugs that cause poor performance, issues with save games, or patches that need more time to deploy.\nDepending on severity, a game in maintenance can be offline anywhere from days to weeks. We work to keep these maintenance times to a minimum, and often work directly with game developers to resolve these issues.\nEliminate Waiting for More Gaming\nOur goal is to do all of the patching and maintenance behind the scenes \u2014 so that when you\u2019re ready to play, you\u2019re game ready and playing instantly.\nGet started with your gaming adventures on GeForce NOW.\nFollow GeForce NOW on Facebook and Twitter and stay up to date on the latest features and game launches.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: GamingTags: Cloud Gaming | GeForce NOW \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company\u2019s total revenue for fiscal 2021 was $16.7 billion, a 53 percent increase from the previous year that was largely driven by triple-digit growth in the company\u2019s data center business and double-digit growth in its gaming business.\n[Related: Nvidia CEO Vows Expedited Raises, No Layoffs In COVID-19 Missive]\nThe base salaries for Nvidia\u2019s five highest compensated executives didn\u2019t change except for the fact that fiscal 2021 had one more week than the previous year, but they did see higher payouts thanks to a mix of stock awards and incentive pay that were tied to the company\u2019s performance.\n\u201cOn the strength of our Gaming and Data Center market platforms, we achieved record revenue for the Company, which directly impacted the performance payouts under our executive compensation program,\u201d the company said in its latest proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThat brought Nvidia\u2019s CEO-to-worker pay ratio to 89:1 for fiscal 2021, with CEO Jensen Huang earning $19.3 million that year while median employee compensation was $215,930, the filing said. Nvidia\u2019s CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 64:1 in fiscal 2020 and 88:1 in fiscal 2019, according to previous filings.\nWhat follows is a breakdown of Nvidia\u2019s top five highest paid executives in the company\u2019s fiscal 2021 based on the company\u2019s latest proxy filing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJen-Hsun \u201cJensen\u201d Huang\nAs CEO and president of Nvidia, Jen-Hsun \u201cJensen\u201d Huang has been the GPU maker\u2019s leader since he co-founded it with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Pirem in 1993.\nHuang\u2019s base salary for fiscal year 2021 was $1 million, which is slightly higher than what he made the year before as a result of fiscal 2021 being a week longer. He received $3 million in variable cash incentive pay and $19,266 in other non-equity compensation, which includes 401k and health savings account contributions as well as other benefits payments. For equity compensation, Huang received $15.2 million in stock awards, which is $5.6 million higher than what he received the previous year.\nHis total compensation for fiscal year 2021 was $19.3 million, which is $7.8 million higher than what Huang received in the previous year. He was the most compensated Nvidia executive in fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAjay \u201cJay\u201d Puri\nAjay K. Puri is executive vice president of worldwide field operations of Nvidia, a role he has held since 2009 that puts him in charge of the company\u2019s sales and marketing. He joined Nvidia in 2005.\nPuri\u2019s base salary for fiscal year 2021 was $966,487, which is slightly higher than what he made the previous year as a result of fiscal 2021 being one week longer. He received $1.3 million in variable cash incentive pay and $33,388 in other non-equity compensation, which includes 401k and health savings account contributions as well as other benefits payments. For equity compensation, Puri received $6.2 million in stock awards, which is roughly $2.7 million more than what he received the previous year.\nHis total compensation for fiscal 2021 was $8.5 million, which is a little less than double what he received the previous year. He was the second highest compensated Nvidia executive in fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColette M. Kress\nCollette M. Kress is executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nvidia, a role that she has served since joining the company in 2013.\nKress\u2019s base salary for fiscal year 2021 was $915,620, which is slightly higher than what she made the previous year as a result of fiscal 2021 being one week longer. She received $600,000 in variable cash incentive pay and $9,731 in other non-equity compensation, which includes 401k contribution matches and benefits payments. For equity compensation, Kress received $6.5 million in stock awards, which is roughly $3.1 million higher than what she received the previous year.\nHer total compensation for fiscal 2021 was $8.1 million, slightly less than double what she made in the previous year. She was the third highest compensated Nvidia executive in fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebora Shoquist\nDebora Shoquist is executive vice president of operations of Nvidia, and she has been leading the operations side of the company since she joined in 2007.\nShoquist\u2019s base salary for fiscal year 2021 was $864,752, which is slightly higher than what she made the previous year as a result of fiscal 2021 being one week longer.

Radiology departments deploy AI to help distinguish between healthy tissue and tumors. And HR teams employ it to work out which of hundreds of resumes should be sent on to recruiters.\nThese are just a few examples of how AI is being adopted across industries. And with so much at stake, businesses and governments adopting AI and machine learning are increasingly being pressed to lift the veil on how their AI models make decisions.\nCharles Elkan, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, offers a sharp analogy for much of the current state of AI, in which organizations debate its trustworthiness and how to overcome objections to AI systems:\nWe don\u2019t understand exactly how a bomb-sniffing dog does its job, but we place a lot of trust in the decisions they make.\nTo reach a better understanding of how AI models come to their decisions, organizations are turning to explainable artificial intelligence (AI).\nWhat Is Explainable AI?\nExplainable AI, also abbreviated as XAI, is a set of tools and techniques used by organizations to help people better understand why a model makes certain decisions and how it works. XAI is:\u00a0\n\nA set of best practices: It takes advantage of some of the best procedures and rules that data scientists have been using for years to help others understand how a model is trained. Knowing how, and on what data, a model was trained helps us understand when it does and doesn\u2019t make sense to use that model. It also shines a light on what sources of bias the model might have been exposed to.\nA set of design principles: Researchers are increasingly focused on simplifying the building of AI systems to make them inherently easier to understand.\nA set of tools: As the systems get easier to understand, the training models can be further refined by incorporating those learnings into it \u2014 and by offering those learnings to others for incorporation into their models.\n\nHow Does Explainable AI Work?\nWhile there\u2019s still a great deal of debate over the standardization of XAI processes, a few key points resonate across industries implementing it:\n\nWho do we have to explain the model to?\nHow accurate or precise an explanation do we need?\nDo we need to explain the overall model or a particular decision?\n\nSource: DARPA\nData scientists are focusing on all these questions, but explainability boils down to: What are we trying to explain?\nExplaining the pedigree of the model:\n\nHow was the model trained?\nWhat data was used?\nHow was the impact of any bias in the training data measured and mitigated?\n\nThese questions are the data science equivalent of explaining what school your surgeon went to \u2014\u00a0 along with who their teachers were, what they studied and what grades they got. Getting this right is more about process and leaving a paper trail than it is about pure AI, but it\u2019s critical to establishing trust in a model.\nWhile explaining a model\u2019s pedigree sounds fairly easy, it\u2019s hard in practice, as many tools currently don\u2019t support strong information-gathering. NVIDIA provides such information about its pretrained models. These are shared on the NGC catalog, a hub of GPU-optimized AI and high performance computing SDKs and models that quickly help businesses build their applications.\nExplaining the overall model:\nSometimes called model interpretability, this is an active area of research. Most model explanations fall into one of two camps:\nIn a technique sometimes called \u201cproxy modeling,\u201d simpler, more easily comprehended models like decision trees can be used to approximately describe the more detailed AI model. These explanations give a \u201csense\u201d of the model overall, but the tradeoff between approximation and simplicity of the proxy model is still more art than science.\nProxy modeling is always an approximation and, even if applied well, it can create opportunities for real-life decisions to be very different from what\u2019s expected from the proxy models.\nThe second approach is \u201cdesign for interpretability.\u201d This limits the design and training options of the AI network in ways that attempt to assemble the overall network out of smaller parts that we force to have simpler behavior. This can lead to models that are still powerful, but with behavior that\u2019s much easier to explain.\nThis isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds, however, and it sacrifices some level of efficiency and accuracy by removing components and structures from the data scientist\u2019s toolbox. This approach may also require significantly more computational power.\nWhy XAI Explains Individual Decisions Best\nThe best understood area of XAI is individual decision-making: why a person didn\u2019t get approved for a loan, for instance.\nTechniques with names like LIME and SHAP \u00a0offer very literal mathematical answers to this question \u2014 and the results of that math can be presented to data scientists, managers, regulators and consumers. For some data \u2014 images, audio and text \u2014 similar results can be visualized through the use of \u201cattention\u201d in the models \u2014 forcing the model itself to show its work.\nIn the case of the Shapley values used in SHAP, there are some mathematical proofs of the underlying techniques that are particularly attractive based on game theory work done in the 1950s. There is active research in using these explanations of individual decisions to explain the model as a whole, mostly focusing on clustering and forcing various smoothness constraints on the underlying math.\nThe drawback to these techniques is that they\u2019re somewhat computationally expensive. In addition, without significant effort during the training of the model, the results can be very sensitive to the input data values. Some also argue that because data scientists can only calculate approximate Shapley values, the attractive and provable features of these numbers are also only approximate \u2014 sharply reducing their value.\nWhile healthy debate remains, it\u2019s clear that by maintaining a proper model pedigree, adopting a model explainability method that provides clarity to senior leadership on the risks involved in the model, and monitoring actual outcomes with individual explanations, AI models can be built with clearly understood behaviors.\nFor a closer look at examples of XAI work, check out the talks presented by Wells Fargo and ScotiaBank at NVIDIA GTC21.\nLearn more about data science on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | ExplainerTags: Artificial Intelligence | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It could one day give users almost superhuman capabilities.\nThe effort is detailed in a draft paper, or pre-print, titled \u201cA Portable, Self-Contained Neuroprosthetic Hand with Deep Learning-Based Finger Control.\u201d It details an extraordinary cross-disciplinary collaboration behind a system that, in effect, allows humans to control just about anything digital with thoughts.\n\u201cThe idea is intuitive to video gamers,\u201d said Anh Tuan Nguyen, the paper\u2019s lead author and now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota advised by Associate Professor Zhi Yang.\n\u201cInstead of mapping our system to a virtual hand, we just mapped it to keystrokes \u2014 and five minutes later, we\u2019re playing a video game,\u201d said Nguyen, an avid gamer, who holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and Ph.D. in biomedical engineering.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Jules Anh Tuan Nguyen Explains How AI Lets Amputee Control Prosthetic Hand, Video Games \u2013 Ep. 149\nShawn Findley, who lost his hand following an accident 17 years ago, was able to use an AI decoder to translate his thoughts in real-time into actions.\nIn short, Findley \u2014 a pastor in East Texas who lost his hand following an accident in a machine shop 17 years ago \u2014 was able to use an AI decoder trained on an NVIDIA TITAN X GPU and deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson to translate his thoughts in real-time into actions inside a virtual environment running on, of course, yet another NVIDIA GPU, Nguyen explained.\nBionic Plan\nFindley was one of a handful of patients who participated in the clinical trial supported by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s HAPTIX program.\nThe human physiology study is led by Edward Keefer, a neuroscientist and electrophysiologist who leads Texas-based Nerves Incorporated, and Dr. Jonathan Cheng at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\nIn collaboration with Yang\u2019s and Associate Professor Qi Zhao\u2019s labs at the University of Minnesota, the team collected large-scale human nerve data and is one of the first to implement deep learning neural decoders in a portable platform for clinical neuroprosthetic applications.\nThat effort aims to improve the lives of millions of amputees around the world. More than a million people lose a limb to amputation every year. That\u2019s one every 30 seconds.\nProsthetic limbs have advanced fast over the past few decades \u2014 becoming stronger, lighter and more comfortable. But neural decoders, which decode movement intent from nerve data promise a dramatic leap forward.\nWith just a few hours of training, the system allowed Findley to swiftly, accurately and intuitively move the fingers on a portable prosthetic hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like if I want to reach out and pick up something, I just reach out and pick up something,\u201d reported Findley.\nThe key, it turns out, is the same kind of GPU-accelerated deep learning that\u2019s now widely used for everything from online shopping to speech and voice recognition.\nTeamwork\nFor amputees, even though their hand is long gone, parts of the system that controlled the missing hand remain.\nEvery time the amputee imagines grabbing, say, a cup of coffee with a lost hand, those thoughts are still accessible in the peripheral nerves once connected to the amputated body part.\nTo capture those thoughts, Dr. Cheng at UTSW surgically inserted arrays of microscopic electrodes into the residual median and ulnar nerves of the amputee forearm.\nThese electrodes, with carbon nanotube contacts, are designed by Keefer to detect the electrical signals from the peripheral nerve.\nDr. Yang\u2019s lab designed a high-precision neural chip to acquire the tiny signals recorded by the electrodes from the residual nerves of the amputees.\nDr. Zhao\u2019s lab then developed machine learning algorithms that decode neural signals into hand controls.\nGPU-Accelerated Neural Network\nHere\u2019s where deep learning comes in.\nData collected by the patient\u2019s nerve signals \u2014 and translated into digital signals \u2014 are then used to train a neural network that decodes the signals into specific commands for the prosthesis.\nIt\u2019s a process that takes as little as two hours using a system equipped with a TITAN X or NVIDIA GeForce 1080 Ti GPU. One day users may even be able to train such systems at home, using cloud-based GPUs.\nThese GPUs accelerate an AI neural decoder designed based on a recurrent neural network running on the PyTorch deep learning framework.\nUse of such neural networks has exploded over the past decade, giving computer scientists the ability to train systems for a vast array of tasks, from image and speech recognition to autonomous vehicles, too complex to be tackled with traditional hand-coding.\nThe challenge is finding hardware powerful enough to swiftly run this neural decoder, a process known as inference,\u00a0and power-efficient enough to be fully portable.\nPortable and powerful: Jetson Nano\u2019s CUDA cores provide full support for popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Caffe.\nSo the team turned to the Jetson Nano, whose CUDA cores provide full support for popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Caffe.\n\u201cThis offers the most appropriate tradeoff among power and performance for our neural decoder implementation,\u201d Nguyen explained.\nDeploying this trained neural network on the powerful, credit card sized Jetson Nano resulted in a portable, self-contained neuroprosthetic hand that gives users real-time control of individual finger movements.\nUsing it, Findley demonstrated both high-accuracy and low-latency control of individual finger movements in various laboratory and real-world environments.\nThe next step is a wireless and implantable system, so users can slip on a portable prosthetic device when needed, without any wires protruding from their body.\nNguyen sees robust, portable AI systems \u2014 able to understand and react to the human body \u2014 augmenting a host of medical devices coming in the near future.\nThe technology developed by the team to create AI-enabled neural interfaces is being licensed by Fasikl Incorporated, a startup sprung from Yang\u2019s lab.\nThe goal is to pioneer neuromodulation systems for use by amputees and patients with neurological diseases, as well as able-bodied individuals who want to control robots or devices by thinking about it.\n\u201cWhen we get the system approved for nonmedical applications, I intend to be the first person to have it implanted,\u201d Keefer said. \u201cThe devices you could control simply by thinking: drones, your keyboard, remote manipulators \u2014 it\u2019s the next step in evolution.\u201d\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 Jules Anh Tuan Nguyen Explains How AI Lets Amputee Control Prosthetic Hand, Video Games \u2013 Ep. 149\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The sample, which already has over 8,000 downloads, displays real-time physics with dynamic lighting and stunning, physically based materials.\nThe technology demo showcases NVIDIA Omniverse\u2019s powerful suite of graphics, AI and simulation technologies. GeForce RTX gaming and NVIDIA RTX enthusiasts can download Marbles RTX and experience Omniverse\u2019s advanced capabilities in real-time ray- and path-traced rendering, Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and complex physics simulation.\n\nFirst previewed at GTC 2020, the Marbles RTX tech demo simulates the dynamic world in real time, without any precomputation or baking. It highlights NVIDIA\u2019s advanced rendering and physics with exceptionally high-quality 3D content created from scratch.\nThe final Marbles RTX tech demo completed in Omniverse resulted in over 500GB of texture data, 165 unique assets that were modeled and textured by hand, more than 5,000 meshes and about 100 million polygons.\n\nDuring the GeForce RTX 30 Series launch event in September, NVIDIA unveiled a more challenging take on the demo with the release of Marbles at Night RTX. This presented a night scene that contained hundreds of dynamic, animated lights. Based on NVIDIA Research, Marbles at Night RTX showcased how the power and beauty of RTX-enabled real-time ray tracing allows artists to render dynamic direct lighting and shadows from millions of area lights in real time.\n\nThe combination of physically based MDL materials and real-time, referenced path tracing in Omniverse brings high-quality details to the Marbles scene, enabling players to feel like they\u2019re looking at real-world objects. The Omniverse RTX Renderer calculates reflections, refraction and global illumination accurately while the denoiser easily manages all the complex geometry across the entire scene.\n\nNVIDIA PhysX 5 and Flow simulate the interaction of rigid-body objects and fluids in the scene in real time, and NVIDIA DLSS enhances the details in the image with powerful AI, allowing users to focus GPU resources on accuracy and fidelity. All these elements combined provide a unique look and feel in CGI that users typically can\u2019t get from real-time games.\nAt GTC 2021, the artists behind Marbles RTX hosted an exclusive deep dive session detailing the creative and development process. Learn more about the Making of Marbles by watching the GTC session on demand, which is available now and free to access.\nDownload NVIDIA Omniverse and try the Marbles RTX playable sample today.\nFor additional resources, view the latest tutorials on Omniverse, check out the forums for support and join the Omniverse Discord server to chat with the community.\n\n\nCategories: Gaming | Pro GraphicsTags: Omniverse | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Based on NVIDIA\u2019s newest and smallest Ampere GPU, GA107, the RTX 3050 series finally rounds out the rest of NVIDIA\u2019s laptop offering, introducing a mobile video card that\u2019s better suited for mid-power systems, and cheaper than RTX 3060 to boot. Laptops featuring the new RTX 3050 video adapters will be available today, with all of the major vendors set to ship laptops using NVIDIA\u2019s latest laptop adapter in short order.\nNVIDIA\u2019s xx50 tier of laptop video cards has traditionally been the company\u2019s high-volume/low-price products for laptops, and the RTX 3050 family is no different. Laptops with the new adapters will start at $799, and will frequently crop up as a baseline option in Tiger Lake-H laptops. With Intel only shipping 32 EUs in Tiger Lake\u2019s integrated GPU \u2013 just a third of how many are in Tiger Lake-U \u2013 Intel isn\u2019t setting the bar for graphics performance particularly high in this generation of H-series CPUs. As a result, there\u2019s a wide-open market for NVIDIA\u2019s latest low-end graphics adapter to give these machines a boost in graphics performance.\nAnd, like the RTX 3060 For Laptops launch back at the start of the year, it\u2019s actually the laptop market that is getting the newest silicon first. For the RTX 3050 series, NVIDIA is rolling out their new GA107 GPU. Cut from the same cloth as the rest of the Ampere family, NVIDIA\u2019s 5th Ampere chip is the smallest and cheapest yet, fulfilling the company\u2019s traditional waterfall launch strategy of rolling out successively cheaper and lower-power/lower-performing chips for additional markets. As an added kicker, these are the first xx50 tier products to have ray tracing \u2013 and thus qualify for the RTX moniker \u2013 so expect to see NVIDIA promoting that aspect rather hard.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop Specifications\n\n\n\u00a0\nRTX 3070\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3060\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3050 Ti\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\nRTX 3050\r\n\t\t\tLaptop GPU\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n5120\n3840\n2560\n2048\n\n\nROPs\n80\n48\n32?\n32?\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1290 - 1620MHz\n1283 - 1703MHz\n1035 - 1695MHz\n1057 - 1740MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n14Gbps GDDR6\n14Gbps GDDR6\n12Gbps?

At the top is the RTX 3050 Ti, a full-fat (or close to it) GA107 implementation with 20 SMs, for a total of 2560 CUDA cores. Below it is the RTX 3050 (vanilla), with has 16 SMs for 2048 CUDA cores. As these are Ampere family parts, NVIDIA has kept the basic GPU functional blocks proportional across the lineup, so we\u2019re looking at 80/64 tensor cores and 20/16 ray tracing cores for the RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 respectively.\nPast that, NVIDIA isn\u2019t sharing too much about GA107 in particular. We\u2019re still waiting to find out the die size and transistor count (just how much smaller is it than the 276mm2 GA106?), as well as a few details like ROP counts.\nAs for clockspeeds, both RTX 3050 laptop parts are a bit more modestly clocked, owing to their lower TDP options. Officially, the boost clock for the RTX 3050 Ti for laptops is anywhere between 1035MHz and 1695MHz, depending on what the OEM dials in. Meanwhile the vanilla RTX 3050 for laptops lands between 1057MHz and 1740MHz; a bit higher than the Ti version, owing to the fewer enabled SMs in the lower-end part.\nMeanwhile, both adapters will ship with 4GB of GDDR6 memory. We\u2019re still awaiting confirmation from NVIDIA on the clockspeed, but 12Gbps is a reasonable bet for both power and cost reasons. Both cards come with a 128-bit memory bus \u2013 another typical design choice for xx50 tier parts \u2013 so this puts the cards\u2019 memory bandwidth at or above 192GB/sec.\n\nFinally, both parts offer the same 35 Watt to 80 Watt TDP window. This very wide range allows for the RTX 3050 parts to be suitable for use in everything from 13-inch gaming laptops to 17-inch workstation laptops. Though it also underscores the fact that the cards\u2019 performance will vary pretty widely from OEM to OEM, since power and cooling allowances are such a critical element of performance. Overall, the new RTX 3050 parts come in at a lower TDP than the RTX 3060 \u2013 which started at 60 Watts \u2013 which opens the door for use in a bunch more designs, though I fully expect RTX 3060 to be more efficient where the parts overlap in power consumption.\nPerformance Expectations & 140 Wins\nFor better or worse, NVIDIA doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about the actual performance of their low-end laptop adapters, and the RTX 3050 series is no exception. The company\u2019s promotional focus is more on features and how it compares to Intel\u2019s integrated graphics, so we don\u2019t have a lot of performance guidance to work with. Not helping matters again is the wide TDP range, which means different laptop designs can end up being quite far apart in performance.\n\nFor the games where NVIDIA does provide GTX 1650 Ti data as a comparison point, they have the RTX 3050 Ti at roughly 60% faster. But with a sample size of two games, this should be taken as a very rough estimate.\nIf nothing else, expect to see NVIDIA push DLSS harder here than they have on any other RTX 30 series part thus far. As these are the lowest performing Ampere parts (to date), they have little performance to spare for ray tracing and other resource-intensive effects at native (1080p) resolution, so NVIDIA will be relying on DLSS to make these advanced features viable on this entry-level hardware.\nOtherwise, as Ampere family parts, the new RTX 3050 for laptop accelerators offer the usual suite of NVIDIA features, including those laptop features rolled out back at the RTX 3060 For Laptops launch earlier this year. So this includes HDMI 2.1 output support and Dynamic Boost 2.0. As well, even these entry-level parts support PCI Express 4.0 connectivity and resizable PCIe base address register (reBAR) support to maximize performance there.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA is touting 140 wins across the consumer and professional (Studio) markets, underscoring the fact that the RTX 3050 series will be NVIDIA\u2019s highest volume parts for the laptop market. Over the years NVIDIA has established a rather cozy symbiotic relationship with Intel\u2019s H-series laptop CPUs \u2013 with xx50 tier parts being the de facto choice for laptops that include a discrete GPU as a baseline option \u2013 and it looks like that will once again be the case for Tiger Lake -H. Already NVIDIA has wins in 15-inch and 17-inch laptops from Dell, Lenovo, HP, and ASUS, and there will be more to come as OEMs continue to launch their next-generation H-series laptops.\nFinally, according to NVIDIA, the first RTX 3050-equipped laptops will be released as soon as today, depending on the shipping schedule of each OEM. Laptops with the new adapters will start at $799.\nGallery: RTX 3050 For Laptops Press Deck\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n30 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\npatel21 - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nWow, so now Nvidia launches their low end products along with intels new cpus. How times have changed.\n\n\n\nSmell This - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nI think folks are striving to *segment* individualized markets __ which is good and bad.  The good news is that more product should be available; the bad news is the buyer must be 'aware'With the Ampere mobiles I am look forward to deep dive into AMD/Intel/nVidia with the Radeon RX 6X00M in mobile graphics (pending releases this quarter) ___Make it so, AT!\n\n\n\nchrysrobyn - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nWith the GPU shortages, I'd really look hard at this to go in a desktop system. If it were available.\n\n\n\nSamus - Thursday, May 13, 2021 - link\nThe industry seems fixated on mobile chips for all segments at the moment, because the smaller dies result in more chips per wafer. The best example of this is all-in-ones and most sub-$500 PC's all have laptop chips in them, especially the Ryzen U series (which is basically desktop class performance in 15w package) and those low-end GPU's with smaller die sizes seemingly the only retail-available video cards.This is fine and all but it just goes to show everyone seems dependent on TSMC and without competition prices skyrocket.\n\n\n\nbrookheather - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nI bought a new Dell G15 5510 with an RTX 3050ti last week direct from Dell so they are already available.  Just waiting for it to arrive from the factory in China.\n\n\n\ngijames1225 - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nBe curious to see how these bench against he GTX 1650 / Super without DLSS when they come out.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nNotebookcheck have a performance preview based on a mid-TDP model already, and depending on resolution you're looking at performance between the RTX 2060 and the GTX 1660Ti - so it's not exactly a dramatic improvement, but it's not to be sniffed at, either.The RT performance in Port Royal compared with the RTX 2060 is *hilarious*, though. Truly humiliating stuff. They managed to make something that's even worse than the 2060, which was already fairly useless.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Tuesday, May 11, 2021 - link\nObviously there's either a driver problem, a testing problem, or a memory capacity limitation. Why would he test Port Royal at 1440p for this GPU, anyway? The laptop prototype he tested on only had a 1080p screen. If you want to drive a 1440p screen you probably want a different GPU, especially if you want to do ray tracing on 1440p, and certainly if you want to do ray tracing on 1440p without DLSS. The test is pretty silly, so it's not surprising that the results are hilarious.The 2060 is a great GPU. It's certainly not useless. I assume you're confusing what you are looking to buy with the market.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Thursday, May 13, 2021 - link\n\"Obviously there's either a driver problem, a testing problem, or a memory capacity limitation.\"I wouldn't say the first two are obvious. Problems with memory capacity seem very likely, but I feel like that's a relevant concern to raise about future games with RT effects.\"Why would he test Port Royal at 1440p for this GPU\"Port Royal is a 1440p test, so taking results at 1080p wouldn't be comparable to every other result in their database. I'm not sure how much lowering the resolution would help vs. the 2060 - Ampere's performance advantage over Turing increases with resolution. It's a bit of a problem for low-end parts like this one (you can see it in the other results).\"The 2060 is a great GPU. It's certainly not useless.\"I wasn't clear - the 2060's performance is fine (I have the broadly equivalent RX 5600M), it's the *RTX capabilities* that I was describing as \"fairly useless\". You have to sacrifice image quality to free up resources for effects that are supposed to improve image quality, and to me that doesn't make any sense. I think they should have limited RTX to the 2070 and above with Turing, and 3060 and above with Ampere.As it is, Nvidia is pushing low-end users to pay for RTX features they can't really use to provide the illusion of a larger installed user base for RTX. DLSS is a helpful feature for low-end cards even without RT, though, so it's not all bad.\n\n\n\nYojimbo - Thursday, May 13, 2021 - link\n\"I wouldn't say the first two are obvious. Problems with memory capacity seem very likely, but I feel like that's a relevant concern to raise about future games with RT effects.\"A, B, or C, is true if any of A, B, or C are true. It's not a relevant concern to raise, because in the future one is less likely to use the card for 1440p, not more likely. And we don't know the answer to the question (why is the benchmark so low) so we can't talk as if we did. First it needs to be explored and A, and B need to be ruled out. \"I wouldn't say...\" is not ruling it out. There's no reason to believe it's not A or B. None at all.\"Port Royal is a 1440p test\"Then it's a useless benchmark for this card.\"I wasn't clear - the 2060's performance is fine (I have the broadly equivalent RX 5600M), it's the *RTX capabilities* that I was describing as \"fairly useless\". You have to sacrifice image quality to free up resources for effects that are supposed to improve image quality, and to me that doesn't make any sense.\"That isn't true. You can play with RT and DLSS, especially if you are able to use G-Sync or Freesync, even at 1440p with the 2060. At 1080p the 2060 can lock to 60fps in Control with ultra settings, all ray tracing enabled, using DLSS.As it is, Nvidia is pushing low-end users to pay for RTX features they can't really use to provide the illusion of a larger installed user base for RTX.\"As it is, Nvidia is pushing low-end users to pay for RTX features they can't really use to provide the illusion of a larger installed user base for RTX.\"The evidence clearly says otherwise.

Version 1.2 includes new effects that enhance your microphone and webcam quality, plus features requested from the streaming community.\nNVIDIA Broadcast technologies are also being integrated natively into top streaming apps such as OBS Studio, AVerMedia and Notch.\nNVIDIA Broadcast uses AI to improve the quality of your microphone, speakers and webcam. RTX GPU owners can apply AI effects to their own microphone, or any incoming audio, removing unwanted noise. AI features also enhance the camera, including Background Removal, which removes a cluttered background from the camera feed, or Auto Frame which keeps the subject centered in the camera, even if they move. These effects run in real-time using Tensor Cores found on GeForce RTX GPUs. It\u2019s the perfect tool to enhance both live streaming and video conferencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast 1.2\nAs millions of people have pivoted to working from home, one noticeable struggle has been room echo \u2014 or reverb. It turns out that bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens \u2014 the new home offices for many aren\u2019t ideal spaces for capturing digital audio.\nThe new Room Echo Removal feature takes care of that by removing the echoey sound of your voice in rooms with poor acoustics. That echo may not feel so bad at first, but after a long streaming session or more than 400 days of meetings from home, your audience or colleagues will thank you for getting rid of it.\nIn addition to the audio-based Room Echo Removal, bothersome video noise is also going to become a thing of the past. Lower quality cameras often can output \u201cnoise\u201d \u2014 static that the audience can see on the video feed, especially in low-light situations. This is a complex challenge, one that will take some time to perfect \u2014 but the Video Noise Removal beta feature is a first step, helping to reduce video static to deliver a cleaner image.\nExisting features also receive improvements. The new update further enhances the quality and performance of the popular audio noise removal tool, with added profiles to better separate the sound of cats, dogs and even insects (cicadas be gone!). Auto Frame is also getting an update with a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d that will let the subject move within the frame, without the camera updating. Now, it\u2019ll move only when the talent leaves the middle-third of the screen.\nIn addition to feedback we receive on the AI effects, we receive a ton of feedback on the app itself. One bit of feedback, now incorporated in the app, is being able to run multiple AI effects on a single device. Now users can combine Background Blur with Auto Frame, or any combination they choose. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast Effects in AVerMedia, OBS and Notch\nNVIDIA partners closely with the content creator ecosystem, accelerating and enhancing top apps for RTX GPUs. \u00a0\nLast October, the NVIDIA Maxine SDKs that power the NVIDIA Broadcast app were released so developers could add these effects natively in their apps. Last month, we announced that OBS Studio was integrating our Noise Removal effect natively in OBS Studio 27, and that Notch had also integrated Body Tracking and Virtual Background.\nToday, we are announcing that AVerMedia has integrated the audio noise removal and virtual background effects natively into their apps. Users with an AVerMedia microphone or webcam can get these effects directly applied to your device, making it easier than ever to stream perfect audio and video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay in Touch!\nWe hope that you enjoy the updates. Try them out, and please send us your feedback on the NVIDIA Broadcast forums. Browse other comments and suggestions and vote for the ones you like as this will help guide future app development.\u00a0 You can help us further refine the AI by sharing a short audio and/or video clip at our feedback site. This will allow us to anonymously train the AI on your setup, so future iterations will run even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Dozens signed up for hands-on training from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute and joined networking sessions hosted by NVIDIA community resource groups in collaboration with organizations like Black in AI and LatinX in AI.\nMore than 1,500 sessions from GTC 2021 are now available for free replay on NVIDIA On-Demand \u2014 including panel discussions on AI literacy and efforts to grow the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.\nAdvocating for AI Literacy Among Youth\nIn a session called \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader Who Knows AI?,\u201d STEM advocates Justin Shaifer and Maynard Okereke (known as Mr. Fascinate and the Hip Hop M.D., respectively) led a conversation about initiatives to help young people understand AI.\nGiven the ubiquity of AI technologies, being surrounded by it \u201cis essentially just how they live,\u201d said Jim Gibbs, CEO of the Pittsburgh-based startup Meter Feeder. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know any different.\u201d\nBut school curriculums often don\u2019t teach young people how AI technologies work, how they\u2019re developed or about AI ethics. So it\u2019s important to help the next generation of developers prepare \u201cto take advantage of all the new opportunities that there are going to be for people who are familiar with machine learning and artificial intelligence,\u201d he said.\nPanelist Lisa Abel-Palmieri, CEO of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania, described how her organization\u2019s STEM instructors audited graduate-level AI classes at Carnegie Mellon University to inform a K-12 curriculum for children from historically marginalized communities. NVIDIA recently announced a three-year AI education partnership with the organization to create an AI Pathways Toolkit that Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide can deliver to students, particularly those from underserved and underrepresented communities.\nAnd Babak Mostaghimi, assistant superintendent of Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County Public Schools shared how his team helps students realize how AI is relevant to their daily experiences.\n\u201cWe started really getting kids to understand that AI is already part of your everyday life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when kids realize that, it\u2019s like, wait a minute, let me start asking questions like: Why does the algorithm behind something cause a certain video to pop up and not others?\u201d\nWatch the full session replay on NVIDIA On-Demand.\nDiverse Participation Brings Unique Perspectives\nAnother panel, \u201cDiversity Driving AI Innovation,\u201d was led by Brennon Marcano, CEO of the National GEM Consortium, a nonprofit focused on diversifying representation in science and engineering.\nResearchers and scientists from Apple, Amazon Web Services and the University of Utah shared their experiences working in AI, and the value that the perspectives of underrepresented groups can provide in the field.\n\u201cYour system on the outside is only as good as the data going in on the side,\u201d said Marcano. \u201cSo if the data is homogeneous and not diverse, then the output suffers from that.\u201d\nBut diversity of datasets isn\u2019t the only problem, said Nashlie Sephus, a tech evangelist at Amazon Web Services AI who focuses on fairness and identifying biases. Another essential consideration is making sure developer teams are diverse.\n\u201cJust by having someone on the team with a diverse experience, a diverse perspective and background \u2014 it goes a long way. Teams and companies are now starting to realize that,\u201d she said.\nThe panel described how developers can mitigate algorithmic bias, improve diversity on their teams and find strategies to fairly compensate focus groups who provide feedback on products.\n\u201cWhenever you are trying to create something in software that will face the world, the only way you can be precisely coupled to that world is to invite the world into that process,\u201d said Rogelio Cardona-Rivera, assistant professor at the University of Utah. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you will be able to be as precise if you leave diversity off the table.\u201d\nWatch the discussion here.\nLearn more about diversity and inclusion at GTC, and watch additional session replays on NVIDIA On-Demand.

Pictures of the RTX 3080 Ti have also surfaced and NVIDIA has teased the announcement of the RTX 3080 Ti.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Comes Equipped With 10240 CUDA Cores, 12GB GDDR6X VRAM, & The Same Cooler Design As The RTX 3080\nIn a GPU-Z validation, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti was validated in the utility tool. The graphics card comes from PALIT as indicated in the validation and the PCI device ID for the GA102-225 Ampere GPU is 2208. The RTX 3080 Ti comes equipped with 10240 CUDA cores. The RTX 3080 Ti also comes equipped with 112 ROPs. This specific PALIT SKU features a base clock of 1365 MHz and boosts up to 1665 MHz. In the Geekbench benchmark, we discovered the RTX 3080 Ti will boast 34.2 TFLOPs.\nRelated Story Unreleased MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU With 20 GB VRAM Unearthed, Runs Fine & Supports Overclocking\n\nIn the memory department, the RTX 3080 Ti comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR6X memory clocked at 1188 MHz (translates to an effective memory clock of 19008 MHz). The memory features a 384-bit bus width and a bandwidth of 912.4 GB/s. The board design and TDP aren't in the validation, but reviewers with cards in hand have confirmed the 350W TDP. The board design is expected to be the PG132-SKU18 PCB design seen on the RTX 3080.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nIn terms of the design of the Founder's Edition of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, Videocardz was able to get photos of the Founder's Edition RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 3080 Ti is sticking with the 2 slot wide dual-fan cooling design which has one fan on each side of the card. NVIDIA hasn't decided to make any changes to the power connector and has kept the 12pin MOLEX connector on the front of the card. The cooler performance is unknown at the moment with the increased TDP, so we will have to wait until the review embargo lifts to see the cooler performance in independent reviews.\nThe announcement of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is expected to be during NVIDIA's Computex 2021 keynote on May 31st. This will be followed by the review embargo lift of the RTX 3080 Ti on June 2nd with the official launch the day after, June 3rd.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series 'Ampere' Graphics Card Specifications:\n\n\n\nGraphics Card NameNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 TiNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\n\n\n\n\nGPU NameAmpere GA107Ampere GA107Ampere GA106-300Ampere GA104-200Ampere GA104-300Ampere GA104-400Ampere GA102-200Ampere GA102-225Ampere GA102-300\n\n\nProcess NodeSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nmSamsung 8nm\n\n\nDie SizeTBATBATBA395.2mm2395.2mm2395.2mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2628.4mm2\n\n\nTransistorsTBATBATBA17.4 Billion17.4 Billion17.4 Billion28 Billion28 Billion28 Billion\n\n\nCUDA Cores2048?2560?358448645888614487041024010496\n\n\nTMUs / ROPs64 / 4080 / 48112 / 64152 / 80184 / 96192/ 96272 / 96320 / 112328 / 112\n\n\nTensor / RT Cores64 / 1680 / 20112 / 28152 / 38184 / 46192/ 48272 / 68320 / 80328 / 82\n\n\nBase ClockTBATBA1320 MHz1410 MHz1500 MHz1575 MHz1440 MHz1365 MHz1400 MHz\n\n\nBoost ClockTBATBA1780 MHz1665 MHz1730 MHz1770 MHz1710 MHz1665 MHz1700 MHz\n\n\nFP32 ComputeTBATBA12.7 TFLOPs16.2 TFLOPs20 TFLOPs22 TFLOPs30 TFLOPs34 TFLOPs36 TFLOPs\n\n\nRT TFLOPsTBATBA25.4 TFLOPs32.4 TFLOPs40 TFLOPs42 TFLOPs58 TFLOPs67 TFLOPs69 TFLOPs\n\n\nTensor-TOPsTBATBA101 TOPs129.6 TOPs163 TOPs174 TOPs238 TOPs273 TOPs285 TOPs\n\n\nMemory Capacity4 GB GDDR6?4 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR68 GB GDDR6X10 GB GDDR6X12 GB GDDR6X24 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Bus128-bit128-bit192-bit256-bit256-bit256-bit320-bit384-bit384-bit\n\n\nMemory SpeedTBATBA15 Gbps14 Gbps14 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19 Gbps19.5 Gbps\n\n\nBandwidthTBATBA360 Gbps448 Gbps448 Gbps608 Gbps760 Gbps912 Gbps936 Gbps\n\n\nTGP~75W~100W170W200W220W290W320W350W350W\n\n\nPrice (MSRP / FE)$149?$199?$329$399 US$499 US$599 US$699 US$1199$1499 US\n\n\nLaunch (Availability)2021?2021?February 2021December 202029th October 202010th June 202117th September 20203rd June 202124th September 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 GPUs See Huge Price Cuts At BestBuy: 3090 Ti For $880, 3080 Ti For $720, 3080 For $420, 3070 For $300 US\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Prices Continue To Crash \u2013 AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Now Selling For $699 US, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Starting at $869 US\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXMG Releases Its Fully Decked Out NEO 17 & NEO 15 Laptops With AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU, RTX 3080 Ti GPU & Liquid Cooling Support\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Graphics Cards Restocked & Reloaded: Gaming GPU Availability Improves Along With Prices\n\nJason R.

Even small reductions in latency have an impact on performance. Powerful GPUs, high refresh displays, and tuned game settings can help gamers unlock their full potential.\nTo further improve your performance on the virtual field there\u2019s now also NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Mode, a free update for many popular competitive games that reduces system latency. Acquire targets faster, react quicker, and increase aim precision simply by enabling NVIDIA Reflex in a game\u2019s settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex: Available Today In Rust\nFacepunch Studios\u2019 phenomenally successful Rust attracts ever more gamers to its high-stakes servers month after month, where everything and everyone is a threat to your survival. Sleep with one eye open, because a raid can occur at any time, and keep your head on a swivel when exploring, resource harvesting, and stalking enemy players.\nWith just a few hits being deadly, you want the fastest possible response times, your shots to land on the target, and your actions to occur that bit quicker than the enemy\u2019s. Enter NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Mode, which is available from 11am PT today in Rust for anyone with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nvidia Reflex is now available for Rust, reducing latency by up to 38%! Rust players with GeForce GPUs will get an upgrade by simply enabling Reflex through the options menu.\" - Helk, Rust's Project Lead, Designer & Programmer\nTo enable NVIDIA Reflex in Rust, download and install our latest Game Ready Driver and the newest game update, head to options menu in-game, then Graphics settings, and enable the NVIDIA Reflex setting. When activated, system latency will be reduced by up to 38%, greatly improving responsiveness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRust also includes the NVIDIA Reflex Latency Flash Indicator, so if you\u2019re sporting a Reflex Latency Analyzer-compatible monitor and have GeForce Experience installed, enable the flash indicator in-game and position your monitoring rectangle over the indicator location to get accurate system latency results every time.\nAnd if you wish to reduce system latency further still, there are a number of system tweaks, game tweaks and hardware upgrades that you can make, detailed in full in our System Latency Optimization Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Tuned For More Reflex and GeForce Updates\nTo be the first to learn about the latest NVIDIA Reflex games, bookmark GeForce.com and follow our social media accounts on your platform of choice.

Ryan Simpson wanted to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing into something much broader that could tackle this needle-in-a-haystack problem.\nWith edge AI servers strategically located at its processing centers, he believed USPS could analyze the billions of images each center generated. The resulting insights, expressed in a few key data points, could be shared quickly over the network.\nThe data scientist, half a dozen architects at NVIDIA and others designed the deep-learning models needed in a three-week sprint that felt like one long hackathon. The work was the genesis of the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP, pronounced EE-sip), a distributed edge AI system that\u2019s up and running on the NVIDIA EGX platform at USPS today.\nAn AI Platform at the Edge\nIt turns out edge AI is a kind of stage for many great performances. ECIP is already running a second app that acts like automated eyes, tracking items for a variety of business needs.\nCameras mounted on the sorting machines capture addresses, barcodes and other data such as hazardous materials symbols. Courtesy of U.S. Postal Service.\n\u201cIt used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple hours,\u201d said Todd Schimmel, the manager who oversees USPS systems including ECIP, which uses NVIDIA-Certified edge servers from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.\nAnother analysis was even more telling. It said a computer vision task that would have required two weeks on a network of servers with 800 CPUs can now get done in 20 minutes on the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in one of the HPE Apollo 6500 servers.\nToday, each edge server processes 20 terabytes of images a day from more than 1,000 mail processing machines. Open source software from NVIDIA, the Triton Inference Server, acts as the digital mailperson, delivering the AI models each of the 195 systems need \u2014\u00a0 when and how they need it.\nNext App for the Edge\nUSPS put out a request for what could be the next app for ECIP, one that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow.\n\u201cIn the past, we would have bought new hardware, software \u2014 a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we\u2019d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you\u2019re talking about approximately a billion images,\u201d said Schimmel.\nToday, the new OCR use case will live as a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes and served by Triton.\nThe same systems software smoothed the initial deployment of ECIP in the early weeks of the pandemic. Operators rolled out containers to get the first systems running as others were being delivered, updating them as the full network of nearly nodes was installed.\nAI algorithms were developed on NVIDIA DGX servers at a U.S. Postal Service Engineering facility. Courtesy of NVIDIA.\n\u201cThe deployment was very streamlined,\u201d Schimmel said. \u201cWe awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August \u2014 the USPS was very happy with that,\u201d he added.\nTriton Expedites Model Deliveries\nPart of the software magic dust under ECIP\u2019s hood, Triton automates the delivery of different AI models to different systems that may have different versions of GPUs and CPUs supporting different deep-learning frameworks. That saves a lot of time for edge AI systems like the ECIP network of almost 200 distributed servers.\nThe app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.\n\u201cThe models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service \u2014 it helps us maintain our mission,\u201d Schimmel said.\nA Pipeline of Edge AI Apps\nSo far, departments across USPS from enterprise analytics to finance and marketing have spawned ideas for as many as 30 applications for ECIP. Schimmel hopes to get a few of them up and running this year.\nOne would automatically check if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight and destination. Another one would automatically decipher a damaged barcode and could be online as soon as this summer.\nThe USPS runs AI inference on HPE Apollo 6500 servers, each equipped with four NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Photo courtesy HPE.\n\u201cThis has a benefit for us and our customers, letting us know where a specific parcel is at \u2014 it\u2019s not a silver bullet, but it will fill a gap and boost our performance,\u201d he said.\nThe work is part of a broader effort at USPS to explore its digital footprint and unlock the value of its data in ways that benefit customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI. Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,\u201d he said.\nLearn more about the benefits of edge computing and the NVIDIA EGX platform, as well as how NVIDIA\u2019s edge AI solutions are transforming every industry.\nPictured at top: Postal Service employees perform spot checks to ensure packages are properly handled and sorted.

The new flagship gaming GPU of the GeForce RTX family, the RTX 3080 Ti will be available worldwide June 3 starting at $1,199, with the RTX 3070 Ti available next week starting at $599.\nWhile previous-generation GPUs tackled the ambitious games of their era, contemporary games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs: Legion have elevated realism \u2014 and increased overall demands of modern graphics cards.\nPowered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the RTX 3080 Ti delivers an incredible leap in performance and fidelity with acclaimed features such as ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS performance-boosting AI, NVIDIA Reflex latency-reduction, NVIDIA Broadcast streaming features and additional memory that allows it to speed through the most popular creator applications as well.\n\u201cWith RTX such a huge success, gamers and creators will be thrilled with the performance and features the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti offers,\u201d said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of the GeForce business unit at NVIDIA. \u201cAs the new flagship to the RTX family, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is the ultimate upgrade for GPU enthusiasts of any generation.\u201d\nUnsurpassed Performance\r\nAcross a variety of ray-traced and rasterized DirectX and Vulkan titles, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is a gaming powerhouse that also brings lower latency for better responsiveness and a competitive edge to the games millions of people are playing today.\nFor gamers still rocking the well-loved GTX 1080 Ti, the RTX 3080 Ti is 2x faster in traditional rasterization and much faster with ray tracing and other cutting-edge gaming features enabled.\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is just as impressive in its price class, delivering 1.5x more performance over the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER and 2x the frames per second over the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, which launched in 2017.\nWatch the first 4K ray-tracing gameplay footage featuring DOOM Eternal running on a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.\nPerfect for Creators, Too\r\nThe world\u2019s 45 million-plus creative professionals demand more from their hardware than ever, so GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPUs deliver amped up levels of creative performance as well.\nBacked by the NVIDIA Studio platform and powered with 12GB of GDDR6X(1) memory for creative applications, RTX is accelerating the No. 1 photography application \u2014 Adobe Photoshop; the No. 1 video editing application \u2014 Adobe Premiere Pro; the No. 1 broadcast application \u2014 OBS; and every major 3D renderer. There are now over 70 content creation applications that support RTX-accelerated ray tracing, DLSS or AI features.\nNVIDIA DLSS: The AI Gift That Gamers Love\r\nAI is revolutionizing gaming \u2014 from in-game physics and animation simulation to real-time rendering and AI-assisted broadcasting features. Powered by dedicated AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores, NVIDIA DLSS boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, crisp game images and it gives gamers the performance headroom to maximize ray-tracing settings and increase output resolutions.\nAdoption of DLSS technology has been swift, and the game title count is set to increase quickly with support in the world\u2019s leading licensed game engines, Unreal Engine and Unity Engine. The all-star lineup of gaming franchises that use DLSS to deliver a new level of graphics includes Battlefield, Call of Duty, Cyberpunk, Fortnite, Minecraft, Tomb Raider and many more.\nNVIDIA Reflex and Broadcast: The Ultimate Play\nNVIDIA Reflex technology reduces system latency (or input lag), making games more responsive and giving players in competitive multiplayer titles an edge over the opposition. In fact, 12 out of the top 15 most played competitive shooters now support Reflex, including Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, Overwatch, Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six Siege and Valorant, and it is coming soon to Escape from Tarkov and Crossfire.\nNVIDIA Broadcast is a suite of audio and video AI enhancements, including virtual backgrounds, motion capture and advanced noise removal, that users can apply to chats, Skype calls and video conferences.\n\nWhere to Buy\r\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be available on June 3 starting at $1,199, with the RTX 3070 Ti available on June 10 starting at $599. Both GPUs will be available for purchase as custom boards \u2014 including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models \u2014 from leading add-in card providers, including ASUS, Colorful, EVGA, Gainward, Galax, GIGABYTE, Inno3D, MSI, Palit, PNY, Zotac and other regional providers around the world.\nLimited-edition NVIDIA Founders Edition boards will also be available.

Our RTX 30 Series is built on our second-generation RTX architecture, with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores, delivering amazing visuals and performance to gamers and creators.\nBecause NVIDIA GPUs are programmable, users regularly discover new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.\nHalving Hash Rate\nTo help get GeForce GPUs in the hands of gamers, we announced in February that all GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards shipped with a reduced Ethereum hash rate.\nToday, we\u2019re taking additional measures by applying a reduced ETH hash rate to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. These cards will start shipping in late May.\nClear Communication to Gamers\nBecause these GPUs originally launched with a full hash rate, we want to ensure that customers know exactly what they\u2019re getting when they buy GeForce products. To help with this, our GeForce partners are labeling the GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti cards with a \u201cLite Hash Rate,\u201d or \u201cLHR,\u201d identifier. The identifier will be in retail product listings and on the box.\nThis reduced hash rate only applies to newly manufactured cards with the LHR identifier and not to cards already purchased.\nGeForce Is Made for Gaming\nGeForce RTX GPUs have introduced a range of cutting-edge technologies \u2014 RTX real-time ray tracing, AI-powered DLSS frame rate booster, NVIDIA Reflex super-fast response rendering for best system latency, and many more \u2014 created to meet the needs of gamers and those who create digital experiences.\nWe believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Gaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And that performance doesn\u2019t even include a second phase coming later this year to the system based at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.\nMore than two dozen applications are getting ready to be among the first to ride the 6,159 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in Perlmutter, the largest A100-powered system in the world. They aim to advance science in astrophysics, climate science and more.\nA 3D Map of the Universe\nIn one project, the supercomputer will help assemble the largest 3D map of the visible universe to date. It will process data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a kind of cosmic camera that can capture as many as 5,000 galaxies in a single exposure.\nResearchers need the speed of Perlmutter\u2019s GPUs to capture dozens of exposures from one night to know where to point DESI the next night. Preparing a year\u2019s worth of the data for publication would take weeks or months on prior systems, but Perlmutter should help them accomplish the task in as little as a few days.\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy with the 20x speedups we\u2019ve gotten on GPUs in our preparatory work,\u201d said Rollin Thomas, a data architect at NERSC who\u2019s helping researchers get their code ready for Perlmutter.\nPerlmutter\u2019s Persistence Pays Off\nDESI\u2019s map aims to shed light on dark energy, the mysterious physics behind the accelerating expansion of the universe. Dark energy was largely discovered through the 2011 Nobel Prize-winning work of Saul Perlmutter, a still-active astrophysicist at Berkeley Lab who will help dedicate the new supercomputer named for him.\n\u201cTo me, Saul is an example of what people can do with the right combination of insatiable curiosity and a commitment to optimism,\u201d said Thomas, who worked with Perlmutter on projects following up the Nobel-winning discovery.\nSupercomputer Blends AI, HPC\nA similar spirit fuels many projects that will run on NERSC\u2019s new supercomputer. For example, work in materials science aims to discover atomic interactions that could point the way to better batteries and biofuels.\nTraditional supercomputers can barely handle the math required to generate simulations of a few atoms over a few nanoseconds with programs such as Quantum Espresso. But by combining their highly accurate simulations with machine learning, scientists can study more atoms over longer stretches of time.\n\u201cIn the past it was impossible to do fully atomistic simulations of big systems like battery interfaces, but now scientists plan to use Perlmutter to do just that,\u201d said Brandon Cook, an applications performance specialist at NERSC who\u2019s helping researchers launch such projects.\nThat\u2019s where Tensor Cores in the A100 play a unique role. They accelerate both the double-precision floating point math for simulations and the mixed-precision calculations required for deep learning.\nSimilar work won NERSC recognition in November as a Gordon Bell finalist for its BerkeleyGW program using NVIDIA V100 GPUs. The extra muscle of the A100 promises to take such efforts to a new level, said Jack Deslippe, who led the project and oversees application performance at NERSC.\nSoftware Helps Perlmutter Sing\nSoftware is a strategic component of Perlmutter, too, said Deslippe, noting support for OpenMP and other popular programming models in the NVIDIA HPC SDK the system uses.\nSeparately, RAPIDS, open-source code for data science on GPUs, will speed the work of NERSC\u2019s growing team of Python programmers. It proved its value in a project that analyzed all the network traffic on NERSC\u2019s Cori supercomputer nearly 600x faster than prior efforts on CPUs.\n\u201cThat convinced us RAPIDS will play a major part in accelerating scientific discovery through data,\u201d said Thomas.\nCoping with COVID\u2019s Challenges\nDespite the pandemic, Perlmutter is on schedule. But the team had to rethink critical steps like how it ran hackathons for researchers working from home on code for the system\u2019s exascale-class applications.\nMeanwhile, engineers from Hewlett Packard Enterprise helped assemble phase 1 of the system, collaborating with NERSC staff who upgraded their facility to accommodate the new system. \u201cWe greatly appreciate the work of those people onsite bringing the system up, especially under all the special COVID protocols,\u201d said Thomas.\nAt the virtual launch event, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang congratulated the Berkeley Lab crew on its plans to advance science with the supercomputer.\n\u201cPerlmutter\u2019s ability to fuse AI and high performance computing will lead to breakthroughs in a broad range of fields from materials science and quantum physics to climate projections, biological research and more,\u201d Huang said.\nOn Time for AI Supercomputing\nThe virtual ribbon cutting today represents a very real milestone.\n\u201cAI for science is a growth area at the U.S. Department of Energy, where proof of concepts are moving into production use cases in areas like particle physics, materials science and bioenergy,\u201d said Wahid Bhimji, acting lead for NERSC\u2019s data and analytics services group.\n\u201cPeople are exploring larger and larger neural-network models and there\u2019s a demand for access to more powerful resources, so Perlmutter with its A100 GPUs, all-flash file system and streaming data capabilities is well timed to meet this need for AI,\u201d he added.\nResearchers who want to run their work on Perlmutter can submit a request for access to the system.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Data Science | Energy | GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | NVIDIA A100 | Science | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With NVIDIA DLSS, GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptops are also up to 2x faster than previous-generation systems.\nOnly GeForce RTX GPUs feature specialized Tensor Cores that power DLSS, which is now available in more than 40 AAA titles and indie game hits, with recent additions such as Outriders, Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT and Mortal Shell.\nAdditionally, creators can experience DLSS acceleration in applications such as D5 Render, SheenCity Mars and NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, which enable artists to visualize their designs in real time instead of waiting for ray-traced scenes to finish rendering.\n\u201cConsumers are spending more time than ever on laptops \u2014 PC gamers, creators and students are all driving demand for massive improvements in graphics horsepower and AI-accelerated applications,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. \u201cLaptop manufacturers are responding to this market momentum by designing thinner, higher-performing models to meet the various needs of consumers \u2014 it\u2019s no wonder NVIDIA GPUs are powering so many new designs.\u201d\nNVIDIA Reflex Brings Low-Latency Esports to Laptops\r\nFor those who enjoy competitive games, new GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptops can deliver 144+ FPS and sub-25ms system latency in titles such as Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege and Valorant, thanks to the NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency mode. Seven out of the top 10 competitive shooter games have NVIDIA Reflex support, which allows gamers to achieve lower system latency so they can play their absolute best. NVIDIA Reflex is also supported across the entire RTX 30 Series lineup.\nNew AI Effects for Video Conferencing and Livestreaming in NVIDIA Broadcast\r\nAll RTX 30 Series laptops include support for NVIDIA Broadcast, an app that transforms laptops into a home studio. This has now been improved with new AI effects \u2014 room echo removal and video noise removal \u2014 and updated the audio noise removal to eliminate sounds from cats, dogs and insects. These effects, together with the previously released virtual background and auto frame, can now be stacked to provide more control and quality over audio and video.\nNew NVIDIA Studio Laptops\r\nRTX-based Studio laptops are designed for creators to meet their demands for performance and reliability. Newly unveiled NVIDIA Studio laptops equipped with RTX 30 Series GPUs now render creative and professional apps up to 2x faster than the previous generation. Video editors can work with 8K RAW footage, use AI to simplify workflows and reduce encode times by up to 75 percent. Additionally, artists can take advantage of up to 16GB of graphics memory to work with huge assets or multiple apps simultaneously for increased productivity and efficiency.\nAvailability \r\nNew GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops, including GeForce RTX 3080, 3070 and 3060, are available starting today from the world\u2019s top manufacturers, including Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI and Razer. RTX 3050 Ti and 3050-based laptops will be available this summer.\nGeForce RTX 30 Series laptops will also be available from local OEMs and system builders, including Aftershock, CyberPower PC, Digital Storm, Eluktronics, Falcon NW, Hasee, Maingear, Mechrevo, Mouse, Origin PC, PC Specialist, Scan, Schenker, Terrans Force, Thunderobot and XOTIC PC. Pricing, configurations and availability will vary among regions and partners.\nPress assets, including product photographs, specifications, chip and die shots and other materials, are available on the NVIDIA press site at www.nvidia-press.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence.

The results illustrate the challenges investors face in the broader sustainable or ethical investing space, where definitions can vary from fund to fund.BetaShares Global Sustainability Leaders ETF (ASX:ETHI) has more than $1.3 billion under management. It tracks an index of large global stocks identified as \u201cClimate Leaders\u201d, companies that have also passed several exclusion tests, including involvement with fossil fuels, weapons, and human rights abuses.Sustainable funds like ETHI are growing in popularity. Assets in Australian sustainable funds topped $25 billion in 2020, with $4 billion over the year.Interest in sustainable investment has come alongside concerns about \u201cgreenwashing\u201d, whereby funds or companies convey a misleading impression about their environmental credentials. In March, the European Union introduced new rules to make sustainable financial products more consistent and transparent.ETHI\u2019s holdings pass some of the strictest exclusion tests in the industry. Sectors such as fossil fuels, weapons, pornography, and factory farming are excluded, although the fund counts among its holdings companies, such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), that have been fined for tax evasion.The fund\u2019s definition of \u201cclimate leadership\u201d means many of the holdings, such as Big Pharma or the credit card majors, are not directly involved in ethical or sustainable activities.Is Mastercard (MA) a sustainable investment? It depends what an investor means by sustainable.Below, we dig into the fund to help investors understand where their money is going, and the prospects for this popular and important space.Building a sustainable fundETHI tracks an index of 200 companies, the Nasdaq Future Global Sustainability Leaders Index. The index is jointly created by Nasdaq and BetaShares.The index is populated through a three-step process. First comes a $2 billion market cap minimum and trading liquidity requirements. Next, firms must qualify as \u201cclimate leaders\u201d, with a carbon efficiency score, defined as greenhouse gas emissions divided by annual revenues, in the top third for their industry, or superior performance on Scope 4 carbon emissions, defined as avoided emissions.A third stage excludes sectors by ESG criteria. Companies involved in fossil fuels, weapons, live animal exports, factory farming, detention centres, or pay-day lending? Gone. Companies with more than 33 per cent of revenue from junk food production? Gone. No women on boards? Gone.An external three-person Responsible Investment Committee (RIC) determines the final list. The RIC actively monitors ESG-related controversies, says Cameron Gleeson, senior investment specialist at BetaShares.\"The RIC has monthly screens for controversies and engages with those companies where they believe it is required,\" he says.\"The RIC can exclude a company if an alteration in behaviour is not evident.\"In 2018, the RIC removed Facebook from the fund over data privacy concerns.ETHI is Australia\u2019s largest sustainable exchange traded fund measured by net assets. It is followed by Vanguard\u2019s Etclly Cons Intl Shrs ETF (VESG), a currency hedged version of ETHI (HETH), and VanEck Vectors MSCI Intl Sust Eq ETF (ESGI).Credit cards, pharma, and HR softwareETHI\u2019s strict exclusion criteria leave the portfolio with no exposure to the fossil fuel sector. But as per the fund\u2019s definition of \u201cclimate leadership\u201d, many of the holdings\u2019 core businesses have little to do with climate or environmental sustainability beyond reducing their own emissions.Technology and financial services make up 52.73 per cent of the fund. This rises to 81.49 once healthcare and consumer companies are included.Financial services holdings are dominated by credit card providers (12.55 per cent) and insurers (7.95 per cent). Visa (V), Mastercard, and American Express (AXP) make up 8.23 per cent of the fund\u2019s portfolio.The fund\u2019s portfolio includes 8.9 per cent spread across 19 enterprise software providers, covering everything from cybersecurity, to cloud computing, to specialised software for financial services.Pharmaceutical giants total 3.03 per cent of the holdings, with Roche (ROG) at 1.11 per cent; Sanofi (SNY) at 0.76; GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) at 0.41 per cent; AbbVie (ABBV) at 0.75 per cent.The top three holdings as of 30 April were iPhone maker Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), and electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (TSLA).The top 10 holdings of the three major sustainable funds are shown below, with crossholdings highlighted in matching colours.Sustainable funds, top ten holdingsSource: Morningstar Premium, VESG as of 31 Jan, ETHI as of 30 April, ESGI as of 5 MayStrong performanceETHI\u2019s return of 21.88 per cent since its inception in January 2017 is impressive. By comparison, over the same period SPDR S&P/ASX 200 ETF (STW) returned 8.82 per cent.The fund\u2019s best year was 2019, where it returned a mouth-watering 35.60 per cent.Helped by its holding in Tesla, the fund stormed to a 24.92 per cent return in 2020, more than doubling the since-inception performance of other sustainable ETFs like VESG or ESGI. Tesla returned 743.44 per cent in 2020.Aussie sustainable funds side by side*ETHI was founded 5 Jan 2017, 2017 returns are from this date.Source: Morningstar Direct; accessed 6 May.It\u2019s a similar story among the holdings. Over the period since inception, the fund has had many more winners than losers. A total of 180 of ETHI\u2019s holdings have had a positive return over the period since inception, compared to 12 losers.Top 5 winners and losers (Inception to 30 March 2021)Source: Morningstar Direct; accessed 6 May 2021Aside from Tesla, the top four performers all provide technology and software for enterprises.Annual expenses include a management fee of 0.49 per cent and fund expenses, capped at 0.10 per cent. ESGI charges 0.55 per cent, while VESG comes in at 0.18 per cent.Growth funds carry risksThe fund\u2019s returns look similar to growth and technology-focused ETFs such as Hyperion Global Growth Companies ETF (HYGG) or ETFS Morningstar Global Technology ETF (TECH).ETHI alongside growth funds (Inception to 8 March 2021)YTD figures are until 8 March 2021Source: Morningstar DirectA growth emphasis hurt many ESG indexes during the Q1 2020 rotation to value, because they tend to favour growth and technology over energy. The Russell 3000 growth index lost 5 per cent between 12 February and 4 March this year. The Nasdaq 100 lost 9.7 per cent over the same period.While 180 of ETHI\u2019s holdings have had a positive return over the 4\u00bd years since inception, during the February-March decline, 141 of the holdings fell into negative territory. ETHI performed worse than blend funds like VESG or ESGI during this period, with a fall of -7.14 per cent, compared to -4.95 for VESG, and -3.82 for ESGI.Globally, only 24 per cent of Morningstar\u2019s ESG-screened indexes beat their broad market equivalents.Performance of ETHI\u2019s 200 holdings. Each line is one firm. (Inception and 12 Feb \u2013 4 March 2021)Source: Morningstar DirectSustainability in practiceETHI scores highly on Morningstar sustainability scores with a 5-globe sustainability rating, putting it in the top 3 per cent of funds in its category. The rating indicates that, on average, more of its assets invested in companies that have lower ESG risk as characterised by Sustainalytics.The fund also received a Morningstar \u201cLow Carbon\u201d designation, with no fossil fuel involvement.Morningstar\u2019s \u201cESG Commitment level\u201d assesses a fund manager\u2019s commitment to incorporating ESG principles into their investment organisation and process. The scale runs from Leader, Advanced, Basic, and Low.BetaShares scores a Low because it does not impose any ESG principles, philosophies, or policies at the firm level or across most of its other product ranges.ESG score breakdownsSource Morningstar Direct and SustainalyticsTax evasion and animal testingETHI\u2019s inclusion of pharmaceutical and medical research firms does expose it to animal testing. Sustainalytics, a Morningstar ESG research house, categorises animal testing according to whether it is used for pharmaceutical products, medical devices, biotechnology, or non-pharmaceutical products. Thirty-nine of ETHI\u2019s holdings conduct at least one form of animal testing, with the majority doing so only for pharmaceutical purposes.In relation to the claim that thirty-nine of ETHI\u2019s holdings conduct animal testing, BetaShares says: \u201cETHI is one of the only sustainable investment funds to screen for animal testing, which is a key differentiator in the market. Companies which engage in animal testing for medical purposes are not screened from the fund.\u201dCompanies accused of tax evasion have also found their way into the portfolio. ETHI holds a $7 million position (0.52 per cent) in Activision Blizzard, makers of the popular game World of Warcraft. The firm has a history of using tax havens in Bermuda and Barbados, according to NGO Taxwatch. In 2018, French tax authorities hit the firm with a \u20ac652 million bill. The company disputes the claims.It\u2019s a similar story for Netflix (NFLX), where ETHI has a $26.6 million or 1.96 per cent position. The Guardian reports the firm paid no income tax in 2018 and stands accused of funnelling profits through low tax jurisdictions such as the Netherlands.When the fund was set up, exclusions based on tax minimisation were not common, says BetaShares' Gleeson. In 2019, 7 per cent of funds screened based on \"paying a fair share of tax\", according to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia.\"We spent a few years surveying the market to see what were considered important issues and the original screens were based on those,\" he says.\"The fact we haven't included it [tax minimisation] yet suggests it hasn't met the threshold.\"Are you an avoider, engager, or changer?There are three broad ways to invest sustainably: avoid, engage, or change. Avoiders want a good return but don\u2019t want their money invested with companies who pollute, pump oil, or pay their workers a pittance\u2014whether because of ethics or financial risk. Engagers are willing to invest in companies outside the ESG universe to create change from within. Changers only want to invest in businesses that directly contribute to a social or environmental aim.ETHI performs admirably for avoiders and engagers, even if its inclusion of tax minimisers raises questions. Changers might prefer more thematic funds like BetaShares Climate Change Innovation ETF (ERTH) or VanEck Vectors Global Clean Energy ETF (CLNE).This article appeared last week under the headline 'Under the hood of Australia\u2019s largest sustainable ETF'. It has been updated with the following clarifications:BetaShares wishes to state that \u201cETHI is designed to act as a diversified core portfolio holding of liquid, global companies, which focusses on climate leadership across industries and screens across a wide range of ESG issues.\" A 'Year to Date' column has been added to the chart: 'ETHI alongside growth funds' alongside a sentence about this performance.BETASHARESESGESG RISKSETHIETHICAL INVESTINGSUSTAINABLE INVESTINGAUTHORLewis Jacksonis a reporter and data journalist with Morningstar.SHARE THIS ARTICLE Article Page URL has been copied to clipboard for sharing.

Even though it is another nine to 12 months before completion, the Good Class Bungalow (GCB) recently changed hands for $63.7 million or at a record $4,291 psf, although a caveat has yet to be lodged. (See: Good Class Bungalow at Jervois Hill on the market for $37.8 mil)  This latest price of $4,291 psf supersedes the $4,005 psf paid for a GCB at Nassim Road by Dr Shi Xu, founder of Singapore-listed Nanofilm Technologies, and his wife, Jin Xiao Qun at the end of March. The buyer of the GCB at Cluny Hill is said to be a Singaporean entrepreneur in the tech sector who's in his early 30s. However, he wants to remain anonymous. \u201cHe was very specific about what he wanted to buy,\u201d says Bruce Lye, managing partner of SRI, who brokered the sale. \u201cHe loves the surrounding greenery, and there are only a few locations that offer this. Other than the Cluny area, the other is the GCB area at Peirce Road, next to the Dempsey area.\u201d    The artist\u2019s impression of the Good Class Bungalow at 2 Cluny Hill (Picture: Wallflower Architecture + Design) And the buyer also wanted something \u201cbrand new\u201d, adds Lye. Having visited \u201ca lot of places\u201d, he had not found anything that met his requirements until he came upon 2 Cluny Hill. Lye approached the owners of the property on his behalf. \u201cThe owners were initially reluctant to sell as this was going to be their home,\u201d relates Lye. \u201cThey said they had received many unsolicited offers and were prepared to wait. In fact, they had rejected an offer I had submitted previously on behalf of a Chinese client.\u201d  However, the Singaporean buyer was serious in his intent. Finally, Lye arranged a dinner for the prospective buyer and sellers to meet. \u201cMost people who approach us about buying the property will ask us about the specifications of the house but this client didn\u2019t,\u201d says Sebestian Soh, who spoke on behalf of his family, the sellers of the GCB at 2 Cluny Hill. \u201cHe came and listened to our story and he bought into our dream home.\u201d The dinner was followed by a phone call the next day during which the buyer requested for some minor tweaks to the house that were subsequently agreed upon. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have sold if not for this very genuine buyer that appeared before us,\u201d according to Soh. \u201cWe had no opening price and he just made an offer.\u201d To show his sincerity in purchasing the property, the buyer even paid a 30% down payment of $19.1 million upfront.   Story continues   Soh: We wouldn\u2019t have sold if not for this very genuine buyer that appeared before us (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Good Class Bungalow: Maiden project under Meir HomesBeyond a family home, 2 Cluny Hill was also Soh\u2019s first project under his firm, Meir Homes. Soh is its founder and managing director. Founded in 2018, Meir Homes is positioned as a development advisory firm that caters to bungalow homeowners. \u201cWe want to offer them a whole suite of services according to their lifestyle, without them having to go through the hassle of dealing with the authorities, architects, project consultants and contractors,\u201d says Soh.He had been scouting around for his first project in 2018 when his family purchased the GCB at 2 Cluny Hill in September that year. Their intention was to redevelop the property as their future home.Soh\u2019s father had purchased the site given its location in the Cluny area and proximity to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which he said \u201crarely came on the market\u201d. A property developer turned shophouse investor, Soh\u2019s father, David Soh, had developed the existing family home, a three-storey detached house at Wiltshire Road, off Lucky Heights. He wanted a bigger home for the entire family: he and his wife, along with their six children, with Soh being the eldest.  The main entrance to the new GCB, which sits on a freehold land area of 14,844 sq ft with a built-up area of around 15,000 sq ft (Picture: Wallflower Architecture + Design)\u2018The House of Botanics\u2019The GCB at Cluny Hill sits on a freehold land area of 14,844 sq ft with a built-up area of around 15,000 sq ft. The GCB was going to be their new family home. \u201cThe property was named \u2018The House of Botanics\u2019 out of respect for the environment and the fact that we are very fortunate to be located right opposite a Unesco heritage site,\u201d says Soh.The concept and design of the house were inspired by the Singapore Botanic Gardens, relates Robin Tan, principal architect of Wallflower Architecture + Design, the design architect for 2 Cluny Hill. Iconic structures within the Singapore Botanic Gardens that inspired Tan and influenced the design of the project were the Bandstand, an octagonal shaped gazebo built in 1930 where regimental bands used to perform and the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage, where concerts are performed.  Design inspiration came from iconic structures at Singapore Botanic Gardens such as the Bandstand, an octagonal gazebo built in 1930 (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)In a way, the design of the property was also determined by the shape of the site, which is also elongated, notes Tan. That explains the shape of the house, which looks like a yacht from the side, he adds. Besides Wallflower Architecture, Soh also engaged Salad Dressing as the landscape architect for the project.A lot of the materials used for the house, from stone selection, furniture and fittings, were imported, adds Tan. Doors, kitchen cabinets and wardrobes are from Italian company Cubo. Bathroom fittings are from the Italian brand Gessi, while kitchen appliances are top-end German brand, Gaggenau.Soh estimates the total cost of construction and fitting out the GCB at Cluny Hill amounted to \u201cabout $15 million\u201d. He attributes this to the fact that 80% of the materials, finishes and fittings were made in Italy, he says.  Tan: The design of the property was also determined by the shape of the site, which is also elongated and influenced by its location near the Singapore Botanic Gardens (Photo: Wallflower Architecture + Design)\u2018Time is more important than money\u2019Costs have soared over time. Tan had co-founded Wallflower Architecture in 1999 together with Cecil Chee. \u201cBack in 2000, my first GCB client paid $450 psf for her GCB site,\u201d recalls Wallflower Architecture\u2019s Tan. \u201cIt was after the Asian Financial Crisis: She paid about $5 million for the land and $2 million to build the new GCB, and that was $7 million in total. Today, you\u2019re talking about close to $4,500 psf.\u201dThat was another reason why the buyer was willing to pay a premium for the GCB at Cluny Hill, adds SRI\u2019s Lye. \u201cHe knew it would cost a lot more and take at least another four years to complete the GCB if he were to buy an old GCB and redevelop it, especially in the current uncertainty with Covid-19,\u201d he adds.Construction of the GCB at Cluny Hill is now at the roof level, and the property was originally scheduled for completion by the end of 2021. But due to delays in construction due to Covid, it is likely to be completed sometime in 3Q2022.  Lye: For buyers today, time is more important than money. If they were to build a new GCB from scratch, it will take at least four years. And they don\u2019t want to wait (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Buyers are now more willing to buy GCBs that are still under construction and pay a premium, notes Lye. \u201cFor them, time is more important than money,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they were to build a new GCB from scratch, it would take at least four years. And they don\u2019t want to wait.\u201dSellers, on the other hand, are reluctant to sell their GCBs unless they can achieve a record price for the property in their neighbourhood, adds Lye. Anecdotally, the asking price of some of the older properties in the prime GCB locations is in the range of $4,000 to $4,500 psf, while brand new ones have reached $6,000 psf, according to Lye.Bragging rights \u201cThere\u2019s also the scarcity factor: It\u2019s very rare to find a GCB in the Cluny area, so close to the Singapore Botanic Gardens,\u201d notes Lye. What\u2019s more, the Cluny Hill area is quieter, relative to Cluny Park and Cluny Road, he adds.  The Good Class Bungalow at Cluny Park, which was featured in 2018 film The Crazy Rich Asians is located near 2 Cluny Hill For further bragging rights, the GCB at 2 Cluny Hill is back-to-back with the GCB at Cluny Park that cameo-ed as \"the Goh Mansion\" in the 2018 movie, Crazy Rich Asians. When they first purchased the house, it was a source of amusement for the Sohs to see the tour buses drive past their home en route to \"the Goh Mansion\". The owner of the GCB at Cluny Park has since repainted the fa\u00e7ade blue, but the gold fountain is still visible when the gates are opened.\u201cThe GCB scene has certainly changed in the last two years,\u201d says Wallflower\u2019s Tan. \u201cGiven what\u2019s happening around the world \u2014 the Covid pandemic, political and economic unrest, the ultra-rich are coming to Singapore, and the Cluny and Nassim areas have become \u2018internationalised\u2019.\u201dMeanwhile, the Sohs are hunting for a new family home. In light of the pandemic and the desire for more outdoor space, they would now need to find a bigger GCB. \u201cWe now need more outdoor space because of Covid,\u201d he says.Check out the latest listings near Cluny Hill, Peirce Road, Singapore Botanic GardensSee Also:Singapore Property for Sale & Rent, Latest Property News, Advanced Analytics Tools New Launch Condo & Landed Property in Singapore (COMPLETE list & updates) Bungalow deals turbo-charged by new generation of business titans Revisiting Pollen & Bleu at Farrer Drive: Duplex penthouse for $5.3 mil GCB at Coronation Road West going for $37 mil amid surging prices En Bloc Calculator, Find Out If Your Condo Will Be The Next en-bloc HDB Resale Flats Up For Sale, Affordable Units Available   Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

(See: First mortgagee sale of bungalow on Treasure Island priced from $12.9 mil)  Cheng went down to view the property: It was a bungalow sitting on a 99-year leasehold site of 8,379 sq ft, with a built-up area of 9,362 sq ft. The 21\u20442-storey detached house comes with five en suite bedrooms, a basement and a 27m frontage with a driveway for seven cars. The house has a 22m frontage along the waterway and comes with a private jetty. Sevens Group has been shopping for a bungalow at Sentosa Cove since early last year, says Cheng. Prices of bungalows at Sentosa Cove had peaked at $3,214 psf in October 2012, when a sea-facing property sitting on a land area of 10,111 sq ft along Ocean Drive, changed hands for $32.5 million. \u201cWe feel that prices at Sentosa Cove are at rock-bottom today and definitely worth a closer look,\u201d he adds. If Sevens Group wants to redevelop or undertake extensive additions and alterations to a bungalow at Sentosa Cove, including changing the fac\u0327ade, Cheng\u2019s options are limited to the bungalows developed by individual owners on individual plots sold by Sentosa Development Corp. These can be found along Ocean Drive, Cove Way and Lakeshore View on the North Cove; as well as those on the South Cove such as Cove Drive, Cove Way and Cove Grove.  Among the five islands at Sentosa Cove, four were purchased by property developers: Coral Island with 21 villas and the 29-villa Paradise Island were developed by Ho Bee Land; Sandy Island, with 18 villas, was developed by YTL Land; and Pearl Island, with 19 villas by Chinese developer Ximeng Land. The fac\u0327ade of the bungalows has to be retained in order to conform with the other bungalows on the same island, says Cheng. That means he cannot redevelop the property or undertake fac\u0327ade changes to the properties on these islands. This leaves just one island, namely Treasure Island, which was purchased by a group of tycoons back in 2007, and has been developed into 19 villas. Although the 19 villas have a similar fac\u0327ade as they were designed by CPG Corp and completed in 2009, the individual bungalows can be redeveloped and the fac\u0327ade can be changed, according to Cheng. He had considered several other bungalow plots including one at Cove Drive, with a view of Tanjong Golf Course. The deal fell through, how ever, due to a mismatch in price ex- pectations between buyer and seller.   Story continues   The bungalow on Treasure Island has a 22m frontage with a private berth along the waterway (Photo: PropNex)8 Treasure Island: Designing a \u2018trophy home\u2019The bungalow at 8 Treasure Island was attractive in Cheng\u2019s eyes as it was a mortgagee sale, and marked the first mortgagee sale on the island. There have been several other mortgagee sales elsewhere, such as on Coral Island, Paradise Island and Sandy Island.The bank\u2019s guide price for the property on Treasure Island was $12.88 million ($1,537 psf). Seeing that it was a distressed sale, Cheng initially offered $11 million, which was turned down by the bank. As the property was hotly contested, all the agents who were marketing the property had to submit offers from interested parties by mid- April.Cheng approached Bruce Lye, managing partner of SRI, to help him broker the deal. Cheng\u2019s business partner and a director of Sevens Group submitted a bid of $12,900,128 ($1,540 psf) \u2014 which was $20,128 above the guide price \u2014 and the highest offer received. That led them to secure the property. While the option was recently exercised, the caveat has yet to be lodged.As the new owner, Cheng already has plans to invest another $2.5 million to $2.8 million in extensive addition and alteration works over the next 12 months. He plans to change the fac\u0327ade, reconfigure the interiors and turn the spacious basement into a karaoke lounge and entertainmentspace. He intends to select designer furnishings from luxury brands such as Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Armani. \u201cI want to design a stunning, trophy home,\u201d says Cheng.When the extensive refurbishments are completed, Cheng is targeting to launch it at a price \u201cabove $2,500 psf\u201d, which would translate to upwards of $21 million.

In September 2016, another seafront property along Ocean Drive fetched $28 million ($2,923 psf), based on caveats lodged.The two biggest bungalow deals in Sentosa Cove in terms of absolute prices were both transacted this year: \u201cThe Copper House\u201d, which sits on one of the biggest plots of 18,053 sq ft (an amalgamation of two adjacent plots), fetched $43,666,000 ($2,419 psf), according to a caveat lodged in February; while another bungalow along Ocean Drive, which is also the result of two adjacent sites combined, with a land area of 19,551 sq ft, went for $39,333,999 ($2,012 psf) in April.More recently, a bungalow with an auspicious address at Coral Island changed hands for $10.3 million ($1,371 psf), according to a caveat lodged on May 5. The property was built in 2007, and sits on a 99-year leasehold site of 7,511 sq ft. The previous owner paid $5.488 million ($731 psf) for the property when Coral Island was first launched in December 2005.Cheng feels it is an opportune time for Sevens Group \u201cto build our presence in Sentosa Cove\u201d and to carve a niche in the prime districts of Singapore. \u201cSome Singaporeans are concerned about the 99- year lease at Sentosa Cove,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cBut investing in property is not for those looking for a short- term gain. As a developer, we are looking at the mid- to long term, and we are focusing on the top 1% of the market.\u201dForeigners can purchase bungalows at Sentosa Cove, unlike elsewhere on the mainland. However, they will still require approval from the Land Dealings Approval Unit of Singapore Land Authority. There are only around 300 such bungalows in Sentosa Cove. \u201cIt\u2019s very limited in number,\u201d adds Cheng.

The Indian company was earlier planning to introduce the off-roader in the Australian market and had also opened expressions of interest on its Australian website. A single unit of the Thar was imported in Australia and was also spotted there. The Background  Earlier this month, Stellantis, the parent company that owns Jeep, moved court over Mahindra's intention of launching the Thar in Australia. It said the Thar's design is quite similar to the Wrangler, which is already on sale there. According to CarAdvice, in addition to Stellantis (Jeep) commencing Australian Consumer Law proceedings against Mahindra for alleged \u201cmisleading and deceptive conduct\u201d, \u201cpassing off\u201d, and \u201cinfringement of registered designs\u201d, the brand had also asked for an undertaking that Mahindra will not launch the Thar in Australia, and provide, at least, a 90 days written notice if ever there was an intention to do so. Mahindra also released a statement saying \u201cWe\u2019re seeing very strong demand for the all-new Thar 2020 in India, therefore have no immediate plans for launch of the current variant of the Thar in markets outside India. As a result, it was pointless to engage in a litigation at this stage. When we decide to launch any new variant of the Thar in Australia, we will provide 90 days\u2019 notice to FCA and take all steps to protect our rights to market and sell the product. This has no bearing on our future plans in Australia as we continue to pursue expansion of our business across a number of vehicle categories.\u201d  Mahindra had previously applied to give a 45-day notice to Jeep of an intention to certify and import the Mahindra Thar into Australia, however it has agreed now to provide a 90-day notice. Stellantis, the parent company of the Jeep brand also issued a statement. \u201cFCA is pleased that Mahindra has conceded and undertaken that they will not import, market or sell the current Thar vehicle in Australia, and will provide prior notice to FCA before bringing any future model or variant of the Thar into Australia. This outcome illustrates our commitment to protect the iconic trade dress and trademarks of the Jeep brand here and overseas, and continue to engage the passion our customers and loyal Jeep community in Australia have for these iconic vehicles.\u201d Going forward  While the design of the Thar is not quite simply a straightforward copycat case, Mahindra and Jeep have a shared design heritage, with Mahindra having made licensed versions of the CJ Jeep in the past in Indiaand even carrying the \u2018Jeep\u2019 moniker on its vehicles. However, this shared heritage is only relevant in India, and to international customers, the design would not have any resonance and consumers there would likely see this as a Jeep design.   Story continues Thus, in addition to focusing on the strong Indian demand, rather than tangle itself in legal battles over a matter that may not cut ice with local consumers, Mahindra haselected to not sell the current Thar in Australia. This development will certainly put a dent in Mahindra\u2019s overall export plans for the Thar, as it\u2019s likely to face a similar situation in other markets. Thus, expect the company to develop a differentiated design, as it has done so in the case of the Roxor off-roader.With a unique design, Mahindra would be free to sell the SUV in other markets and this would also strengthen and develop Mahindra\u2019s own brand identity, something that will serve it well as it expands operations globally.

Abloh\u2019s line opened to a lot of praise among the fashion critics. However when LV released the bag online, social media was abuzz with criticism about its exorbitant price. The bag in the shape of a plane is symbolic of LV\u2019s association with travel. Louis Vuitton is known for manufacturing trunks and cases; several maharajas have owned LV bags over the years and to this day LV baggage is considered to be a status symbol.  LV\u2019s plane-shaped bag is made in the company\u2019s signature monogram canvas. It also features engines, cockpit and wings and has a shoulder strap. In some ways it\u2019s significant that the collection dropped at a time when flying is severely restricted and the bag serves as a commentary on this unusual situation that the world has found itself in.  To be fair the bag has received a lot of praise from the fashion community, although a bag this experimental is more in the Hermes territory than it is in LV. The Parisian luxury goods conglomerate that began making saddles for exclusive clients has since moved on to making exclusive and whimsical items for the rich and famous through Hermes Horizons, the super secretive branch of Hermes. Even so, the design has sparked a lot of debate on social media about whether it\u2019s worth it to begin with. The LV monogram canvas remains one of the most copied pieces in the fashion business just like the trademark Burberry checks, and doesn\u2019t always spell cool, especially in experimental pieces such as this. The monogram has always been associated with quiet sophistication and not hip experimentation, which is what this bag essentially is.  The LV plane bag retails for $39,000, which is almost Rs 30 lakh in today\u2019s conversion rate. And while, without doubt, there is clearly a market for bags this expensive (hello, Birkin), as several internet users pointed out, it\u2019s possible to buy a real plane for less. Of course, a brand new plane doesn\u2019t come at this price but, as someone pointed out online, you can indeed buy a used Cessna single-engine aircraft for lesser!     So, for argument\u2019s sake, if you did have Rs 30 lakh or thereabouts, would you rather invest in a bag, a plane, or, ahem Bitcoin (which is worth Rs 25 lakh right about now)   Story continues Don't miss: 6 smart gadgets for your home (that won\u2019t blow a hole in your pocket)Peek into Virat Kohli's garage: Skipper Kohli's car collectionIf you had invested Rs 25,000 in Bitcoin in 2015 this is how rich you would beHere's how much money Bill Gates makes per minuteInside the glamorous life of Bill Gates' daughter  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

Ltd., an expert network company, when the industry was still in its infancy in South-east Asia. The gamble has paid off \u2014 the business which acts as a matchmaker between investors and industry experts \u2014 has confirmed a new US$1 million cash injection from several tech executives, and is also on track to achieve US$1 million in revenue by 2022.  Before 2019, Lee was oblivious to the existence of the expert advisory service. The 29-year-old recalled that he \u201cfound it rather incredulous\u201d when a friend told him at a Hong Kong tech conference that her former employer had spent millions on expert networks services. What the former Grab Holdings Inc. and Huobi Group employee did know was that he wanted to start something in the talent recruitment space which could leverage technology. In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Singapore, Benjamin explained why he started Sealed Network. \u201cI saw how the future of work is being transformed by recent advancements in disruptive technologies like AI,\" Lee said. \"As a result, there is a growing interest in diversifying income streams, discussions about remote work, and even \u2018job-sharing\u2019 in the workplace.\u201d After some intense research, Lee and co-founder Wen Ge Leo, previously from Temasek-backed venture capital firm Wavemaker Partners, decided to start the company. Leo is now the head of operations at Sealed Network.  The company is growing fast, with a double-digit growth year-on-year, and also has over 20,000 experts on hand to answer investor queries. Clients pay Sealed Network a percentage of the engagement fee. A typical engagement session lasts from 30 minutes to one hour. Experts at Sealed Network can earn up to US$1,300 an hour, sometimes more, according to Lee. They come primarily from Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. \u201cThis is a reflection of their relative importance in the growth of the regional economy,\u201d said Lee, adding that an increasing number of customers ask for fintech, e-commerce or last-mile logistics expert advice in Indonesia and Vietnam. American and European companies with headquarters or a regional office in Singapore are the heaviest users of the platform, followed by large local and regional companies based in SE Asia, and rounded off by companies based in Europe, China and the US. For the near term, Sealed Network is focused on expanding coverage of Indonesia and Vietnam. The decision \u201ctracks broader trends in the flows of capital into the region\u201d, Lee said.   Story continues He said that Sealed Network is currently on a steady momentum, and hopes to continue its stride. Evolving its proprietary online platform launched earlier this year is on the cards.\u201cIn the near term, we aim to train the platform\u2019s recommendation engine to provide more relevant suggested experts when clients submit requests,\" Lee said. He estimates that hiring the right tech talent needed is likely \"a six-figure investment over the next two years\".Lee, who is single and devotes a fair bit of his time to community work related to entrepreneurship and business, shares some of his entrepreneurial experience.Why is what Sealed Network offering essential?It is impossible for everyone to know everything, and researching an unfamiliar industry can take a long time. Investors or strategy consultants use expert networks to speak directly with subject matter experts who can very quickly get them up to speed about an industry of interest. Expert networks greatly accelerate the learning process.Also, investors need to validate key assumptions in their investment theses. These key assumptions often involve granular-level insights into things like operational challenges, workflow processes or even personal opinions from key decision makers.What were the challenges in getting started, and how did you overcome them?Recruiting early team members was tough due to the lack of awareness among job seekers about the expert network industry in this part of the world. We managed to find the right hires from meeting with a lot of people and by getting a pool of credible and strategic investors and advisors to support us.Similarly, many experts we were onboarding onto the platform were also initially unfamiliar with the expert network industry. By taking the time to patiently educate the market, more experts began to understand our business.Who or what inspires you?I look up to Grab in the South-east Asian start-up space. When I worked there, I found that they possessed a culture of excellence and respect. My time at Grab showed me the power of bringing together people driven to make a dent in the universe, all highly competent and respectful. With a culture and a team like that, there is little that cannot be achieved.Advice for aspiring entrepreneurs?I love this particular quote by Reid Hoffman, describing an entrepreneur as \u201csomeone who will jump off a cliff and assemble an airplane on the way down\u201d. Don\u2019t expect everything to be perfect from the start, because you will have to keep iterating along the journey and finding solutions as you go. Having this perspective in mind helps to keep you from feeling daunted by the moments of uncertainty that will punctuate your journey as a start-up founder.Related stories:Ox Street CEO\u2019s focus on customer service spurs regional expansionOhmyhome chips away at the traditional housing transaction processTribecar banks on convenience and low cost to attract users to car-sharing  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy dashboard     Recommended stories     China stimulus hopes help stock markets rise Global stock markets started the week on the front foot on Monday as investors welcomed China's plans to kickstart consumption in the world's number two economy, with upcoming central bank rate decisions also in focus.The plan looks to boost income with property reforms, stabilizing the stock market and encouraging lenders to provide more consumption loans with reasonable limits, terms and interest rates.

It seems that the GPUs on which these new products are based are going to be widely referred to as LHR (Lite Hash Rate) GPUs.\nYesterday Twitter hardware watcher momomo-us spotted that Gigabyte / Aorus had updated its GeForce RTX 3060 product pages with five Rev 2.0 graphics cards, all of them featuring LHR GPUs. There is some hope that with the full GeForce RTX 30 series being updated to LHR more will stay on shelves to be bought by gamers, but we will see the fuller results of this strategy in the coming weeks / months.\n\nNvidia's previous attempts at limiting ETH mining hash rates with the freshly launched GeForce RTX 3060 12GB back in February famously fell apart after a dev driver allowed users to bypass the limiter. Things went bad to worse when the use of multiple RTX 3060s in 'mining rigs' was found to be simple to achieve, by simply plugging dummy HDMI dongles into the cards that weren't connected to a display.\n\nWe have no detailed information about how this new LHR implementation works. One must hope that Nvidia has learnt lessons from its failure, if high-tech companies repeat silly mistakes it is particularly disappointing.\nYou can find all the new GeForce RTX 3060 Rev 2.0 products listed here. Filter to show only RTX 3060 and you will see 10 products, with the LHR and older version cards on one page, all together. Comparing the Aorus GeForce RTX 3060 Elite 12G Rev 2.0 and Rev 1.0, for example, reveals no spec differences at all. You will find the reference to the LHR GPU only on each product's feature page, as you can see highlighted in the screenshot above.\nNow it only looks like a question of when, not if, all the GeForce RTX 30 series from all AIBs will be LHR GPU packing products as standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nHEXUS Week In Review: Radeon RX 6600 and RTX 3070 Noctua Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 10 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The best way to illustrate the power of staying the course is to demonstrate this with an example. Of course, investors need to ensure they pick a sturdy company that has a strong franchise and can withstand economic downturns. The idea is to study how much you would end up with after investing in this stock for an entire decade. And what better candidate for this exercise than Singapore\u2019s largest blue-chip bank DBS Group (SGX: D05)? We compare an investment in DBS versus leaving your money in the bank account over 10 years. The power of compounding Imagine that you had invested S$10,000 in DBS exactly 10 years ago on 18 May 2011. The share price of the bank back then was around S$14.74. S$10,000 would have garnered you around 678 shares of the lender. Fast forward to today, and DBS is now trading at around S$29.50, doubling from the level it traded at a decade ago.  The 678 shares you own would have grown to S$20,000. And let\u2019s not forget the dividends that the bank has declared along the way. If we include the full-year dividend starting from 2011 up till the recent interim dividend for the first quarter of 2021, DBS would have paid out a total of S$8.39 per share. The total dividends received would amount to S$5,688, making up more than 50% of your original investment of S$10,000. By the end of a decade, you would end up with a total of S$25,688 that translates to a 157% gain on your original investment. Not too shabby at all, you\u2019re probably thinking. A 10-year comparison The question on your mind is probably: what has been responsible for driving the growth of the bank over this period? To answer this, we take a look at the bank\u2019s revenue and profits back in 2011. For the first quarter of 2011 (1Q2011), total income came up to S$1.9 billion while net profit clocked in at S$807 million. 10 years later, DBS has grown its total income to S$3.9 billion, despite tackling challenging conditions related to the pandemic. The bank also reported a net profit of S$2 billion, a record for the lender.  For 2010, DBS paid out a total of S$0.56 in dividends. In 2020, the group paid out S$0.87 in dividends, a level that was still higher than that paid out a decade ago. Note: the Monetary Authority of Singapore called on banks to moderate their dividend payments. From this simple comparison, it\u2019s clear why DBS\u2019 share price has performed so well. A famous quote from one of the world\u2019s best investors, Warren Buffett, says it all. \u201cIf the business does well, the stock (price) eventually follows\u201d.   Story continues Positioned for further growthThe bank is not resting on its laurels, though.The group had recently concluded two acquisitions to grow its presence in Asia \u2014 the purchase of Lakshmi Vilas Bank in India and a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank, for S$463 million and S$1.1 billion, respectively.It is also partnering with both JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Temasek to establish a platform for speeding up cross-border payments and foreign exchange settlements.DBS has also set up a digital exchange that deals with cryptocurrency and is offering this to institutional and accredited investors only.Momentum has been good with S$80 million in assets under custody with 120 customers. According to CEO Piyush Gupta, the exchange has a \u201cpipeline of hundreds more (customers)\u201d.There is also the Chinese securities joint venture that the bank owns a 51% stake in.The lender is waiting for the business licence to be issued and it can then commence business to capture fund flows in China.Get Smart: Stick with long-term investingThe numbers prove that investing in a strong, resilient company can yield attractive returns over the long term.You should be more than convinced by now that long-term investing in the right stocks is an effective way to grow your wealth.And that\u2019s what we at the Smart Investor do, too.Our search for great businesses to own over years or even decades continues.You, too, can enjoy such stellar returns if you adopt the same investment philosophy.We are in the golden age of growth where there is no shortage of growth trends.

As for the highlights, the two-wheeler comes with a TFT instrument cluster as well as a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). Under the hood, it is powered by a 500cc, twin-cylinder engine. However, its arrival in India seems unlikely. Here are more details.  Design: The bike sports a V-shaped headlamp  Dahaidao 500 GS-ADV has a muscular fuel tank, split-style seats with a pillion grab rail, an upswept exhaust, raised handlebars with handguards, and a raised transparent windscreen. The bike packs a TFT instrument cluster, a V-shaped headlight, and rides on 19-inch front and 17-inch rear wire-spoked wheels. The vehicle has a fuel capacity of nearly 40 liters.  Fact: It runs on a 47hp, 500cc engine  Under the hood, the Dahaidao 500 GS-ADV draws power from a 500cc, twin-cylinder engine that generates a maximum power of 47.3hp and a peak torque of 43Nm. Notably, these power figures are similar to that of the Honda CB500X and the Benelli TRK 502.  Safety: There are disc brakes on both the ends  To make sure that the riders are safe, the Dahaidao 500 GS-ADV is equipped with disc brakes on both the front and rear wheels along with ABS and TPMS for better handling on the roads. Suspension duties on the adventure motorcycle are taken care of by telescopic forks on the front side.  Fact: Dahaidao 500 GS-ADV: Pricing and availability  In Europe, the Dahaidao 500 GS-ADV carries a price tag of \u20ac3,500 (roughly Rs. 3.09 lakh). However, this adventure bike will not make its way to our shores as the brand has no presence here.

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

India's central bank, the government's debt manager, met market participants over last week to seek views on the borrowing plan.  \"The widespread suggestion from dealers and banks was to cut down supply of ultra-long bonds to 34%-35% of the total borrowing, due to weak demand for such papers towards the end of this year's auction cycle,\" one of the traders with direct knowledge of the matter, said.

The Gigabyte G5 and G7 series gaming laptops have benefitted from both new Nvidia and Intel parts. Meanwhile, the Aorus 15 and 17 gaming laptops in its portfolio have embraced the higher power new Intel mobile processors, but ignored the RTX 3050/Ti as they are premium designs which bottom out with the RTX 3060.\n\nThe new G5 and G7 laptops are pitched by Gigabyte as being good all-rounders which balanced performance in gaming, entertainment, and work tasks for 'Gen-Z gamers', but they look a lot like budget gaming laptops, both in styling and in specification.\n\nAbove you can see a neat table outlining the specs of these latest Gigabyte G5 (15-inch) and G7 (I17-inch) offerings. You will see the CPUs are freshly harvested from Intel's high-performance 11th Gen Core chips for laptops announced yesterday. Similarly, the graphics are taken care of by Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti, announced yesterday.\nIt would be great to test how this combo performs, but we will have to wait for laptop samples to reach the labs first. Gigabyte asserts that the \"i7-11800H has an 8-core, 16-thread and 45W TDP configuration, different from the 4-core, 8-thread H35 processor unveiled earlier this year, performing with astonishing results in multi-core benchmark for gaming\" which is somewhat reassuring. HEXUS reviewed a gaming laptop with one of the earlier H35 CPUs and it was indeed somewhat disappointing given the accompanying RTX 3070 mobile.\nIn addition to the CPU/GPU upgrades in the G5 and G7 series, Gigabyte would like to draw your attention to the new 144Hz high refresh rate IPS-level gaming displays, WindForce cooling, selection of I/O, and PCIe gen 4 storage support.\n\nGigabyte has updates its Aorus gaming laptops series with the latest Intel 11th gen Intel processors. These premium designs support DDR4 3200, Thunderbolt 4, and PCIe Gen 4.0, as well as HDMI 2.1. As it worked on the updates Gigabyte also added faster displays to the range, with the 15-incher sporting a panel with 360Hz, and the 17-inch models up to 300Hz.\n\nIn the table above you can see the Aorus gaming laptops aim high, so you won't find configurations with anything weedier than the GeForce RTX 3060 mobile. The weighty Aorus 17X, however, is exclusively an 11th Gen Intel Core i9-11980HK (2.6GHz~5.0GHz) and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 laptop GPU (16GB/165W) machine.\nAvailability and pricing\nFor pricing and availability of the refreshed Gigabyte G5 and G7, as well as Aorus 15 and 17 machines, please keep your peepers open, watching your usual tech outlets. In Taiwan, I have started to see the Gigabyte G5 go up for pre-order with the i5-11400H / RTX3050 / 144Hz / 16G / 512G SSD config at TWD$35,900, which is approx GBP\u00a3900 (available from 10th June). An Aorus 17G XD with i7-11800H / RTX3070 / 300Hz / 32G / 512G SSD is listed at the same online outlet for pre-order at TWD$76,900, or approx GBP\u00a31,950 (available from 18th May).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\n\n                    After Apple's blockbuster reveal last week, the GPUs don't live up to the hype. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n7\nUpgraded MacBook Pro laptops come with M1 Pro and Max SoCs\n\n                    14.2- and 16.2-inch laptops have more ports, a Mini LED screen (notch), Function keys. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n15\nFramework laptop modular marketplace goes live\n\n                    A handy place to pick and choose upgrades, replacement parts, and modules. \n                \n\n\n\nApple Unleashed on 18th Oct to debut new MacBook Pros, M1X\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 8, Pro X, and Go 3 revealed\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\nDell updates XPS and Alienware desktops with Alder Lake CPUs\nAsus shares its Intel Z690 motherboard guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 0 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Marco Chiappetta is a technologist who covers semiconductors and AI.Follow AuthorMay 11, 2021, 07:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA Just Launched The GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU.NVIDIA\nWith Intel\u2019s high-performance, 10nm Tiger Lake-H mobile platform looming, virtually all of the major manufacturers in the space are readying new products and adjacent technologies. NVIDIA, for example, has just announced a brand-new laptop GPU, which brings its leading-edge RTX graphics technology down into smaller form factors and power envelopes \u2013 the GeForce RTX 3050 laptop GPU.\n\n\nThere are actually two flavors of GeForce RTX 3050 laptop GPU being announced today, a standard RTX 3050 and a higher-end GeForce RTX 3050 Ti variant. As their branding suggests, these new mobile GPUs feature the same Ampere architecture as the other, higher-powered variants in the GeForce RTX 30 series, but scaled down to address additional market segments.\nNVIDIA Laptop GPU Line-Up And Specs.NVIDIA\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti land just behind the GeForce RTX 3060 laptop GPU in NVIDIA\u2019s current line-up. The higher-end GeForce RTX 3050 Ti packs a total of 2,560 CUDA cores, with 80 Tensor cores and 30 Ray Tracing cores, with a wide boost clock range of 1,057MHz to 1,740MHz. The standard GeForce RTX 3050 arrives with 2,048 CUDA cores, 64 Tensor cores, and 16 RT cores, with slightly different boost clocks in the 1,035MHz to 1,695MHz range. All of the other main features are similar between the two GPUs; they both pack 4GB of GDDR6 memory, attached to the GPU via a 128-bit interface, and they both fall within the same 35 \u2013 80-watt power envelope.\nSome Of The Newest RTX Laptops.NVIDIA\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nThe more manageable power envelope means the new GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti can be accommodated in thinner and lighter form factors, with commensurate cooling solutions. A whole range of gaming and content creation laptops with slim form factors are inbound from a number of NVIDIA\u2019s partners, including Razer, Alienware/Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS and MSI to name a few.\n\n\nI mention content creation notebooks because the GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti will be leveraged in an array of NVIDIA Studio laptops as well. NVIDIA\u2019s Studio drivers are tuned for additional performance and stability in many of today\u2019s popular content creation applications, like Davinci Resolve and Adobe Photoshop and Premiere. And since the GeForce RTX 3050 features NVIDIA\u2019s latest architecture and cores, in addition to the same 5th Gen encoder and 7th Gen decoder engines, it is well suited to mobile creators. All of NVIDIA\u2019s latest tools, like NVIDIA Broadcast and supported too.\n\n The GeForce RTX 3050 With RTX/DLSS Outperforms The GTX 1650 Ti.NVIDIA\nOf course, GeForce is all about gaming and the GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti raise the bar for thin and light notebooks as well. NVIDIA is claiming huge performance gains over the GeForce RTX 1650, in addition to full support for its RTX Ray Tracing and Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technologies. For 1080P-class gaming the GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti should perform well in many titles.\nUltimately, what the GeForce RTX 3050 does is push NVIDIA\u2019s leading GPU architecture, and all of the software and technologies that come with it, into thinner and lighter notebooks, that address both the gaming and content creation segments. Expect machines featuring the GeForce RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti to be available soon.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Soon-to-be billionaire\u2019s surprising confession      Anastasia Santoreneos     3 May 2021 3 min read            Alexis Ohanian: Soon-to-be billionaire\u2019s surprising confession. Source: Getty  \u00b7 Issei Kato / reuters Alexis Ohanian may have co-founded a well-known multibillion-dollar company, but you\u2019d probably recognise him for something else: being tennis champion Serena Williams\u2019 husband. And, he wants you to know he\u2019s fine with that. Responding to a tweet last week, Ohanian said: \u2018I\u2019ll be a self-made billionaire one day and most people will still know me as Serena\u2019s husband (or Olympia\u2019s dad) and that\u2019s fine by me\u2019.  But in actual fact, Ohanian co-founded one extremely popular online forum: Reddit. As of February 2021, Reddit is worth a whopping US$6 billion (AU$7.78 billion), thanks to a surge in popularity from the WallStreetBets and GameStop commotion earlier this year. Also read: 5 TikTok stars set to become billionaires  The company boasts more than 50 million daily active users, and saw a 90 per cent surge in advertising revenue year-on-year, according to Reuters. But Ohanian is no longer in the driver\u2019s seat. In fact, he and his co-founders sold Reddit nearly 15 years ago for a slither of its valuation: US$10 million. On November 2 last year, Ohanian tweeted: \u201cHalloween is always a surreal holiday for me, because on Halloween 2006, we sold Reddit to Conde Nast. The deal was months in the making and I wish I\u2019d had more advisors around the table giving me more perspective on the sale.\u201d How did Alexis Ohanian start Reddit? Ohanian, who\u2019s been called \u2018The Mayor of the Internet\u2019, met his co-founder, Steve Huffman at university, where they bonded over video games. But in his junior year of college, he walked out of his LSAT practice test and went to Waffle House. \u201cThat\u2019s where I had what I call The Waffle House Epiphany,\u201d he told Inc. in 2012. It was there Ohanian said he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer, but wanted to \u201cmake a dent in the universe\u201d instead. When the co-founders realised entrepreneur and computer scientist Paul Graham was making an appearance locally, they sought to get in touch and pitch a mobile food-ordering business to him. While Graham rejected their idea, he liked the co-founders, tasked them with building \u201cthe front page of the internet\u201d. Reddit was built three weeks later. Why did Alexis Ohanian sell Reddit? Ohanian met a reporter from Conde Nast, the parent company of Vogue, at a Halloween Party. \u201cFounders are supposed to be not at all interested in selling,\u2019 Ohanian told Inc. \u201cBut there is a price at which a founder can't help being interested.\u201d In a thread on Twitter in 2020, Ohanian said he thought he\u2019d made the right choice. \u201cI thought I was getting away with something because for 16 [months] worth of work, I was getting more money than my parents had made their entire working lives,\u201d he said.   Story continues Ohanian\u2019s mother had also been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer a few months into founding Reddit, and tweeted that \u201cthe idea of rewarding her life-long unflagging confidence in me with a $10 million exit was tremendously appealing\u201d.What does Alexis Ohanian do now?Ohanian remained at the company for three years, and in 2014, when the then-CEO Yishan Wong resigned, he returned as executive chairman. His co-founder, Huffman, came back as CEO in 2015.He\u2019s since resigned from the board of directors, and these days runs his own early-stage venture capital firm, Initialized Capital.Ohanian said he hopes to guide \u201cthe next Alexis Ohanian, 22 and wide-eyed\u201d to make better decisions.Also read: Richest and poorest states in India by GDPBuying your first home?

The bank had planned to raise as much as 150 billion rupees (about $1.7 billion) through sale of bonds before the end of March, but will now tap the market in the next financial year that starts in April, the sources said.  \"The bank has been waiting for an opportune time to enter the market, but yields have stayed high for the last several weeks, and hence the bank is avoiding tapping the market in the near term,\" one of the sources said.

Twitter based hardware leakster momomo_us spotted that MSI had implemented a 'GeForce RTX 3080 Ti' category in the Nvidia GPU chooser selection menu, which lets you fine tune the product listings. The 'error' has since been corrected and premature references to the RTX 3080 Ti scrubbed away.\n\nLast week MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X graphics cards were spotted for sale in a bricks and mortar store in the UAE. Check out the image above, which I've cropped from the original shared on Reddit.\nRumoured RTX 3080 Ti specifications are for the graphics card to feature 10,240 CUDA cores, 320 Tensor cores and 80 RT cores. The base clock should be 1.35GHz+ which should boost to 1.65GHz+.\nPalit EEC listings\nOn Tuesday Nvidia launched the GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti for laptops. It now seems to be much easier to grab a laptop with an RTX 30 GPU than purchase an add-in-card for your desktop PC. Hopefully the situation is going to change and the introduction of 4GB cards like the RTX 3050/Ti could help as they don't seem to be worth investing in to mine crypto due to the VRAM quota and of course slower MH/s. Furthermore, all new and reissued Nvidia GPUs (bar the RTX 3090) look set to include Nvidia's revamped crypto perf-nerf.\nPalit is one of the first Nvidia AIB partners to spill its RTX 3050 Ti graphics card plans online, via the EEC \u2013 an astonishing 25 in total. It has a plentiful selection of RTX 3070 Ti models listed too (20), and a quintet of RTX 3080 Ti models for those with the deepest pockets. Supporting Nvidia's dedicated mining GPU strategy the maker's filing includes nine 30HX/40HX GPUs, and twelve 50HX/90HX GPUs cards.\n\nThe EEC listing was spotted by Komachi but VideoCardz has added some context to the data splurge by reminding GPU watchers that Palit \"often uses different codes for graphics cards being sold in different regions, so each code may simply mean a different packaging or a bundle\". In other words, don't expect this many different Palit models to become available in the coming weeks.\nSpecs for the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3050 Ti seem to be rather uncertain at this time but of course they will fill gaps in the RTX 30 line-up, and you can pin a tail on the donkey in these vacant spec areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nIntel XeSS demonstrated in Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker\n\n                    And devs can now access the XeSS DevMesh program to test it in their games. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSapphire Radeon RX 6600 Pulse\n\n                    A no-nonsense card that works well. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nAMD lines up Accelerated Data Centre Premiere for 8th Nov\n\n                    Epyc processors and Instinct accelerators will be the hardware stars of the show. \n                \n\n\n\nGaming performance of Apple M1 Pro, M1 Max investigated\nNvidia CMP 170HX cryptomining flagship listed at US$4,500\n'World\u2019s Smallest Gaming Arcade' opens in iconic British phonebox\nNvidia intros GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership streams\nAcer announces Predator Orion 7000 (Alder Lake) gaming desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEXUS Forums :: 10 Comments\n\n\n\nLogin with Forum Account\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Don't have an account?

The toys keep coming \u2013 NVIDIA Machinima just hit public beta.\nI\u2019m interested. Go on. (Images courtesy NVIDIA.)\nOkay, so NVIDIA have been busy, which means there is a repeating cadence to their news. It\u2019ll involve Omniverse somehow (their platform for collaboration), they\u2019ll want you to buy one of their fancy new GPUs (think GeForce RTX 3060+ or Quadro RTX 4000+), and then\u2026 well some kind of \u201cAI\u201d machine learning is usually a safe bet, too, in combination with the graphics eye candy features.\nBut this Mad Libs game is fun. This time, what you get is Omniverse Machinima, a dedicated Omniverse app for making your own narrative (read: recorded, linear) animations using game engine tools. \n\n\n\n\u201cMachinima\u201d is a word I haven\u2019t heard in a long time. It\u2019s been long enough that I could \u2013 gasp, tell some kids to \u201cask your parents.\u201d There was the genius of This Spartan Life [2005], a talk show hosted in Halo on Xbox. The technique even saw some action on South Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes sense that a new generation of tools will spawn a new generation of machinima. Unreal, Unity, Blender, Notch, and whatnot don\u2019t really quite count \u2013 part of the \u201cpunk\u201d appeal of machinima is somehow working with hacked-together elements of games.  \nBut rapid visualization with today\u2019s bleeding-edge, photorealistic engines is just an obvious new world to explore. The Omniverse angle is that you\u2019ve got a platform set up for collaboration \u2013 meaning you don\u2019t have to do this alone. \nThere are some other interesting ingredients here \u2013 and this is free?! (at least for the moment):\n\nPhotorealistic rendering (with NVIDIA\u2019s MDL material library)Animated faces (hey, I\u2019m going to try that on a music video once I can get a GPU, won\u2019t you?) \u2013 NVIDIA Audio2Face \u2013 can you believeVisual effects and physics (which of course uses\u00a0PhysX 5,\u00a0Blast,\u00a0and\u00a0Flow\u00a0)The ability to capture motion from a phone \u2013 wrnch CaptureStreamPose estimation that actually works (now using AI, instead of the ever-so-glitchy stuff in tools like the early Kinect or \u2013 eep \u2013 the horrible stuff we used to do with webcams) \u2013 see wrnch AI Pose EstimatorSequencer for sticking stuff together \u2013 with real-time rendering, so you don\u2019t have to render and use (eww) Premiere or Final Cut or something, but you can piece together a storyReshade for different rendering styles (so you can make this cartoon-y if you want, even)Camera Animation Tool for camera movementsAnimation Recorder\nThis is either going to be a total mess of way too many parts wishing to be a real tool, or utter genius, it seems. \nThese tutorials look tasty, indeed:\nOmniverse Machinima \u2013 Audio2Face in Machinima\nOmniverse Machinima \u2013 Wrnch & Recording\nBut the specific tool aside, I\u2019d also look at the big picture here \u2013 which is definitely about more than just NVIDIA and/or Omniverse, even if they\u2019re a great case study in these trends:\nAI assistance for animating from sound and motion capture (making this almost as much like puppetry as filmmaking)Real-time photorealistic renderingNetworked toolchain with collaboration options\nIt\u2019s likely NVIDIA aren\u2019t the only ones looking at that. I\u2019ll be curious if someone does something related on Apple Silicon, though it doesn\u2019t have the same horsepower yet. (Notably the person evangelizing this for NV used to do something similar for developers at Arm.)\nBut this is all a new realm, because if you think about what we had before, it\u2019s more like:\nManual animationRenderingRendering to your collaborators who render again so you have to manually re-adjust th\u2026 \nGah. Game engines offered some real-time tools around that, but often the only \u201ccollaboration\u201d involved hopping into a game together \u2013 fun and still relevant here, but a far cry from creative teams being inside the backend animating together.

Any open roles are now on hold. In addition, Arm canceled an annual \"wellbeing\" allowance, a move those who spoke to The Register said is effectively a pay cut, and a significant one at that for graduates and other lower-paid staffers.\nThe hiring freeze, which came into force this month, affects Arm's chip design wing \u2013 its IP Products Group, or IPG \u2013 though The Register understands hiring in other departments, such as sales, marketing, finance, HR, and operations, has slowed to a trickle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPG president Rene Haas must personally authorize any backfill requests. The default answer will be no. Contractors cannot be taken on either, and fixed-term contract work is frozen, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff were told that Softbank-owned Arm was ahead of its hiring plans \u2013 it increased its headcount by eight per cent in the past year \u2013 and now needed to ensure it is \"within the cost targets for the business.\" In the background to this, Nvidia is trying to acquire UK-headquartered Arm for $40bn, a takeover the British government is scrutinizing to see if there is a clash with its national security interests.\nIn an FAQ shared with staff regarding the freeze, and seen by The Register, Arm bosses stated:\n\nThe primary reason for this is that due to the accelerated hiring in the past six months, we are well ahead of our planned headcount. The market response has been fantastic, the selection process rigorous, and we have hired some exceptional people into Arm from across the globe.\nWe are pleased to welcome these new hires from early careers through to experienced business leaders. However, we now need to take this action to ensure we are within the cost targets for the business.\n\n\"We expect this will last until the Nvidia deal closes, which we currently anticipate will be in April 2022,\" the document continued. Staff were also told that Arm's future hiring plans will be formed in discussion with Nvidia and that \"closer to [the acquisition's] close, we will update you then.\"\nThe majority of graduate positions and internships have been filled, and any open roles have been closed. Arm had \"already pulled back on a small number of UK graduate roles after a review,\" the FAQ stated.\n\nWellbeing allowance scrapped\n\nArm has also canceled its FlexPot scheme: this was an annual allowance granted to employees and fixed-term contract workers, the size of which was determined by location. In the UK, the allowance would be \u00a34,500 per person, and in the US $8,500. The Register understands this perk was introduced after Arm went private in 2016, when it was acquired by Softbank, and replaced a scheme that distributed shares to employees.\nStaff were told FlexPot could be used to fund, per internal documents, \"activities that support you and your family\u2019s health or financial wellbeing,\" and \"any activities that allow you to learn something new.\" In reality, this could be used to expense anything management would approve \u2013 investments in share funds, summer camps for children, home insurance and rental deposits, personal trainers, scuba diving, school tuition fees, dance lessons, art classes... the list is quite long and fairly open ended.\n\nArm at 30: From Cambridge to the world, one plucky British startup changed everything\nArm pulls the sheets off its latest Armv9 architecture with added AI support, Realms software isolation\nSoftBank: We paid $32bn for you, when are you going to strong-Arm some more money out of your customers?\nFour years after swallowing Arm Holdings, SoftBank said to be mulling Brit chip biz sale\n\nAlthough FlexPot was not guaranteed every year, staff came to rely on it, and it was due to continue running in 2021 until it was canceled this month. No reason was given, a source told us. For graduates and lower-paid staff, the allowance amounted to 10 per cent or more of their take-home compensation, even taking into account a bonus people were paid this past quarter as Arm has been performing well financially, they added.\nStaff were told in a quarterly business update that the company had exceeded its goals. However, FlexPot will be no more. It may return in one form or another depending on how the Nvidia acquisition goes, The Reg understands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is happening at a time when nobody knows what will happen to staff after the Nvidia deal goes through, assuming it does,\" one person close to the matter told us.\nPhil Hughes, Arm's vice president for external communications, told The Register:\n\nThis year is about executing on our strategy and preparing for a new chapter which will bring significant additional rewards for our people. Arm, like all companies, adjusts its benefits periodically as necessary, but we always ensure our people understand why we are making changes as keeping them well-informed, motivated and rewarded is vital as they are the core of our success.\n\nWe note that Arm recorded $1.98bn in revenue in the 12 months to March 31, up 9.5 per cent year-on-year, and a loss of $312m that Softbank said in a financial report [PDF] was mainly due to charges linked to Nvidia's proposed acquisition and share-based remuneration for Arm staff. Softbank also said Arm's bottom line was affected by the extra hands it had taken on.\nSeparately, El Reg has heard that Arm, which employs about 6,200 people globally, increased the healthcare benefits of its staff and their families in India, and granted workers with families in the COVID-19-ravaged nation extended leave to be with their relatives during the pandemic.\nOn Friday, Nvidia announced a four-for-one stock split, and closed Monday with its share price up four per cent to $624.48 apiece. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                AWS Graviton\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Arm\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                AWS Graviton\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                RISC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIndia wants backdoors into clouds, email, SaaS, for tax inspectors\n\nAsia in Brief\u00a0PLUS: Malaysia teams with Arm for local chip designs; NTT warns of possible breach; Samsung strikers settle; and more\n\nSecurity9 Mar 2025 | 7\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData resilience and data portability\nWhy organizations should protect everything, everywhere, all at once\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nNetwork edge?

Recently, transformers have been successful in vision-and-language tasks (opens in new tab) such as image captioning (opens in new tab) and visual question answering (opens in new tab) due to their ability to learn multimodal contextual representations (opens in new tab). However, training multimodal transformers end-to-end is difficult because of the excessive memory requirement. In fact, most existing vision and language transformers rely on pretrained language transformers to train them successfully.Today, in collaboration with NVIDIA Research, we are excited to announce our work: \u201cParameter Efficient Multimodal Transformers for Video Representation Learning (opens in new tab).\u201d In this paper, which was accepted at the International Conference on Learning Representations (opens in new tab) (ICLR 2021),\u00a0we propose an approach to reduce the size of multimodal transformers up to 97 percent by weight sharing mechanisms.\u00a0This allows us to train our model end-to-end on video sequences of 30 seconds (480 frames sampled at 16 frames per second), which is a significant departure from most existing video inference models that process clips shorter than 10 seconds, and achieve competitive performance on a variety of video understanding tasks.\nAggressive parameter sharing within transformers\nFigure 1. Our model consists of audio and visual convolutional neural networks, audio and visual transformers, and a multimodal transformer.\nOur model consists of five components: audio and visual convolutional neural networks (CNNs), audio and visual transformers, and a multimodal transformer. The two CNNs encode audio and visual signals from one-second clips, respectively, while the three transformers encode audio, visual, and audio-visual signals from the entire input sequence (30 seconds). The whole model contains 155 million weight parameters and the three transformers consume 128 million parameters, or 82.6 percent of the total. Training on 30 seconds of video is GPU memory intensive, requiring small batch sizes and long training time.\nFigure 2. We share parameters across both transformers and layers within each transformer. This results in a 97 percent reduction of parameters.\nTo address this, we reduce the model size by sharing the weight parameters using two strategies. The first strategy shares weights across layers within each transformer, treating a transformer as an unrolled recurrent network. As shown in Figure 2(b), this reduces the parameters by 83 percent (from 128 million to 22 million). The second strategy involves partial weight sharing with low-rank factorization, where we factorize each weight matrix of the transformer into a form \\(W\\)=\\(U\\)\\(\u03a3\\)\\(V\\) and shared \\(U\\) across transformers while keeping \\(\u03a3\\)\\(V\\) private to each transformer. This strategy, depicted in Figure 2(c), helps our model capture the underlying dynamics between modalities efficiently: \\(U\\) models modality-shared dynamics, while \\(\u03a3\\) and \\(V\\) model modality-specific dynamics. The factorization and partial sharing achieve 88 percent parameter reduction. We further reduce the parameters by imposing a low-rank constraint on parameter \\(\u03a3\\), achieving a 97 percent reduction rate, from 128 million parameters to just 4 million parameters.\n\n\nSpotlight: blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphRAG auto-tuning provides rapid adaptation to new domains\nGraphRAG uses LLM-generated knowledge graphs to substantially improve complex Q&A over retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

To meet the high I/O rates required by the algorithm, we have developed in parallel WebDataset (opens in new tab), a new high performance I/O framework for PyTorch. It provides efficient access to datasets stored in POSIX tar archives and uses only sequential/streaming data access. This brings substantial performance advantages in many compute environments, and it is essential for large-scale training such as video datasets.\nContent-aware negative sampling\nWe train our model using contrastive learning objectives. In contrastive learning, finding informative negative samples is essential for the model\u2019s convergence. We develop a novel content-aware negative sampling strategy that favors negatives sufficiently, similar to the positive instance. Specifically, we calculate the normalized pairwise similarity in the CNN embedding space and treat them as sampling probabilities, so that the more similar a sample is to the positive, the higher the chance there is to be selected as negative.\nDownstream performance\nOur model achieves competitive performance across several benchmarks that involve audio and/or visual modalities from short or long clips. Table 1 shows different components of our model generalizing well across tasks, for instance visual CNN for short action recognition (UCF-101), audio-CNN for short environmental sound classification (ESC-50), and the transformers for long audio-visual video classification (charades and kinetics-sounds). Our results demonstrate the versatility of this model\u2014once pretrained, we can take different components appropriate for downstream scenarios.\nTable 1. (a) Short video classification results on UCF-101 (mean accuracy, percentage). (b) Short audio classification results on ESC-50 (mean accuracy, percentage). c) Long video classification results on charades (mAP) and kinetics-sounds (KS; top-1/5 accuracy, percentage).\nLooking forward \nLarge-parameter transformer models are producing impressive results on numerous challenging tasks, but there is a growing concern that conducting research in this direction is limited to institutions with large compute resources. In this work, we presented an approach to reduce the size of multimodal transformers by up to 97 percent and still achieve competitive results on standard video benchmarks, making them more accessible to institutions with limited compute resources. To accelerate research in this direction, we have open sourced the code and will be releasing the pretrained model checkpoints on GitHub (opens in new tab) in the coming weeks. We hope that our research will open up research opportunities in large-scale pretraining to institutions with limited compute resources\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was conducted by an amazing team of researchers from Seoul National University (Sangho Lee, Youngjae Yu, and Gunhee Kim), NVIDIA Research (Thomas Breuel and Jan Kautz) and Microsoft Research (Yale Song).\n\nOpens in a new tab \n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Efficient Multimodal Transformers for Video Representation Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the authors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYale Song\nSenior Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tContinue reading\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\n\nMagma: A foundation model for multimodal AI agents across digital and physical worlds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\n\nFrontiers of multimodal learning: A responsible AI approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 29, 2023\n\n\nBreaking cross-modal boundaries in multimodal AI: Introducing CoDi, composable diffusion for any-to-any generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 4, 2023\n\n\nUsing generative AI to imitate human behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSee all blog posts\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tResearch Areas\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtificial intelligence\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComputer vision\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tResearch Groups\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComputer Vision Group\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelated tools\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAvbert\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelated events\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMicrosoft at ICLR 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelated labs\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMicrosoft Research Lab - Redmond\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow us:\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nFollow on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our RSS feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare this page:\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nShare on X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's new\n\n\nSurface Pro\n\n\nSurface Laptop\n\n\nSurface Laptop Studio 2\n\n\nSurface Laptop Go 3\n\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\n\nAI in Windows\n\n\nExplore Microsoft products\n\n\nWindows 11 apps\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Store\n\n\nAccount profile\n\n\nDownload Center\n\n\nMicrosoft Store support\n\n\nReturns\n\n\nOrder tracking\n\n\nCertified Refurbished\n\n\nMicrosoft Store Promise\n\n\nFlexible Payments\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nMicrosoft in education\n\n\nDevices for education\n\n\nMicrosoft Teams for Education\n\n\nMicrosoft 365 Education\n\n\nHow to buy for your school\n\n\nEducator training and development\n\n\nDeals for students and parents\n\n\nAzure for students\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\nMicrosoft Cloud\n\n\nMicrosoft Security\n\n\nDynamics 365\n\n\nMicrosoft 365\n\n\nMicrosoft Power Platform\n\n\nMicrosoft Teams\n\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\n\n\nSmall Business\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper & IT\n\n\nAzure\n\n\nMicrosoft Developer\n\n\nMicrosoft Learn\n\n\nExplore ISV Success\n\n\nMicrosoft Tech Community\n\n\nAzure Marketplace\n\n\nAppSource\n\n\nVisual Studio\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout Microsoft\n\n\nCompany news\n\n\nPrivacy at Microsoft\n\n\nInvestors\n\n\nDiversity and inclusion\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices Opt-Out Icon\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices Opt-Out Icon\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\nConsumer Health Privacy\n\n\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nContact Microsoft\n\n\nPrivacy \n\n\nManage cookies\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\nTrademarks\n\n\nSafety & eco\n\n\nRecycling\n\n\nAbout our ads\n\n\u00a9 Microsoft 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Therefore, NVIDIA\u00ae has worked with the Spark community to implement GPU acceleration as part of Spark 3.x.\u00a0\nWhile Spark distributes computation across nodes in the form of partitions, within a partition, computation has historically been performed on CPU cores. However, the benefits of GPU acceleration in Spark are many. For one, fewer servers are required, reducing infrastructure cost. And, because queries are completed faster, you expect a reduction in time to results. Also, since GPU acceleration is transparent, applications built to run on Spark require no changes in order to reap the benefits of GPU acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerated ETL and AI in Spark \nAs machine learning (ML) and DL are increasingly applied to larger datasets, Spark has become a commonly used vehicle for the data pre-processing and feature engineering needed to prepare raw input data for the learning phase. The Spark community has been focused on bringing both phases of this end-to-end pipeline together, so that data scientists can work with a single Spark cluster and avoid the penalty of moving data between phases via an external data lake. Horovod (by Uber) and TensorFlowOnSpark (by Yahoo) are examples of this approach.\nSpark 3.x represents a key milestone, as Spark can now schedule GPU-accelerated ML and DL applications on Spark clusters with GPUs. The complete Spark 3 software stack that includes the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew GPU-Accelerated Libraries on NVIDIA CUDA\nAs discussed previously, NVIDIA\u00ae CUDA\u00ae is a programming model and a set of APIs for accelerating operations on the NVIDIA GPU architecture. Layered on top of CUDA, RAPIDS is a suite of open-source software libraries and APIs that provide GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through DataFrame and graph operations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAPIDS GPU-Accelerated Spark DataFrames\nRAPIDS offers a powerful GPU DataFrame based on Apache Arrow data structures. Arrow specifies a standardized, language-independent, columnar memory format, optimized for data locality, to accelerate analytical processing performance on modern CPUs or GPUs. With the GPU DataFrame, batches of column values from multiple records take advantage of modern GPU designs and accelerate reading, queries, and writing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpark GPU-Accelerated DataFrame and SQL\nFor Apache Spark 3.0, new RAPIDS APIs are used by Spark SQL and DataFrames for GPU-accelerated memory-efficient columnar data processing and query plans. With the RAPIDS accelerator, the Catalyst query optimizer plugin interface has been extended to identify operators within a query plan that can be accelerated with the RAPIDS API, mostly a one-to-one mapping, and to schedule those operators on GPUs within the Spark cluster when executing the query plan.\nWith a physical plan for CPUs, the DataFrame data is transformed into RDD row format and usually processed one row at a time. Spark supports columnar batch, but in Spark 2.x only the Vectorized Parquet and ORC readers use it. The RAPIDS plugin extends columnar batch processing on GPUs to most Spark operations. Processing columnar data is much more GPU friendly than row-by-row processing.\n\nA new Spark shuffle implementation built upon OpenUCX communication libraries leverage NVLink, RDMA and InfiniBand (if available) to dramatically reduce data transfer among Spark processes by: keeping as much data on the GPU as possible, finding the fastest path to move data between nodes, using the best of available hardware resources, including bypassing the CPU to do GPU to GPU memory intra and inter node transfers.\u00a0 RDMA allows GPUs to transfer data directly across nodes at up to PCIe speeds, operating as if on one massive server.\u00a0 NVLink allows GPUs to initiate peer to peer communication at up to 300GB/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU-Aware Scheduling in Spark\nSpark 3.x adds integration with the YARN, Kubernetes, and Standalone cluster managers to request GPUs and plugin points, which can be extended to run operations on GPUs. For Kubernetes, Spark 3.x offers GPU isolation at the executor pod level. This makes GPUs easier to request and use for Spark application developers, allows for closer integration with DL and AI frameworks like Horovod and TensorFlow on Spark, and allows for better utilization of GPUs.\u00a0\nAn example of a flow for GPU scheduling is shown in the diagram below. The user submits an application with a GPU resource configuration discovery script. Spark starts the driver, which uses the configuration to pass on to the cluster manager, to request a container with a specified amount of resources and GPUs. The cluster manager returns the container. Spark launches the container. When the executor starts, it will run the discovery script. Spark sends that information back to the driver and the driver can then use that information to schedule tasks to GPUs.\u00a0\n\nThe Spark Web UI has been modified with a new checkbox to see which resources have been allocated. In this instance, two GPUs have been allocated.\n\nSpark 3.x stage level resource scheduling allows you to choose one container size for one stage and another size for another stage. For example, one for ETL and another for ML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXGBoost, RAPIDS, and Spark\nXGBoost is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) ML library. XGBoost provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading ML library for regression, classification, and ranking problems. The RAPIDS team works closely with the Distributed Machine Learning Common (DMLC) XGBoost organization, and XGBoost now includes seamless, drop-in GPU acceleration, significantly speeding up model training and improving accuracy for better predictions.\nRAPIDS, XGBOOST, and SPARK has three features that help with speed-up and cost:\n\nGPU-accelerated DataFrame: Reads any number/size of supported input file formats directly into GPU memory and divides up evenly among the different training nodes. \nGPU-accelerated training: XGBoost training time has been improved with a dynamic in-memory representation of the training data that optimally stores features based on the sparsity of a dataset. This replaces a fixed in-memory representation based on the largest number of features amongst different training instances. \nEfficient GPU memory utilization: XGBoost requires that data fit into memory which creates a restriction on data size using either a single GPU or distributed multi-GPU multi-node training. The latest release has improved GPU memory utilization by 5X. Now users can train with data that is five times the size as compared to the first version. This improves total cost of training without impacting performance. \n\nLater in this eBook, we explore and discuss an example using the upgraded XGBoost library to load/transform data and conduct distributed training using GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Spark 3.x Features\n\nAdaptive Query execution: Spark 2.2 added cost-based optimization to the existing rule based SQL Optimizer. Spark 3.0 now has runtime adaptive query execution(AQE). With AQE, runtime statistics retrieved from completed stages of the query plan are used to re-optimize the execution plan of the remaining query stages. Databricks benchmarks yielded speed-ups ranging from 1.1x to 8x when using AQE. Spark 3.0 AQE optimization features include:\n\nDynamically coalesce shuffle partitions: AQE can combine adjacent small partitions into bigger partitions in the shuffle stage by looking at the shuffle file statistics, reducing the number of tasks for query aggregations.\n\nDynamically switch join strategies: AQE can optimize the join strategy at runtime based on the join relation size. For example, converting a sort merge join to a broadcast hash join which performs better if one side of the join is small enough to fit in memory.\n\nDynamically optimize skew joins: AQE can detect data skew in sort-merge join partition sizes using runtime statistics and split skew partitions into smaller sub-partitions.\n \n\nDynamic Partition Pruning: Partition pruning is a performance optimization that limits the number of files and partitions that Spark reads when querying. After partitioning the data, queries that match certain partition filter criteria improve performance by allowing Spark to only read a subset of the directories and files. Spark 3.0 dynamic partition pruning allows the Spark engine to dynamically infer, at runtime, the specific partitions within a table that need to be read and processed for a specific query, by identifying the partition column values that result from filtering another table in a join. For example, the following query involves two tables: the flight_sales table that contains all of the total sales for all flights, partitioned by originating airport, and the flight_airports table that contains a mapping of airports for each region. Here we are querying for sales in the North-East America region.\n\nselect fs.airport, fs.total_sales from flight_sales fs, flight_airports fa where fs.airport = fa.airport and fa.region\u00a0 = 'NEUSA'\n\nWith dynamic partition pruning, this query will scan and process only the partitions for the airports returned by the where filter on the region. Reducing the amount of data read and processed results in a significant time savings.\n\nJoin strategy hints instruct the optimizer to use the hinted plan for join strategies. MERGE, SHUFFLE_HASH and SHUFFLE_REPLICATE_NL hints were added to the existing BROADCAST hint.\nDataSource API Improvements:\n  \nPluggable catalog integration.\nImproved predicate push down for faster queries via reduced data loading.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we covered the main improvements in Spark 3.x that are proving instrumental in accelerating time to insights, especially when executed on NVIDIA GPUs. Details on new Spark 3.0 features can be found in the Spark 3.0 release notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Please fill out the form below to keep reading this E-book\n\n\nWelcome back.\n\t\t\tNot you?

See our ethics statement.Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeTom Warren is a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.Nvidia is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d or \u201cLHR\u201d identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining.\u201cThis reduced hash rate only applies to newly manufactured cards with the LHR identifier and not to cards already purchased,\u201d says Matt Wuebbling, Nvidia\u2019s head GeForce marketing. \u201cWe believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere.\u201dThese new RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 cards will start shipping later this month, and the LHR identifier will be displayed in retail product listings and on the box. Nvidia originally started hash limiting with the RTX 3060, and the company has already committed to not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold.Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 already has a mining limit in place. Photo by Tom Warren / The VergeWhile Nvidia tried to nerf mining with the RTX 3060, the company also accidentally released a beta driver that unlocked hash rates and increased performance. That\u2019s been reinstated with more recent drivers, but the beta drivers are out in the wild now.Nvidia\u2019s new LHR cards are part of a broader effort to make its latest 30-series GPUs less desirable to cryptocurrency miners. PC gamers have been trying and failing to get their hands on new graphics cards for months due to the great GPU shortage, and miners have been blamed for part of the shortages.Nvidia offers a separate Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) for Ethereum miners instead. These cards include the best performance for mining and efficiency, but they won\u2019t handle graphics at all.Nvidia\u2019s move to nerf new cards will undoubtedly drive up prices for existing 30-series GPUs that don\u2019t have these restrictions in place. It will also likely mean the rumored RTX 3080 Ti card will have similar cryptocurrency mining limits in place, as this card is expected to be announced later this month.See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsAI search is starting to kill Google\u2019s \u2018ten blue links\u2019InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: u/FaisalKhatib)\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that more pictures of Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti partner cards are showing up, further pointing towards a release in the very near future.The bad news is that one of these allegedly comes from a retailer in the United Arab Emirates, which has put an MSI Suprim X version of the RTX 3080 Ti on sale for 12,500 AED: with tax, that\u2019s about $3,500. Not too encouraging, in other words, for the prospects of an ordinary launch with plentiful stock.Find where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080Where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: Restocks trackedPlus: AMD RDNA 3 leak teases new Nvidia-killing graphics powerWhile tech YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law is Dead tweeted an image of a Gigabyte-made RTX 3080 Ti, Reddit user u/FaisalKhatib posted a shot of the MSI cards apparently stacked in the U.A.E. store.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5080 GPU third-party prices rumored to be up 35% over asking price, and I'm hoping it isn't true\n\n\n\n\nRTX 5090 GPU prices are officially out of control \u2014 now $1,400 over Nvidia's official asking price\n\n\n\nSpecs-wise, these only really confirm a detail we were already very sure of \u2014 the RTX 3080 Ti using 12GB of video memory instead of the originally rumored 20GB \u2014 though the MSI Suprim model looks practically identical to the GeForce RTX 3080 Suprim X 10G, if you were curious about the GPU\u2019s sizing.Just to confirm from my end - the RTX 3080 Ti 12GB is certainly real, and coming soon\u2122\ufe0f.I obviously blacked out the background to protect someone, but that's a real 3080 Ti someone I know has their hands on... pic.twitter.com/sn18aNbboaMay 4, 2021The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti release date has supposedly been pushed back from May to June, though the fact that these partner cards have already been sent out backs up rumors that a launch is close. It\u2019s just a shame that this development is accompanied by a clear attempt at price-gouging. We don\u2019t know how exactly how much the RTX 3080 Ti\u2019s MSRP will be, but you can bet it won\u2019t be anywhere near $3,500.Sadly this follows a pattern of behaviour from less scrupulous retailers surrounding Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 appeared for hundreds of dollars above its recommended price just prior to its release earlier this year, driven by a worldwide GPU shortage and booming interest in cryptocurrency mining that\u2019s only driving demand even higher.Although the RTX 3080 Ti will release with a hash rate limiter designed to limit its appear to miners, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the GPU has such little stock available that some retailers \u2014 and especially resellers \u2014 try their luck with similarly inflated prices. Still, this isn\u2019t the only reason to avoid engaging with sellers that break the street date for graphics hardware, as the RTX 3080 Ti\u2019s driver software hasn\u2019t been released yet either.Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.More: The best gaming laptops with GPUs already installedToday's best Gaming Monitors deals1 Amazon customer review\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $91.77View $116.99View $129.99ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nnvidia\ngraphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (0)\n\n\n\nJames ArcherSocial Links NavigationJames is currently Hardware Editor at Rock Paper Shotgun, but before that was Audio Editor at Tom\u2019s Guide, where he covered headphones, speakers, soundbars and anything else that intentionally makes noise.

Originally launched with 11 GB GDDR6 memory, the modder confirms that with mods, the card can physically support twice the memory capacity.\nModder Confirms That NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Could Support 22 GB GDDR6 Memory\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti has been replaced by the GeForce RTX 3090 and we will also be getting the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti soon. The Turing TU102 GPU graphics card launched in 2018 and featured 11 GB GDDR6 memory. Surprisingly, its real successor, the 3080 Ti, will only feature 1 GB higher memory capacity (12 GB GDDR6X) which doesn't sound like a huge upgrade while the RTX 3090 would retain the highest memory capacity of 24 GB.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\nWith that said, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti that VIK-on received was broken and damaged to such an extent that it won't even boot at all. This was because the card had already landed in the hands of others who offered repair service but made the card's condition worse than before. The modder states that traces on the PCB were cut off along with missing components but he and his soldering expertise took no time to fix the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB fixes by VIK-on\nWhile fixing the card, VIK-on also decided to see if his previous strap mods, which he had used on the RTX 3070 (modded to 16 GB GDDR6 memory) could be applied on the RTX 2080 Ti, and alas, it does work. The strap mod itself confirmed that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti could support up to 22 GB GDDR6 memory but since the modder didn't have access to 16 Gb memory modules, he couldn't test the mod physically.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti comes with 12 pin-points for GDDR6 memory on the PCB. One of the memory modules is disabled since the card rocks a 320-bit bus which could only allow up to 11 modules at once. NVIDIA used 1 GB (8 Gb) memory modules on the card which allow up to 11 GB GDDR6 memory but the card can also support 2 GB (16 Gb) DRAM dies for up to 22 GB VRAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 of 9\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 22 GB Memory Confirmation by VIK-on\nIt is amazing that even after extensive damage, VIK-on was able to recover the card back to its original state and as for the mod, it is definitely interesting & if it works on the NVIDIA GeForce 3080 Ti, then we can expect VIK-on to put 24 GB GDDR6X memory on that after launch.\nNews Source: Videocardz\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Specifications Leaked: GB206, 3840 CUDA Cores, 8GB GDDR7, And 150W Of TDP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit In 2026\n\n\n\n130\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s First Foldable Device With An 18.8-Inch Display Will Run macOS, Reserving iPadOS For The iPad Lineup And Marking A Shift In Product Strategy\n\n\n\n78\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n69\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nOverclocked Nintendo Switch Modded With 8GB RAM Can Run Kingdom Hearts III, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Other PC Games Surprisingly Well\n\n\n\n52\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Unveils Next-Gen Feynman GPU In Updated Roadmap, Arriving in 2028 With Next-Gen HBM Memory\n\n\n\n47\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nMajor US Tech Firms Now Have \u201cChinese-Descent\u201d Individuals As Their CEOs, Shows How Valuable China\u2019s Talent Is For The Tech Industry\n\n\n\n1161\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

And now, NVIDIA wants a piece of the UE5 pie. \n\n\nUnreal Engine website \n\nWCCFTech reported that Team Green is bringing support for their latency-busting Reflex tech to Unreal Engine 5. The information comes straight from an NVIDIA blog post, revealing that the company has already been in deep collaboration with Epic Games during the development of Unreal Engine 5. Nick Penwaden, Epic Games' VP of Engineering, backs this up as reported by TweakTown, saying that they have been using RTX graphics cards while developing the latest Unreal Engine. This also means that aside from Reflex, NVIDIA is also bringing DirectX-based real-time ray tracing to the engine.This is after AMD also announced that a handful of its rendering technologies will also be present in Unreal Engine 5, which they say will benefit users of Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs.DLSS (deep-learning supersampling), another NVIDIA tech, is also slated to come to UE5 at some point in the future. There's no official news about it, though.Read also :\nEpic Games Unveils New Unreal Engine 5 Along with a Demo on the Next-Gen Console, Playstation 5Unreal Engine 5 and NVIDIA Reflex: What's the Benefit?To understand why the inclusion of Reflex into UE5 is such a big deal, you need to understand what the technology is first.According to a NVIDIA developer blog post, Reflex is a technology that enables game developers to create a so-called \"low latency mode,\" which speeds up the game engine to complete its work in time for rendering it into a screen. With it, user inputs can be translated into actual movement on a screen almost instantaneously.\n\n\nA screenshot showing NVIDIA Reflex's in-game latency monitoring in action. \nNVIDIA \n\nWith Unreal Engine 5 having this tech, this means that it would be a great game engine to work with for fast-paced, competitive titles like first-person shooters. In these kinds of games, a single millisecond of input delay can spell the difference between living and dying. Combined with the insane graphical fidelity of UE5 as a whole, this means that gamers might see big-budget FPS titles with insanely detailed visuals that don't suffer from latency problems.Remember the time when UE5 was first demonstrated on a PS5? The graphical jump from last gen was insane, and that's just the beginning.A More 'Stable' Development ExperienceEpic Games plans to make sure that UE5 is going to be a \"very stable experience\" for both gamers and developers, and that's saying something. With various architecture-specific improvements from NVIDIA and AMD already baked into the engine, gamers might see fewer hardware issues like frame rate drops, stuttering, and overall instability in any next-gen game that uses Unreal Engine 5.And it's not just going to benefit console and PC players too, it seems.Back in May 2020, it was revealed that UE5 will also run on the Nintendo Switch. Now, this is a big deal, because we're talking about a handheld that's going to be able to run next-gen games.Unreal Engine 5 is currently in early access, with Epic Games planning to end that by early 2022. But either way, the future of gaming is in good hands with an engine like this.Related :\nEpic Games Buys Reality Capture Software Maker, Plans to Integrate it With Unreal Engine to Create Realistic WorldsThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by RJ Pierce  \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

This time, it's the power couple Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti Nvidia announced at Computex 2021. The 3080 Ti will be available June 3 starting at $1,199, while the 3070 Ti ships on June 10, starting at $599. Don't blink or you'll miss them.    Watch this: Nvidia's newest 3080 Ti GPU headlines Computex 2021\n        04:20  The 3080 Ti distinguishes itself from the 3080 with more of everything: more memory (12GB GDDR6X) and more cores everywhere (80 RT cores, 10,240 CUDA cores, 320 Tensor cores). In fact, while it looks like a big leap over the RTX 3080, it looks awfully close to the RTX 3090, including the same hefty 350 watt power draw. The exception is the amount of memory, as the RTX 3090 has 24GB.Read more:\u00a0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 and 3080: Check for inventory restocks at Best Buy, Newegg and moreOn the other hand, the RTX 3070 Ti is specced quite closely to the RTX 3070, with one notable difference. It has the same amount of memory, but uses GDDR6X rather than GDDR6, promising significantly better memory bandwidth.But despite Nvidia's introduction of cryptomining-optimized cards (its CMP HX) and throttling the mining performance of gaming GPUs (now retronymmed LHR for low hash rate), things still don't look especially promising. For one thing, the company said in its recent earnings call that it expects supply constraints to continue for at least another few months, if not longer. For another, the CMP cards still aren't available in the US.\u00a0Even when the CMP cards finally do become available here, and even if Nvidia can meet the demand for them as it claimed in the earnings call -- they use older production technologies, an older architecture chip and don't need GDDR6 memory, so the supply problems don't overlap with the gaming GPUs -- that doesn't mean the gaming GPU shortage will necessarily ease. Miners can use the gaming GPUs but gamers can't use the mining GPUs, and there's nothing to prevent miners from soaking up all the available supplies, both CMP and LHR, among other potential issues.And Nvidia pretty much stated during a briefing that there will be stock of its Founders Edition cards, the only cards guaranteed to have the uninflated prices, on the day of launch -- but didn't mention anything about subsequent days. Also, that you'd pretty much have to keep checking. Since supplies will remain tight for a while, prices will remain at scalper-high levels as well. That all sounds status quo to me.See also Best Gaming Laptops for 2022Best Cheap Gaming Laptop Under $1,000 to Get in 2022Best Gaming Desktops for 2022    \n    Computing Guides\n   \n      Laptops\n     \n  \n          Best Laptop\n        \n          Best Chromebook\n        \n          Best Budget Laptop\n        \n          Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best 2-in-1 Laptop\n        \n          Best Windows Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook\n        \n          Best Gaming Laptop\n        \n          Best Macbook Deals\n        \n      Desktops & Monitors\n     \n  \n          Best Desktop PC\n        \n          Best Gaming PC\n        \n          Best Monitor Under 200\n        \n          Best Desktop Deals\n        \n          Best Monitors\n        \n          M2 Mac Mini Review\n        \n      Computer Accessories\n     \n  \n          Best PC Speakers\n        \n          Best Printer\n        \n          Best External Hard Drive SSD\n        \n          Best USB C Hub Docking Station\n        \n          Best Keyboard\n        \n          Best Webcams\n        \n          Best Mouse\n        \n          Best Laptop Backpack\n        \n      Photography\n     \n  \n          Best Camera to Buy\n        \n          Best Vlogging Camera\n        \n          Best Tripod\n        \n          Best Waterproof Camera\n        \n          Best Action Camera\n        \n          Best Camera Bag and Backpack\n        \n          Best Drone\n        \n      Tablets & E-Readers\n     \n  \n          Best E-Ink Tablets\n        \n          Best iPad Deals\n        \n          Best iPad\n        \n          Best E-Reader\n        \n          Best Tablet\n        \n          Best Android Tablet\n        \n      3D Printers\n     \n  \n          Best 3D Printer\n        \n          Best Budget 3D Printer\n        \n          Best 3D Printing Filament\n        \n          Best 3D Printer Deals\n                          Your guideto a better future DealsReviewsBest ProductsGift GuideCouponsVideosSoftware Downloads About CNET Press Room Newsletters Licensing Sitemap Careers Accessibility Cookie Settings Privacy Policy  Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information instagram youtube tiktok facebook x flipboard  US France Germany Japan Korea \n  \u00a9 2025 CNET, a Ziff Davis company.\n  All rights reserved.\n   \n\n\n"

Three of these titles, No Man's Sky, Wrench, and Into the Radius, support virtual reality in some capacity, whether it is required or an optional feature. They mark the first VR titles to support DLSS, which could improve the games greatly, even on the more performance-restrictive medium.DLSS \u2013 or deep learning super sampling \u2013 is an image upscaling technology created by Nvidia. An exclusive to the company's graphics cards, the technology uses AI to upscale lower resolution to produce an image that looks like a higher resolution, without needing to use a significant amount of extra performance power to do so.The headliner here is No Man's Sky, which will offer the option to play the game with or without a virtual reality headset and receive DLSS support. Nvidia claims that, with an Oculus Quest 2 and an RTX 3080 GPU, the DLSS will double No Man's Sky's VR performance when running it on the Ultra graphics setting, while maintaining 90 FPS. Of course, it is important to keep in mind that the performance improvements can vary by specs and driver version.Alongside a boost in performance for the VR mode, No Man's Sky without a virtual reality will also get DLSS for desktop. Performance in desktop mode will reportedly improve by up to 70% when running the game at full 4K resolution.The inclusion of virtual reality games is no surprise for Nvidia as the tech giant rapidly expands the library of games with DLSS support. That's been made easier thanks to major game engines, including Unity adding easy plugins for the image upscaling technology. However, Nvidia may have some competition soon from AMD as it gears up to release FidelityFX Super Resolution, which is slated to release sometime this year.\nTaylor is the Associate Tech Editor at IGN.

Aquilatech suggests the first shipment of RTX 3080 Ti cards will take place on May 13th - just 10 days from now, while ComputersPerth's placeholder suggests the first stock will arrive in \u2018late May\u2019.\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.According to previous rumors, the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti may be launched on May 18, before it goes on sale just over a week after that on May 26. It remains to be seen whether pre-orders will begin ahead of the GPU's official debut.\u00a0With a launch likely just weeks away, we'll finally get confirmation on the specs of the RTX 3080 Ti. Rumors seem pretty confident that the graphics card will have 10,240 CUDA cores, 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM and a 384-bit memory bus.Via: Wccftech\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\nMSI\n\n\nCarly PageSocial Links NavigationCarly Page is a Freelance journalist, copywriter and editor specialising in Consumer/B2B technology.

Biomutant, the new open-world action RPG from Experiment 101 and THQ Nordic, is coming to GeForce NOW when it releases on May 25.\nEverybody Was Kung Fu Fighting\nBiomutant puts you in the role of an anthropomorphic rodent with swords, guns and martial arts moves to explore a strange, new open world. Your kung fu creature will evolve as you play thanks to the game\u2019s mutations system, granting new powers and resistances to help you on your journey.\nEach mutation will change how you fight and survive, with combat that challenges you to build ever-increasing attack combinations. You\u2019ll mix and match melee attacks, ranged weapons and Psi powers to emerge victorious.\n\nAs you evolve your warrior\u2019s abilities, you\u2019ll also change your in-game look. Players will craft new weapons and armor from items found during their adventures. For gamers who love customizing their build, Biomutant looks to be a dream game.\nAdventure Across Your Devices\nPC gamers have been eagerly anticipating Biomutant\u2019s release, and now GeForce NOW members will be able to take their adventure with them at GeForce quality, across nearly all of their devices.\n\u201cIt is great that PC gamers can play Biomutant even without relying on powerful hardware via GeForce NOW,\u201d said Stefan Ljungqvist, art and creative director at Experiment 101.\n\u201cWe love that GeForce NOW will help introduce even more players to this ever-evolving furry creature and its lush game world,\u201d said Florian Emmerich, head of PR at THQ Nordic, Biomutant\u2019s publisher. \u201cNow players can discover everything we have in store for them, even if their PC isn\u2019t the latest and greatest.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a gorgeous world to explore in Biomutant, and with GeForce NOW, you can explore it even on lower-powered devices.\nFrom what we\u2019ve seen so far, the world that Experiment 101 has built is lush and gorgeous. GeForce NOW members will get to explore it as it was meant to be seen, even on a Chromebook, Mac or mobile device.\nHow will you evolve when Biomutant releases on May 25?

NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics and is driving upgrades across the gaming and design markets. \n\u201cOur partners are launching the largest-ever wave of NVIDIA-powered laptops. Across industries, the adoption of NVIDIA computing platforms is accelerating. \u201cMellanox, one year in, has exceeded our expectations and transformed NVIDIA into a data-center-scale computing company.\n\u201cFrom gaming, cloud computing, AI, robotics, self-driving cars, to genomics and computational biology, NVIDIA continues to do impactful work to invent a better future,\u201d he said.\nEnterprise AI is the next big thing, according to Huang\nOn an earnings call this week, Huang detailed his company\u2019s high expectations for Enterprise AI. \u201cThis is a really large endeavor and the early indications of it are really exciting,\u201d he said. He noted that the company\u2019s data center business is more than 50 percent vertical industry enterprises already. \n\u201cAnd by creating this easy-to-adopt and easy-to-integrate stack, it\u2019s going to allow them to move a lot faster,\u201d he predicted.\nHuang pointed out that Nvidia\u2019s channel partners are integral to selling the company\u2019s new solutions. These include the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite as well as the EGX server platform that runs the software. This stands in contrast to Nvidia\u2019s cloud service provider business, which is based on direct sales, he added. The company\u2019s channel partners include value-added resellers and system integrators,\n\u201cFor enterprises, there are thousands, industries far and wide,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd so we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world\u2019s market so that everybody could buy more and save more.\u201d\n\n\n\nTags:\nNvidia / Nvidia AI Enterprise / VMware \n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nStay tuned, subscribe!\nE-mailadres*\n\nNieuwsbrieven*\n\nMorning Bytes\n\n\nWeekly Advisor\nCommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated                                \n\n\n\nHP adds more AI and PQC to printers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic CEO warns of Chinese spying on AI companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers see a bright future through the rise of agentic AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Databricks tools bring AI agents into production\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor picks    \n\n\n\nOracle launches Java 24 with enhanced AI support and post-quantum cryptography\n\nSecurity and AI take center stage in Java 24\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Lip-Bu Tan, the new Intel CEO?\n\nChange is afoot at Chipzilla\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Google\u2019s plans for cloud security provider Wiz?\n\nCatching up in the cloud computing market\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI introduces Responses API for building AI agents\n\n\nOpenAI has launched a new set of APIs and tools, making it easier for...\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Backup & Recovery\n\n\n\n\nCohesity buys Veritas unit for nearly 3 billion dollars\n\n\nCohesity has reached an agreement to acquire Veritas' data protection...\n\n\n\n\n\nCommvault Cloud shifts to cyber resilience\n\n\nCommvault is well known for backup solutions, but increasingly wants ...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCohesity CTO: New vaccines needed for the EU ransomware pandemic\n\n\nThe recent Synnovis ransomware attack suggests that today, with all t...\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVeeam focuses on migration and data freedom through hypervisor updates\n\nNow including Oracle and Proxmox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on VMware\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nScale Computing targets more VMware customers with new pricing models\n\n\nScale Computing wants to take more advantage of the uncertainty surrounding VMware.

Expect over 60 frames per second performance in more mainstream games such as Call of Duty: Warzone and Outriders, which Nvidia claims delivers up to double the performance from previous-gen GPUs.\u00a0The best gaming laptop deals in May 2021Nvidia RTX 30-series FAQ: Everything you need to knowBest gaming laptops 2021Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti Laptop GPUsAccording to Nvidia, the new RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs, both of which sport 4GB of GDDR6 memory, blast the company's past GTX 1650 Ti GPUs out of the park. What's more, gamers can expect over 60 fps performance in demanding games with DLSS and RT on. We like the sound of that.(Image credit: Nvidia)As shown above, gamers can expect nearly 100 fps when playing a round of Call of Duty: Warzone, and to get up to 70 fps in games such as Watch Dogs Legion and Minecraft with RTX \u2014 both with RT on.\n\nWhile the RTX 3050 Ti doesn't deliver the same performance, the new GPU still offers up to 60 fps in Call of Duty and sufficient performance for the more graphically demanding games.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 RTX 3050 Ti RTX 3050CUDA cores25602048Tensor Cores8064Ray Tracing Cores2016Boost Clock (MHz)14851500Standard Memory4GB GDDR64GB GDDR6PCIe 4.0YesYesHDMI 2.1YesYesWith the new GPU, Nvidia states it now has more than 140 RTX laptops on the market, with the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Pro being one of the first to boast the RTX 3050 GPU and the Dell XPS 15 bringing an RTX 3050 Ti.\n\nOther laptops now with RTX GPUs include the newly refreshed batch from different brands, including the Razer Blade 15, Alienware M15 R5, MSI GS76 Stealth, Asus Zephyrus M16, Dell XPS 17, and more.\n\nThat's not all, as the tech company also announced Nvidia Reflex, delivering high fps rates with low latency to major esports titles.

The game launches on PC this summer, and when it does, it\u2019ll be streaming instantly to GeForce NOW members.\nNo GFN Thursday would be complete without new games. And this week is chock full of new-new ones. Five PC games launching this week are joining the GeForce NOW library \u2014 including Saints Row: The Third Remastered \u2014 plus twelve additional titles.\nIt\u2019s a good week to have your head in the clouds.\nAdventure From the Clouds\nDevolver and Team WIBY have an exciting spin on dungeon-delving, and they\u2019re bringing it to GeForce NOW members at release.\n\u201cPhantom Abyss and GeForce NOW are a perfect match,\u201d said Josh Sanderson, lead programmer at Team WIBY. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for gamers to explore each dungeon, and now those adventurers can stream from the cloud even if their gaming PC isn\u2019t up to par.\u201d\nMembers who purchase the game on Steam will be able to play Phantom Abyss across nearly all of their devices, at legendary GeForce quality. Away from your rig but looking for a challenge? Stream to your Android mobile device, Chromebook or any other supported device. You can bring the action with you, wherever you are.\nRead on to learn more about Devolver\u2019s freshly announced Phantom Abyss.\nYou\u2019ll face perils in each of Phantom Abyss\u2019 tombs.\nTemple of Zoom\nPhantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers.\nYou\u2019ll need to dodge hidden traps, leap across chasms and defeat foes as you navigate each labyrinth to claim the relic at the end. Oh, and you only get one chance per temple. Luckily, you\u2019re joined on your quest by the phantoms of adventurers who tried before you, and you can learn from their run to aid your own.\nTo survive, you\u2019ll need to learn from those who came before you.\nExplore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you. Use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could\u2019ve hoped. Watch and learn from the mistakes of up to 50 phantoms, including your Steam friends who have attempted the same temple, and steal their whips as they fall.\nThose stolen whips matter, as they carry minor blessings to aid you on your run. But beware: they\u2019re also cursed, and balancing the banes and boons is key to reaching your ultimate prize.\nThe competition if fierce. Succeed where others have failed, and the treasures of each tomb will be yours.\nAs you progress on each run, you\u2019ll recover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward.\nAnd if you succeed, the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple will be yours, sealing the temple and cementing your legacy.\nExclusive Tips & Tricks\nThe folks at Devolver shared a few tips and tricks to help you start your adventure in Phantom Abyss.\nBefore each run you can select between two standard whips and one legendary one that can be acquired in exchange for tokens that you\u2019ve found in previous runs. Select carefully though, as each whip has its own blessings and curses, so it\u2019s important to find the whip that boosts your play style.\nThe phantoms of ghosts aren\u2019t just fun to watch meet their demise, they can be a helpful guide in your run! Phantoms can set off traps for you, which can be advantageous but also unexpected, so stay on your toes. If a phantom dies in front of you, you can pick up its whip if you find that it\u2019s more beneficial to you on the run.\nThe guardians are relentless so always keep them in mind the deeper you get into a temple \u2014 they tend to cause complete chaos when in the same room as you!\nEach temple has different levels and as players move down they can choose to take a more common relic and secure their lesser success or choose a different door to venture further into the Caverns and then the Inferno for even more treasure and glory.\nRemastered and Returning\nThe remastered version of Volition\u2019s classic returns to GeForce NOW.\nSaints Row: The Third Remastered is both joining and returning to GeForce NOW. The game launches on Steam later this week and we\u2019ll be working to bring it to GeForce NOW after it\u2019s released. Aligned to the launch, the Epic Games Store version of the game will make its triumphant return to GeForce NOW.\nThe remastered edition includes enhanced graphics, plus all DLC included \u2013 the three expansion mission packs and 30 pieces of DLC from the original version.\nGet Your Game On\nThat\u2019s only the beginning. GFN Thursday means more games, and this week\u2019s list includes four more day-and-date releases. Members can look forward to the following this week:\n\nSnowrunner (day-and-date release on Steam, May 17)\nSiege Survival Gloria Victis (day-and-date release on Steam, May 18)\nJust Die Already (day-and-date release on Steam, May 20)\n41 Hours (day-and-date release on Steam, May 21)\nSaints Row: The Third Remastered (Steam, May 22 and Epic Games Store)\nBad North (Steam)\nBeyond Good & Evil (Ubisoft Connect)\nChess Ultra (Steam)\nGroove Coaster (Steam)\nHearts of Iron 2: Complete (Steam)\nMonster Prom (Steam)\nOneShot (Steam)\nOutlast 2 (Steam)\nRed Wings: Aces of the Sky (Steam)\nSpace Invaders Extreme (Steam)\nWarlock: Master of the Arcane (Steam)\nWRC 8 Fia World Rally Championship (Epic Games Store)\n\nReady to brave the abyss on GeForce NOW this summer?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about disruptive companies, technologies and usage models.Follow AuthorMay 18, 2021, 09:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 LHRNVIDIA\nThe demand for PCs continued at a staggering pace in Q1 2021, driven by the need for one suitable device per family member of the household, work from home demands, and the ever-increasing demand for PC gaming. Canalys Research said that for Q1 2021, the market saw staggering 55% growth. These outlandish year-over-year numbers were accentuated by a weak Q1 2020, but the demand is still there. At the same time, we are experiencing an insatiable demand for computing capabilities related to Ethereum mining. Unfortunately for gamers, the best mining silicon is also found in the best gaming platform, and graphics card supply remains incredibly tight. This is very frustrating for gamers, to say the least.\n\n\nTo help combat this, in February, NVIDIA created a specialty lineup of products dedicated to Ethereum mining, called the Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, or \u201cCMP\u201d for short. NVIDIA announced four CMP cards, the 30HX, 40HX, 50HX, and 90HX. I wrote about that here. NVIDIA also announced that starting with the GeForce RTX 3060, it would \u00a0limit the Ethereum hash rate to 50% of its potential mining performance. While the 3060 results weren\u2019t definitive or helped answer the question \u201cis this helping?,\u201d I can confidently say that it helped ship an extra gaming card for each CMP card shipped.\n\n\nThere is demand for CMP. Commenting on Q1 guidance, NVIDIA\u2019s CFO Colette Kress recently said, \u201c...we now expect CMP revenue to be approximately $150 million, higher than the $50 million included in our fiscal Q1 outlook. Upside to CMP is not displacing supply from our other platforms. It is incremental.\u201c This is NVIDIA\u2019s CFO saying this, which I believe you can take to the bank.\nGTC 2021 Spring Investor Day mentioning CMP growthNVIDIA\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n\n\nNVIDIA announced today that it is doubling down on its commitment to ship gaming cards to gamers by taking the 50% hash rate-limiting to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, 3070, and 3060 Ti graphics cards. Buyers will recognize the difference in packaging with a \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d or \u201cLHR\u201d sticker or logo on the package and at the point of sale. I believe 100% of the company\u2019s channel partners will decide not to chew up profits fielding calls and emails from confused customers and make it clear which cards are \u201cLHR.\u201d NVIDIA also said the move would not impact cards already purchased or cards that are in the channel without the LHR designation.\n\n\nUltimately, I think this is a good move by NVIDIA for gamers. While there\u2019s no data that definitively tells us hash rate limiting on GeForce RTX 3060 helped create more cards for gamers, I do believe the combination of strong CMP sales and broadening the LHR lineup will help. Is it an exact science? No, but at least NVIDIA is trying its best to get gaming cards into the hands of gamers.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

At issue is the latest line of NVIDIA graphics cards\u2014powerful, cutting-edge chips with the computational might to display the most advanced video game graphics on the market.Gamers want the chips so they can experience ultra-realistic lighting effects in their favorite games. But they can\u2019t get their hands on NVIDIA cards, because miners are buying them up and adapting them to crunch cryptographic codes and harvest digital currency. The fierce competition to buy chips\u2014combined with a global semiconductor shortage\u2014has driven resale prices up as much as 300%, and led hundreds of thousands of desperate consumers to sign up for daily raffles for the right to buy chips at a significant mark-up.AdvertisementTo broker a peace between its warring customers, NVIDIA is, essentially, splitting its cutting-edge graphics chips into two dumbed-down products: GeForce for gamers and the Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) for miners. GeForce is the latest NVIDIA graphics card\u2014except key parts of it have been slowed down to make it less valuable for miners racing to solve crypto puzzles. CMP is based on a slightly older version of NVIDIA\u2019s graphics card which has been stripped of all of its display outputs, so gamers can\u2019t use it to render graphics.Splitting the chip market in twoNVIDIA\u2019s goal in splitting its product offerings is to incentivize miners to only buy CMP chips, and leave the GeForce chips for the gamers. \u201cWhat we hope is that the CMPs will satisfy the miners\u2026[and] steer our GeForce supply to gamers,\u201d said CEO Jansen Huang on a May 26 conference call with investors and analysts. \u201cHopefully, in the combination of those two, we\u2019ll see strong growth in our core gaming business through the year.\u201dUltimately, NVIDIA\u2019s priority is to keep its loyal gaming customers happy, according to Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya. Miners are flooding into the market for graphics cards because bitcoin prices are high\u2014but cryptocurrencies are unpredictable, and the miners\u2019 demand for chips could dry up with the next crypto crash. Gamers, on the other hand, will always want the latest graphics processors. \u201cPart of it is maintaining that trust with the [gaming] customers they know will be around long after mining goes away,\u201d Arya said.It won\u2019t be easy to keep the miners at bay, however. NVIDIA tried releasing slowed-down graphics chips in February in an effort to deter miners from buying them, but it didn\u2019t work. The miners quickly figured out how to hack the chips and make them perform\u00a0at full-speed again. NVIDIA announced May 18 it would release a newer, harder-to-crack version of its slowed-down graphics cards that should be utterly useless to miners\u2014and hopefully give gamers a chance to buy them.\ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily BriefOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

It adds the specialised graphical processing power required for serious videogaming, and is designed to connect, usually, to multiple high resolution displays.\nCryptocurrency miners use GPUs in large arrays and have no need for display outputs. They also need to run their equipment under heavy load continuously. They care much more than gamers do about energy efficiency, and also about price.\nThe new CMP cards don\u2019t have display outputs, which permits them to have better cooling and cope with being pushed hard for long periods. Their driver software is optimised for cryptocurrency mining. At the same time it brought out CMPs Nvidia rolled out software drivers on its GeForce RTX 3060 gaming GPU to reduce the hash rate when it detects cryptocurrency mining, making them less economically viable for miners.\nThe core hardware of the two product lines, however, is the same thing: graphical-processing chips. Gaming GPUs and mining CMPs are essentially the same product from the chipmaker\u2019s point of view, but the use of different software and peripherals allows the customers to be split into two groups.\nNvidia\u2019s strategy is a form of price discrimination, a perfectly legal and standard sales practice in which a company asks certain consumers to pay a different price for the same or similar products. This is in part possible because of Nvidia\u2019s dominant position in the GPU market. Examples of price discrimination include carmakers selling essentially the same car at significantly different prices based on minor equipment variations, or Apple selling an iPhone of a given model for a hugely increased price because it has some extra very cheap memory.\nNvidia sells CMPs at roughly $700 apiece, while the GeForce RTX 30-series for gamers retail for $399 to $1,499, depending on specs. Taking the median price of the GeForce RTX 30-series \u2013 $949 \u2013 gamers are on average paying a higher rate than miners.\nHigh demand for gaming GPUs means products are often resold at a premium by resellers, another issue that Nvidia is aiming to solve by separating the cryptocurrency mining and gaming markets.\nThe move looks to have been good business for Nvidia. In the three months ended 2 May, its CMPs brought in $155m in revenue for the Santa Clara, California-headquartered company.\nWhile that sum is dwarfed by Nvidia\u2019s core gaming business \u2013 which generated a record $2.76bn in the fiscal first quarter \u2013 it is still a notable additional revenue stream.\nAsked for comment by Verdict, an Nvidia spokesperson said that the two product lines cannot be directly compared:\n\u201cCMP GPUs are optimised for mining and use GPUs that do not meet our GeForce GPU specification. They are not comparable.\u201d\nThe separate products could also shield Nvidia in the event of a cryptocurrency price crash. The mining of bitcoin and other digital currencies is only profitable while their prices remain high. A recent downturn from bitcoin\u2019s peak in February could mean weaker sales for Nvidia in the current quarter, should that trend continue.\nIt learned this the hard way when bitcoin crashed in early 2018 and miners stopped buying Nvidia graphics cards. That left the company with an inventory bubble. But now Nvidia can, to an extent, segment these two revenue streams and keep on top of inventories.\nHowever, there is nothing stopping cryptocurrency miners from buying other GPUs without restrictions, and there are also reports of workarounds for the anti-mining software drivers.\nThis makes it tricky to determine how much the surge in cryptocurrency prices during the last quarter contributed to Nvidia\u2019s record sales in its gaming segment, a fact acknowledged by chief financial officer Colette Kress in an earnings call on Wednesday.\nDespite the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, Nvidia expects CMP sales to more than double to $400m in the current quarter.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has made it clear that gaming remains the company\u2019s core focus.\n\u201cThe gaming industry is really large, and what\u2019s really exciting on top of that is that gaming is no longer just gaming,\u201d Huang said during a call with analysts on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s infused into sports, e-sports. It\u2019s infused into art. It\u2019s infused into social. And so gaming has such a large cultural impact now. It\u2019s the largest form of entertainment, and I think the experience we\u2019re going through is going to last a while.\u201d\nElsewhere Nvidia showed strong growth in its data centre business, with revenues up 79% year on year (YoY) to $2.05bn. Much of this growth stemmed from the $6.9bn acquisition of Mellanox, a supplier of data centre-related technologies.\nBut Nvidia\u2019s automotive business \u2013 in which it provides GPUs to carmakers, primarily for high-end driverless applications \u2013 continued to stutter, generating just $154m and slumping 1% on the year-ago figure.\nNvidia\u2019s overall revenue totalled $5.66bn, up 84% YoY, while profits soared to $1.91bn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our daily news round-up!\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\n\n\n\nSign

Ray tracing is the hot new feature that manufacturers are hoping will convince you to buy a brand new console or GPU, and if you want to push your RTX GPU to the limit, then the Nvidia Marbles demo is for you. \nMarbles is a unique real-time tech demo that Nvidia showed off several years ago. It seems that it has always been Nvidia\u2019s intent to release this to the public, but even 30-series RTX graphics cards may struggle.\nRelated:\u00a0DLSS, Not Ray Tracing, Is The RTX 3060's Secret Weapon\nStill, if you have an RTX GPU and you want to see what magic it can pull off in the Marbles demo, then all you need is our instructions below so you can download and test it out for yourself. \n                        How To Download The Nvidia RTX Marbles Tech Demo\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to download the Marbles tech demo, you must first sign up to Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform. This is a development platform that incorporates tools that CGI movie studios like Pixar use to make materials look and react realistically under light and more. You can use this toolset to develop your own RTX creations, or you can simply download and experiment with those on offer. Marbles is one of these.\nSo navigate to the Omniverse home page here, and then download the open beta. You will need to specify why you are using the service, and give Nvidia some of your details. You won\u2019t need an email confirmation or anything - once your details are entered, the Omniverse application will begin to download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce downloaded and opened up, the Omniverse platform will require you to create an account - you can, thankfully, also log in using your Facebook or Google accounts.\nOnce you\u2019re all logged in head over to the Exchange tab - this is where you will literally exchange software with other Nvidia developers, or download software from Nvidia and others. Marbles is one of the titles, and you\u2019ll be able to find it by typing Marbles in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarbles doesn\u2019t have any in-app settings menu, however you can hunt down and edit a config file in Notepad. However, I couldn\u2019t actually find this config file - amateur, I know.\nA quick note, Marbles is very, very demanding, and on my RTX 3060 it uses 11GB of VRAM, and yet still doesn\u2019t hold a consistent framerate, especially when you change the marble design to the flowing, fluid fire variant. This is very demanding on GPUs, and you\u2019ll be lucky to be able to hold the framerate at 30FPS while playing. This just might be the new Crysis, in terms of being a benchmark of what your PC is capable of.\nNext:\u00a0After Four Years I Am Finally Ready For A Switch Pro \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaming Guides\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nRTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAm I Finally Gonna Be Able To Sell My PS3?\n\t\t\n\n\nPS3\n\nWith backward compatibility rumored to be on the horizon, my PS3's days may, at last, be numbered.\n\n\nPosts\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe DJI Osmo Action 4 Is A Capable Camera With Frustrating Drawbacks\n\t\t\n\n\nInstagram\n\nI recently took the DJI Osmo Action 4 on a multi-day hike.

In the meantime, Nvidia are saying that these laptop variants of the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti will be able to deliver 60fps+ speeds in many of today's top ray tracing games at 1080p with their performance boosting DLSS tech switched on, which is pretty good going for $799. \n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS | GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop Gameplay\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nAdmittedly, Nvidia's performance figures were obtained using Medium quality and Medium ray tracing settings, according to the stats they provided in my press briefing, so I'll have to wait until some proper review samples are available to see how they fare on higher quality settings, and what they can do in ray tracing games that don't have the benefit of DLSS. Still, provided these initial figures hold true, that should mean these laptops are capable of producing around 65fps in Control, just under 70fps in Watch Dogs Legion and Minecraft RTX, and almost 100fps speeds in Call Of Duty: Warzone, which again sounds pretty decent for the price.\nSpecs-wise, both the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPUs will have 4GB of GDDR6 memory to their name, and a GPU power ranging between 35-80W, which is quite a bit lower than the rest of Nvidia's RTX 30 series laptop family. To see how the rest of their specs stack up against their other RTX 30 siblings, have a look at the table below.\n\n\nGPU\nRTX 3080 laptop GPU\nRTX 3070 laptop GPU\nRTX 3060 laptop GPU\nRTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU\nRTX 3050 laptop GPU\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n6144\n5120\n3840\n2560\n2048\n\n\nTensor Cores\n192\n160\n120\n80\n64\n\n\nRay Tracing Cores\n48\n40\n30\n20\n16\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1245-1710 MHz\n1290-1620 MHz\n1283-1703 MHz\n1035-1695MHz\n1057-1740MHz\n\n\nGPU Subsystem Power\n80-150W\n80-125W\n60-115W\n35-80W\n35-80W\n\n\nMemory\n16GB / 8GB GDDR6\n8GB GDDR6\n6GB GDDR6\n4GB GDDR6\n4GB GDDR6\n\n\nMemory Interface Width\n256-bit\n256-bit\n192-bit\n128-bit\n128-bit\n\n\nInterestingly, Nvidia's new RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti laptops won't be replacing their existing GTX 16-series devices, Nvidia confirmed during my press briefing. Instead, their GTX 1650, GTX 1660 and GTX 1660 Ti laptops will continue to exist alongside the new RTX laptops. I'd hope that would mean we'll start seeing some sizable discounts on existing GTX 16-series laptops, as many currently cost around the same kind of $800 mark as their new, considerably more powerful RTX 3050 counterparts. I'm not holding out much hope, given the lack of discounts we've seen on older RTX 20-series laptops so far, but maybe, just maybe, we'll get some decent deals out of it this time round. \nNvidia also expect there to be a \"healthy ramp\" of chips available to power these new gaming laptops, which should mean these devices are available to buy for longer than five seconds, too. \"Laptop availability in a variety of regions on 30-series is actually quite good, especially in the higher end GPU SKUs,\" Nvidia told me during my press briefing. \"The shortage is not as severe as it is on desktop.\"\nThere was still no comment on when we can expect the desktop situation to get any better unfortunately. Nvidia are currently saying stock shortages could continue until 2022 at this rate, so anyone in need of a much-needed upgrade may actually have better luck getting hold of a laptop (or indeed a whole new pre-built desktop) instead of trying to upgrade their existing rig. \nAs mentioned above, I'll do my best to test as many of these new RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti laptops as I can in the coming weeks and months to work out which ones are worth buying, so watch this space to see how they stack up.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKatharine Castle: Katharine was RPS' editor-in-chief from 2021 to 2024.

No developer should ignore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Tools like the Sipeed Maixduino and the Maxim MAX78000, which we have already presented in Elektor, are suitable options for taking your first steps into the world of AI. The Nvidia Jetson Nano (Figure 1)\u00a0is a much more powerful hardware from the class of single board computers, equipped with a quad-core ARM processor, 4 GB RAM and a GPU with 128 CUDA cores.In this series of articles, I show you which applications are possible, for example, in the fields of image processing or robotics.\n\nFigure 1 : Nvidia Jetson Nano (source: Nvidia).\n\nAI\u00a0in Everyday Life\nAI is finding its way more and more into our everyday lives. Neural networks make it possible to recognize objects, enhance images, and convert the words of a conversation into text. This exciting field will help shape our future. To help you take your first steps into the exciting world of AI, we have already looked at the Sipeed Maixduino (Figure\u00a01) [1] and the Maxim MAX78000 FTHR board (Figure\u00a02) [2].\n\n\nFigure 2: Sipeed bit with K210 MCU.\n\n\nBoth boards have something in common: microcontrollers and accelerators for neural networks are built in, but with limited resources. The Nvidia Jetson Nano (Figure\u00a0\u200b3) [3] is a much more powerful piece of hardware from the single board computer (SBC) class.\n\n\nFigure 3: MAX78000 FTHR board with AI accelerator.\n\n\nEquipped with a quad-core ARM processor, 4\u00a0GB RAM and a GPU with 128\u00a0CUDA cores, the Jetson Nano is a good platform for investigating AI and neural networks. Applications range from speech recognition to classifying objects in captured video images to full-blown robot control. Plenty of \u201caccessories\u201d are available for all areas \u2014 for example, the SparkFun JetBot AI Kit v2.1 Powered by Jetson Nano.\nThe GPU Makes the Difference\nWith the Nvidia Jetson Nano, a comparison with the popular Raspberry Pi 4B (Figure\u00a04) is obvious. Both are SBCs, both have four processor cores, and both are available with 4\u00a0GB of RAM. An Ubuntu 20.04 can also be installed on both boards, and a pin header for extensions is also common to both. The Raspberry\u00a0Pi\u00a04 has a Broadcom VideoCore6 graphics processing unit (GPU). The Jetson Nano has a Maxwell-based GPU with 128\u00a0CUDA cores (GM20B). These cores give the Jetson Nano its performance advantages. The CUDA cores are programmable arithmetic units within the GPU that are not only intended for processing graphics data, but can also execute generic arithmetic operations in parallel (i.e., also those that are needed for training and applying a neural network).\n\n\nFigure 4: Raspberry Pi 4 board\n\n\nTraining with the Jetson Nano\nHere you can see the difference from a MAX78000. The training of the neural network should be done on a Linux PC, which is best equipped with a CUDA-capable Nvidia card. PyTorch and other software tools are used for this. The Jetson Nano, on the other hand, already has all the ingredients to train a neural network itself. Certainly, this is not as fast as on a current PC with a Geforce 1660 or Geforce 1050Ti. But you can get the Jetson Nano for about \u20ac130. A graphics card, if available at all at the moment, costs twice as much.\n\r\nNvidia provides a large number of tutorials [4, 5] and, of course, software [6]. Among other things, they show how neural networks can be taught for image recognition/processing on the Nvidia Jetson Nano with the help of a webcam.\nJetson Nano and the Moving JetBot\nOnce you are familiar with the environment, the desire for a tangible application may arise. Due to the focus on image processing, a self-driving robot suggests itself. The JetBot (Figure\u00a05) [7] is one such robot.\u00a0Maker-friendly, a parts list and 3D models are available for self-printing of parts. A moving robot with object recognition and interaction allows the intelligence of self-trained neural networks to be seen directly in action. The webinar \u201cAI for Makers: Learn with JetBot\u201d demonstrates how to teach such a robot to interact with its environment [8].\n\n\nFigure 5: Nvidia JetBot as 3D rendering (source: Nvidia).\n\n\nDevelopment Via Web Browser\nA web browser is sufficient for developing the JetBot\u2019s software. The development environment that runs in the browser is the JupyterLab (Figure\u00a06). It allows for the creation, editing and execution of Python scripts. This also allows for access to quite a few third-party libraries. Motor drivers or sensors (e.g., from Sparkfun or Adafruit) can be addressed directly from Python.\n\n\nFigure 6: Jupyter Lab in a browser.\n\n\nJupyterLab also can be used to start neural network training. It is possible to generate new training data for the neural networks in order to improve the behavior of a robot with data from the running operation and to add new functions. You always have the IDE with you in a browser. However, to develop the control of the robot and other services from scratch is time consuming and not necessary. The Robot Operation System (ROS) can be used as a flexible basis for robots of all types. It enables you to build on a defined core and a well-documented software base. However, ROS as an operating system based on Linux also allows functions such as creating maps of the environment and other actions. A suitable OS image with pre-installed ROS is available for the Nvidia Jetson and JetBot.\nSparkFun's All-in-One Kit\nDownload images, prepare the Jetson Nano, procure components for the JetBot from various sources, and possibly 3D print them? Configure the individual software parts appropriately and only then start with the topic of AI? It is easier to use a ready-made kit in order to have defined and functioning hardware right away, so that you can delve completely into the topic of AI. The SparkFun JetBot AI Kit v2.1 (Figure\u00a07) includes all the hardware you need to get started with AI and robotics. Based on Nvidia\u2019s JetBot, it gives you access to a large ecosystem of tutorials and software, with SparkFun\u2019s helpful hardware documentation.\n\n\nFigure 7: SparkFun JetBot AI Kit v2.1 (source: SparkFun).\n\n\nThere is also no need to assemble software components. The kit contains a ready-made SD card that already includes everything necessary. The purchase of such a kit may seem expensive at around \u20ac270. However, it includes the Jetson Nano, the mechanical parts of the robot, motors, motor drivers, an OLED, WiFi adapter, camera, SD card, and all the other parts needed to get started (Figure\u00a08).\n\n\nFigure 8: Parts in the SparkFun JetBot AI Kit v2.1 (source: SparkFun).\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Next with the Jetson Nano?\nThere is much to learn and much to discover. AI shows many new exciting ways to equip a vehicle with autonomous control. For most readers, however, terms like PyTorch and ROS certainly still need to be put into the appropriate context. PyTorch takes care of modifying and teaching the AI. Like any software, PyTorch wants to be operated appropriately \u2014 and, as usual, with many programs from the Linux world, preferably with configuration files. The control of the vehicle/robot is then managed by the ROS. The handling of these two tools alone offers enough material to fill entire books. Therefore, we will slowly approach the individual components and dive deeper into the details!\nDo you have technical questions or comments about this article?

Twitter user I_leak_VN has also added additional weight to these concerns after posting a lineup of alarmingly high prices from an unspecified Vietnamese retailer.AMD vs Nvidia: which should be your next graphics card?Where to buy Nvidia RTX 3080: find stock hereWe'll show you\u00a0how to build a PC\"Real\" MSI graphics cards price in my country \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/1mlU1C020cMay 5, 2021Let's state the obvious here before we go any further \u2013 we don't have any way to substantiate the source of these claims so this is all speculation so far. If the image does have any shred of truth to it though, the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti could come with an eyewatering price tag in certain regions.\n\nWhen converted from Vietnamese Dong the MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti SUPRIM X converts to around $3,200 / \u00a32,300 / AU$4,100 , with the MSI Gaming X Trio following at $3,050 / \u00a32,500 / AU$4,000 and the entry-level MSI Ventus 3X OC finishing up at $2,900 / \u00a32,100 / AU$3,700.\n\nIt was also previously reported that a local retailer in Abu Dhabi that's already made an MSI Suprim X version of the GPU available for purchase for an estimated $3500/\u00a32500/AU$4500, so the prices we're seeing aren't an isolated claim.MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti SUPRIM X allegedly goes on sale in UAE for 3500 USD https://t.co/LuaJFa1hNUMay 4, 2021Ti-wateringly high pricesGiven the RTX 3080 Ti is supposed to bridge the gap between the previous RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 GPUs (providing not far off the gaming performance of a 3090 for a more affordable budget), the prices we're seeing here would still make Nvidia's latest flagship an unaffordable option for many.\n\nThis could also mean that cryptominers will be dissuaded from buying up the available stock, however, especially as both the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti should be getting Nvidia's updated hash rate limiter. The GeForce RTX 3090 hasn't been as big a target for miners given the large upfront cost, making them an inefficient investment for mining rigs.\n\nAs with all rumors, take all this with a pinch of salt. We won't know the state of things until the GPU officially hits the shelves and an announcement is made regarding Nvidia's recommended pricing.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia RTX 5070 Ti early pricing rumors are making me fear the worst for the cost of this mid-range GPU\n\n\n\n\nRumored prices for third-party RTX 5080 graphics cards soar above Nvidia\u2019s MSRP, and I\u2019m worried entry-level models will sell out in a flash\n\n\n\nWe've contacted Nvidia for comment.Today\u2019s best graphics card deals293 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $29View $39.99 $34.99ViewDeal ends Tue, Apr 1, 2025 $63ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesThese are the best graphics cards of 2021Via WCCFTechGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJess WeatherbedSocial Links NavigationJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

The stunning demo consists of over 10 million polygons, enabling users to view incredibly detailed, photorealistic visuals in virtual, augmented and mixed reality \u2014 collectively known as extended reality, or XR.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our partnership with Lenovo workstations \u2014 and in particular, ThinkStation P620 \u2014 which has enabled us to take this to the next level,\u201d said Pete Freedman, vice president and chief marketing officer of Aston Martin Lagonda. \u201cOur aim has always been to provide our customers with a truly immersive experience, one that feels like it brings them to the center of the automotive product, and we\u2019ve only been able to do this with the NVIDIA RTX A6000.\u201d\nNVIDIA RTX Brings the XR Factor\nCustomers would typically visit Aston Martin dealerships, attend motor shows or tour their facilities in the U.K. to explore the latest car models. A team would walk them through the design and features in person.\nBut after everyone started working remotely, Aston Martin decided to take a fresh look at what\u2019s truly possible and investigate options to take the experience directly to customers \u2014 virtually.\nWith the help of teams from Lenovo and Varjo, an XR headset maker, the automaker developed the demo that provides an immersive look at the new Aston Martin DBX using VR and XR.\nThe experience, which is rendered from the NVIDIA RTX-powered ThinkStation P620, allows virtual participants to enter the environment and see a pixel-perfect representation of the Aston Martin DBX. Customers with XR headsets can explore the virtual vehicle from anywhere in the world, and see details such as the stitching and lettering on the steering wheel, leather and chrome accents, and even the reflections within the paint.\nThe real-time reflections and illumination in the demo were enabled by Varjo\u2019s pass-through mixed reality technology. The Varjo XR-3\u2019s LiDAR with RGB Depth Fusion using NVIDIA\u2019s Optical Flow gives users the perception that the car is in the room, seamlessly blending the real world and virtual car together.\n\nWith the NVIDIA RTX A6000, the immersive demo runs smoothly and efficiently, providing users with high-quality graphics and stunning detail.\n\u201cAs you dial up the detail, you need high-end GPUs. You need large GPU frame buffers to build the most photorealistic experiences, and that\u2019s exactly what the NVIDIA RTX A6000 delivers,\u201d said Mike Leach, worldwide solution portfolio lead at Lenovo.\nThe NVIDIA RTX A6000 is based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture and delivers a 48GB frame buffer. This allows teams to create high-fidelity VR and AR experiences with consistent framerates.\nAston Martin will expand its use of VR and XR to enhance internal workflows, as well. With this new experience, the design teams can work in virtual environments and iterate more quickly earlier in the process, instead of creating costly models.\nWatch Lenovo\u2019s GTC session to hear more about Aston Martin\u2019s story.\nLearn more about NVIDIA RTX and how our latest technology is powering the most immersive environments across industries.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: NVIDIA RTX | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories Are Redefining Data Centers and Enabling the Next Era of AI\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center to Bring Quantum Computing Closer\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Steam Ahead: NVIDIA-Certified Program Expands to Enterprise Storage for Faster AI Factory Deployment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom AT&T to the United Nations, AI Agents Redefine Work With NVIDIA AI Enterprise\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Aerial Expands With New Tools for Building AI-Native Wireless Networks\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

What\u2019s Missing?ByKarl FreundFollowShareSaveInnovationEnterprise TechQualcomm Cloud AI 100 Is 3X More Efficient. What\u2019s Missing?ByKarl Freund, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorMay 20, 2021, 07:00am EDTShareSaveThis article is more than 3 years old.New MLPerf benchmarks lay a solid foundation; now the company needs to finish the job.\nAs the Cambrian Explosion reverberates across the landscape of AI chips, the benchmarking silence of many challengers stands in sharp contrast to their marketing hype. Most are vying to challenge NVIDIA, the leader in data center AI acceleration, but few have dared to take on NVIDIA GPUs in a head-t0-head benchmark using the open source MLPerf benchmarking suite. Qualcomm, the maker of the mobile Snapdragon and its AI engine, has bravely put its best foot forward, releasing its first peer-reviewed benchmarks with excellent performance and industry-leading power efficiency. We explain the results and preview what may be next for the Qualcomm Cloud AI100 platform.\n\nThe Cloud AI 100 is now available from Gigabyte, who has built a pl 6.4 thousand trillion (POPS) ... [+] server, which is over 100 POPS in a rack.Qualcomm\nQualcomm demonstrates its prowess in performance and efficiency\nWhile the Cloud AI100 did not outperform NVIDIA\u2019s flagship A100 Tensor Core GPU, the Qualcomm/AMD equipped Gigabyte server nailed power efficiency in data center while the Qualcomm AI Development Kit (which uses a Snapdragon CPU) did the same in edge configurations. In all cases, the AI100 performed admirably, delivering over 3.5 times the performance of the NVIDIA T4 (albeit a two year-old platform), while consuming roughly the same amount of energy with lower latency. The Gigabyte server with the AI100 delivers performance comparable to the newest NVIDIA A30 GPU while consuming less than half the total system power, which is how MLCommons specifies that power consumption is to be measured. That means complete configurations, like the Gigabyte server with 16 cards depicted above, is far more efficient; the server\u2019s power-hungry CPU and power supply wattage is only being amortized over a single accelerator in the benchmark.\n\nQualcomm (QTI) demonstrated excellent performance per watt in their MLPerf submission for ResNet50.Qualcomm\nQualcomm\u2019s claim of industry leading efficiency seem largely validated, at least for object detection and identification. But again, these platforms are targeting different applications and deployment environments, so we remain somewhat cautious in generalizing these data points into broader assertions. For example, the NVIDIA A100 is a 250-450 watt powerhouse all by itself, and is not meant to compete with smaller, less expensive chips doing smaller jobs, while the T4 will be largely replaced with Multi-Instance fragments of a cloud-based A100 over time.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nThe Cloud AI100 also outperformed NVIDIA in terms of power efficiency for Imagenet, although the ... [+] NVIDIA A100 delivered more absolute throughput.Cambrian-AI Research\n\nNonetheless, we cannot miss the opportunity to play around with a spreadsheet, and so we examine the relative performance versus latency of these contenders, this time looking at smart edge processing. The AI100 bests NVIDIA Xavier in both throughput and latency by ~5X and 3X respectively, all at lower power. Again, we must point out that Xavier has a ton of logic on chip that the AI100 does not have, but from an architectural perspective this comparison points to a significant advantage in AI model processing for Qualcomm.\n\n\n The Qualcomm AI100 has higher throughput at much lower latency than the NVIDIA Xavier part. The ... [+] latter, however, provides more non-AI functionality, while the AI100 is strictly an AI engine.Cambrian-AI Research\nSo, what\u2019s next for Qualcomm AI?\nWith these benchmarks, we believe Qualcomm has established its bona fides in data center inference processing, at least for images. The power efficiency does not come at the expense of performance, as many edge AI startups require for low power applications. But the platform is taking a long time to fully materialize as a business; we have been following it for three years now. So, now we must ask, what\u2019s next? And what\u2019s missing?\nLooking forward, we will be anxious to understand the following.\n\n\nHow well does the AI100 architecture perform in processing other AI models such as language processing and recommendation engines?\nDoes the memory architecture suffice for processing larger models, or will Qualcomm need to add off-chip memory to the next generation (3- or 5-nm?) platform?\nWho are the first AI100 customers, and have any completed their evaluations? As we have speculated, the Gigabyte/AMD/Qualcomm server tells us that someone with a large data center is preparing to deploy the AI100 in volume. Otherwise Gigabyte would be unlikely to build and test a server strictly on speculation. Who is driving this demand, and who else is in evaluations? Customers are always shy; they don\u2019t want their competitors to know what they are using that gives them a competitive advantage.\nWe hope to see a TCO study or model, as power saving flow to cost of operations not acquisition. In large data center inference, TCO matters. A lot.\n\n\nWe remain an enthusiastic follower of Qualcomm\u2019s entry into the data center. After the company abandoned their Centriq ARM server effort, and placed all its cloud bets on AI, this program has become a critical growth factor for the company, and initial performance and power measurements foretell a success story in the making.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

They sit beneath the GeForce RTX 3060 in terms of specs and performance, with less video memory (4GB) and fewer dedicated Tensor AI and RT cores available to perform ray tracing and handle AI-enhanced effects like DLSS.Despite this, Nvidia says that the RTX 3050 Ti is capable of going beyond 60fps in games like Call of Duty: Warzone, Outriders, Control, Watch Dogs: Legion, and Minecraft \u2014 all with ray tracing settings on. That\u2019s pretty good, considering it\u2019ll show up in gaming laptop starting at $849. The RTX 3050 will appear in laptops starting at $799. We already know that Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Book Odyssey will feature these graphics chips, starting at $1,399.There are caveats. To begin with, Nvidia\u2019s benchmark measured this level of performance with graphics set to medium, with medium ray tracing settings enabled, and with DLSS on and set to quality mode. It\u2019s entirely possible that many games set to high graphics settings (and minimal or no ray tracing) might also perform well with the RTX 3050 Ti, but this graphics chip seems best suited for people who don\u2019t mind knocking down some quality settings to get smooth gameplay.The RTX 3050 Ti serves as yet another flex of Nvidia\u2019s DLSS feature that, with the help of its AI cores, is able to run games faster than the hardware normally could. It does this in supported games by turning down the resolution, then using a trained AI model to enhance the picture quality on the fly without a perceptible (in most cases) difference in how the game looks. It promises big gains in performance with little in the way of disadvantages, unless you\u2019re really dissecting pixels.Again, this is a great argument in favor of these two GPUs, but it only works if your games have been patched to support DLSS. Control, for example, supports DLSS, but its performance without the feature turned on takes almost a 50 percent hit, running at about 35 frames per second at medium settings, according to Nvidia\u2019s testing. That\u2019s playable, but not particularly fluid, and it may be indicative of the kind of experience you might have when playing graphically intensive games that don\u2019t support DLSS.The performance charts that Nvidia shared with us only showed data on the RTX 3050 Ti\u2019s performance, not the RTX 3050\u2019s. Given that the RTX 3050 is a notch below the RTX 3050 Ti in terms of specs, you can probably expect performance to reflect that. Still, it should deliver good performance for the expected $799 starting price of laptops into which it will be built.Here\u2019s the performance breakdown of the 3050 Ti in some games. NvidiaIt\u2019s also important to remember that, like with all other RTX 30-series mobile graphics chips, OEMs are free to tweak the total graphics power (TGP) of each RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti in terms of wattage and clock speed to align with their design goals. The TGP range for these chips can be anywhere between 35W and 80W.Finally, it\u2019s fair to expect less powerful variants in thinner laptops. Conversely, thicker models often allow graphics cards to reach their highest possible power levels. As a result, you may want to keep that in mind when you\u2019re shopping for a gaming laptop equipped with one of these new chips.RelatedHow DLSS could make the next Switch a powerhouse overnightIntel\u2019s flagship Tiger Lake-H mobile chips are here to take on Ryzen 5000See More: EntertainmentGamingNewsNvidiaPC GamingTechMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?Leaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The F900 is the first PowerScale system to support Nvidia GPUDirect to boost performance by bypassing the host CPU and moving data directly into memory using remote direct memory access (RDMA) technology.\nDell claimed the new F900 delivers throughput of up to 6 GB per node, per second and performs 30% faster for sequential reads than the older Isilon F800 model. Company officials attributed the increase to newer multicore Intel Cascade Lake processors, expanded memory and OneFS file system optimizations.\nUpgrading to OneFS 9.2 could also help existing PowerScale customers accelerate performance. Dell claimed the updated file system would speed up the PowerScale F600 by 70% and the entry-level F200 by 25% for sequential reads.\n\nPerformance drives upgrade for PowerScale customer\nThe performance improvements are important for customers in need of real-time access to data. Ontario-based Nature Fresh Farms plans to upgrade next week to OneFS 9.2 across the PowerScale F200, H400 and A100 systems that store about 215 TB of unstructured data.\n\"The performance really caught our eye,\" acknowledged Keith Bradley, director of information technology at Nature Fresh.\nNature Fresh uses AI, robotics and automation technology to optimize the growing, picking and packing of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers in greenhouses in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. The company relies on PowerScale to process and store about 10,000 photographs every hour and archive the video streams of produce that its cameras and robots capture.\nBradley said the AI workloads and robots have maxed out the performance of the F200 on a couple of occasions, so the IT staff is examining in-house fixes. But with Nature Fresh's use of AI expanding, Bradley is also keeping an eye on the F900 as a potential long-term remedy. He said the company's Nvidia servers have been a \"game changer\" for AI performance, so the new PowerScale GPUDirect storage option presents an intriguing proposition.\n\n\n\nNew Dell EMC PowerScale F900 supports All-NVMe flash storage configurations and Nvidia GPU Direct for AI and machine learning workloads.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUptick in all-NVMe for AI\nScott Sinclair, a senior analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group, said the increasing interest in and adoption of AI and machine learning and the expansion of business intelligence and analytics are driving an uptick in demand for all-flash and all-NVMe storage for unstructured data. Sinclair expects the trend to extend to GPUDirect storage because of the work that Nvidia is doing to support developers and \"all things machine learning.\"\nSteve McDowell, a senior technology analyst and Moor Insights & Strategy, said the new high-end Dell EMC F900 would increase Dell's competitiveness against Pure Storage's FlashBlade and NetApp's AFF models that also support Nvidia GPUDirect for a performance advantage.\n\"GPUDirect is rapidly becoming a check-box feature for high-end machine learning, exactly where Dell is targeting the F900,\" McDowell said. \"It's significant in demonstrating that Nvidia continues to set the agenda for deep learning.\"\nMcDowell said the PowerScale F900 more generally takes aim at the narrow range of \"high-value applications\" that enterprises in finance, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, retail, and similar industries depend on for operations. The PowerScale F600 also supports all-NVMe SSD configurations, but neither the F600 nor the F900 support NVMe over Fabrics, according to Dell.\n\n\nNew PowerScale cloud consumption options\nAlso on Tuesday, Dell added new consumption options for its PowerScale file storage, which supports object access through an S3 interface. PowerScale will be available through Dell's new Apex storage as a service that enables enterprises to buy, deploy and manage on-premises storage in much the same way they would in the public cloud.\nCustomers that prefer to use PowerScale in the public cloud have a new option for all-flash Tier 1 storage with Google at a lower price point, reduced minimum capacity and shorter contract term than the offering that launched in June 2020. Dell PowerScale systems run inside Google data centers for the service. The starting capacity has now dropped to 25 TB instead of the original 100 TB requirement.\nBrian Henderson, director of product marketing for unstructured data solutions at Dell Technologies, said Apex and Google Cloud customers choose the performance, capacity and services they need, and Dell determines the PowerScale model based on their selections.\nDell also supports PowerScale in AWS and Microsoft Azure, but the storage does not run natively in their data centers. Colocation provider Faction operates the PowerScale systems in facilities located near the AWS and Azure data centers and uses high-speed interconnects to link into them, Henderson said.\nAdditional new PowerScale features Dell announced on Tuesday include security updates to support IPv6, external key managers and the Security Technical Implementation Guide configuration standard.\nEnterprise Strategy Group is a division of TechTarget.\nCarol Sliwa is a TechTarget senior writer covering enterprise storage arrays and drives, flash and memory technologies, and enterprise architecture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Deeper on Flash memory and storage\n\n\n\nDell still tops the pile as it deepens enterprise storage offer\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antony\u00a0Adshead\n\n\n\n\nWith Project Lightning, Dell to strike out in new directions\n\n\n\n\nBy: Adam\u00a0Armstrong\n\n\n\n\nMad Max production company gets Dell PowerScale to leverage generative AI\n\n\n\n\nBy: Yann\u00a0Serra\n\n\n\n\nDell refines AI factory, expands Nvidia partnership\n\n\n\n\nBy: Adam\u00a0Armstrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored News\n\n\nDriving Digital Transformation in Higher Education\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\n\nFlexible IT: When Performance and Security Can\u2019t Be Compromised\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\n\nImproving Operational Efficiencies: 4 Success Stories in Digital Transformation\n\u2013Dell Technologies\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nTop 10 storage stories highlight trends of 2021\n\u2013 Search Storage\n\n\nDell OneFS adds security, some performance to ...\n\u2013 Search Storage\n\n\nDell EMC turns Isilon NAS into PowerScale, adds ...\n\u2013 Search Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisaster Recovery\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Backup\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSustainability and ESG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Disaster Recovery\n\n\n\n\nHow to assess pandemic risk in 2025\nBusinesses learned a lot about disaster recovery and risk from COVID-19.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter months of rumors and speculation, Nvidia has finally revealed the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, the long-awaited heir to the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Forget the earlier 20GB VRAM rumors; the 3080 Ti is basically an RTX 3090 with half the VRAM. With specifications and performance so close to the GeForce RTX 3090, the new Ampere offering will have no problems competing for a spot with the best graphics cards on the market. Here's the quick overview:Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 3090RTX 3080 TiRTX 3080RTX 2080 TiArchitectureGA102GA102GA102TU102Process TechnologySamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)28.328.328.318.6Die size (mm^2)628.4628.4628.4754SMs / CUs82806868GPU Cores10,49610,2408,7044,352Tensor Cores328320272544RT Cores82806868Base Clock (MHz)1,3951,3701,4401,515Boost Clock (MHz)1,6951,6651,7101,545VRAM Speed (Gbps)19.5191914VRAM (GB)24121011VRAM Bus Width384384320352ROPs1121129688TMUs328320272272TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)35.634.129.813.4TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)142 (285)136 (273)119 (238)108RT TFLOPS69.566.658.152.5Bandwidth (GBps)936912760616TDP (watts)350350320260Launch DateSep 2020Jun 2021Sep 2020Sep 2018Launch Price$1,499$1,199$699$1,199Armed with 80 out of a potential 84 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) from the GA102 GPU, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti offers consumers 10,240 CUDA cores with a 1,665 MHz boost clock alongside 320 third-generation Tensor Cores for AI and 80 second-generation RT cores for ray tracing workloads. With the CUDA cores alone, it\u2019s easy to see why Nvidia is boasting that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti delivers up to 1.5 times higher performance than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. For those of you who love numbers, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti pumps out 143%, 139% and 56% higher shader TFLOPs, Tensor TFLOPs and RT TFLOPs, respectively. It also has 48% more memory bandwidth.\n\nWe can also look at the more recent Ampere GPUs for comparison. The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is only a hair behind the GeForce RTX 3090 in most areas, with the biggest difference being VRAM capacity. 3080 Ti wields 12GB of GDDR6X memory at 19 Gbps, on a 384-bit memory interface, meaning the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti lands with a maximum theoretical memory bandwidth up to 912 GBps. On paper, it's only about 3\u20134% behind the 3090, except for having half the memory. Alternatively, the 3080 Ti has 14% more compute and 20% more bandwidth than the vanilla RTX 3080.GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (Image credit: Nvidia)For better or worse, the 3080 Ti takes after the GeForce RTX 3080 in terms of design \u2014 if not for the \"Ti'' branding, we'd swear that we're looking at a GeForce RTX 3080. The GeForce RTX 3080's dual-slot cooling system is less robust than the GeForce RTX 3090\u2019s triple-slot cooler, though really it's the GDDR6X memory that gives us the most cause for concern. The 3090 and 3080 Founders Edition cards could run very hot on the memory, and the same goes for a lot of the third party designs. Adding two more GDDR6X modules isn't going to improve the situation with the 3080 Ti.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is also rated with the same 350W TDP as the GeForce RTX 3090, compared to the GeForce RTX 3080's 320W TDP, so we're looking at 30W overhead. Common sense would tell us that the cooling fans will have to work a bit harder, which may increase the operating noise level. There is evidence that replacing the stock thermal pads on the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 helps better cool the memory chips. So, the big question is whether Nvidia substituted the thermal pads on the Ti. We suspect not, but let's hope Nvidia proves otherwise.Image 1 of 3GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti's other attributes align with those of the non-Ti. The Founders Edition is still happily rocking Nvidia's 12-pin PCIe power connector. Display outputs still come down to one HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. Nvidia is set to launch the RTX 3080 Ti on June 3, with an official launch price of $1,199.\u00a0Considering the rest of the graphics card market right now, not to mention what we've seen of previous Ampere launches, that price is likely to be meaningless throughout 2021 and into 2022. The RTX 3080 continues to immediately sell out and generally goes for over $2,000 on eBay, and the RTX 3090 lands closer to the $3,000 range right now. Unless Nvidia can produce a lot more GPUs and cards, shortages and price gouging are likely to continue.Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 TiGeForce RTX 3070 Ti (Image credit: Nvidia)Besides the RTX 3080 Ti, Nvidia also officially announced the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti. The graphics card presumably utilizes GA104 silicon, which is the same die inside the GeForce RTX 3070. The Ti comes with two additional SMs, which gives the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 6,144 CUDA cores, 192 Tensor cores and 96 RT cores.\n\nNvidia clocks the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti higher than both the GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce RTX 3080. It features a 1,575 MHz base clock and 1,770 MHz boost clock. With these clock speeds, the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti delivers a FP32 performance up to 21.75 TFLOPs. The potentially bigger change is in the memory, as the 3070 Ti will use GDDR6X instead of GDDR6 VRAM.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti ends up being a moderately faster variant of the existing GeForce RTX 3070. In comparison to the GeForce RTX 2070 Super, however, Nvidia is claiming a performance uplift up to 1.5X.Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GPU SpecificationsGraphics CardRTX 3080RTX 3070 TiRTX 3070RTX 2070 SuperArchitectureGA102GA104GA104TU104Process TechnologySamsung 8NSamsung 8NSamsung 8NTSMC 12FFNTransistors (Billion)28.317.417.413.6Die size (mm^2)628.4392.5392.5545SMs / CUs68484640GPU Cores8,7046,1445,8882,560Tensor Cores272192184320RT Cores68484640Base Clock (MHz)1,4401,5751,5001,605Boost Clock (MHz)1,7101,7701,7251,770VRAM Speed (Gbps)19191414VRAM (GB)10888VRAM Bus Width320256256256ROPs96969664TMUs272192184160TFLOPS FP32 (Boost)29.821.7520.39.1TFLOPS FP16 (Tensor)119 (238)87 (174)81 (163)72RT TFLOPS58.14239.727.3Bandwidth (GBps)760608448448TDP (watts)320290220215Launch DateSep 2020June 2021Oct 2020Jul 2019Launch Price$699$599$499$499Nvidia only equipped the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti with 8GB of GDDR6X memory at 19 Gbps. This might seem like a disappointment for many consumers, who were expecting at least 10GB, like the GeForce RTX 3080. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti also has a narrower memory bus, meaning it's only good for 608 GBps of memory bandwidth.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It remains to be seen whether the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti can provide a sensible performance upgrade over the GeForce RTX 3070. The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti variant rocks a 290W TDP, a significant 31.8% increase over the non-Ti model. As usual, you'll find the Founders Edition with the 12-pin PCIe power connector. Obviously, Nvidia's partners will opt for a dual 8-pin PCIe power connector setup instead.Image 1 of 4GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition(Image credit: Nvidia)The GeForce RTX 3070 Ti gives Nvidia a chance to realign prices with the current market by bumping the price up to $599. It's $100 cheaper than the GeForce RTX 3080, but then performance will also be lower than the 3080.We likely won't see Nvidia's new Ampere offerings at their respective MSRP at retail in sufficient quantities, but unlike graphics cards, dreams are free. We're looking forward to testing and reviewing both the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nGeForce\nGeForce RTX 3080\nGeForce RTX 3070\nrtx\nNVIDIA RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (38)\n\n\n\nZhiye LiuSocial Links NavigationNews Editor and Memory ReviewerZhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

I have my doubts that a software based solution will miraculously be anywhere near as good as a hardware based solution that uses AI, and took years and millions of dollars to properly develop. I mean, it can't hurt, to be sure. I just don't think it's going to be the magic bullet people think it's going to be.

I'm interested to see how it fares when it gets into the hands of people for proper testing.I opt to be optimistic based on the past. See gsync vs freesync and how big of a difference really is to matter the extra $$$ and also how it turned out in the end - nvidia being forced to accept it too.\n\nAlso so far everything AMD said they will accomplish with Ryzen, RDNA1 and 2, they delivered and any marketing materials released before about all these products and the reviews that came after confirmed not only that they did not lie (like nvidia did so many times now), but that the difference was basically margin of error between the marketing materials and 3rd party trustworthy benchmarks.\n\nSo until AMD is caught with a blatant lie or BS at the level of nvidia's BS, I can trust them to deliver what they promise. They have earned it in the past years.\n\nThere is one important factor people should not ignore: FSR is free for everyone. DLSS costs money, you can only have it if you buy an RTX card, and only that way. FSR will work even on consoles, APUs and mobile phones... and since it will work on everything, it's basically a free tech.\n\nThat aspect alone makes FSR already a winner for me vs DLSS.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njeremyj_83\n\n\nThe 3080Ti is to make sure that the 3080 name has higher performance than the 6800XT.

This results in a maximum boost clock range of 1245 MHz to 1710 MHz depending on the configuration. The memory subsystem includes 8 or 16GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus.\n\nWhile this presents a healthy specification bump over the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU, it's substantially different to what you get on a desktop RTX 3080. Nvidia isn't using the same GPU die either: this is GA104 on laptops, rather than the GA102 used for its desktop counterpart. So far, this is the only mobile GPU in the series that differs on the actual GPU die being used.\n\nAs a result, the laptop part features 48 SMs, down from 68 in the desktop, leading to a significant 29% reduction in CUDA core count. Clock speeds can be the same depending on the power level, but we also see a drop from GDDR6X memory to just GDDR6 which brings lower memory bandwidth. Of course, this sort of spec differences make sense as you can't just take a 320W desktop GPU, put it in laptops and call it a day. However these differences can be confusing for less tech savvy buyers to whom it may not be obvious that the desktop and laptop GPUs are drastically different though they have virtually the same name.\nPart of today's review will be comparing the performance of the laptop and desktop variants, but we'll also be showing the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU up against other recent mobile products, so you'll get a good idea how it performs overall.\n\nThe test system for today's benchmarking is the MSI GE76 Raider, a high-end 17\" system equipped with flagship specifications. The model we received from MSI to test, the 10UH, packs the 16GB variant of the RTX 3080 with a power range of 135-155W: base limit at 135W with an extra 20W available through Dynamic Boost 2.0.\nThe GE76 Raider also includes a Core i9-10980HK processor \u2013 11th-gen variants will be available soon, but for now we have 10th-gen data \u2013 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory, and an ample 17.3-inch 1080p 240Hz IPS display. I'm quite a fan of MSI's Raider designs this generation, the build quality is excellent and while this is a bigger laptop, it's not a ridiculously huge system; it retains portability without sacrificing on the cooling necessary for an RTX 3080 and Core i9 CPU.\nToday we are testing the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU at two resolutions: 1080p with Nvidia Optimus enabled, so the display is connected to the iGPU; and 1440p with an external display connected directly to the discrete GPU. Let's get into the benchmarks.\nBenchmarks\n\nFirst up is Metro Exodus. At 1080p using Ultra settings, the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU is able to sustain 119 FPS on average in our benchmark pass which delivers quite a decent high refresh rate experience on modern internal laptop displays. This is 13% faster than the RTX 3070 running at 115W, however it still means the RTX 3080 Laptop falls well short of the RTX 3070 in desktops. At 1080p we're 25% behind the desktop RTX 3080 here.\n\nAt 1440p it's a slightly more positive story for the RTX 3080 in laptops. While the margin to the desktop part has grown compared to at 1080p, the RTX 3080 Laptop is now quite a bit faster than the RTX 3070 Laptop. Now there is a bit of a power discrepancy here, 135W vs 115W, however this does generally appear to be the case in most laptops when you look at how RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 models are configured. In this instance the RTX 3080 is 17% more powerful.\n\nBorderlands 3 is an example of a game that when played at 1080p in a laptop is generally going to be more CPU limited than GPU limited. You can see that here with an instance where the RTX 3070 Laptop configured with a Ryzen 9 5900HX slightly outperforms this RTX 3080 Laptop with the Core i9-10980HK, now Ryzen isn't always faster in CPU limited games than the Core i9 but in this instance it is, so we see performance fall slightly behind. It's important to show these cases as not every game will be GPU limited on your laptop.\n\nAt 1440p we get a much better look at how these GPUs actually stack up for gaming performance when GPU limited. The RTX 3080 Laptop GPU is 18% faster than the RTX 3070 Laptop, and quite a significant 41% faster than the RTX 3060 Laptop. However, the RTX 3080 Laptop still fails to beat the desktop RTX 3070, and overall ends up 16% slower than the desktop RTX 3080 which carries the same name.\n\nIn Red Dead Redemption 2 at 1080p, the RTX 3080 Laptop presents a small performance increase over the RTX 3070, in the range of 10%. In this title at this resolution, it gets demolished by a desktop configuration, coming in 30% slower than the RTX 3080 desktop model and still behind the RTX 3070 for desktops.\n\nAt 1440p the results are quite decent for the RTX 3080 Laptop configuration, closing the gap to the RTX 3070 desktop model and delivering an experience consistently over 60 FPS using High settings. The RTX 3080 Laptop is now 20% faster than the RTX 3070 Laptop which is twice the margin we just saw at 1080p, and while it's still 30% slower than its desktop equivalent, you'll get a decent experience here.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed Valhalla at 1080p, we see a smaller than usual margin between the laptop and desktop variants. Here the laptop model is just 21% slower. We also see a modest but healthy margin between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 for laptops, at 14%, not too bad in this sort of title.\n\nThat margin holds steady at 1440p, but now the RTX 3080 Laptop is within touching distance of the RTX 3070 in the desktop, we're just 5% slower here. Getting essentially the performance of an RTX 2080 Ti in a laptop at just 140W or so is pretty impressive given this sort of performance was not possible with prior generation hardware.\n\nThese days everyone wants to know how a GPU performs in Cyberpunk 2077 so here are the results. The RTX 3080 Laptop GPU comes in 19% faster than the RTX 3070 Laptop at 1080p, one of the largest margins we've seen so far in this GPU heavy game running at ultra settings. As such, the RTX 3080 Laptop is also 32% slower than its desktop counterpart.\n\nAs this title is so GPU demanding we see pretty similar margins pop up when testing at 1440p. Again the margins to desktop cards are not very impressive for the laptop part, however with a few settings tweaks you could easily get this game running at over 60 FPS at 1440p\n\nIn Watch Dogs Legion at 1080p, the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU is providing performance slightly behind an RTX 3070 desktop configuration, and about 15% more frames than an RTX 3070 Laptop GPU. This is again one of the small margins between the desktop and laptop variants, the laptop variant is around 13% slower.\n\nAt 1440p the RTX 3080 Laptop is almost matching the performance of the desktop RTX 3070, so that's not a bad result for a significantly lower power laptop equivalent, although ultimately it still falls well short of what the desktop RTX 3080 can do. Meanwhile, in the laptop space the RTX 3080 performs well, delivering 19% better performance than the RTX 3070 for laptops.\n\nDeath Stranding at 1080p is another title which is CPU limited in modern laptop form factors, as you can see from the results comparing the Core i9 and Ryzen 9 laptops. So this is another good reminder that not all games you play will benefit from the faster RTX 3080 GPU, as at 1080p we are right on the border of being CPU limited. For this sort of game it makes a lot more sense to pick a laptop with a good CPU.\n\nHowever the situation is very different at 1440p. Now there is a more noticeable step up in performance comparing the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU to the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU, a 16% performance increase. The margin to the desktop configurations also shrinks, we're now just 22% slower than the RTX 3080 desktop version, and 12% slower than the RTX 3070.\n\nThe final title we'll be looking at in detail today is Horizon Zero Dawn. This game is GPU limited at 1080p using the Ultimate Quality preset, so again we see about a 15% performance increase moving from the RTX 3070 Laptop to the RTX 3080 Laptop, one of the higher margins in our testing so far. However we are still 26% slower than the desktop equivalent GPU.\n\nAt 1440p it's a fairly similar situation, although to be honest the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU is delivering nearly 100 FPS on average here which is a great result for a laptop GPU given what we've seen from other models available.\nPerformance Comparisons\nBefore jumping into the conclusion, here's a look at some head to head comparisons in a larger range of games.\nRTX 3080 Laptop vs RTX 3070 Laptop\nWhen comparing the RTX 3080 Laptop to the RTX 3070 Laptop in a higher power class, most of the time the 3080 will be delivering between 10 and 15 percent more performance.\n\nHowever at times the platform will be CPU limited, and given the CPU differences here (Ryzen 9 5900HX for the 3070, and Core i9-10980HK for the 3080), we do see slower performance. So that's something to keep in mind.\n\nWhen fully GPU-limited using a 1440p external display hooked up directly to the discrete graphics, we no longer see any instances of being CPU-limited. On average, the RTX 3080 Laptop configuration is 19% faster, so this gives you a good idea of what is possible in the best case scenario. In general though, when you factor in the 1080p results, when GPU-limited you should be seeing performance 10 to 20 percent higher than the lower-tier GPU.\n\nRTX 3080 Laptop vs RTX 3080 Desktop\nIn terms of a laptop vs desktop comparison, at 1080p on average the laptop variant is 25 percent slower. This performance ranges from just a 10% margin right up to 35% depending on the title, and in some of the most GPU demanding games the margin is often around 30%.\n\n\nThat margin is about the same at 1440p, the RTX 3080 Laptop is 25% slower than the RTX 3080 desktop variant.\nRTX 3080 Laptop vs RTX 3070 Desktop\nThat also means the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU is also not able to match the performance of the RTX 3070 desktop GPU: in our testing at 1440p it's 9% slower on average. Based on our prior testing of these desktop GPUs, that would place the RTX 3080 Laptop when running at 135-155W slightly above the RTX 3060 Ti and slightly behind the last-gen RTX 2080 Ti.\n\nObviously the laptop and desktop variants don't deliver the same performance, we've known that for a while now, but this does give us a good look at how the margins stack up. Keep in mind this mobile GPU maximum TGP of 155W, which compares to 200W for the RTX 3060 Ti and 250W for the RTX 2080 Ti, we are seeing quite good efficiency to shave off 50-100W and still maintain that level of performance.\n\nWhat We Learned\nMy overall thoughts on the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU are similar to my thoughts on the RTX 3070 Laptop GPU, and so this section needs to be split in two: first covering laptop GPUs only, and then talking about the desktop comparison.\nPurely talking laptops, the RTX 3080 Laptop provides a decent performance improvement over the RTX 3070 depending on how CPU limited your gaming will be. At 1440p, it's quite good and I think there's enough power available here to deliver a smooth gaming experience on newer laptop displays that are coming out with a 1440p resolution. At times, this GPU is over 40% faster than the RTX 3060 Laptop in the higher power tier (Max-P) which does enable gaming at these higher resolutions.\n\nThis margin between 3070 and 3080 is similar to what we see on the desktop cards, where the 3080 is about 20% faster than the 3070 at 1440p when mostly GPU limited. You just have to make sure you are going to be playing GPU limited titles, as the RTX 3080 is powerful enough to run into bottlenecks at 1080p even with a high-end laptop CPU.\nIt also appears to be possible to get an RTX 3080 Laptop without paying a ridiculous premium. Take the upcoming Gigabyte Aorus 15P, this is just one example, but the RTX 3080 model costs 26% more and also packs double the RAM for what should end up around 15% better performance when GPU limited. That's surprisingly reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, you will run into situations where laptop manufacturers will up-spec the RTX 3080 model and charge a larger premium. That's the case with the new 11th-gen variants of the MSI GE76 Raider that I looked at: the RTX 3070 model with a Core i7 costs $2,600, but going for the RTX 3080 variant also forces you to upgrade to a Core i9 processor, and MSI is charging $3,400 or a 31% premium for that privilege.\nI was also impressed with the efficiency of this part. The RTX 3080 is now giving laptop gamers just below the power of an RTX 2080 Ti in a portable form factor. That is if you completely avoid models that run the GPU at 80W, which will no doubt be far worse and not worth the asking price.\n\nNow, when you compare the RTX 3080 against its desktop equivalent, it gets a bit embarrassing. The laptop GPU is nowhere near the performance of the RTX 3080 on desktops and so these two products should not have the same name.\nIn the configurations I tested, the RTX 3080 desktop card was 33% faster than the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU running in the upper range of its power limits: 135-155W. This margin will only grow with lower power configurations, after all, the RTX 3080 can be used all the way down to 80W.\nNormally this isn't an issue. You would of course expect a high-end desktop GPU to outperform the best laptop GPU simply because a desktop can allocate twice the power budget. But because performance is different - and in this case even the GPU die itself is different - these two products should have distinctly different names to avoid any confusion among buyers.\n\nWe like to explain this for two reasons: the first is that casual buyers may not do a ton of research into the hardware (e.g. non PC enthusiasts buying gaming laptops). The second reason relates to today's market with horrendous GPU pricing. A talking point I've heard several times as of late is that \"you could either buy a GPU for thousands of dollars on the scalper market or just buy a gaming laptop.\" I've even heard some say that gaming laptops are great value now.\nBut we know that's only true if you ignore the performance discrepancy between laptops and desktops. Yes, spending $2,300 on an RTX 3080 laptop is a lot more appealing than spending $2,700 on an RTX 3080 on eBay. But is it more appealing than spending $1,600 on an RTX 3060 Ti or RTX 3070? But wait... it's not like anyone is recommending you buy a desktop card right now.\nHistorically, laptops have never been as good value as desktops for gaming, but it's interesting to see this still playing out today despite reasonably normal laptop prices and awful graphics card prices.\nTo conclude, I'll put it this way... the RTX 3080 Laptop GPU falls short in the desktop vs. laptop comparison, but the \"RTX 3080 M\" is a genuinely great laptop GPU. You can get RTX 2080 Ti-like performance in a portable system and that's simply fantastic.\nShopping Shortcuts\n\nGeForce RTX 3080 Laptops on Amazon\nMSI GE76 Raider RTX 3080 on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3070 Laptops on Amazon\nGeForce RTX 3060 Laptops on Amazon\nIntel Core i7 Tiger Lake Laptops on Amazon\nRyzen 7 5800H Laptops on Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n If you enjoy our content, please consider subscribing.\n \n\nAd-free TechSpot experience while supporting our work\nOur promise: All reader contributions will go toward funding more content\nThat means: More tech features, more benchmarks and analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGENDS OF TECH\nApple iMac: The Computer That Saved the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH TRIVIA\nWi-Fi 7 is expected to bring all of these improvements over Wi-Fi 6, except...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH CULTURE\nYouTube at 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WEB\nAll Amazon Alexa recordings will now go to the cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\nThe State of the GPU:All Fake MSRPs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Comments: 6\n\n\n Got something to say?

At least that's what the rumour mill says: The Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti will arrive June 3, and the RTX 3070 Ti will follow June 10.Nvidia has confirmed neither card directly, but WCCFTech claims to have information pertaining to the release of both rumoured 30-series cards, and cites those two release dates.The dates also tally with previous rumours that suggest the same timeline, so pending a last-minute shake up it sounds as though we'll see these cards make an appearance around Computex, which kicks off June 1.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nYour next chance to secure an RTX 50-series graphics card at launch could be a 16 GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti next month\n\n\n\n\nA European storefront listing suggests the RTX 5070 Ti may be launching on February 20 and there might actually be a good reason to believe it\n\n\n\nBoth cards have been floating in the ether for a long while now, although may have morphed and changed since the beginning of the year. The RTX 3080 Ti, especially, has metamorphosed from a proposed GA102-250 GPU into the GA102-225 card reported before you now, which comes with fewer cores and less VRAM. That is still said to house 80 SMs for a total of 10,240 CUDA Cores, which is a whole lot by anyone's making.Your next upgrade(Image credit: Future)Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the restThe RTX 3070 Ti will likely feature the GA104 GPU found in the RTX 3070 through to the RTX 3060 Ti and mobile RTX 3080. We're again left taking guesses as to the exact specification, but a 6,144 CUDA Core config seems likely here.Prices are even more speculative at this time, although the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT's $999 price tag may offer some indication of the rough whereabouts for the RTX 3080 Ti.\u00a0We can roughly guess the RTX 3070 Ti's price, too. The RTX 3070 costs $499 and the RTX 3080 $699, which means the RTX 3070 Ti will inevitably fall between the two. We can hope for $549, but $579 to match the RX 6800 seems fitting, too. If Nvidia really feels it has the performance to best the Radeon by a margin, a $599 price tag isn't out of the question, either.The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJacob RidleySocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, HardwareJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Already a fixture on the vanilla GeForce RTX 3060 since it\u2019s launch, NVIDIA has begun incorporating their hash limiting technology and its associated security stack into newly manufacture red GeForce RTX 3080, 3070, and 3060 Ti cards. The new cards will appear on shelves later this month, and will carry the \u201cLHR\u201d branding to differentiate themselves from the first-generation, unthrottled cards.\nWe\u2019ve been covering the ongoing matter of NVIDIA and Ethereum mining for several months now, as the company has worked to deal with the unexpected (and largely unmanageable) surge in video card demand that has come as the price of Ethereum tokens has exploded. Even with the cryptocurrency down almost 20% in a week, Ethereum mining is still quite profitable on NVIDIA cards. Which in turn has contributed to an unprecedented and sustained spike in demand for video cards that NVIDIA (and AMD) are unable to meet.\nIn order to make their cards less useful to miners \u2013 and to try to shift shipments back to gaming customers \u2013 NVIDIA began rolling out an Ethereum hash limiter, starting with their GeForce RTX 3060 card back in February. NVIDIA\u2019s hash limiter throttles a card\u2019s Ethereum mining performance to 50% of its native rate, reducing (though not eliminating) a card\u2019s usefulness and profitability for mining. Overall, this initial rollout did not go quite as planned thanks to an unforced error on NVIDIA\u2019s part that partially disabled the throttle. But it clearly has not deterred NVIDIA as they have continued to refine their hash limiter and, now, are expanding it to other cards.\nTo that end, NVIDIA is adding the hash limiter to new GeForce RTX 3080, 3070, and 3060 Ti cards. As always, the company isn\u2019t sharing much in the way of technical details, but it looks like this is the same hash limiter that is going into revised GeForce RTX 3060 cards, which began shipping in the middle of this month. Key among that technology is an updated vBIOS that requires a minimum driver version \u2013 466.71 in the case of hash-limited 3080/3070/3060Ti cards \u2013 preventing their use with older drivers that lack throttling capabilities. Through the combination of the revised vBIOS and drivers, NVIDIA in turn is able to detect and limit the Ethereum hashing performance of these new cards.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Release Info\n\n\n\u00a0\nOriginal\nLHR/Revised\n\n\nRTX 3090\n09/2020\n-\n\n\nRTX 3080\n09/2020\nLate May\n\n\nRTX 3070\n10/2020\nLate May\n\n\nRTX 3060 Ti\n12/2020\nLate May\n\n\nRTX 3060*\n02/2021\nMid May\n\n\n\n*RTX 3060 shipped with an earlier version of NVIDIA's hash limiter\nMeanwhile, these new cards will be receiving additional labeling to differentiate them from the original generation of unthrottled cards. Calling this throttling feature \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d, or \u201cLHR\u201d, according to NVIDIA there will be LHR branding/information put on the relevant product boxes as well as on retail websites. Ostensibly, this is to communicate to buyers that the cards are hash-limited, but at the same time it\u2019s likely that this branding is required for legal reasons as well, as NVIDIA is introducing an additional limitation that was not present on the original generation of cards.\nThis is a slightly different branding strategy from how they\u2019ve handled the RTX 3060, owing in large part to the RTX 3060 shipping with a hash limiter from day one. In the case of the RTX 3060, even when NVIDIA began shipping revised cards earlier this month no branding changes were needed, and few (if any) RTX 3060 cards mention being hash rate limited. With that said, we\u2019ve already seen Gigabyte accidentally publish and then pull RTX 3060 product pages that mention LHR as well, so we may see NVIDIA\u2019s board partners use the LHR branding across their entire GeForce product lines in order to be consistent.\nEthereum performance aside, NVIDIA says that the upcoming LHR GeForce cards are functionally identical to the original generation GeForce 30 series cards as far as compute and gaming performance go. For our part, we have not seen the Ethereum throttle trigger in other use cases on the RTX 3060, so we\u2019re not expecting different behavior on the more powerful GeForce cards. For better or worse, Ethereum has a very distinct workload (memory bandwidth bound and comprised almost entirely of random-access operations), so it\u2019s rather easy to tell apart from games and even other compute workloads.\nFinally, the GeForce RTX 3090, NVIDIA\u2019s flagship GeForce 30-series card, will be the odd man out as far as the LHR changes go. NVIDIA is not issuing an LHR version of that card, owing to the fact that the $1500 MSRP card\u2019s rate of return isn\u2019t nearly as high as the likes of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3060 Ti, making it relatively less popular with miners.\n\nAs with the launch of throttled RTX 3060 cards, NVIDIA says that they are doing this to better ensure that GeForce cards make it to gamers, as opposed to being conscripted into mining farms. Overall, this is part of a larger overall NVIDIA strategy to respond to the rise of Ethereum and the resulting crush of demand in the short term and the long term. Ideally, NVIDIA would like to shift Ethereum miners over to their CMP series of dedicated mining cards, which fetch higher prices don\u2019t (directly) compete with GeForce cards. Meanwhile, reducing the number of GeForce cards going into mining means those cards don\u2019t boomerang back on to the second-hard market once the Ethereum mining bubble does pop, thereby avoiding the kind of supply glut that lead to the crypto-hangover of 2018.\nWrapping things up, the revised LHR GeForce 30-series cards are already in production, and will begin shipping to retailers later this month. Given how quickly video cards of all flavors have been selling, the remaining unthrottled cards should quickly sell out. At which point we expect that NVIDIA\u2019s anti-Ethereum measures will truly be put to the test, as miners will be facing their own supply shortages.\n\n\n                Source:\n                NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n47 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nZoZo - Tuesday, May 18, 2021 - link\n\"NVIDIA says that they are doing this to better ensure that GeForce cards make it to gamers, as opposed to being conscripted into mining farms.\"That's definitely not their main motivation, by far. The main motivation is to get miners to stop buying GeForce cards, so that when the mining bubble crashes, NVIDIA won't have to compete with a flood of used latest-generation cards, which would result in a significant dive in sales and therefore benefits.\n\n\n\nlilkwarrior - Tuesday, May 18, 2021 - link\nIt can be a legitimate latent function of this; there's not exactly one sole reason for this you know. \n\n\n\nZingam - Tuesday, May 18, 2021 - link\nThey could push for faster adoption of RT and I guess RT acceleration ought not be useful for mining\n\n\n\nStevoLincolnite - Tuesday, May 18, 2021 - link\nDid that happen with the last Crypto boom though? I don't recall much in the way of a flood of GPU's on the 2nd hand market.\n\n\n\nMarlin1975 - Tuesday, May 18, 2021 - link\nYea it was not a long/multi-year thing. But I got my RX580 for $100 because of it.Right now COVID put a lot of people at home so they can do mining like this and those that mine can do more as they can watch the systems more now. \n\n\n\nDanNeely - Wednesday, May 19, 2021 - link\nI got a pair of cheap 1070's in dec 2018 during the last slump.\n\n\n\nSpunjji - Wednesday, May 19, 2021 - link\nNvidia missed their quarterly targets because of it. Of course, that may also be because they seem to have predicted the effects of the mining boom to go on for longer than they did... it's not entirely clear, tbh.\n\n\n\nimaheadcase - Wednesday, May 19, 2021 - link\nThe last major boom was only for AMD cards though, i forget exact tech wise, but they had something that did mining better than nvidia cards at the time so they was completely sold out.  Which didn't effect %90 of pc gamers \n\n\n\nGoldenBullet - Thursday, May 20, 2021 - link\nAMD was preferred but nvidia gpus were fine for mining too. \n\n\n\nGoldenBullet - Thursday, May 20, 2021 - link\nMy bro mined and I sold 15k of his gpus on eBay and Kijiji in 2019.

These GPUs deliver massive time savings for freelancers and creatives specializing in video editing, 3D animation or architectural visualization.\nIn addition, HP and Acer announced new NVIDIA Studio laptops with GeForce RTX 30 Series and NVIDIA RTX professional GPUs, including the latest 11th Gen Intel mobile processors.\nFinally, the latest NVIDIA Omniverse app, Machinima, is now in beta, fully supported by the latest NVIDIA Studio drivers.\nExpand Your Creative Arsenal\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti GPUs deliver incredible leaps in performance and fidelity. The powerhouse 3080 Ti is ideal for high-end content creation thanks to its faster clocks and 12GB of superfast GDDR6X video memory.\nThe 3080 Ti shines in heavy-rendering workloads, where it can make full use of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, including second-generation RT Cores and third generation Tensor Cores, as well as performance gains from NVIDIA DLSS, to get the job done fast. And it\u2019s ideal for high-end video editing, especially 8K HDR RAW footage.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Ti turbocharges the popular RTX 3070 by giving it more CUDA cores and super-speedy GDDR6 video memory. Content creators will enjoy faster texture loading times, making the 3070 Ti a great choice for 3D rendering and video editing with up to 6K HDR RAW footage.\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be available on June 3 starting at $1,199, and the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti will be available next week starting at $599.\nMore Studio Laptop Options for Content Creation \nHP, Acer and MSI are offering new NVIDIA Studio laptops powered by the latest GeForce RTX 30 Series and NVIDIA RTX Professional GPUs, and the latest 11th Gen Intel mobile processors.\n\nHP\u2019s refreshed Envy 15 and Envy 14 feature elegant designs and fantastic, color-calibrated displays. For students and commuters, the Envy 14 packs the power of NVIDIA Studio in an ultra-portable creator laptop, powered with a GeForce RTX 3050 or 3050 Ti GPU. For creators who want more power, the Envy 15, which can include up to a GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU, is perfect for video editing thanks to its larger display and video memory.\n\nAcer is updating the ConceptD creator lineup with the new ConceptD 3 Ezel, the all-metal ConceptD 5 laptop and the ConceptD 7 Ezel flagship. The ConceptD 7 Ezel features up to a GeForce RTX 3080 and the Pro model up to an NVIDIA RTX A5000 Laptop GPU, and Acer\u2019s patented adjustable 15.6-inch 4K PANTONE-validated touchscreen display. The lineup has a wide selection of GPU options for any type of creator, ranging from the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti up to RTX 3080, and with options for professional GPUs such as the NVIDIA RTX A5000.\n\nMSI\u2019s Creator Z16, Creator 17, WS66 and WS76 units have joined the NVIDIA Studio program. The Creator Z16 is an elegant and premium laptop powered by a GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU. It sports a striking postmodern design with a True Pixel display with QHD+ resolution, DCI-P3 100 percent color gamut, factory-calibrated Delta-E <2 out of the box accuracy.\n\n\nOmniverse Machinima Now in Beta\nGaming has been an inspiration to digital creators and artists for decades. Machinima, an art form started in the \u201990s, uses real-time 3D technologies with game assets, visual effects and character animation to create short, humorous clips, or full-length movies. Using the latest RTX technologies, NVIDIA built Omniverse Machinima, an application that lets people collaborate in real time and create amazing animated video game stories.\n\nCreators can import their own game assets or draw from Omniverse\u2019s growing library, including content from Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, Squad! and iconic NVIDIA tech demos. Advanced physics effects like destruction or fire can be applied with NVIDIA\u2019s PhysX 5, Blast and Flow. Animate character movements using only a webcam with wrnch\u2019s AI Pose and use simple audio tracks to animate character faces with Omniverse Audio2Face.\nUpon completion, creators can access the Omniverse RTX Renderer for the highest quality output, enhanced with real-time ray tracing and referenced path tracing for interactive, bleeding-edge visuals.\n\nTry out the Omniverse Machinima open beta and show us what you can do.\nAll Backed by NVIDIA Studio\nThese new GPUs and NVIDIA Studio laptops benefit from the RTX acceleration and optimization of the NVIDIA Studio ecosystem:\n\nPerformance optimization in hundreds of creator apps, including 70+ apps optimized for RTX ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS.\nNVIDIA Studio Drivers, optimized for content creation to provide the best performance and stability.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\n\n\nAt CES 2021, Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3060, bringing the Ampere architecture to its lowest price point yet. With it, Team Green is hoping to convince folks who have been faithfully using the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 for the last five years to upgrade to Ampere. But is it really the right time to upgrade? Well, as always, it\u2019s complicated.\u00a0According to the latest Steam Hardware Survey, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 is still the most popular graphics card among Steam users, with a full 9.38% of all Steam users sporting the aging graphics card.\u00a0This is a little misleading, as it\u2019s dependent on independent Steam users, so communal PCs in places like LAN cafes are overrepresented \u2013 and since it\u2019s optional, it doesn\u2019t represent the entirety of Steam\u2019s userbase (nor PC gamers in total). But, it\u2019s still impossible to deny the popularity of that graphics card \u2013 and it's popular for good reason.\u00a0\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nThe best cheap graphics card in 2025: my favorite GPUs for those on a budget\n\n\n\n\nI haven't been this excited about PC gaming in decades \u2013 and it's all thanks to my early time with Nvidia's RTX 5070\n\n\n\nWhen the GTX 1060 came out, it was able to handle pretty much every game on the market at 1080p with high quality settings and solid frame rates. Five years later, that efficiency has started to wane, especially with new games that are also being released on the PS5 and Xbox Series X.\u00a0The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 has basically the same sales pitch, only this time you can add ray tracing and DLSS to the mix. But is it the right product for people holding on to their older cards?\u00a0Find out where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3060 vs GTX 1060 price\u00a0When Nvidia launched its RTX 2000 series of graphics cards based on the Turing architecture, the company faced a lot of criticism for substantially raising the prices across its lineup. Unfortunately, now that the RTX 3060 is here, it looks like that\u2019s not going to change any time soon.\u00a0The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is starting at $329 (\u00a3299, AU$729), making it the cheapest Nvidia Ampere graphics card yet. The closest right now is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which is a tad more expensive at $399 (about \u00a3299, AU$540).Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.When compared to the last generation, this falls largely in line with where you would find the Nvidia RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2060. Things change drastically once you look at the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, though.\u00a0Pascal-generation graphics cards were the last time graphics cards were affordable for a lot of people, with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 starting at $249 for third-party cards, and $299 for Nvidia\u2019s own Founder\u2019s Edition. That means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is nearly a hundred bucks or quid more expensive. If you don\u2019t have more disposable income than you did five years ago when you bought the GTX 1060, the higher asking price for the Nvidia RTX 3060 could understandably be a deal breaker.\u00a0Today's best Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 deals176 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $239View $349.99View No price informationCheck WalmartShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Nvidia)Nvidia RTX 3060 vs GTX 1060 specs\u00a0Once you take a glance at the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 spec sheet, that $80 jump in starting price might start to look a little less heinous.\u00a0The RTX 3060 has double the VRAM \u2013 we\u2019re not counting the 3GB version of the GTX 1060 \u2013 at 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit bus. For comparison\u2019s sake, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB has, well, 6GB of GDDR5, also on a 192-bit bus. But that\u2019s not what makes the RTX 3060 up to 2.2x more powerful than the GTX 1060.\u00a0Packed with 3,584 CUDA cores, 48 ROPs and 112 texture mapping units (TMPs), the RTX 3060 is a massive jump in raw silicon over the GTX 1060. The 2016 graphics card, by comparison, has 1,280 CUDA cores, 80 TMUs and 48 ROPs.\u00a0Along with a higher Total Graphics Power (TGP) rating of 170W vs 120W, the RTX 3060 is a much more powerful piece of hardware on paper. So, while the RTX 3060 is significantly more expensive this time around, you are getting an incredibly powerful graphics card, especially when you compare it with the GTX 1060.\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3060 vs GTX 1060 performance\u00a0A spec sheet might be fun to look at and say something like \u201chey, look, these numbers are higher than the other numbers\u201d, but ultimately it doesn\u2019t mean much if the real-world performance doesn\u2019t match up. And, well, it kind of does here.\u00a0For our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review, we tested the GTX 1060 against it, and found that the new card is up to 220% faster in some games.\u00a0One such game is Dirt 5, where at 1080p, the new RTX 3060 was able to pull 84 fps on Ultra High settings, while the GTX 1060 was stuck at 38 fps. That game is definitely a next-generation title, and it\u2019s clear that the GTX 1060 starts to falter in today\u2019s most advanced games. Red Dead Redemption 2 sees similar results, with the RTX 3060 pulling 53 fps to the GTX 1060\u2019s 23 fps at 1080p. Similarly, in Watch Dogs Legion, even without ray tracing, the RTX 3060 pulls 60 fps, while the GTX 1060 is stuck at 29.\u00a0But even in older titles, where the GTX 1060 probably has the most faithful users, it\u2019s still falling behind. In Final Fantasy XIV, an MMO from 2014 that continues to get more and more popular, the GTX 1060 is more than playable at 1080p with maximum settings, holding a respectable 96 fps average. That\u2019s high, but the 164 fps average that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 holds in the same game with the same settings sets it up for high refresh gaming, which is definitely useful in that game\u2019s challenging Extreme Trials and Savage Raids.\u00a0Today's best Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 deals954 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 $372.81View $384.69View $699ViewShow moreWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)Nvidia RTX 3060 vs GTX 1060: should you upgrade?\u00a0So, yeah, the GeForce RTX 3060 is way faster than the GTX 1060, but that should have been obvious \u2013 five years have passed since the 1060 came out, after all. But whether or not the RTX 3060 is the right graphics card for you is going to be complicated, and highly dependent on the games you play and how much money you have to spend on a graphics card right now.\u00a0If you\u2019re just playing games like Destiny 2, World of Warcraft or Rainbow Six Siege and you\u2019re happy with your performance, you probably don\u2019t need to drop hundreds of dollars on a new graphics card. That obviously changes if you play these games competitively, but if you\u2019re fine just playing the game with friends, your experience probably won\u2019t fundamentally change just because you get 200 fps vs 90 fps.\u00a0However, if your favorite games are the ones you play yourself with the pretty eye-candy turned on, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 starts to make more sense. Whether or not you\u2019re on board with Nvidia\u2019s ray traced future, games are getting harder to run, as naturally happens when a new generation of consoles comes out. Trust us, playing Cyberpunk 2077 isn\u2019t going to be a great experience on 5-year-old hardware.\u00a0You can\u2019t discuss any of this right now without talking about availability, though. Right now, graphics cards are selling out immediately, being sold through third party retailers and resellers for prices that are way higher than Nvidia intended. If you already have a working GTX 1060, and you\u2019re getting by, it\u2019s definitely not worth buying a new graphics card if it means paying hyper-inflated prices for it. The current stock situation will end eventually, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u00a0And, hey, maybe when GPU prices are reasonable again, Nvidia might put out a graphics card that falls within the same price window as the original GeForce GTX 1060 \u2013 and that will be an upgrade which will be much easier to recommend.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSee more Computing News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie ThomasSocial Links NavigationJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN.

If you have one of these set-top boxes under your TV, here are some tips and tricks to make the most out of it.  1. Attach a keyboard and mouse Attaching a keyboard and mouse to your Nvidia Shield TV device can make entering passwords and search terms much easier, as well as improve the gaming experience in many titles. If you\u2019ve got a model with USB ports, you should be able to plug peripherals straight into the back of the device and start using them after a few seconds. Every Shield TV model supports wireless Bluetooth connections. You can add a keyboard and mouse this way via Remotes & Accessories and Add accessory in the Settings menu. Anecdotally, some input devices seem to work better than others, so it\u2019s worth researching keyboards and mice that are known to function properly with the Shield TV boxes.\n\n\n  2. Find your remote If you have one of the newest models of the Nvidia Shield TV or the Nvidia Shield TV Pro with the triangular-shaped remote, you can get it to make an audible beep if you\u2019ve lost it. This is easiest on the cylindrical Nvidia Shield TV, where you can just press the dedicated remote finder button above the HDMI port to get the remote to beep. On the Nvidia Shield TV Pro, you need to open Settings and choose Remotes & Accessories, SHIELD accessories, SHIELD remote 1, and Find this remote. As you\u2019ve lost the remote, obviously, you\u2019ll need to get to this menu by plugging in a mouse (see above) or by using the Android TV Remote Control app for Android or iOS to control the Shield TV.\n\n\n\n Screenshot: Android TV  3. Remap the remote If you don\u2019t like the default functions of the remote control that came with your Nvidia Shield TV for whatever reason, then you can change them around. The Menu button (the three horizontal lines) can be reprogrammed out of the box: From Settings, choose Remotes & Accessories, then Customize Menu button to pick a new function. For the rest of the buttons, including that one with the Netflix label on it, you need to install the ever-useful Button Mapper on your device. We\u2019ve used this on many different pieces of Android hardware, and it\u2019ll let you remap any button on the remote. Some buttons can be edited for free, while others require a paid upgrade before they become accessible.\n\n\n\n 4. Rearrange the home screen You don\u2019t have to settle for the default look of the Android TV home screen on the Nvidia Shield TV. Make sure your favorite apps and content are front and center and you can spend less time scrolling and more time watching (or playing). For example, select an app from the main list on the left, then navigate left to find the Move and Remove options. Long pressing the select button in the navigation wheel is helpful here. On the main favorite app list row at the top, for instance, it lets you move the position of an app shortcut or hide it from this row completely. Meanwhile, you can scroll all the way to the bottom of the home screen and select Customize channels to choose which apps you see.  Screenshot: Android TV  5. Quickly switch between apps If you\u2019re serious about your binge watching then you might often want to switch between different streaming apps. The Nvidia Shield TV offers a quick and intuitive way to do this, though it\u2019s not immediately obvious\u2014if you double-tap on the home button (with the white circle icon in it), you\u2019ll bring up a quick switch screen showing recently opened apps.\n\n\n\n 6. Take screenshots of games and more Should you have to snap something on the screen of your Nvidia Shield TV, you can do this with a long press of the home (white circle) button. First of all though, you need to enable this overlay: From the main Settings screen, pick Device Preferences, System, and turn the Nvidia Share option to On.  Screenshot: Android TV  7. Tweak the external brightness and internal performance If the green LED swish on the front of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro is a little bit too bright for your tastes, you can easily dim it. Open up Settings then choose Device Preferences, System and LED brightness, and you can pick from High, Medium, Low, or Off. If the box is causing an unnaturally bright glow in your room, then this is how you can fix it.\n\n\n\nOn the same System menu in Device Preferences, you can adjust the Processor mode setting to either Max performance or Optimized. You might want to turn this down if you want to save on the energy your box is using up\u2014you only really need the high performance mode if you\u2019re running games locally from the Nvidia Shield TV device itself.  8. Enable GameStream The Nvidia Shield TV is an excellent gaming machine. Not only can it tap into the GeForce Now cloud streaming service, but it can also stream games from a compatible Windows PC somewhere else on the local network using a feature called GameStream. Open up the Nvidia Games app on your Shield TV, and GameStream PCs is on the Settings row. You need to do some prep work on your Windows computer as well, assuming it meets the standards for compatibility (most GTX and RTX GPUs are going to work). You need to have the latest GeForce drivers installed, and the GeForce Experience utility running. In that utility\u2019s settings, make sure GameStream is enabled on the Shield page.\n\n\n\n Screenshot: Android TV  9. Sideload Android apps You won\u2019t find all the Google Play Store apps available on the Nvidia Shield TV, because they haven\u2019t all been optimized for Android TV. To get other apps on board the device, you need to sideload them, which is actually easier than it used to be. Numerous apps can help you out with this, but one of our favorites for the job is the freemium File Commander. You can use Google Drive via File Commander to move APK (Android Application Package) files over to the Nvidia box. Get the APK for any app from a trusted, recognized source like APKMirror. The first time you try and open an APK in File Commander, Android TV will prompt you to confirm that the file manager is authorized to install \u201cunknown apps.\u201d  10. Test out AI upscaling The latest Nvidia Shield TV models do an impressive job of scaling up lower resolution video sources by default, but they also offer an \u2018AI enhanced\u2019 upscaling option that attempts to intelligently insert detail into frames as well as making them larger. It can improve a lot of videos, and you can even do a side-by-side comparison on your device. From the device Settings screen, choose AI upscaling, then pick AI-Enhanced. There are three levels of enhancement to pick from High, Medium, and Low. Make sure to also turn on the Enable demo mode toggle switch to begin with, which lets you press the Menu button on the remote (the three horizontal lines, top right) to see a side-by-side view.\n\n\n\nAndroidComputingGeForce NowNetflixNvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\n\n\r\n          Select\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\n\n\r\n          Select\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\nSign me up\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            io9Movies\n          \n\n\n          Stephen King\u2019s Cujo Gets an Unexpected Yet Exciting Director\n        \n\n          Darren Aronofsky, director of Black Swan and The Wrestler, is circling the Netflix remake.\n        \n\n\n\n    By\n    \n      Germain Lussier    \n\n\n      Published March 18, 2025\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            io9Television\n          \n\n\nWitch Watch Might Be 2025\u2019s Comfy Rom-Com Anime\n        \n\n          She was a witch.
