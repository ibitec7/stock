Jim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their \u201cstaying power\u201d despite the odds. \u201cWe\u2019re back. That\u2019s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.\u201d  Cramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding. \u201cThis rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There\u2019s a lot of money going around, and we know there\u2019s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won\u2019t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.\u201d  For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Talking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer talked about the much-awaited Blackwell chips: \u201cThey are so powerful, so fast. These guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business out of thin air. It wasn\u2019t possible before, but now it can do incredible things, and very soon it will be both faster and better.\u201d  Cramer also talked about the demand NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs NVIDIA for self-driving cars.\u201d  Nvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.   Story Continues Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Of course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

Maleha Afzal   October 18, 2024 5 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.43%       We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. Another 50 bps Cut is Still Restrictive The labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy. Cohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.  Cohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive. Portfolio Manager Highlights High Growth Sectors As the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his expectations of the market. Expectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.  This year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions. Now that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. Our Methodology To find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179Analyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 11%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), also referred to as the AI star, is one of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. The chip maker is also a provider of cloud services and gaming products.The company is rapidly growing and garnering attention from across the globe to the point that it has the power to influence financial markets. Such can be attributed to its advancements in technology and its strategic partnerships. Recently the company closed a deal with Salesforce and also launched a new AI tool to meet the needs of the next generation of mobiles, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G. On October 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with TSMC to push the limits for the next generation of advanced semiconductor chips using Nvidia\u2019s computational lithography platform.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to generate $32.5 billion in revenue during the fiscal third quarter of 2024. This revenue is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips. By the end of this year, the company is also expected to ramp up production for the chips.There is no denying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a crucial role to play in the artificial intelligence industry, which explains why 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024. Analysts\u2019 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 111% upside from current levels.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

Wall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a \u2018substantial majority\u2019 of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.  The broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank\u2019s next meeting in November. However, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth. She noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas. Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month: This Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let\u2019s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m a little hesitant for investors to dive in.  Earlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to \u2018buy the dip\u2019, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.   Story Continues Adam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast.With that said, let\u2019s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s share price has surged by over 2000% over the last five years, driven by robust demand for graphics processing units (GPU) and AI models. It is the go-to company for firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they increase spending on artificial intelligence, which has been a significant catalyst behind the company\u2019s growth.The software and fabless company had another strong quarter in Q2 2024, with revenues soaring 122% from last year to $30 billion. Net income for the quarter stood at $16.6 billion, which enabled NVIDIA to beat earnings forecasts as it posted an EPS of $0.68, against projections of $0.645. The company attributed these solid results in Q2 to increased demand for data center chips.NVIDIA anticipates a revenue of $32.5 billion in Q3, with gross margin in the range of 74.4% and 75%. It also expects a strong performance from its Blackwell and Hopper Architecture products during the back half of 2024. Wall Street analysts have a consensus on the stock\u2019s Strong Buy rating and project an upside potential of over 8% in NVIDIA\u2019s share price. However, if growth fails to meet forecasts, that could result in a downturn in the share\u2019s value.Most investors remain bullish on the stock. It is also one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s database for Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds had investments in the company. Here is what Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure. Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Bob Karr   October 20, 2024 7 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.43%          We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks with lowest short interest to buy. A report from S3 Partners revealed that the rally in Chinese stocks as a result of stimulus measures cost traders who were betting against the US-listed shares ~$6.9 billion in mark-to-market losses. Benchmark CSI 300 index saw an increase of more than ~22% over the past month. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon index went up by over ~34% during the same period. Much of these increases were seen off the back of policy-easing measures.  S3 Partners went on to say that, before this market rally, short sellers continued to build their positions profitably in the falling market. However, after the rebound, the short selling in the group slowed. Before China announced the stimulus plans, shorting the Chinese stocks was a popular strategy, with several market players going underweight in the sector. Short Selling in Q2 2024 S3 Partners reported that short interest in the US/Canada markets went up by $57.9 billion, or 5.1%, to $1.20 trillion in Q2 2024. The increase comprised $73.9 billion of new short selling, which was partially offset by a\u00a0$16.0 billion fall in the mark-to-market value of shares shorted.\u00a0During the quarter, the sectors that saw the largest increase in short selling were the IT, Industrials, and Communication Services sectors. On the other hand, the Energy sector was the only sector that saw a decrease in shares shorted (short covering). Short Sellers Reduced Their Positions in This Sector S&P Global reported that short sellers decided to pull back their bets against consumer staples stocks on the US exchanges during the summer months. This comes amidst the general increase in overall short interest throughout equities. Recent data suggests that the short interest in the consumer staples sector declined to 3.87% at the end of August from 4.16% at the end of May. The decline in short interest against consumer staples stocks might be due to the decline in inflation. On the other hand, short interest in the industrial sector went up by 21 bps from the end of May to the end of August, rose 20 basis points in the healthcare sector, and jumped 19 basis points in the real estate sector, as per the company. With the expectations of further rate cuts, market experts opine that the consumer staples sector might see sustained demand. The consumer spending resulted in solid Q2 2024 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% (annualized), approximately double the rate of Q1 growth, as per the US Bank.   Story Continues After the rate cut in September, market strategists recommended going long on consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. This is because these sectors are expected to\u00a0receive a boost as declining mortgage rates might benefit spending, reported Reuters.Therefore, with the expectations of lower inflation and interest rates, there can be some revival in consumer confidence. This should result in increased spending on staple goods, which might lead to improved performance in the consumer staple sector. As per Evercore, among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples and consumer discretionary have seen the best average performance, with both sectors gaining ~14% a year after the rate cut.Our MethodologyTo list 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy, we used a Finviz screener to extract the list of stocks having the\u00a0lowest short interest. Next, we narrowed down our list to the following 8 stocks having short interest of less than 2%. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the descending of their short interest.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The healthy demand for the company\u2019s Hopper GPU computing platform, together with growth in InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, should continue to fuel its financial performance over the near term.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s CUDA software platform and system software capabilities are expected to act as primary differentiators. The company continues to focus on expanding its presence in enterprise and edge computing markets. Its AI Foundry and NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) offerings target simplifying AI rollouts for enterprises, opening up new revenue streams as and when businesses adopt AI technologies.Despite the competitive pressures, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s technological lead and ecosystem advantages should help it maintain market leadership over the next few years. Analysts at Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares of the company, issuing a $200.00 target price on 29th August.Vltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the less reliable those estimates are. So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the stocks with lowest short interest to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.8% in the morning session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected.  Management noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025. Lastly, ASML's CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region. ASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Nvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock gained 5.2% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years. The Fed\u2014under Chair Jerome Powell\u2014began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.   Story Continues Putting it all together, the announcement and outlook provided a breath of fresh air and a clearer view of the Fed's monetary policy stance, which the market has been waiting for with bated breath. If there's anything the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty.As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.Nvidia is up 174% since the beginning of the year, and at $131.93 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $138.07 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,870.Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.

In this piece, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) sits on the fund managers' radar. The surge in interest surrounding artificial intelligence has meant that the stock market in 2024 has continued to surprise. Just like most Wall Street analysts were left scratching their heads after worries of a recession proved to be unfounded, this year, analysts have continued to revise their year end targets of the flagship S&P index multiple times. Take the example of investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its latest index year end target was released in October, and as of now, the bank believes that the index will close at 6,000 points by the end of this year.  Before the October target, the bank had upped its year end estimate to 5,600 points in June. This was based on optimism for big tech stocks and the rush surrounding AI that continued to fuel them. This had added 400 points to the previous target of 5,200 points which was released in February, and this in turn had added 100 points to the previous upward revision of 5,100 over the first Goldman Sachs S&P year end target of 4,700 points. Safe to say, the market has beaten expectations in 2024. Its recent value of 5,832 points leaves it just 2.8% shy of Goldman\u2019s latest 2024 estimate. The index is up by 23.6% year to date, and to see just how much its returns have been driven by artificial intelligence, consider the fact that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange\u2019s semiconductor stock index is up 27.8% year to date. AI, and particularly semiconductor stocks, continue to make their mark and the key question now is whether this performance will be sustained after the third quarter earnings season.  The Q2 season was nothing short of fireworks for some of the biggest AI names. Two firms in particular come to mind when we reminisce. The first is Wall Street\u2019s AI darling which is known for making the best AI GPUs in the world, and the second is the firm behind Windows OS that has invested billions of dollars in the AI upstart OpenAI.\u00a0 Both these stocks did well in the first half of 2024 but pared back some of their gains in H2. Starting from the GPU company, its stock is up 186% year to date. However, from the peak in June which had marked 181% in YTD gains back then, the shares are up by a modest 1.84%. For the software company, the shares peaked at 26% year to date returns before the Q2 earnings season, and since the peak, they are down 10.4%.   Story Continues The difference in their share price appreciation isn\u2019t surprising even though it might appear to be so. Simply put, the reason the GPU maker has posted stronger returns is its products are the immediate need of the AI industry. On the other hand, the software company\u2019s products are part of a later wave of AI which counts upon strong demand for AI products within the business world to enable it to turn a profit. Turning a profit is key since it has already invested billions of dollars into OpenAI.

Research from BofA covering their performance for the first quarter shows that 64% of actively managed large cap US mutual funds beat their benchmarks. This was a sizeable jump over 38% of funds beating the benchmarks last year, with the bank speculating that a broadening of equities performance was part of the reason driving the returns. A study from The Wall Street Journal adds to this. It looks at the performance of large cap growth funds during H1 2024 and shares that the Magnificent 7 stocks drove large cap growth funds to the top of the mutual fund pyramid. The survey looked at 1,218 funds to determine that just 15% were in the red, with the average 12 month return of all the surveyed funds being 16.5%.While on one end of the spectrum are the risk averse mutual funds, on the other, are hedge funds that chase alpha through leverage. This risk means that the funds can accumulate large losses that take years to recover from. This is the case for some of the funds, according to Goldman\u2019s latest industry report. It shows that Tiger Global, Whale Rock, and Third Point which fell 50%+, 45%, and 21.8% in 2022 still haven\u2019t recovered. In 2023, the three respective funds posted 28.5%, 18%, and 4.1%, while their performance through July was 10.7% and 10.9% for Tiger Global and Third Point and 18.9% through May for Whale Rock.In fact, GS\u2019 data shows that roughly one third of long-short funds are yet to recover their 2022 losses, as they are joined by 31% of event driven funds and 45% of macro driven funds. However, some of the top performing funds in the first half were Bridgewater Associates and Citadel, which posted 14.1% and 13.7% in returns respectively. The top performer among hedge funds appears to be AQR Capital with its long/short fund delivering 16.3% in returns.Our Methodology To make our list of stocks that hedge funds and mutual funds love and hate, we divided Goldman\u2019s Hedge Fund Trend Monitor and Mutual Fundamentals report into four categories. These categories are stocks that both avoid, stocks that both love, and stocks favored by one but avoided by the other. Stocks within these categories were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. To learn more about the number of top hedge fund investments in some of these stocks, you can check out Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

These have propelled the firm to become the most valuable semiconductor company on the planet courtesy of its latest market capitalization of $3.21 trillion. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s Blackwell chips are the hottest product in the semiconductor industry and have seen their capacity booked out months in advance. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also benefits from its CUDA software which allows users to tightly control their chip use for accelerated computing. Accelerated computing is at the heart of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s hypothesis, with CEO Jensen Huang believing that even if the AI market slows down, the world\u2019s data centers will nevertheless have to spend $1 trillion to upgrade existing infrastructure. High prices, product delays, lower AI monetization, and a greater shift towards custom AI chips carry the potential to detract NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Baron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year. Overall NVDA ranks 13th on our list of stocks that fund managers love and hate according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

NASDAQ is Poised for Long-Term Returns Big tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies. Wald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names.  Given the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle. Viewing Tech Stocks on Valuations Alone is Wrong, Strategist Says Technology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks. Ethridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it.  He adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon. Now that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

This revenue is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips. By the end of this year, the company is also expected to ramp up production for the chips.On October 14, Ben Reitzes, Melius Research's head of technology research, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his outlook on NVDA. He suggests that there is a lot of upside near the company's growth estimates and revenue, quite less than any other stock. According to him, NVDA will be trading at one time its P/E to growth ratio in 2025, which is highly attractive for a name as influential as NVDA. He adds that the demand for its Blackwell chips is huge and the company will have to ramp up production.There is no denying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a crucial role to play in the artificial intelligence industry, which explains why 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.  READ ALSO:\u00a015 AI News Investors Should Not Miss \u00a0and\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4 Sometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these \u201cdown days\u201d can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major \u201cAI arms race\u201d is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings. Just like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn\u2019t surprised by recent market developments. It\u2019s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is \u201ceasy to hope\u201d that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, \u201creaffirms that confidence\u201d.   Story Continues With that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents.\u201cWe think every company in the world, whether it\u2019s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.\u201d -Taylor told CNBC in an interview. In other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo\u2019s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both.\"Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety.\" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company\u2019s Master Perfumer Advancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI\u2019s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company:\u201cNeither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready\u201d. With that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now.Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Unveils AI Workflow for Credit Card Fraud Detection, Enhancing Security for Financial Institutions  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179Leading the way in AI computing, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a darling AI stock. It is not only the leader in the AI chip market but has also built a robust AI ecosystem spanning graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Its GPUs are the backbone of AI innovation globally, powering everything from advanced data centers to autonomous systems.On October 28, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed on its blog that they have developed a new NVIDIA workflow optimized for credit card transaction fraud. The new NVIDIA AI workflow for fraud detection that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses accelerated data processing and advanced algorithms to improve AI\u2019s ability to detect and prevent credit card transaction fraud. The workflow was launched at the Money20/20 fintech conference this week, enabling financial institutions to recognize subtle patterns and anomalies in transaction data based on user behavior. The workflow will help them improve accuracy and reduce false positives compared with traditional methods, keeping customers\u2019 money, identities, and digital accounts safe.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

(NVDA): Leading the AI and GPU Revolution      Maham Fatima   October 21, 2024 9 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.29%        ^GSPC   -1.05%         We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. Neutral Stance Amid Uncertainties The tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.  As sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the\u00a010 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector\u2019s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here\u2019s an excerpt from his sentiment: \u201c\u2026This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.  Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell\u2019 on October 17 and highlighted that there\u2019s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.   Story Continues Stockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.When asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500\u2019s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.Regarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.On the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.Her insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.MethodologyTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds.

This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Rising Market Volatility Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.  A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that\u2019s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. \u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\u201d  \u201cBut there\u2019s been some cracks in the business cycle,\u201d he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \u201csuper high\u201d levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.   Story Continues \u201cHistorically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,\u201d Cohen said.Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta\u2019s share price surge due to strong sales growth.Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.  Our MethodologyTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst\u2019s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 179Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 15.32%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, given the role it is playing in artificial intelligence, which is only starting. With so many companies relying on its chips to power next-generation technologies and software, its growth metrics and long-term prospects remain intact.Given that artificial intelligence adoption is still in the early stages, it affirms Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects as a leading player in the supply of much-needed chips for AI. Given that graphic processing units are preferred for their flexibility and adaptability in the evolving AI applications, it also affirms the company\u2019s growth metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) financial statements show the company\u2019s explosive growth in recent years. Its net income over the last four reported quarters has exceeded $53 billion. That\u2019s almost twice as much as the $26.9 billion it made in fiscal 2022, which concluded on January 30, 2022, before all the AI hoopla started. It made $9.8 billion in profit during that fiscal year.The enormous demand for Nvidia\u2019s data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which aid in the execution and training of AI algorithms, caused the company\u2019s second-quarter revenue to soar 122% year over year to $30 billion.The company\u2019s bottom line is likewise strong, with operating income rising 174% yearly to $18.6 million. In 2025 and beyond, management anticipates introducing new AI hardware products built on the quicker and more effective Blackwell architecture will boost customer demand.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s revenue base is poised to receive a significant boost later in the year with the launch of the Blackwell cap line. Given that the chipset is already eliciting sand demand, according to Coo Jensen Huang, it underscores why Nvidia is a top growth stock.Thanks to robust revenue and earnings growth, the stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, which is not high for a stock that has rallied by more than 26,000%. Analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a buy with an average price target of $152.44, implying a 15.32% change from the last price of $132.19.According to our Insider Monkey database, at the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall NVDA\u00a0ranks 9th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Another bullish analyst note also boosted shares, as Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote to clients the \u201csetup here is still pretty darn good\u201d for Nvidia stock even as it enjoys an extended bounce. \u201cStrong AI spending\u201d from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet and ChatGPT parent OpenAI should \u201ccatalyze consumption\u201d of Nvidia\u2019s core (GPUs), according to Reitzes. The demand optimism follows continued comments from Nvidia\u2019s centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang insisting demand for its AI products is \u201cso great\u201d and \u201cinsane.\u201d\nKey Background\nMonday is a continuation of a month-long period of outsized returns for Nvidia, as its 26% return since Sept. 6 trounces the S&P\u2019s 6% gain during the period and its five trillion-dollar peers\u2019 7% average gain. Nvidia was briefly the world\u2019s largest company in June, when its share price peaked at a still-record $140.76. Previously a fairly low-profile company known for its video game business, Nvidia became a Wall Street darling as its profits skyrocketed amid the generative AI boom. Nvidia\u2019s valuation has increased tenfold over the past two years.\n\nBig Number\n$21.9 billion. That\u2019s how much in adjusted profits Nvidia is expected to report in its fiscal quarter ending this month, according to average analyst forecasts tracked by FactSet. That\u2019s a more than 80% year-over-year increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and a more than 1,000% jump from 2022\u2019s comparable period.\n\nFurther ReadingForbesNvidia Shares Jump After CEO Jensen Huang Notes \u2018Insane\u2019 Demand For Blackwell AI \u2018Superchip\u2019By Antonio Peque\u00f1o IV\nForbesNvidia Stock Pops 8% As CEO Huang Touts Demand For ChipsBy Derek Saul\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

In the last 10 years, the chip designer has returned an astonishing 27,496% to shareholders.\u00a0In the last two years alone, the stock has surged over 1,000%, as it is at the epicenter of the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. Several companies are using Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop and train generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT. The robust demand for these products has allowed Nvidia to report revenue of $96.3 billion in the last four quarters, up from just $10.9 billion in fiscal 2020 (which ended in January).\u00a0While its sales more than doubled to $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024, top-line growth has accelerated to almost 200% in the last 12 months. The company\u2019s upcoming Blackwell series chips could be the next key driver for the semiconductor giant, pushing valuations higher.\u00a0Let\u2019s see if Nvidia stock can get even bigger and continue to deliver outsized gains to shareholders in the upcoming decade.\u00a0The Bull Case for Nvidia StockAgainst a backdrop of strong demand, Nvidia remains a leader in the AI chip market. In fact, according to various reports, the semiconductor giant has a market share of between 75% and 90% in the AI chip segment. This market leadership has allowed Nvidia to benefit from pricing power, ending Q2 with gross margins of over 75% while operating margins were over 62%.\u00a0After meeting with management, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote that Nvidia could actually gain an even bigger share of AI processors in 2025, \"as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year.\"Moore reiterated an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating for NVDA stock with a price target of $150. The analyst added that previous production snags with Blackwell appear to be resolved, and cited \"high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter.\"What's Next for NVDA Stock?The AI accelerator market is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 29% through 2030. In an investor presentation yesterday, Advanced Micro Devices AMD CEO Lisa Su - while introducing a new chip to rival Nvidia's offerings - projected the AI accelerator market to grow to a whopping $500 billion by the end of 2028. So, if Nvidia can maintain a market share of 50%, its GPUs might rake in $250 billion in 2028.\u00a0Rising chip demand has allowed Nvidia to report triple-digit revenue and earnings growth for five consecutive quarters. Notably, analysts expect sales growth to decelerate to \u201cjust\u201d 42% year over year in fiscal 2026.\u00a0Comparatively, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $1.19 per share in fiscal 2024 to $4.03 per share in 2025. So, priced at 33x forward earnings, NVDA stock is not too expensive, given that adjusted earnings are on track to rise by more than 50% annually through fiscal 2029.\u00a0Out of the 41 analysts covering NVDA stock, 35 recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d two recommend \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and four recommend \u201chold.\u201d The average 12-month target price for Nvidia stock is $149.99, indicating an upside potential of 11.3% from current levels.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat, strong growth prospects, widening profit margins, and an expanding AI market make it a top stock to own, even at a $3.3 trillion valuation.\u00a0 On the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The company is a leader in the graphics processing units (GPUs) central to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With soaring demand for its AI offerings, Nvidia is the market's top-performing mega-cap stock.However, like any high-flying stock, Nvidia recently faced some turbulence. Concerns have emerged around a potential slowdown in AI spending, delays in the release of its much-anticipated AI GPU, \u201cBlackwell,\u201d and mounting pressure on profit margins. These issues led to a temporary pause in the stock's meteoric rise.Despite these short-term concerns, Nvidia\u2019s rally has resumed. In just one month, the stock has surged by nearly 24% - far outpacing the broader market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). This impressive bounce-back showcases investors\u2019 confidence in the stock and the strong underlying demand for its products.Year-to-date, Nvidia stock has now climbed about 190%. Interestingly, at least one Wall Street analyst believes Nvidia stock could still go higher, setting a price target of $200 per share - which is the highest on the Street.With Nvidia continuing to lead in the AI market and the demand for advanced GPUs only growing, let\u2019s explore the factors that could push Nvidia stock even higher.Solid Q3 Numbers to Push NVDA Stock HigherNvidia will release its Q3 earnings numbers next month on Nov. 20. Despite the short-term concerns, the solid demand for NVIDIA Hopper, Computing, and Networking platforms could help the company post strong Q3 results that will likely boost its share price.A significant factor in Nvidia\u2019s success is the booming growth in its Data Center revenue. Since the beginning of fiscal 2024, this segment has consistently added approximately $4 billion in revenue each quarter. In Q2 of fiscal 2025, Data Center revenue reached $26.3 billion, marking a 16% sequential growth and an impressive 154% increase year-over-year. Notably, its computing revenue has more than doubled in Q2, and its networking revenue has more than tripled compared to last year.Nvidia\u2019s strength in the Data Center space is driven by surging demand from cloud service providers (CSPs) and major companies across the consumer, internet, and enterprise sectors. Looking ahead to Q3, Nvidia\u2019s management has guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, which represents an 8% increase quarter-over-quarter and 79% year-over-year. This positive outlook suggests that the company\u2019s Data Center segment will continue to flourish, fueled by growing customer adoption of its Hopper architecture.It\u2019s worth noting that the Hopper H200 platform began ramping up in Q2. The platform builds on the success of its predecessor with improved memory bandwidth, making it highly attractive to large CSPs and enterprise companies. With improving supply, Nvidia expects Hopper demand to remain strong, especially in the second half of fiscal 2025.Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell platform is expected to make a significant contribution starting in Q4. The demand for Blackwell already exceeds supply, and Nvidia is poised to generate several billion dollars in revenue in Q4 from this platform. This strong demand is expected to carry over into the next fiscal year, providing a solid foundation for future growth.Beyond its Hopper and Blackwell platforms, Nvidia\u2019s Networking segment is also performing well, thanks partly to the strong demand for Ethernet for AI. This is expected to further boost the company\u2019s top line in Q3.While the company is likely to deliver solid top-line numbers, the Data Center mix continues to shift to new products, which could impact its margins in the short term. Nonetheless, Nvidia\u2019s bottom line could continue to grow at a solid pace. Analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.69 per share, compared to $0.38 in the prior-year quarter. What\u2019s Next for Nvidia Stock?Nvidia\u2019s solid financials in Q3 and upbeat Q4 guidance could significantly boost its share price. To reach the $200 mark, Nvidia stock would need to rise by about 39% from current levels \u2014 a target that appears achievable, given the company\u2019s leadership in AI and the increasing adoption of generative AI across industries.Generative AI is opening new revenue streams for Nvidia\u2019s customers, allowing them to enhance productivity and expand their businesses. This, in turn, has prompted data center operators to increase their capital spending on accelerated computing, with a particular focus on GPUs, further supporting Nvidia\u2019s growth.The Bottom Line on NVDA Stock Right NowNvidia\u2019s large installed base, constant innovation, new product launches, and expanding software offerings position the company for continued growth. As a result, analysts maintain a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating on NVDA stock, with an average price target of $150.99 - which may soon be revised upward.On the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

TipRanks   October 16, 2024 5 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   PLTR   -3.32%       NVDA   -2.32%          Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) have been two of 2024\u2019s hottest stocks \u2014 Nvidia\u2019s 179.6% year-to-date gain has made it the second-most valuable company in the world by market cap, while Palantir\u2019s 153.3% gain has put it on the map as a mega-cap tech stock to be reckoned with, not to mention a new member of the S&P 500 (SPX).  Both stocks have benefitted from being key players in the AI revolution. Both companies have exciting futures ahead of them, but there is a key difference between the two that makes one the more compelling opportunity at this point in time. Which looks like the better choice for investors right now? Massive Gap in Valuation on a Price-to-Earnings Basis Nvidia\u2019s 2024 surge has taken it to a relatively high valuation multiple of 47.5 times January 2025 earnings estimates. The S&P 500 trades at 24.7 times earnings, meaning that Nvidia is nearly twice as expensive as the broader market. However, with consensus earnings per share projected to grow to $4.01 per share for the fiscal year ending in January 2026, Nvidia looks quite a bit more palatable at 33.6 times forward earnings. While this is still fairly expensive, it\u2019s starting to look reasonable enough for a mega-cap powerhouse projected to grow earnings per share by over 40% for the year.\u00a0While Nvidia sometimes catches flack from value-oriented investors for its above-average price-to-earnings multiple, Palantir is even more expensive.  The massive 153% YTD gain has pushed shares of Palantir to an incredible valuation of 122.4 times December 2024 earnings estimates. This is more than double Nvidia\u2019s valuation and roughly five times the broader market.\u00a0With the stock expected to grow earnings per share by 19.4% to $0.43 per share for December 2025, the stock\u2019s valuation comes down a bit but is still trading at an exorbitant triple-digit multiple of 100.8 times forward earnings. Looking Beyond Price-to-Earnings  Plus, it\u2019s not just price-to-earnings that makes Palantir look significantly more expensive than Nvidia. When looking at the two stocks on a price-to-sales basis, a popular metric often used for evaluating high-growth names like technology stocks and software stocks, Palantir trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of 35.3, while Nvidia trades for a high but comparatively cheaper 26.3 times sales. What About the PEG Ratio?  Lastly, it\u2019s worth comparing the two stocks based on their PEG ratios (price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio), a popular valuation metric useful for evaluating growth stocks like Nvidia and Palantir by accounting for earnings growth.\u00a0PEG ratio is calculated by taking a stock\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio and dividing it by its earnings growth rate. The lower the PEG ratio, the better a stock looks by this measure. Investors and analysts who utilize this metric typically view a PEG ratio of 1.0x or less to be undervalued.   Story Continues So, how do Nvidia and Palantir stack up on this basis? Nvidia\u2019s PEG ratio of 1.8 is a bit higher than ideal but not prohibitive. On the other hand, Palantir trades at a significantly higher PEG ratio of 10.4, indicating that it is likely overvalued even when accounting for its earnings growth.Palantir is no doubt an exciting company, but it\u2019s hard to sustain a valuation multiple like this, and it leaves little room for error \u2014 if the company falls short of analyst expectations or hits any speed bumps, shares could tumble quickly.Is NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Turning to Wall Street, NVDA earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months. The average NVDA stock price target of $152.86 implies 10.7% upside potential from current levels.  See more NVDA analyst ratingsIs PLTR Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Turning to Wall Street, PLTR earns a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, six Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PLTR stock price target of $27.67 implies 36.2% downside potential from current levels.  See more PLTR analyst ratingsSmarten Up Wall Street analysts are far more constructive on Nvidia, and so is TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Scores of four, five, six, or seven are considered Neutral, and scores of three or below are considered equivalent to an Underperform rating.Nvidia boasts an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9.  Meanwhile, Palantir receives a far less favorable Neutral Smart Score of 4.  Nvidia Is the Clear ChoiceNVDA and PLTR are both high-flying AI stocks, and both are projected to grow earnings significantly in the year ahead. However, Nvidia is projected to grow earnings more than twice as much as Palantir. Despite this, Nvidia shares trade for a far cheaper valuation multiple. Nvidia is often criticized as an \u2018expensive\u2019 stock, but its forward earnings multiple is just a third of Palantir\u2019s double-digit valuation, making it look downright cheap in comparison.Plus, sell-side analysts rate Nvidia a Strong Buy and see an upside of 10.7% over the next 12 months, while they are considerably more cautious towards Palantir, rating it a Hold and forecasting a potential downside of 36.4% from current levels. This disparity in analyst views is another strong point in favor of Nvidia.I\u2019m bullish on Nvidia based on its significantly cheaper valuation and superior earnings growth, making it the clear-cut winner in this comparison of high-profile AI stocks. For investors looking to capitalize on the generative AI wave, Nvidia continues to look like a smart choice.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

(NVDA): Leading AI Innovation with Strategic Partnerships      Maham Fatima   October 18, 2024 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.33%          We recently published a list of 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high growth high market stocks to invest in. How Market Trends Shape Opportunities When investor confidence is high, capital tends to flow into growth sectors, driving up stock prices and valuations. This is particularly relevant for companies with strong growth prospects and high margins, as they are often seen as more resilient in a recovering economy. Current market dynamics indicate that much of the upward movement may be attributed to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. High-growth stocks typically trade at higher price-to-earnings ratios, so if the market continues to expand, these stocks could benefit significantly as investors are willing to pay a premium for growth potential.  Jason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 3 to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now. Jason Trennert revealed that he turned bullish at the end of 2023 after initially predicting a recession. Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then. When discussing current valuations, Trennert pointed out that the market is trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle. He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect.  Trennert also addressed concerns regarding government spending and deficits, noting that the federal deficit has reached 7% of GDP and expressing a desire for more free-market-oriented policies rather than gridlock in Washington. He criticized both parties for their lack of commitment to reducing deficits and highlighted the moral hazard created by prolonged quantitative easing over the past 12 years. He believes that this situation has led to irresponsible spending practices that will eventually necessitate accountability. Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.   Story Continues As for small-cap stocks, Trennert pointed out that they have historically been underrepresented in portfolios and may offer opportunities for future growth. He highlighted that many venture capital-backed firms are looking to go public, with approximately 45% of them potentially tapping into the IPO market at some point. However, he cautioned that if the economy continues to slow down and earnings growth expectations are not met, small caps may struggle.Skepticism about the projected earnings growth for the S&P 500 could also apply to high-growth stocks. If expectations for earnings growth are too optimistic relative to economic conditions, such as anticipated rate cuts, it may lead to volatility in high-growth stocks, especially if actual earnings do not meet these elevated expectations. Companies with high-profit margins are generally better positioned to weather economic downturns. As Trennert noted concerns regarding government spending and deficits, firms that maintain or improve their profit margins may be more attractive to investors seeking stability amidst economic uncertainty.Trennert\u2019s overall analysis underscores the importance of monitoring government policies and economic indicators as they influence investor sentiment and market performance moving forward. Still, his predominantly bullish sentiment lays the groundwork for a lot of investors, and to make the portfolio expansion process even easier for them, we\u2019re here with a list of the\u00a08 high growth high margin stocks to invest in now.MethodologyWe sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 15 companies with TTM net profit margin above 20% and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates above 25%. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Leading AI Innovation with Strategic Partnerships  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)5-Year Net Income CAGR: 56.73%TTM Net Profit Margin: 55.04%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializing in products and platforms for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Its GPUs have been instrumental in driving advancements in various fields, including deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality.NetApp has launched a new AI tool utilizing NVIDIA technology. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI is leveraging 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal, with potential future expansion to include H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips.NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has formed a strategic partnership with Accenture to accelerate AI innovation. Its AI chip, Blackwell, is now in mass production and experiencing high demand.\u00a0A partnership with Salesforce is established to enhance businesses\u2019 utilization of AI and data. In September, the company introduced Aerial, an AI tool designed to optimize wireless networks for various devices. Its proprietary software, CUDA, provides a competitive edge. The company\u2019s continued success hinges on its ability to sustain innovation and monetize AI effectively.The company\u2019s CEO believes its competitive advantage in AI chips is sustainable. Snowflake, a cloud data warehousing company, that utilizes Nvidia\u2019s AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into its Snowflake Cortex AI, has seen its stock price rise 10% in the past month due to strong prospects driven by a strong portfolio and expanding partner base.The recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and upward stock movement all point to a potential continued upward trajectory. Investors may want to consider adding NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) to their watchlist or portfolios given its positive momentum.Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high growth high market stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

It\u2019s essentially a virtual space where people can interact, play, work, and explore digital environments using technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and 3D graphics.\nGiven its potential to drive the next big opportunity in the tech space, several tech giants are heavily investing in this area to fuel their transition. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into three fundamentally sound stocks: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), and Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK), with explosive growth potential within the metaverse.\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t just about gaming or social interactions. It encompasses immersive experiences that could redefine entertainment, education, and even the way we collaborate in virtual offices.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is.  We can see that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does use debt in its business.  But is this debt a concern to shareholders?  Why Does Debt Bring Risk?  Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price.  Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price.  Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.   See our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What Is NVIDIA's Debt?  The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NVIDIA had debt of US$8.46b at the end of July 2024, a reduction from US$9.71b over a year.    But it also has US$34.8b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$26.3b net cash.  NasdaqGS:NVDA Debt to Equity History October 18th 2024 How Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?  We can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$14.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.1b due beyond that.   Offsetting this, it had US$34.8b in cash and US$14.1b in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So it can boast US$21.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.   This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets.  So it's very unlikely that the US$3.36t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet.    Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!     Even more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 459% over twelve months.  That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.   Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits.   NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt.    Over the most recent three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.    Summing Up While it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$26.3b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet.     And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 459% over the last year.     So we don't think NVIDIA's use of debt is risky.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

On a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. \u201cThe whole first year of this bull\u2019s life was an anomaly. That\u2019s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,\u201d Cramer explained. He emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, \u201cEvery night I say there\u2019s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it\u2019s been right in front of you.\u201d Cramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying: \u201cThe bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I\u2019d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.\u201d  Cramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates. \u201cWe had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.\u201d  He did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become \u201cFed watchers,\u201d suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained: \u201cWhen the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.\u201d  Cramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added: \u201cSure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.\u201d    Story Continues Cramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. \u201cForget the macro, people. It\u2019s not that meaningful when the Fed\u2019s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,\u201d he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that\u2019s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market.Our MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179Here\u2019s what Cramer had to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\u201cPeople are just beginning to realize that maybe it wasn't just a gaming company with some real fast graphics chips...Eventually, NVIDIA and its renaissance man, CEO Jensen, pioneered both accelerated computing and generative AI. We speak too much about the latter, not enough about the former. Accelerated computing is what makes things really work here. In other words, NVIDIA created machines that think faster than you do and soon will do almost anything better than you can do NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) initially gained widespread recognition in 1999 with the introduction of the GeForce 256, celebrated as the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU). Today, it maintains a dominant position in the GPU market, largely thanks to its A100 and H100 chipsets, which have significantly contributed to the company's record revenue and profit growth over the past few years.The company's new Blackwell series GPUs are anticipated to become a major product for the company. CEO Jensen Huang recently expressed excitement about the overwhelming demand for Blackwell, commenting that interest is incredibly high and that many are eager to be at the forefront of this innovation.Among the noteworthy advancements is NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) concept of \"physical AI,\" which involves the deployment of semi-autonomous robots capable of interacting in real-world environments. A significant partnership with Foxconn, the electronics supplier, is already in place to develop and train AI-driven robots.In the second quarter, the company reported a remarkable 122% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching $30 billion. It was fueled by a heightened demand for data center GPUs, particularly the H100 and H200 models.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0Read Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

[+] binary code in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock fell by close to 4.5% on Tuesday. Peer AMD stock also saw a sharp decline, falling by about 5%. The selloff follows an earnings report by chip manufacturing equipment supplier ASML which indicated weaker-than-expected sales guidance for 2025, raising concerns among investors about global chip demand. ASML produces highly sophisticated photolithography machines, particularly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography equipment, which is essential for manufacturing cutting-edge semiconductor chips including the GPUs that Nvidia sells. ASML said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in at between Euro 30 billion to 35 billion, which is toward the bottom end of its previous forecast, with gross margin forecasts also coming in below estimates.\n\n\nNow, although the decline in guidance was attributed to slower chip demand recovery outside of the AI sector, Nvidia, being the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor company by market cap, was impacted considerably. Additionally, there have been reports that the Biden administration may restrict sales of advanced AI processors to some Persian Gulf countries, citing national security concerns. This stems from worries that these countries could act as a conduit for China to acquire U.S. semiconductor technology that is currently banned from direct export to China. While Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI revolution, Here\u2019s A Better AI Pick Than Nvidia stock\n\nThe increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\n\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia\u2019s sharp stock decline on Tuesday may have been an overreaction. Much of the capital expenditure cuts that are likely impacting ASML potentially come from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung foundries, rather than from TSMC, Nvidia\u2019s primary manufacturing partner. However, Nvidia stock still appears pricey. At its current market price of $132 per share, the stock trades at about 46x consensus FY\u201925 earnings and 33x FY\u201926 earnings. There are also risks ahead. See our scenario analysis on Could Nvidia Stock Crash To $40? The big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs.\n\nCompetition is also mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia\u2019s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, the economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenue. There are concerns that companies are investing in AI due to the fear of missing out, rather than focusing on returns. This could eventually lead to reduced capital spending and impact Nvidia, We value NVDA stock at $88 per share, about 33% below the current market price.

Published on October 27, 2024 at 10:17 am by  \n                Inan Dogan, PhD\n                  in News, Stock Analysis        Share  Tweet  Email        Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) stock price has soared to unprecedented heights, fueled by the AI boom and the company\u2019s dominant position in the GPU market. It\u2019s market cap briefly touched $3.5 trillion on Friday. However, this meteoric rise has raised questions about its valuation. Is the future already priced into the stock, or are there still significant upside opportunities?The AI Gold RushNvidia\u2019s GPUs have become the de facto standard for AI and machine learning applications. The company\u2019s powerful chips are essential for training and running complex AI models, driving demand from both consumers and enterprise customers.This surge in demand has translated into impressive financial performance for Nvidia. The company has consistently delivered strong revenue and earnings growth, fueled by the AI boom.The Valuation Question  While Nvidia\u2019s growth prospects are undeniably strong, its valuation has reached stratospheric levels. The stock\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is significantly higher than the industry average and the broader market. That\u2019s understandable for a fast-growing stock. Assuming that NVDA becomes a more mature stock in a few years and keeps growing at the same rate the entire stock market grows. A mature but growing company usually gets a price-earnings ratio of around 20. This means currently NVDA\u2019s stock price implies that it will be generating after tax profits of $175 billion a year if it manages to retain its dominance in the chip industry.Over the last 12 month period NVDA generated $96 billion in sales and $53 billion in net income. So, basically, investors basically assume that NVDA will be able to triple its revenue and profits until it becomes a more mature company.If that happens, NVDA stock will return zero percent. The investors who are buying NVDA stock today are assuming that Nvidia will deliver even better results than tripling its revenue and profits. I personally own NVDA, but I am not convinced that the company can deliver these lofty expectations.While Nvidia\u2019s future looks promising, investors should exercise caution and consider the risks associated with its high valuation. It\u2019s important to assess whether the current price reflects the company\u2019s long-term growth potential or if there\u2019s a bubble forming.While I acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, my conviction lies in the belief that some other AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: Long NVDA.

In an interview with CNBC on October 14,\u00a0Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.  He also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market. Regarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform. Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.  Lee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction. Regarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.   Story Continues While some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years.Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0\u00a010-Year Net Income CAGR: 58.47%\u00a0\u00a0TTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion\u00a0\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and a pioneer in AI, gaming, and data center technology. The company\u2019s GPUs are widely utilized in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have been adopted across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and finance. Notable customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is positioned for ongoing growth, driven by its strong presence in the data center market and the upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is highly sought after by companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, who are building AI data centers to support their products. The Blackwell GPUs, priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, are already being distributed to data centers and industrial customers for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025.In a CNBC interview, CEO Jensen Huang remarked that \"Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane,\" adding, \"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\" NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in accelerated computing and generative AI is also a key factor in its growth outlook.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to benefit from the expanding enterprise AI market, along with growing opportunities in the automotive and healthcare sectors, as its products and solutions gain traction in these areas.In Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure rose by 19% year-over-year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend approximately $160 billion on AI infrastructure in 2024.With its robust position in the data center market and emerging opportunities in various industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth. Analysts estimate that the company\u2019s earnings will grow by 81.88% this year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $148.53, which represents a 12.08% upside potential from its current level.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.33%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.22%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.56%. Shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 20.73% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 2.83% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.83%.  The upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on November 20, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.74, indicating an 85% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $32.74 billion, reflecting an 80.69% rise from the equivalent quarter last year. Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.82 per share and revenue of $124.66 billion. These totals would mark changes of +116.92% and +104.63%, respectively, from last year. It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.  The Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Right now, Nvidia possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Looking at valuation, Nvidia is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 50.12. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.78.

Zacks Equity Research   October 18, 2024 3 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Have you been paying attention to shares of Nvidia (NVDA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $140.89 in the previous session. Nvidia has gained 176.5% since the start of the year compared to the 26.5% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 124.7% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 28, 2024, Nvidia reported EPS of $0.68 versus consensus estimate of $0.64. For the current fiscal year, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share on $124.66 billion in revenues. This represents a 116.15% change in EPS on a 104.63% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.73 per share on $174.35 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 32.75% and 39.86%, respectively. Valuation Metrics Nvidia may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.  Nvidia has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B. In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 48.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 24.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 110.4X versus its peer group's average of 11X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. Zacks Rank We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.   Story Continues Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Nvidia fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Nvidia shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Talk about the 1% \u2014 specifically, $3 trillion! But everyone knows that. The bigger question is: what\u2019s next? Should you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia at this point?\n\n\nIn our recent analyses, we argued for a range of outcomes: Nvidia\u2019s road to $300 and the counterpoint Nvidia\u2019s downside to $40.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is No Dud Either \u2014 Here\u2019s Path to 10x\n\n\nNvidia stock journey so far\nNVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA\u2019s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular \u2013 as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nNow, below are the facts, and a concrete view of how you might want to think of Nvidia in your portfolio.\nThree undeniable facts about Nvidia\n\n\nNvidia is an arms supplier and the AI war is on\nAI isn\u2019t just an input: it\u2019s a strategic input. Companies from apparel to the energy sector to pharma giants don\u2019t just need it as a hygiene factor - they need it to win vs. the competition. Meaning? These Nvidia\u2019s customers cannot afford to be price-sensitive\nHeady growth comes with massive swings. Froth always includes water: the core, and the air. It won\u2019t be smooth to watch Nvidia swing in your portfolio\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\nSo what should you do with NVDA stock?\nAnswer: Add Nvidia to your portfolio in the amount such that while you sit envisioning a 5x gain in the long term, you\u2019re also willing to stomach 50% loss at any time during the ride. Yep, be willing to bear short-term pain - the price you\u2019ll pay - to be rewarded in the long run. This sounds simple in theory but is never easy to live by in practice.\n\nBelow are more specifics on the pros and cons.\nThe bad first\n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, competition is heating up. AMD isn\u2019t sitting idle - the company has doubled down on AI-focused GPUs and claims its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia\u2019s in several areas. Intel is also emerging as a competitor, gaining traction with value-priced AI chips. Moreover, big tech players like Google - one of Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers - are developing their own AI and machine learning silicon. With these rivals, the rapid growth in Nvidia\u2019s revenues and the unusually high levels of Nvidia\u2019s cash-flow margins (over 50% in recent quarters) may not be sustainable.\nThe underlying economics of the AI GPU market remain weak, with most of Nvidia\u2019s customers still unprofitable. Why is that? Large language models are expensive to build and train and the payoff can take a long time. VC firm Sequoia estimates that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, possibly exceeding $100 billion when including other costs. Yet, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few services besides ChatGPT gaining large, paying user bases. We may well be in an AI \u201cFOMO phase,\u201d where companies feel compelled to invest in AI simply because their competitors are. As shareholders seek better returns, capital spending may cool off, impacting companies like Nvidia.\nSeparately, large AI deployments follow two stages. The first is the compute-intensive training phase, during which AI models are built from large datasets with GPUs being used to process data and adjust the model\u2019s parameters. The second stage is the deployment phase, where trained models run in real-world applications and typically require lower processing power, allowing companies to use less expensive hardware to run models for daily tasks. As the AI revolution began just about two years ago, most companies are in the training phase and there is a possibility that demand could ease off as we move towards lower power inferencing.\nThe good and the great\nNvidia has had a head start in the AI market. And it has the foresight to not let its early mover advantage slip away. The company has built a comprehensive ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages and software, which can lock customers into its products as they scale up their AI investments. Nvidia\u2019s extensive software stack - including CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT - not only enhances performance but also simplifies AI development, making it increasingly difficult and costly for companies to switch to alternative platforms. Look at it this way. As companies deploy their AI bets they will be spending time and resources on training, tuning their AI models, and integrating these tools into their broader IT systems and workflows. This makes it more difficult and costly to shift to competitors. The ecosystem could help to protect Nvidia\u2019s margins, with software-related sales also likely expanding in the long run.\nWhile the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal meaning that they work with speech, images, video, and 3D content - calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power - particularly with processors - outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia.\nThe shift in U.S. monetary policy could also give Nvidia an extra lift. The Fed\u2019s 50 basis point cut - the first in nearly four years - brings the federal funds rate to 4.75%-5%, with room for further reductions. Lower rates boost growth sectors like tech by increasing the present value of future earnings. The rate cuts are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks to watch for the rest of 2024. Talking about the latest market situation during a program on CNBC, Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI senior managing director, said that despite the ups and downs that have happened since the pandemic, the US remains an economy that is \u201cenvy of the world.\u201d The analyst urged investors to pile into stocks that have historically performed well after the Fed started cutting rates and hinted at the expected \u201cturbulence\u201d related to US elections. \u201cWe love what we call the Fed rate cut playbook. You go back to 1970, you look at all the rate cutting cycles, there\u2019s a very pronounced outperformance in the year after the Fed starts cutting from info tech, surprise surprise. Small caps, which might be a bit counterintuitive considering how much they took it on the chin today, but also, barbelled by the more defensive sectors, consumer staples and health care. So, to us, that\u2019s sort of the sensible way that will help you ride out if you get some turbulence, which, obvious, if there\u2019s a contested outcome, you\u2019re likely going to get some turbulence.\u201d  READ ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In Pointing to market volatility, Emanuel said that the \u201cwall of worry\u201d is still strong. \u201cThe wall of worry is still very, very intact. And if you think about it, yeah, the VIX is low compared to maybe longer run history, but actually, if you think about the inertia of the markets the last several weeks, the VIX is high, and it should be, in front of probably one of the biggest unknowns we\u2019ve been facing, certainly in the last four years, if not longer.\u201d  For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Talking to Bloomberg in a latest program, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller expressed regret over selling Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).   Story Continues \u201cI\u2019ve made so many mistakes in my investment career. One of them was I sold all my Nvidia,\u201d the billionaire said, confirming that he owns no Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares as of today.\u201cIt was a big mistake in terms of I am, by the way, when I saw you at that conference, which was 18 months ago, I fully expected to own it for years, but I think it was 300 and change. And as I also said in another media interview, I\u2019m not Warren Buffett. So I thought I was going in. But what changed is it tripled in a year, and I thought the valuation was rich. We are big term long-term believers in AI, and there are so many ways we\u2019re playing AI, particularly the infrastructure that\u2019s been built out to support the power needed. And yes, I think NVIDIA is a wonderful company, and where the price to come down, we get involved again. But right now I\u2019m licking my wounds from a bad sale there.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks to watch for the rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine NVIDIA\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.  Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What's The Opportunity In NVIDIA? NVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 62.81x is currently well-above the industry average of 28.79x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. What kind of growth will NVIDIA generate?   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth October 17th 2024   Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.  Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

It\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s NVDA stock market and we all live in it. That\u2019s once again the theme across equities after the chip juggernaut soared to a fresh all-time high, conquering the not-seen-before $3.5 trillion market cap. Nvidia jumped 4.1% on Monday, blasting to a record closing high of $143.71 per share. The milestone level brings the company just $100 billion away from ousting Apple AAPL as the world\u2019s largest company.  Nvidia\u2019s rally comes just as Big Tech prepares to release third-quarter earnings data. Top of mind for investors will be how much megacap tech mainstays spent on artificial intelligence. Spoiler: some big numbers most likely. Technology firms splashing out billions of dollars on AI inevitably means that Nvidia got a share of the cash.

Maleha Afzal   October 25, 2024 6 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.24%          We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. \u201cWe Are Just at the Beginning of the AI Buildout\u201d Each of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research\u2019s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined\u00a0CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019\u00a0to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence.  The third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark. Wang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold.  FAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.   Story Continues Our MethodologyTo come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)X the Best FAANG Stock To Buy According to Analysts?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Analyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 4.29%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), commonly referred to as the AI star and AI winner, ranks 7th on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts.On October 19, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he suggested that Nvidia, without a doubt, is the AI winner and will be the first company to reach a $4 trillion valuation. He adds that he expects the stock to reach $150 by the end of 2024, as other companies continue to make investments in GPU compute. Previously on October 15, Ben Reitzes, Melius Research\u2019s head of technology research, appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he shared his stance on the stock. Like Ahluwalia, Reitzes is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expects the stock to trade at one time its P/E to growth ratio in 2025, highly attractive for an influential name like NVDA.There is no doubt about NVIDIA\u2019s position in the technology and AI sector. On October 21, the company announced a partnership with Deloitte to deploy digital AI agents for healthcare. On the same day, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined hands with Microsoft to support AI startups across the globe with a focus on healthcare and life sciences in the first phase. The two companies will pan out to other industries in future phases. NVDA will provide inference credits to run GPU-optimized AI models and MSFT will offer Azure credits to access leading AI models.Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides AI hardware and software products to high-growth markets, medium-sized companies, and mega-cap stocks, that have been pouring billions into enhancing their AI infrastructure. In the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company expects to generate $32.5 billion in revenue, which is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\" Overall NVDA ranks 7th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

Omor Ibne Ehsan   October 29, 2024 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.24%          Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) bears have been proven wrong continuously in the past two years, and the stock is up 923% since. This company went on to become the largest in the world before declining, but it is on another rally that could make it the biggest company yet again. Very few people would've thought that such a thing would be possible even just a year ago.  That said, the stock market is--and always will be--a weighing machine in the long run. The bulls may have been right so far, but that does not mean that Nvidia will keep its shine forever. No stock in history has defied gravity for years and years without a major correction of some sort. Conversely, the bearish argument here is taking a very long time to play out. There's competition on the horizon, but the numbers coming out of Nvidia's quarterly reports are simply too high for the market to not reward.    Anyone telling you with absolute certainty about where this train is heading is lying. However, what we can do is dig deeper and see what can go right and what can go wrong. You can then form your own opinion--with a lot more confidence. Let's start! Does Nvidia's AI Business Have Any Real Competition? We're going to assume that you already have a decent idea of what Nvidia does. On that note, we're going to jump into the most important part of Nvidia's business: Compute & Networking. Compute & Networking is Nvidia's largest and fastest-growing segment. It generated $22.68 billion in revenues in Q1 fiscal 2025, up by an extraordinary 5.1X year-on-year. The segment further accelerated in Q2 fiscal 2025 and reached $26.3 billion in revenue. This marked a 16% sequential increase and a staggering 154% year-over-year growth.  The success here stems from Nvidia's flagship H100 data center GPUs. These GPUs are poised to get even better with the upcoming H200 and Blackwell B200 architectures. Speaking of Blackwell, it claims to deliver up to 30 times greater inference performance and consume 25 times less energy for massive AI models compared to its predecessors. Now let's see what the competition has to offer. The underdogs AMD and Intel are making significant strides against Nvidia. However, they're more focused on trying to undercut Nvidia's chips instead of trying to outperform them. AMD's Instinct MI300X chip focuses on inference workloads and Intel's Gaudi 3 accelerator is positioning itself as a more cost-effective alternative.    AI hardware isn't the only thing Nvidia is working on, though. Nvidia's competitive moat extends beyond hardware. Its CUDA software platform has become the industry standard, creating what CEO Jensen Huang calls a \"virtuous circle.\" The company is expanding its ecosystem with new products like Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.   Story Continues Moreover, Nvidia's networking arm--which reported revenue of $3.2 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 (a 242% year-over-year increase)--is becoming increasingly important. Nvidia's Spectrum-X product line is expected to become a multibillion-dollar business within a year. In Q2, its Networking revenue hit $3.7 billion, up 114% year-over-year.The Growth Potential Going ForwardNvidia is clearly miles ahead of the competition so far. There's no denying it. That said, being overkill does have its own drawbacks. There's no guarantee that the broader AI industry will grow in a way that would let Nvidia continue to post such insane growth figures. It's a good idea that we look into the growth potential here more closely.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global artificial intelligence market is projected to grow from $621.19 billion in 2024 to $2,740.46 billion by 2032. This is at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.4%.Looking specifically at Nvidia, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya believes that Nvidia can capture a significant portion of the AI market. He estimates that with Nvidia maintaining its market share, this translates to $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. For reference, Nvidia's total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $61 billion.However, not all analysts are quite as bullish. The consensus among analysts suggests that Nvidia will generate roughly $1.29 trillion in cumulative revenue between fiscal years 2025 and 2030. While still an impressive figure, it falls short of the most optimistic projections.How could this play out? Well, let's take a look.  All of these are based on what analysts estimate right now. We could dig into each of these estimates separately, but that would take us outside the scope of this article. Here are what the estimates for its Data Center/AI segment look like for the next two years.  Nvidia's growth going forward clearly has a lot of variability but should remain fast-moving in the near term unless competition really starts to ramp up.Let's dig deeper into the catalysts that could drag growth into the lower end of the estimates we've presented.Macroeconomic factors can throw a wrench into those estimates. Plus, there's no knowing if AI hype will continue to hold steady. AI startups are flush with cash due to enthusiastic funding rounds from venture capitalists. However, they can get impatient fast if profitability does not improve in the coming years.Another catalyst that is quite under-mentioned is the reliance of Nvidia on a few key customers. This level of customer concentration is considered \"highly unusual\" for a company of Nvidia's size. Most other mega-cap companies don't have even a single customer accounting for 10% of revenue. Let's look at what each customer is trying to do:  Nvidia's revenue from these customers is likely to peak in 2024-2025 and then gradually decline. New customers and markets are likely to offset some losses from major tech companies, but the customer makeup here makes Nvidia prone to any cooldown in how these big software companies view AI.So, How Good Is Nvidia's Valuation Right Now?This is probably the most difficult part of our analysis, as we have to rely on \"guesstimates.\" There are many variables at play with Nvidia, but the current valuation looks fair, or even slightly overvalued. We do not see any signs of Nvidia being a deeply undervalued company. The market has been more than generous. (Read our article about what NVDA's current valuation priced in)However, this also does not mean that Nvidia is out of steam. Momentum has proven analysts wrong--again and again--and it can continue to do just that if the broader tech market keeps rallying.If you are a momentum investor, Nvidia is a good play. Even if you are a value investor and you believe in the prospects of AI, going long on NVDA stock is not a bad idea. You could also start taking some profits if you're sitting on big gains.What we wouldn't suggest doing is shorting NVDA. The momentum here can get you burned pretty quickly.Regardless, all of this is short-term. Our long-term analysis is that NVDA stock is heavily dependent on the broader tech industry and macro factors. This is a cyclical stock that has a lot of room for correction if things do go wrong.You're paying 36 times forward earnings for this business. The growth so far certainly warrants that premium. The problem arises when we consider whether or not that growth will stick around in the coming years.If the AI segment's growth starts to falter, the market will have a very hard time justifying this premium. Moreover, any slowdown in the development of AI models or a better GPU chip by a competitor could erode Nvidia's margins quickly. Wall Street is only paying 36 times trailing sales due to its sky-high margins. However, this will not be the case if margins take a dive. This has happened before during previous downturns.  We have good reason to believe that any future recession would erode margins significantly. This is because AI startups and software companies will likely cut corners when it comes to GPUs if VC/public funding starts to take a hit. But again, that's if a recession happens.The Bottom LineWhether or not you should buy Nvidia depends on how much risk you're comfortable taking. The upside here has been more and more momentum-driven, so value-focused investors should scrutinize NVDA stock more before going long.If you're an aggressive investor, going long on NVDA is not a bad idea, but you should keep in mind that any pullbacks in the broader market could hurt you a lot more.According to my base case, I see Nvidia $140-220 a year from now. That said, a recession could easily drag it below $100.While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an AI play, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace.  READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let\u2019s talk about Morningstar\u2019s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks \"that are hitting record highs\". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. \"It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out\u201d.  As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. \"I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs\u201d.  Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren\u2019t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a \"cease and desist\" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law.   Story Continues In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk.While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input.Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment.MethodologyFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company is said to represent \u201cthe dominant\u201d infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector.Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company\u2019s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell.\u00a0 On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) .According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the \u201cearly innings\u201d and expects that Nvidia\u2019s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn\u2019t have a \u201cclose competitor\u201d. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.\"We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters\u201d. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia\u2019s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the \u201cinsane\u201d demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company\u2019s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, \u201cunderappreciated\u201d enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth.\u201cWe also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)\u201d. According to the bank\u2019s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Welcome to Episode #421 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.  \u00a0 (0:15) - Does It Make Sense For Investors To Buy Semiconductors At Their Current Valuations? (3:45) - Top Stocks To Keep On Your Watch List Right Now (31:25) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, AVGO, TSM, LRCX  Podcast@Zacks.com  Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life. This week, Tracey is going solo to discuss the semiconductor stocks. Should you buy the semiconductor stocks right now or is it too late to get in? Semiconductors: Too Hot to Handle? The semiconductor stocks, which includes more than just the chips, have been on a tear the last 18 months. Over the summer, the stocks took a break and fell back. But some, like NVIDIA, are now back at all-time highs. This earnings season may push them even higher. Tracey looked at 5 of the biggest names in the industry. Are they too expensive to buy right now or is the growth just so strong you MUST own them? 5 Semiconductor Stocks: Should You Buy Them Now? 1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA NVIDIA has been a top stock all year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 184.2% year-to-date, easily outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23%. But it\u2019s been rocky the past 3 months, with big sell-offs. However, thanks to a surge in October, NVIDIA shares are up 15% over that time while the S&P 500 is up just 4.2%.  Earnings look spectacular. Earnings are expected to rise 116% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.8% in fiscal 2026. While NVIDIA may seem expensive with a forward P/E of 48, it has a PEG ratio of just 1.16. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth. NVIDIA\u2019s PEG is nearly that low. Should investors still buy NVIDIA right now? 2. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD Advanced Micro Devices has lagged in 2024. While shares of Advanced Micro Devices are up 48.6% over the last year, year-to-date they\u2019re up just 12.8%. Over the last 3 months, Advanced Micro Devices is down 4.9% while the S&P 500 is up 4.2%. Earnings are expected to jump 26.8% in 2024 and another 54.6% in 2025. You won\u2019t get Advanced Micro Devices cheaply, though. It trades with a forward P/E of 46. However, it\u2019s PEG ratio is just 1.6, which is low.   Story Continues Is this a buying opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices?3. Broadcom Inc. AVGOBroadcom shares have been testing new all-time highs again in 2024. Broadcom is up 67.3% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23.3%. Over the last 3 months, it is outperforming as well, up 13.4% compared to 4.2% for the S&P 500.Earnings are expected to rise 14% in fiscal 2024 and another 27% in fiscal 2025. Broadcom\u2019s P/E is a little more reasonable, at 36.7x. It has a PEG ratio of 2.2, however. That\u2019s higher than NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices.Should Broadcom be on your short list?4. Lam Research Corp. LRCXLam Research is the only one of these 5 stocks that is underperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. Shares of Lam Research are down 2.4% year-to-date. Over the last 3 months, the performance has been dismal. Shares are down 26.7% during that time.Yet earnings are expected to rise 8.7% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.6% in fiscal 2026. Lam Research has attractive valuations with a forward P/E of just 22.8 and a PEG ratio of 1.69.Is this share weakness a buying opportunity in Lam Research?5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSMTaiwan Semiconductor just reported earnings and beat again. It also sees strong demand for AI chips for the next several years.Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have spiked on the earnings news and are up 19.1% over the last 3 months. However, they have been on the move higher all year and are now up 102.7% year-to-date.Earnings are expected to rise 24.5% in 2024 and another 28.4% in 2025. Remarkably, the stock is still cheap even with the huge move higher in the shares. Taiwan Semiconductor trades with a forward P/E of 29.1 but a PEG of just 1.1.Should Taiwan Semiconductor be on your short list?What else do you need to know about the semiconductor stocks?Tune into this week\u2019s video podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AVGO in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio.]Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\" Cramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market. \u201cUnlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one\u2019s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there\u2019s just a lot of money going around.\u201d  He noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable. \u201cWe know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.\u201d  Cramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added: \u201cWhy stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.\u201d  Cramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.  Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179Cramer has been highly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and mentioned the growing demand for the super chip, Blackwell. Here is what he had to say:\u201cNow initially, NVIDIA got clubbed along with the whole market when the yen carry trade imploded. Then it came right back because that was only a temporary problem. Then NVIDIA got smacked down after its quarter, although it didn't take out the blows from the previous sell-off. It's been working its way back ever since. As we learned that demand for its next-generation super chip Blackwell is \u2018insane\u2019, that's a technical term coined by Jensen, by the way. Next thing you know, the stock's coming all the way back, but back with very few people who sold the stock. And before this, right, I mean they're long gone and gone at much lower levels because they traded it, they sold it. Again, take this as a reminder that if you trade NVIDIA, you probably won't be able to sell it high and then get back in low. The ship would've left without you. It's too hard, people, it's just too hard.\u201d NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as a dominant force in the technology sector, particularly in AI. Over recent years, investor interest in the company has surged, positioning it among the largest corporations globally. Additionally, on October 14, as reported by TipRanks, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a target price of $165. He has designated the stock as a Top Pick and Buchalter noted a significant increase in the volumes of the Hopper architecture expected in the latter part of 2024, which could contribute to sustained growth and potentially better profit margins.While he acknowledged some short-term hurdles tied to the evolving supply chain of the Blackwell product line, the enduring demand for these platforms remains strong. Any production delays are anticipated to shift revenue expectations from the first quarter to later in the year, without diminishing the overall demand.Most importantly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has reported that its Blackwell platforms are now fully operational, suggesting that prior production challenges have been effectively addressed. With units priced between $30,000 and $40,000, major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta are actively seeking these products to support their AI data centers.Overall NVDA ranks 6th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0Read Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Attiya Zainib   October 28, 2024 7 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.27%        ^GSPC   -1.04%         We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries\u2019 balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022.  The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent.  Coming back to tech \u2013 the industry wouldn\u2019t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. What\u2019s Ahead for the Market? The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a\u00a0Financial Times\u2019 survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed\u2019s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession.   Story Continues For instance, Piper Sandler\u2019s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the \u201cjumbo\u201d rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn\u2019t avert the problem.However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists\u2019 estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn\u2019t without historical precedent.Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week\u2019s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024.Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is \u2018tactically bullish\u2019 on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets \u201cpricing in a soft landing\u201d. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end.With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said:\u201cI think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we\u2019re kind of underweight on software.\u201d Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don\u2019t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up.MethodologyFor our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  NVIDIA (NVDA): Driving the AI Boom with 184% YTD Gains  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a03Y CAGR: 82.08%NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia\u2019s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company\u2019s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously.It goes without saying that Nvidia isn\u2019t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform \u2013 CUDA. Having a GPU market share of\u00a070.5%\u00a0as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date.Nvidia\u2019s highly anticipated GPU \u2013 Blackwell \u2013 is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months.This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to\u00a0say\u00a0about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs:\u201cPeople are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications\u2014based on supply chain checks and everything else\u2014demand for this product looks off the charts.\u201d The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount:\u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove \u201chorrendous\u201d for LLMs in the short term. \u201cThe short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They\u2019re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it\u2019s measurable.\u201d  However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they\u2019d be enjoying. READ ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it\u2019s competing with a lot of \u201cbig guns.\u201d He quoted Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a \u201cproprietary\u201d large language model. \u201cSo, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it\u2019s a big raise for a private company that\u2019s moving quickly, but they\u2019re going to get acquired. They\u2019re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.\u201d  For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 BofA increased Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s full-year 2025 earnings estimate to $2.87 per share from $2.81, lifted the 2026 estimate to $4.47 from $3.90, and adjusted the 2027 estimate to $5.67 from $4.72. The firm also maintained its Buy rating and raised its price target to $190, up from $165. Nvidia shares have approached new highs this week.   Story Continues \u201cWe see NVDA\u2019s free cash flow generation, with a 45-50%+ margin, as underappreciated, nearly double the 23-25% average of the Mag-7,\u201d said BofA analysts, led by Vivek Arya, in a note. \u201cIn dollar terms, NVDA could generate over $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, putting it in the same league as Apple (AAPL) and giving it room to grow.\u201d BofA also pointed to Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s increasing role in enterprise collaborations with companies like Accenture (ACN), ServiceNow (NOW), and Microsoft (MSFT)Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0holds a commanding 80% to 85% share in a $400 billion market, which has prompted BofA Securities to raise its earnings forecasts for the company.Nvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Of course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most profitable tech stocks right now. Technology Sector\u2019s \u2018High Bar\u2019 In an interview with CNBC on October 10, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy at Citi Research, shared his thoughts about the upcoming earnings season and its potential impact on the market. With the Dow and S&P 500 reaching new closing highs, Pettit raised the question of whether earnings would justify the current valuations. The technology sector has been on a tear, with many software names running up significantly in recent weeks. However, Pettit\u2019s warning suggests that investors should be cautious about getting too caught up in the hype. He noted that when there\u2019s a high bar, investors should be prepared for potential disappointments.  Pettit sounded a note of caution when it came to the tech sector, particularly software stocks. He noted that software has the highest bar within tech, not just in terms of growth expectations but also in terms of monetization. Many software companies are not seeing the expected growth in the next three years, which is already priced into their valuations. This mismatch between expectations and reality could create volatility in the sector. In terms of specific guidance, Pettit expects companies to use the current uncertainty as an excuse to walk down expectations for Q4. This is a typical trend in US markets, where companies tend to set low expectations and then beat them. Pettit advises investors to focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. Overall, Pettit\u2019s comments suggest that investors should be cautious about the tech sector, particularly software stocks, and focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. He also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the current quarter and focusing on long-term growth prospects. Tech Sector Will Thrive Despite Short-term Challenges Dan Flax, Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman is bullish on the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of workloads and are executing well on their product cycles. Flax expects concerns about cyclical headwinds to remain a factor but also sees select opportunities in the sector. He also noted that enterprise customers are looking to adjust to changes in the landscape cyclically and invest in transforming their organizations, which will drive technology spending in the second half of the decade.   Story Continues As investors navigate the current market landscape, it is essential to approach the tech sector with a sense of caution. While the sector has been experiencing a significant upswing, investors should focus on companies that have a proven track record of delivering on their promises, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding certain stocks.Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 8 most profitable tech stocks right now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest technology companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Tirthankar Chakraborty   October 23, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            Jensen Huang\u2019s NVIDIA Corporation NVDA recently achieved a new milestone and is now part of an elite club. And with the NVIDIA stock hitting record highs, investors must lament not owning the stock. But it\u2019s not too late to buy the stock either! Let\u2019s see why \u2013 NVIDIA Reaches $3.5 Trillion Market Cap Among the chip stocks, NVIDIA stood out on Monday after its shares gained 4.1% and closed above $3.5 trillion market capitalization for the first time. In June, NVIDIA surpassed the $3 trillion market value and was worth more than Apple Inc. AAPL. However, Apple became the first company to hit the $3.5 trillion milestone and is now valued at $3.6 trillion. Nevertheless, NVIDIA\u2019s stellar performance in recent times may soon propel it past Apple. NVIDIA\u2019s shares have surged 243% over the past year and a staggering 543% in the last three years primarily due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). 4 Reasons Why NVIDIA\u2019s Shares Will Continue to Rise Insane demand for NVIDIA\u2019s most sought-after cutting-edge Blackwell B200 chips, which have more AI throughput than the current Hopper H100 chips, would boost its share price. NVIDIA has ramped up the production of Blackwell chips as demand has skyrocketed among the likes of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.  NVIDIA\u2019s growing data center business will likely boost the stock. The H100 chips are expected to be extensively used in powering generative AI applications including ChatGPT. Big tech players continue to show keen interest in AI data centers, which is encouraging for NVIDIA. For instance, Microsoft in its latest 10-K annual report has indicated spending $108.4 billion on data centers over the next five years. NVIDIA\u2019s dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market space also gives the company a competitive edge over its peers. Most developers prefer NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software platform over the arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD ROCm software platform. NVIDIA accounts for 80% of the GPU market, which is projected to grow to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from the present $75.77 billion, according to Precedence Research. Lastly, the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent aggressive interest rate cuts, with more to come amid ebbing price pressure, are acting as a tailwind for NVIDIA\u2019s shares. This is because interest rate cuts would curtail borrowing costs, jack up profits, and won\u2019t disrupt cash flows much needed for growth initiatives (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates). NVIDIA Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist From the Fed\u2019s dovish stance to being the pioneer in the GPU market to blossoming data center business and sheer demand for AI chips, NVIDIA\u2019s shares are all set to climb further northward, making it a compelling buy.   Story Continues Brokers have collectively increased the average short-term price target of the NVDA stock by almost 9% to $150.36 from the last closing price of $138. The stock\u2019s highest short-term price target is at $200, an upside of 44.9%.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVIDIA\u2019s strength in the AI space also compelled Bank of America Corporation\u2019s BAC analyst Vivek Arya to recently increase the chip giant\u2019s short-term price target from $165 to $190. Last week, CFRA research too raised NVIDIA\u2019s short-term price target from $139 to $160.The NVDA stock further is trading above both the short-term 50-day moving average (DMA) and long-term 200-DMA at the moment, indicating a bullish trend, and a good time to consider investing in the stock.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMoreover, per price/earnings, the NVDA stock currently trades at 51.0X forward earnings, less than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple of 55.8X. So, buying the stock will burn a smaller hole in your pocket than its peers.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

As per AXA Investment Managers, the US dominated financial markets this year. The investment firm believes that the broader economy has been stronger than anticipated with GDP growth running at an annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2. The blue-chip benchmark, S&P 500 index, has surged ~22% on a YTD basis. Also, the US fixed-income markets saw strong returns. Overall, the financial markets were supported by the success of the US Fed in dealing with inflation.  Interest rates have started to move lower, with credit markets reflecting the strength of the broader US corporate sector, per AXA Investment Managers. At the start of October 2024, the investment firm mentioned that a 50:50 allocation to the S&P 500 Growth equity index and the ICE US High Yield bond index might have resulted in a return of ~18% YTD. S&P 500 Index \u2013 The Road Ahead Forbes believes that the prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. While the momentum in technology innovation, together with the environment of lower interest rates, should help the broader S&P 500 index, investors are required to be wary of certain risks. These include elevated valuations, global tensions, and uncertainty regarding the US presidential election. According to ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, which is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor (RIA), the ongoing innovation in AI and lower rates should help the\u00a0S&P 500 Index see growth in the range of 14.5% \u2013 19.6%. Another firm, Running Point Capital Advisors, expects the S&P 500 to see an increase of 7% \u2013 11% in 2025, with some volatility. As per the company, the influencing factors include economic growth, expansion in earnings, higher mergers and acquisitions activity, and a\u00a0favorable interest rate environment.

Sectors To Keep on Radar Forbes highlighted that investors are required to keep certain sectors, like technology, healthcare, and energy, on the\u00a0radar in 2025. As per IDC, worldwide spending on AI, which includes AI-enabled applications, infrastructure, and associated IT and business services, should more than double by 2028 to reach $632 billion. The incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, in a range of products should result in a\u00a0CAGR of ~29.0% over 2024-2028, which should help the broader technology sector.   Story Continues Definitive Healthcare believes that investors should see more device makers and pharmaceutical companies jump on the D2C bandwagon in 2025. Also, ICRA, a Credit Rating Agency, expects a strong financial outlook for the broader hospital industry in FY 2025. The optimistic outlook stems from the increasing incidence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases, a rise in per capita healthcare spending, increased medical tourism, and penetration of health insurance.US Energy Information Administration, in its short-term energy outlook report (October 2024), mentioned that the summer temperatures this year were warmer in the US as compared to last summer, mainly in the upper Midwest and Northeast regions, which supported pushing up the US electricity demand. EIA expects 2% more U.S. sales of electricity to ultimate customers in 2024 as compared to 2023, followed by another 2% expected growth in 2025. Overall, it expects electricity sales to increase throughout economic sectors. It projects that commercial electricity sales will rise by 3% this year followed by a 1% growth in 2025.

In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most profitable gaming stocks to invest in. Gaming Evolution: Key Trends Shaping the Market The gaming industry is currently experiencing significant changes driven by technology and evolving consumer preferences. One of the most notable trends is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming game development and player experiences. AI is being used to create more realistic environments and enhance gameplay by adapting to individual player styles. Here\u2019s a short excerpt from our previous article \u201c7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now\u201d that discusses this in more detail: \u201cAccording to Bernard Marr, a world-renowned futurist and author of \u2018Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society\u2019, generative AI is revolutionizing video game development by providing tools that enable developers to create engaging content, realistic visuals, and immersive gameplay experiences. Marr believes that generative AI can help developers create vast, unique game environments through procedural generation, allowing for dynamic gameplay experiences that change with each session.\u201d  Another major trend in the gaming market is the rise of microtransactions, particularly in free-to-play games. This monetization model has become increasingly prevalent as developers look for sustainable revenue streams. On March 24, CNBC reported that two of the largest video game companies in the US, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive, are increasingly relying on live-service games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases for their revenue. Microtransactions, which allow players to buy virtual items or features within games using real money, have become a significant source of income. Popular titles like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Clash Royale utilize this model, where players pay for ongoing updates and seasonal content through subscriptions or battle passes.  Mat Piscatella, executive director of video games at Circana, noted that the industry has shifted towards a \u201cbattle pass\u201d system, which packages seasonal content in a way that players find valuable. This approach has led to a more positive response from gamers, as they feel they receive consistent value for their money. The trend indicates that game publishers must continuously engage players with new content to maintain their interest in these live service games.   Story Continues According to Comscore\u2019s 2024 State of Gaming Report, around 82% of American gamers made in-game purchases in freemium games in 2023. The report also highlighted that 62% of adults over 18 participate in gaming activities, showcasing the widespread appeal of video games across various age groups.Esports is becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger audiences. The report found that 86% of Gen Z and 80% of millennials watched esports last year. Additionally, 53% of Gen Z and 61% of millennials interacted with esports content, highlighting the increasing popularity of competitive gaming among these age groups.MethodologyTo compile our list of the 7 most profitable gaming stocks to invest in, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest gaming companies.

On Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech. Cramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted. \u201c... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.\u201d  Cramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day\u2019s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn\u2019t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts. \u201cSee, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.\u201d  READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch He addressed the \u201calleged earnings disappointment,\u201d clarifying that he chose the term \u201calleged\u201d because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts.   Story Continues He reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment.Concluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked:\u201cBut the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.\u201d Our MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Hey, maybe he'll announce a giant sovereign state contract, something he's been hinting at. I would own, not trade\u2026 Nvidia.\u201d NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has established a commanding presence in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, significantly driven by its A100 and H100 chipsets. These products have been key contributors to the company's remarkable revenue and profit growth in recent years. With the introduction of the new Blackwell series GPUs, the company is positioned to strengthen its product lineup even further. CEO Jensen Huang has expressed enthusiasm regarding the overwhelming demand for Blackwell, highlighting the eagerness among many to engage with this innovative technology.Sovereign AI refers to a nation's ability to develop artificial intelligence utilizing its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. It highlights a country's control over its data and the AI it generates.During a speech at the World Government Summit in Dubai in June, Huang emphasized the necessity for countries to develop their own artificial intelligence infrastructure to fully harness economic potential while preserving cultural identity. He remarked that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is working to democratize access to AI, enabling rapid advancements in AI computing. Huang stated, \u201cThe rest of it is really up to you to take initiative, activate your industry, build the infrastructure, as fast as you can.\u201dIn October, Huang joined the King of Denmark to unveil the nation\u2019s largest sovereign AI supercomputer, aimed at facilitating advancements in areas such as quantum computing, clean energy, and biotechnology. Named Gefion, after a figure from Danish mythology, this supercomputer is powered by 1,528 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and employs NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking for connectivity.At a recent NVIDIA AI Summit, Huang also commended India's progress in artificial intelligence. He noted that over 2,000 AI companies in India are currently part of NVIDIA's incubation program, alongside more than 100,000 developers trained in AI.Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Zacks Equity Research   October 18, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.  Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA   Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA   Check price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.  This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.   Story Continues It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NVDA Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $2.81.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.

They\u2019re capable of drafting documents, summarizing web pages and, having been trained on vast quantities of data, accurately answering questions about nearly any topic.\nLLMs are at the core of many emerging use cases in generative AI, including digital assistants, conversational avatars and customer service agents.\nMany of the latest LLMs can run locally on PCs or workstations. This is useful for a variety of reasons: users can keep conversations and content private on-device, use AI without the internet, or simply take advantage of the powerful NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs in their system. Other models, because of their size and complexity, do no\u2019t fit into the local GPU\u2019s video memory (VRAM) and require hardware in large data centers.\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to accelerate part of a prompt on a data-center-class model locally on RTX-powered PCs using a technique called GPU offloading. This allows users to benefit from GPU acceleration without being as limited by GPU memory constraints.\nSize and Quality vs. Performance\nThere\u2019s a tradeoff between the model size and the quality of responses and the performance. In general, larger models deliver higher-quality responses, but run more slowly. With smaller models, performance goes up while quality goes down.\nThis tradeoff isn\u2019t always straightforward. There are cases where performance might be more important than quality. Some users may prioritize accuracy for use cases like content generation, since it can run in the background. A conversational assistant, meanwhile, needs to be fast while also providing accurate responses.\nThe most accurate LLMs, designed to run in the data center, are tens of gigabytes in size, and may not fit in a GPU\u2019s memory. This would traditionally prevent the application from taking advantage of GPU acceleration.\nHowever, GPU offloading uses part of the LLM on the GPU and part on the CPU. This allows users to take maximum advantage of GPU acceleration regardless of model size.\nOptimize AI Acceleration With GPU Offloading and LM Studio\nLM Studio is an application that lets users download and host LLMs on their desktop or laptop computer, with an easy-to-use interface that allows for extensive customization in how those models operate. LM Studio is built on top of llama.cpp, so it\u2019s fully optimized for use with GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nLM Studio and GPU offloading takes advantage of GPU acceleration to boost the performance of a locally hosted LLM, even if the model can\u2019t be fully loaded into VRAM.\nWith GPU offloading, LM Studio divides the model into smaller chunks, or \u201csubgraphs,\u201d which represent layers of the model architecture. Subgraphs aren\u2019t permanently fixed on the GPU, but loaded and unloaded as needed. With LM Studio\u2019s GPU offloading slider, users can decide how many of these layers are processed by the GPU.\nLM Studio\u2019s interface makes it easy to decide how much of an LLM should be loaded to the GPU.\nFor example, imagine using this GPU offloading technique with a large model like Gemma 2 27B. \u201c27B\u201d refers to the number of parameters in the model, informing an estimate as to how much memory is required to run the model.\nAccording to 4-bit quantization, a technique for reducing the size of an LLM without significantly reducing accuracy, each parameter takes up a half byte of memory. This means that the model should require about 13.5 billion bytes, or 13.5GB \u2014 plus some overhead, which generally ranges from 1-5GB.\nAccelerating this model entirely on the GPU requires 19GB of VRAM, available on the GeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU. With GPU offloading, the model can run on a system with a lower-end GPU and still benefit from acceleration.\nThe table above shows how to run several popular models of increasing size across a range of GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs. The maximum level of GPU offload is indicated for each combination. Note that even with GPU offloading, users still need enough system RAM to fit the whole model.\nIn LM Studio, it\u2019s possible to assess the performance impact of different levels of GPU offloading, compared with CPU only. The below table shows the results of running the same query across different offloading levels on a GeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU.\nDepending on the percent of the model offloaded to GPU, users see increasing throughput performance compared with running on CPUs alone. For the Gemma 2 27B model, performance goes from an anemic 2.1 tokens per second to increasingly usable speeds the more the GPU is used. This enables users to benefit from the performance of larger models that they otherwise would\u2019ve been unable to run.\nOn this particular model, even users with an 8GB GPU can enjoy a meaningful speedup versus running only on CPUs. Of course, an 8GB GPU can always run a smaller model that fits entirely in GPU memory and get full GPU acceleration.\nAchieving Optimal Balance\nLM Studio\u2019s GPU offloading feature is a powerful tool for unlocking the full potential of LLMs designed for the data center, like Gemma 2 27B, locally on RTX AI PCs. It makes larger, more complex models accessible across the entire lineup of PCs powered by GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nDownload LM Studio to try GPU offloading on larger models, or experiment with a variety of RTX-accelerated LLMs running locally on RTX AI PCs and workstations.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nInformation technology giants including Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro are teaming with NVIDIA to accelerate AI adoption. They\u2019re creating new jobs and training nearly half a million developers for the era of AI.\nThis great upskill is introducing a new wave of opportunity.\nIT is a leading Indian export, and IDC reports that the Indian domestic IT & Business Services market was valued at $14.5 billion in 2023. Now, India\u2019s technology leaders are taking on an expanded role as the industry shifts from providing IT services to consulting with global clients to meet the demand for front-office AI applications.\n\u201cIn the coming years, IT service investments will be driven by interest in gen AI,\u201d said Harish Krishnakumar, senior market analyst of IT Services at IDC India. \u201cEnterprises will continue engaging with IT service providers to develop potential use cases and POCs and also to transform and manage their complex IT infrastructure and applications.\u201d\nAgents of Innovation\nIndia\u2019s IT consulting giants are helping clients deploy AI with custom-built solutions that use the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. Clients can use these generative AI applications that include virtual agents that can learn, reason and take action to drive new levels of productivity and foster breakthroughs to help solve complex challenges across healthcare, climate, agriculture, manufacturing and more.\nConsulting experts are creating custom models with NVIDIA NeMo and deploying AI in production with NVIDIA NIM microservices. Using NVIDIA Blueprints\u00a0 \u2014 including a new AI Blueprint for customer service announced today at the NVIDIA AI Summit in India \u2014 consultants are helping global clients tailor AI agents for their unique needs.\nNeMo Curator is playing a key role in enabling consulting experts to train highly accurate sovereign AI for India and neighboring Southeast Asian countries. With NeMo Curator, consulting companies are processing high-quality data at scale in these low-resource languages and generating synthetic data to augment their existing datasets.\nWith NVIDIA RAPIDS, they\u2019re accelerating data analytics to create a robust foundation for AI development and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nAs manufacturing leaders seek to use physical AI to scale production, efficiency and safety, leading consulting firms are also tapping into the NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise development platform to create industrial AI digital twins.\nConsulting Leaders Create New Job Opportunities in AI\nGoldman Sachs forecasts that AI has the potential to automate up to 20% of work tasks in emerging economies, including India. NVIDIA\u2019s technology consulting partners are helping professionals and clients get ready for these AI-driven opportunities with full-stack NVIDIA AI.\n\nInfosys uses NVIDIA AI Enterprise for Infosys Topaz, an AI-first set of offerings, to help businesses quickly adopt and integrate generative AI into their operations. It has set up an NVIDIA Center of Excellence that\u2019s spearheading the reskilling of employees, development of solutions and adoption of NVIDIA technology across enterprises.\nTata Consultancy Services features NVIDIA AI Enterprise software in its industry solutions for automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, financial services, retail and many other industry verticals. It has trained 50,000+ AI associates to help clients develop and implement AI strategies that are scalable, sustainable and responsible.\nTech Mahindra offers the Tech Mahindra Optimized Framework built on NVIDIA AI Enterprise to advance sovereign large language model frameworks and bring generative AI into mainstream enterprise applications. As part of the framework, Tech Mahindra will establish a Center of Excellence and introduce Project Indus 2.0, an advanced Hindi-based AI model that uses a new NIM microservice for the Nemotron-4-Hindi 4B model. It has reskilled over 45,000 employees through its AI proficiency framework.\nWipro has built its Wipro Enterprise Generative AI Studio with NVIDIA AI Enterprise to accelerate industry-specific use cases for supply chain management, marketing campaigns, contact center agents, financial services, retail and more. It has trained more than 225,000 employees \u2014 nearly its entire workforce \u2014 to be ready to serve AI client demands.\n\nFaster Fixes: AI Blueprint for Customer Service Debuts to Speed Resolution\nThe new NVIDIA AI Blueprint for customer service can help India\u2019s consulting leaders quickly build custom AI virtual assistants for call center clients. These AI virtual assistants can recommend solutions to resolve issues and help people efficiently serve customers.\nPowered by NVIDIA NIM microservices and RAG, the blueprint shows how to build a solution that supports context-aware, multi-turn conversations and can provide general and personalized Q&A responses based on structured and unstructured data. Using NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails, developers can ensure that the AI virtual agents stay on topic.\nNVIDIA\u2019s consulting partners can help customers tailor the customer service agent blueprint to build unique virtual assistants using their preferred AI model \u2014 including sovereign LLMs from India-based model makers \u2014 and efficiently run it in production on the infrastructure of their choice with NVIDIA NIM.\nTry the new NVIDIA AI Blueprint for free.\nTo learn more, watch the NVIDIA AI Summit India keynote with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\nEditor\u2019s note: IDC figures and statement courtesy of IDC, \u201cWorldwide Semiannual Services Tracker,\u201d April 2024, and IDC: India\u2019s IT Services Market Grows by 6.6% in 2023 as Enterprises Focus on Critical Projects, press release from June 2024.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Events | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Omniverse Enterprise | Physical AI | RAPIDS | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

NVIDIA also announced a Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for Robotics, Autonomy and AI. Farnam Jahanian, Carnegie Mellon University president, Anthony Robbins, vice president, Federal at NVIDIA, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Joan Gabel, University of Pittsburgh chancellor, celebrated the signing of a ceremonial memorandum of understanding with NVIDIA on Oct. 14 (pictured above).\nPitt stands to strengthen its already impressive medical influence through access to the tech giant\u2019s hardware and software. NVIDIA chips power gaming systems, self-driving cars and data centers, but they also handle the accelerated computing that propels drug discovery, genomics and medical imaging through artificial intelligence.\nWith access to AI capabilities that few other institutions have, Pitt medical researchers will be able to expedite their current studies at a much faster pace. In pathology, for instance, this might include the use of AI for whole slide image assessment, which could expedite and enhance the accuracy of certain cancer diagnoses.\nBut the collaboration will be leveraged to do more than explore new ways to connect computing breakthroughs to improved health outcomes for everyone, says Anantha Shekhar, Pitt\u2019s senior vice chancellor for the health sciences and John and Gertrude Petersen Dean of the School of Medicine. It will enhance how the University carries out its mission as an educational leader, he says.\n\u201cAs a top-tier institution for the study of health sciences, it\u2019s imperative that we continually educate our entire academic community on the best ways to optimize AI for the equitable study, prevention, and treatment of disease,\u201d Shekhar says. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the potential for this collaboration to help us achieve this goal.\u201d\nRecognizing AI\u2019s potential to improve the quality of and speed delivery of medical care, Shekhar and Liron Pantanowitz, Maud L. Menten Professor and Chair of Pathology, recruited Hooman Rashidi to serve as Pitt Med\u2019s associate dean for AI in medicine. For his part, Rashidi sees NVIDIA\u2019s technology as a driver in all of this.\nDescribing generative AI as \u201cthe current and future orchestrator of most things we\u2019re going to do around AI,\u201d Rashidi says the right hardware is crucial. \u201cThat\u2019s where NVIDIA fits into all of this,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re the engine around all of the software tools we\u2019re developing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitt Health Sciences 2023 Points of Pride\n\n\nKey Facts & Figures that set our six top-ranked schools apart.\nAccessible text-only version \u00bb\nPDF version \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitt Med Magazine\n\n\nPitt Med magazine is the flagship publication of the School of Medicine, highlighting research, education, and innovation at the school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Sciences Strategic Communications\n\n\nHealth Sciences Strategic Communications is here to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Senior Vice Chancellor for the Health Sciences\nAlan Magee Scaife Hall, Suite 401\n3550 Terrace Street\nPittsburgh, PA 15261\n\u00a0\nGeneral: 412-648-8975\nDonation: 412-647-8301\n\u00a0\npitths@pitt.edu\n\u00a0\nHealth Sciences Strategic Communications\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitt Links\n\n\nAnimal Care and Use Committee\n\n\nCenter for Medical Innovation\n\n\nHSCRF Resources Portal\n\n\nInstitutional Biosafety Committee\n\n\nInstitutional Review Board\n\n\nPitt+Me\n\n\nProject Tycho\n\n\nOffice of Research Protections\n\n\niTarget Information Technology\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExternal Links\n\nAll of Us Pennsylvania\nPubMed\nMyUPMC\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH)\nDOD Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs\nVisit Pittsburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised 03/17/25Copyright 2025Send feedback about this site.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

An avid gamer, he\u2019d been using NVIDIA products for over a decade and was determined to be a part of the company\u2019s work developing transformative technologies.\nFollowing his graduation from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, with a computer engineering degree \u2014 and a few summer internships at another company under his belt \u2014 Madrigal joined NVIDIA as a full-time solutions architect in 2021.\n\u201cAs a new college grad, my impact at NVIDIA is exponentially higher than it would be anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a wide range of opportunities to work on projects across our business and make a real impact since day one.\u201d\n\nMadrigal started off in the new college graduate solutions architect rotation program, where he was exposed to technologies across the company over the course of 18 months. Solutions architects help solve customer challenges with NVIDIA technologies and bring them to the attention of NVIDIA\u2019s internal engineering teams, facilitating collaboration to develop new product features.\nDuring the program, Madrigal gained first-hand exposure to areas including machine learning operations, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, hardware engineering, supercomputing and data center systems.\nAfter rotating through different aspects of the program, solutions architects can choose their focus area. Madrigal picked an AI infrastructure role, where he could support cloud service providers as they set up infrastructure, build AI models and optimize system performance. His knowledge spans NVIDIA\u2019s ever-evolving suite of hardware and software products.\n\u201cAt NVIDIA, we\u2019re built around a culture of continuous learning and helping others \u2014 both of which help us better support our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nMadrigal\u2019s passion for customer success drives him to keep learning, using his\u00a0knowledge to help others use NVIDIA technology to make a real-world impact.\nHe is currently on a four-month stint embedded with NVIDIA\u2019s applied systems engineering team, where he\u2019s learning how to deploy firmware, run performance tests and complete initial setups of next-generation NVIDIA systems. By the end, he\u2019ll become a subject-matter expert for the solutions architect team.\n\u201cI wanted to gain a concrete understanding of our next-generation architecture and how it would affect my customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hands-on experience helps me truly understand how it works so I can best support my customers when I return to my team.\u201d\nFollow @nvidialife on Instagram and learn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The sovereign cloud market is projected to reach $250 billion by 2027, according to IDC. Meanwhile, ABI Research projects the market for foundation models will be $30 billion by 2027.\nSovereign clouds are built to meet strict data privacy and localization requirements. They\u2019re critical for industries handling sensitive data, such as telecommunications and financial services, as well as government agencies.\nF5 BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes deployed on NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs offers a secure and compliant AI networking infrastructure, allowing industries to adopt advanced AI capabilities without compromising data privacy.\nBy offloading tasks like load balancing, routing and security to the BlueField-3 DPU, F5 BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes efficiently routes AI prompts to LLM instances and reduces energy use. This ensures scalable AI performance while optimizing\u00a0 GPU resource utilization.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices, which accelerate the deployment of foundation models, will also benefit from the collaboration thanks to more efficient AI workload management.\nThe combined solutions from NVIDIA and F5 promise enhanced security and efficiency, key for industries transitioning to cloud-native infrastructures. With these innovations, industries in highly regulated sectors can scale AI applications securely and confidently, meeting the highest standards for data protection.\nEditor\u2019s note: The figures on the global sovereign cloud market come from IDC\u2019s \u201cWorldwide Sovereign Cloud Market Forecast, 2022\u20132027\u201d report, Doc # US49695922, published in November 2023.

Brave, a privacy-focused web browser, recently launched a smart AI assistant called Leo AI that, in addition to providing search results, helps users summarize articles and videos, surface insights from documents, answer questions and more.\nLeo AI helps users summarize articles and videos, surface insights from documents, answer questions and more.\nThe technology behind Brave and other AI-powered tools is a combination of hardware, libraries and ecosystem software that\u2019s optimized for the unique needs of AI.\nWhy Software Matters\nNVIDIA GPUs power the world\u2019s AI, whether running in the data center or on a local PC. They contain Tensor Cores, which are specifically designed to accelerate AI applications like Leo AI through massively parallel number crunching \u2014 rapidly processing the huge number of calculations needed for AI simultaneously, rather than doing them one at a time.\nBut great hardware only matters if applications can make efficient use of it. The software running on top of GPUs is just as critical for delivering the fastest, most responsive AI experience.\nThe first layer is the AI inference library, which acts like a translator that takes requests for common AI tasks and converts them to specific instructions for the hardware to run. Popular inference libraries include NVIDIA TensorRT, Microsoft\u2019s DirectML and the one used by Brave and Leo AI via Ollama, called llama.cpp.\nLlama.cpp is an open-source library and framework. Through CUDA \u2014 the NVIDIA software application programming interface that enables developers to optimize for GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs \u2014 provides Tensor Core acceleration for hundreds of models, including popular large language models (LLMs) like Gemma, Llama 3, Mistral and Phi.\nOn top of the inference library, applications often use a local inference server to simplify integration. The inference server handles tasks like downloading and configuring specific AI models so that the application doesn\u2019t have to.\nOllama is an open-source project that sits on top of llama.cpp and provides access to the library\u2019s features. It supports an ecosystem of applications that deliver local AI capabilities. Across the entire technology stack, NVIDIA works to optimize tools like Ollama for NVIDIA hardware to deliver faster, more responsive AI experiences on RTX.\nApplications like Brave\u2019s Leo AI can access RTX-powered AI acceleration to enhance user experiences.\nNVIDIA\u2019s focus on optimization spans the entire technology stack \u2014 from hardware to system software to the inference libraries and tools that enable applications to deliver faster, more responsive AI experiences on RTX.\nLocal vs. Cloud\nBrave\u2019s Leo AI can run in the cloud or locally on a PC through Ollama.\nThere are many benefits to processing inference using a local model. By not sending prompts to an outside server for processing, the experience is private and always available. For instance, Brave users can get help with their finances or medical questions without sending anything to the cloud. Running locally also eliminates the need to pay for unrestricted cloud access. With Ollama, users can take advantage of a wider variety of open-source models than most hosted services, which often support only one or two varieties of the same AI model.\nUsers can also interact with models that have different specializations, such as bilingual models, compact-sized models, code generation models and more.\nRTX enables a fast, responsive experience when running AI locally. Using the Llama 3 8B model with llama.cpp, users can expect responses up to 149 tokens per second \u2014 or approximately 110 words per second. When using Brave with Leo AI and Ollama, this means snappier responses to questions, requests for content summaries and more.\nNVIDIA internal throughput performance measurements on NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs, featuring a Llama 3 8B model with an input sequence length of 100 tokens, generating 100 tokens.\nGet Started With Brave With Leo AI and Ollama\nInstalling Ollama is easy \u2014 download the installer from the project\u2019s website and let it run in the background. From a command prompt, users can download and install a wide variety of supported models, then interact with the local model from the command line.\nFor simple instructions on how to add local LLM support via Ollama, read the company\u2019s blog. Once configured to point to Ollama, Leo AI will use the locally hosted LLM for prompts and queries. Users can also switch between cloud and local models at any time.\nBrave with Leo AI running on Ollama and accelerated by RTX is a great way to get more out of your browsing experience. You can even summarize and ask questions about AI Decoded blogs!\nDevelopers can learn more about how to use Ollama and llama.cpp in the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

NVIDIA is playing a key role, with NVIDIA GPU deployments expected to grow nearly 10x by year\u2019s end, creating the backbone for an AI-driven economy.\nTogether with NVIDIA, these companies are at the cutting edge of a shift Huang compared to the seismic change in computing introduced by IBM\u2019s System 360 in 1964, calling it the most profound platform shift since then.\n\u201cThis industry, the computing industry, is going to become the intelligence industry,\u201d Huang said, pointing to India\u2019s unique strengths to lead this industry,\u00a0 thanks to its enormous amounts of data and large population. \n\nWith this rapid expansion in infrastructure, AI factories will play a critical role in India\u2019s future, serving as the backbone of the nation\u2019s AI-driven growth.\nNVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaking with Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani at NVIDIA\u2019s AI Summit in Mumbai.\n\u201cIt makes complete sense that India should manufacture its own AI,\u201d Huang said. \u201cYou should not export data to import intelligence,\u201d he added, noting the importance of India building its own AI infrastructure.\nHuang identified three areas where AI will transform industries: sovereign AI, where nations use their own data to drive innovation; agentic AI, which automates knowledge-based work; and physical AI, which applies AI to industrial tasks through robotics and autonomous systems. India, Huang noted, is uniquely positioned to lead in all three areas.\nIndia\u2019s startups are already harnessing NVIDIA technology to drive innovation across industries and are positioning themselves as global players, bringing the country\u2019s AI solutions to the world.\nMeanwhile, India\u2019s robotics ecosystem is adopting NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse to power the next generation of physical AI, revolutionizing industries like manufacturing and logistics with advanced automation.\nHuang\u2019s also keynote featured a surprise appearance by actor and producer Akshay Kumar.\nFollowing Huang\u2019s remarks, the focus shifted to a fireside chat between Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, where the two leaders explored how AI will shape the future of Indian industries, particularly in sectors like energy, telecommunications and manufacturing.\nAmbani emphasized that AI is central to this continued growth. Reliance, in partnership with NVIDIA, is building AI factories to automate industrial tasks and transform processes in sectors like energy and manufacturing.\nBoth men discussed their companies\u2019 joint efforts to pioneer AI infrastructure in India.\nAmbani underscored the role of AI in public sector services, explaining how India\u2019s data combined with AI is already transforming governance and service delivery.\nHuang added that AI promises to democratize technology.\n\u201cThe ability to program AI is something that everyone can do \u2026 if AI could be put into the hands of every citizen, it would elevate and put into the hands of everyone this incredible capability,\u201d he said.\nHuang emphasized NVIDIA\u2019s role in preparing India\u2019s workforce for an AI-driven future.\nNVIDIA is partnering with India\u2019s IT giants such as Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro to upskill nearly half a million developers, ensuring India leads the AI revolution with a highly trained workforce.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s technical talent is unmatched,\u201d Huang said.\nAmbani echoed these sentiments, stressing that \u201cIndia will be one of the biggest intelligence markets,\u201d pointing to the nation\u2019s youthful, technically talented population.\nA Vision for India\u2019s AI-Driven Future\nAs the session drew to a close, Huang and Ambani reflected on their vision for India\u2019s AI-driven future.\nWith its vast talent pool, burgeoning tech ecosystem and immense data resources, the country, they agreed, has the potential to contribute globally in sectors such as energy, healthcare, finance and manufacturing.\n\u201cThis cannot be done by any one company, any one individual, but we all have to work together to bring this intelligence age safely to the world so that we can create a more equal world, a more prosperous world,\u201d Ambani said.\nHuang echoed the sentiment, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s make it a promise today that we will work together so that India can take advantage of the intelligence revolution that\u2019s ahead of us.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | HardwareTags: Physical AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  ChatGPT marked the big bang moment of generative AI. Answers can be generated in response to nearly any query, helping transform digital work such as content creation, customer service, software development and business operations for knowledge workers.\nPhysical AI, the embodiment of artificial intelligence in humanoids, factories and other devices within industrial systems, has yet to experience its breakthrough moment.\n\n\u00a0\nThis has held back industries such as transportation and mobility, manufacturing, logistics and robotics. But that\u2019s about to change thanks to three computers bringing together advanced training, simulation and inference.\nThe Rise of Multimodal, Physical AI\nFor 60 years, \u201cSoftware 1.0\u201d \u2014 serial code written by human programmers \u2014 ran on general-purpose computers powered by CPUs.\nThen, in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, mentored by Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition with AlexNet, a revolutionary deep learning model for image classification.\nThis marked the industry\u2019s first contact with AI. The breakthrough of machine learning \u2014 neural networks running on GPUs \u2014 jump-started the era of Software 2.0.\n\nToday, software writes software. The world\u2019s computing workloads are shifting from general-purpose computing on CPUs to accelerated computing on GPUs, leaving Moore\u2019s law far behind.\nWith generative AI, multimodal transformer and diffusion models have been trained to generate responses.\nLarge language models are one-dimensional, able to predict the next token, in modes like letters or words. Image- and video-generation models are two-dimensional, able to predict the next pixel.\nNone of these models can understand or interpret the three-dimensional world. And that\u2019s where physical AI comes in.\nPhysical AI models can perceive, understand, interact with and navigate the physical world with generative AI. With accelerated computing, multimodal physical AI breakthroughs and large-scale physically based simulations are allowing the world to realize the value of physical AI through robots.\nA robot is a system that can perceive, reason, plan, act and learn. Robots are often thought of as autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), manipulator arms or humanoids. But there are many more types of robotic embodiments.\nIn the near future, everything that moves, or that monitors things that move, will be autonomous robotic systems. These systems will be capable of sensing and responding to their environments.\nEverything from surgical rooms to data centers, warehouses to factories, even traffic control systems or entire smart cities will transform from static, manually operated systems to autonomous, interactive systems embodied by physical AI.\n\nThe Next Frontier: Humanoids Robots\nHumanoid robots are an ideal general-purpose robotic manifestation because they can operate efficiently in environments built for humans, while requiring minimal adjustments for deployment and operation.\nThe global market for humanoid robots is expected to reach $38 billion by 2035, a more than sixfold increase from the roughly $6 billion for the period forecast nearly two years ago, according to Goldman Sachs.\nResearchers and developers around the world are racing to build this next wave of robots.\n\nThree Computers to Develop Physical AI\u00a0\nTo develop humanoid robots, three accelerated computer systems are required to handle physical AI and robot training, simulation and runtime. Two computing advancements are accelerating humanoid robot development: multimodal foundation models and scalable, physically based simulations of robots and their worlds.\nBreakthroughs in generative AI are bringing 3D perception, control, skill planning and intelligence to robots. Robot simulation at scale lets developers refine, test and optimize robot skills in a virtual world that mimics the laws of physics \u2014 helping reduce real-world data acquisition costs and ensuring they can perform in safe, controlled settings.\nNVIDIA has built three computers and accelerated development platforms to enable developers to create physical AI.\nFirst, models are trained on a supercomputer. Developers can use NVIDIA NeMo on the NVIDIA DGX platform to train and fine-tune powerful foundation and generative AI models. They can also tap into NVIDIA Project GR00T, an initiative to develop general-purpose foundation models for humanoid robots to enable them to understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human actions.\nSecond, NVIDIA Omniverse, running on NVIDIA OVX servers, provides the development platform and simulation environment for testing and optimizing physical AI with application programming interfaces and frameworks like NVIDIA Isaac Sim.\nDevelopers can use Isaac Sim to simulate and validate robot models, or generate massive amounts of physically-based synthetic data to bootstrap robot model training. Researchers and developers can also use NVIDIA Isaac Lab, an open-source robot learning framework that powers robot reinforcement learning and imitation learning, to help accelerate robot policy training and refinement.\n\nLastly, trained AI models are deployed to a runtime computer. NVIDIA Jetson Thor robotics computers are specifically designed for compact, on-board computing needs. An ensemble of models consisting of control policy, vision and language models composes the robot brain and is deployed on a power-efficient, on-board edge computing system.\nDepending on their workflows and challenge areas, robot makers and foundation model developers can use as many of the accelerated computing platforms and systems as needed.\nBuilding the Next Wave of Autonomous Facilities\nRobotic facilities result from a culmination of all of these technologies.\nManufacturers like Foxconn or logistics companies like Amazon Robotics can orchestrate teams of autonomous robots to work alongside human workers and monitor factory operations through hundreds or thousands of sensors.\n\nThese autonomous warehouses, plants and factories will have digital twins. The digital twins are used for layout planning and optimization, operations simulation and, most importantly, robot fleet software-in-the-loop testing.\nBuilt on Omniverse, \u201cMega\u201d is a blueprint for factory digital twins that enables industrial enterprises to test and optimize their robot fleets in simulation before deploying them to physical factories. This helps ensure seamless integration, optimal performance and minimal disruption.\n\nMega lets developers populate their factory digital twins with virtual robots and their AI models, or the brains of the robots. Robots in the digital twin execute tasks by perceiving their environment, reasoning, planning their next motion and, finally, completing planned actions.\nThese actions are simulated in the digital environment by the world simulator in Omniverse, and the results are perceived by the robot brains through Omniverse sensor simulation.\nWith sensor simulations, the robot brains decide the next action, and the loop continues, all while Mega meticulously tracks the state and position of every element within the factory digital twin.\n\nThis advanced software-in-the-loop testing methodology enables industrial enterprises to simulate and validate changes within the safe confines of the Omniverse digital twin, helping them anticipate and mitigate potential issues to reduce risk and costs during real-world deployment.\nEmpowering the Developer Ecosystem With NVIDIA Technology\nNVIDIA accelerates the work of the global ecosystem of robotics developers and robot foundation model builders with three computers.\nUniversal Robots, a Teradyne Robotics company, used NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator, Isaac accelerated libraries and AI models, and NVIDIA Jetson Orin to build UR AI Accelerator, a ready-to-use hardware and software toolkit that enables cobot developers to build applications, accelerate development and reduce the time to market of AI products.\nRGo Robotics used NVIDIA Isaac Perceptor to help its wheel.me AMRs work everywhere, all the time, and make intelligent decisions by giving them human-like perception and visual-spatial information.\nHumanoid robot makers including 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Galbot, Mentee, Sanctuary AI, Unitree Robotics and XPENG Robotics are adopting NVIDIA\u2019s robotics development platform.\nBoston Dynamics is using Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab to build quadrupeds and humanoid robots to augment human productivity, tackle labor shortages and prioritize safety in warehouses.\nFourier is tapping into Isaac Sim to train humanoid robots to operate in fields that demand high levels of interaction and adaptability, such as scientific research, healthcare and manufacturing.\nUsing Isaac Lab and Isaac Sim, Galbot advanced the development of a large-scale robotic dexterous grasp dataset called DexGraspNet that can be applied to different dexterous robotic hands, as well as a simulation environment for evaluating dexterous grasping models.\nField AI developed risk-bounded multitask and multipurpose foundation models for robots to safely operate in outdoor field environments, using the Isaac platform and Isaac Lab.\nThe era of physical AI is here \u2014 and it\u2019s transforming the world\u2019s heavy industries and robotics.\nGet started with NVIDIA Robotics.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Digital Twin | Events | Industrial and Manufacturing | Isaac | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | NVIDIA NeMo | Omniverse | Physical AI | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA -

By year\u2019s end, they\u2019ll have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployment in the country by nearly 10x compared to 18 months ago.\nTens of thousands of NVIDIA Hopper GPUs will be added to build AI factories \u2014 large-scale data centers for producing AI \u2014\u00a0 that support India\u2019s large businesses, startups and research centers running AI workloads in the cloud and on premises. This will cumulatively provide nearly 180 exaflops of compute to power innovation in healthcare, financial services and digital content creation.\nAnnounced today at the NVIDIA AI Summit, taking place in Mumbai through Oct. 25, this buildout of accelerated computing technology is led by data center provider Yotta Data Services, global digital ecosystem enabler Tata Communications, cloud service provider E2E Networks and original equipment manufacturer Netweb.\nTheir systems will enable developers to harness domestic data center resources powerful enough to fuel a new wave of large language models, complex scientific visualizations and industrial digital twins that could propel India to the forefront of AI-accelerated innovation.\nYotta Brings AI Systems and Services to Shakti Cloud\nYotta Data Services is providing Indian businesses, government departments and researchers access to managed cloud services through its Shakti Cloud platform to boost generative AI adoption and AI education.\nPowered by thousands of NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, these computing resources are complemented by NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end, cloud-native software platform that accelerates data science pipelines and streamlines development and deployment of production-grade copilots and other generative AI applications.\nWith NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Yotta customers can access NVIDIA NIM, a collection of microservices for optimized AI inference, and NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints, a set of customizable reference architectures for generative AI applications.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nArtificial intelligence is transforming cybersecurity with new generative AI tools and capabilities that were once the stuff of science fiction. And like many of the heroes in science fiction, they\u2019re arriving just in time.\nAI-enhanced cybersecurity can detect and respond to potential threats in real time \u2014 often before human analysts even become aware of them. It can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate a breach. And AI agents can automate routine security tasks, freeing up human experts to focus on more complex challenges.\nAll of these capabilities start with software, so NVIDIA has introduced an NVIDIA Blueprint for container security that developers can adapt to meet their own application requirements.\nThe blueprint uses NVIDIA NIM\u00a0microservices, the NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity AI framework, NVIDIA cuVS and NVIDIA RAPIDS accelerated data analytics to help accelerate analysis of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) at enterprise scale \u2014 from days to just seconds.\nAll of this is included in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a cloud-native software platform for developing and deploying secure, supported production AI applications.\nDeloitte Secures Software With NVIDIA AI\nDeloitte is among the first to use the NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprint for container security in its cybersecurity solutions, which supports agentic analysis of open-source software to help enterprises build secure AI. It can help enterprises enhance and simplify cybersecurity by improving efficiency and reducing the time needed to identify threats and potential adversarial activity.\n\u201cCybersecurity has emerged as a critical pillar in protecting digital infrastructure in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d said Mike Morris, managing director, Deloitte & Touche LLP. \u201cBy incorporating NVIDIA\u2019s NIM Agent Blueprint into our cybersecurity solutions, we\u2019re able to offer our clients improved speed and accuracy in identifying and mitigating potential security threats.\u201d\nSecuring Software With Generative AI\nVulnerability detection and resolution is a top use case for generative AI in software delivery, according to IDC(1).\nThe NIM Agent Blueprint for container security includes everything an enterprise developer needs to build and deploy customized generative AI applications for rapid vulnerability analysis of software containers.\nSoftware containers incorporate large numbers of packages and releases, some of which may be subject to security vulnerabilities. Traditionally, security analysts would need to review each of these packages to understand potential security exploits across any software deployment.\nThese manual processes are tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. They\u2019re also difficult to automate effectively because of the complexity of aligning software packages, dependencies, configurations and the operating environment.\nWith generative AI, cybersecurity applications can rapidly digest and decipher information across a wide range of data sources, including natural language, to better understand the context in which potential vulnerabilities could be exploited.\nEnterprises can then create cybersecurity AI agents that take action on this generative AI intelligence. The NIM Agent Blueprint for container security enables quick, automatic and actionable CVE risk analysis using large language models and retrieval-augmented generation for agentic AI applications. It helps developers and security teams protect software with AI to enhance accuracy, efficiency and streamline potential issues for human agents to investigate.\nBlueprints for Cybersecurity Success\nThe new NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprint for container security includes the NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity AI framework to reduce the time and cost associated with identifying, capturing and acting on threats. This brings a new level of security to the data center, cloud and edge.\nThe GPU-accelerated, end-to-end AI framework enables developers to create optimized applications for filtering, processing and classifying large volumes of streaming cybersecurity data.\nBuilt on NVIDIA RAPIDS software, Morpheus accelerates data processing workloads at enterprise scale. It uses the power of RAPIDS cuDF for fast and efficient data operations, ensuring downstream pipelines harness all available GPU cores for complex agentic AI tasks.\nMorpheus also extends human analysts\u2019 capabilities by automating real-time analysis and responses, producing synthetic data to train AI models that identify risks accurately and to run what-if scenarios.\nThe NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprint for container security is available now.

With a 72-GPU NVIDIA NVLink domain, it acts as a single, massive GPU and delivers 30x faster real-time trillion-parameter large language model inference than the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU.\nThe NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform, which now includes the next-generation NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC\u2122, supports OCP\u2019s Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) and Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC) standards. This allows customers to use Spectrum-X\u2019s adaptive routing and telemetry-based congestion control to accelerate Ethernet performance for scale-out AI infrastructure.\nConnectX-8 SuperNICs feature accelerated networking at speeds of up to 800Gb/s and programmable packet processing engines optimized for massive-scale AI workloads. ConnectX-8 SuperNICs for OCP 3.0 will be available next year, equipping organizations to build highly flexible networks.\nCritical Infrastructure for Data Centers\r\nAs the world transitions from general-purpose to accelerated and AI computing, data center infrastructure is becoming increasingly complex. To simplify the development process, NVIDIA is working closely with 40+ global electronics makers that provide key components to create AI factories.\nAdditionally, a broad array of partners are innovating and building on top of the Blackwell platform, including Meta, which plans to contribute its Catalina AI rack architecture based on GB200 NVL72 to OCP. This provides computer makers with flexible options to build high compute density systems and meet the growing performance and energy efficiency needs of data centers.\n\u201cNVIDIA has been a significant contributor to open computing standards for years, including their high-performance computing platform that has been the foundation of our Grand Teton server for the past two years,\u201d said Yee Jiun Song, vice president of engineering at Meta. \u201cAs we progress to meet the increasing computational demands of large-scale artificial intelligence, NVIDIA\u2019s latest contributions in rack design and modular architecture will help speed up the development and implementation of AI infrastructure across the industry.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s contributions to the Open Compute Project at the 2024 OCP Global Summit, taking place at the San Jose Convention Center from Oct. 15-17.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Blackwell accelerated computing platform, NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform, NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, NVIDIA\u00a0NVLink, NVIDIA\u00a0HGX\u00a0H100, NVIDIA\u00a0MGX\u00a0modular architecture, NVIDIA Grace\u00a0CPUs, NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, and NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC; NVIDIA contributing foundational elements of its NVIDIA Blackwell accelerated computing platform design to the Open Compute Project (OCP) and broaden NVIDIA Spectrum-X support for OCP standards; the benefits and impact of NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with third parties; third parties using or adopting our products or technologies; NVIDIA working alongside industry leaders to shape specifications and designs that can be widely adopted across the entire data center; by advancing open standards, NVIDIA helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future; as the world transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated and AI computing, data center infrastructure becoming increasingly complex; and the timing and themes of the 2024 OCP Global Summit are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

It\u2019s about building a greener world.\nFrom optimizing energy use to reducing emissions, AI and accelerated computing are helping industries tackle some of the world\u2019s toughest environmental challenges.\nAs Joshua Parker, senior director of corporate sustainability at NVIDIA, explains in the latest episode of NVIDIA\u2019s AI Podcast, these technologies are powering a new era of energy efficiency.\nParker, a seasoned sustainability professional with a background in law and engineering, has led sustainability initiatives at major companies like Western Digital, where he developed corporate sustainability strategies. His expertise spans corporate sustainability, intellectual property and environmental impact.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 NVIDIA\u2019s Josh Parker on How AI and Accelerated Computing Drive Sustainability \u2013 Ep. 233\nAI can, in fact, help reduce energy consumption. And it\u2019s doing it in some surprising ways.\nAI systems themselves use energy, of course, but the big story is how AI and accelerated computing are helping other systems save energy. Take data centers, for instance.\nThey\u2019re the backbone of AI, housing the powerful systems that crunch the data needed for AI to work in services like chatbots, AI-powered search and content generation. Globally, data centers account for about 2% of total energy consumption, and AI-specific centers represent only a tiny fraction of that.\n\u201cAI still accounts for a tiny, tiny fraction of overall energy consumption globally,\u201d Parker said. Yet, the potential for AI to optimize energy use is vast.\nDespite this, AI\u2019s real superpower lies in its ability to optimize.\nHow? By using accelerated computing platforms that combine GPUs and CPUs. GPUs are designed to handle complex computations quickly and efficiently.\nIn fact, these systems can be up to 20x more energy-efficient than traditional CPU-only systems for AI inference and training, Parker notes.\nThis progress has contributed to massive gains in energy efficiency over the past eight years, which is part of the reason AI is now able to tackle increasingly complex problems.\nWhat Is Accelerated Computing?\nAt its core, accelerated computing is about doing more with less.\nIt involves using specialized hardware \u2014 like GPUs \u2014 to perform tasks faster and with less energy.\nThis isn\u2019t just theoretical. \u201cThe change in efficiency is really, really dramatic,\u201d Parker emphasized.\n\u201cIf you compare the energy efficiency for AI inference from eight years ago until today, [it\u2019s] 45,000 times more energy efficient,\u201d Parker said.\nThis matters because as AI becomes more widespread, the demand for computing power grows.\nAccelerated computing helps companies scale their AI operations without consuming massive amounts of energy.\nThis energy efficiency is key to AI\u2019s ability to tackle some of today\u2019s biggest sustainability challenges.\nAI in Action: Tackling Climate Change\nAI isn\u2019t just saving energy \u2014 it\u2019s helping to fight climate change.\n\u201cAI and accelerated computing in general are game-changers when it comes to weather and climate modeling and simulation,\u201d Parker said.\nFor instance, AI-enhanced weather forecasting is becoming more accurate, allowing industries and governments to prepare for climate-related events like hurricanes or floods, Parker explained.\nThe better we can predict these events, the better we can prepare for them, which means fewer resources wasted and less damage done.\nAnother key area is the rise of digital twins \u2014 virtual models of physical environments.\nThese AI-powered simulations allow companies to optimize energy consumption in real time, without having to make costly changes in the physical world. In one case, using a digital twin helped a company achieve a 10% reduction in energy use, Parker said.\nThat may sound small, but scale it across industries, and the impact is huge.\nAI is also playing a crucial role in developing new materials for renewable energy technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles, helping accelerate the transition to clean energy.\nCan AI Make Data Centers More Sustainable?\nAI needs data centers to operate, and, as AI grows, so does the demand for computing power. But data centers don\u2019t have to be energy hogs. In fact, they can be part of the sustainability solution.\nOne major innovation is direct-to-chip liquid cooling. This technology allows data centers to cool their systems much more efficiently than traditional air conditioning methods, which are often energy-intensive.\n\u201cOur recommended design for the data centers for our new B200 chip is focused all on direct-to-chip liquid cooling,\u201d Parker explained. By cooling directly at the chip level, this method saves energy, helping data centers stay cool without guzzling power.\nAs AI scales up, the future of data centers will depend on designing for energy efficiency from the ground up.\nThat means integrating renewable energy, using energy storage solutions and continuing to innovate with cooling technologies.\nThe goal is to create green data centers that can meet the world\u2019s growing demand for compute power without increasing their carbon footprint.\n\u201cThe compute density is so high that it makes more sense to invest in the cooling because you\u2019re getting so much more compute for that same single direct-to-chip cooling element,\u201d Parker said.\nThe Role of AI in Building a Sustainable Future\nAI is not just a tool for optimizing systems \u2014 it\u2019s a driver of sustainable innovation.\nFrom improving the efficiency of energy grids to enhancing supply chain logistics, AI is leading the charge in reducing waste and emissions.\n\u201cAI, I firmly believe, is going to be the best tool that we\u2019ve ever seen to help us achieve more sustainability and more sustainable outcomes,\u201d Parker said.\n\nThe AI Podcast \u00b7 NVIDIA\u2019s Josh Parker on How AI and Accelerated Computing Drive Sustainability \u2013 Ep. 233\nRegister for the NVIDIA AI Summit DC\u00a0to explore how AI and accelerated computing are shaping the future of energy efficiency and climate solutions.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | The AI PodcastTags: Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The new AI supercomputer was symbolically turned on by King Frederik X of Denmark, Huang and Nadia Carlsten, CEO of DCAI, at an event in Copenhagen.\nHuang sat down with Carlsten, a quantum computing industry leader, to discuss the public-private initiative to build one of the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputers in collaboration with NVIDIA.\nThe Gefion AI supercomputer comes to Copenhagen to serve industry, startups and academia.\n\u201cGefion is going to be a factory of intelligence. This is a new industry that never existed before. It sits on top of the IT industry. We\u2019re inventing something fundamentally new,\u201d Huang said.\nThe launch of Gefion is an important milestone for Denmark in establishing its own sovereign AI. Sovereign AI can be achieved when a nation has the capacity to produce artificial intelligence with its own data, workforce, infrastructure and business networks. Having a supercomputer on national soil provides a foundation for countries to use their own infrastructure as they build AI models and applications that reflect their unique culture and language.\n\u201cWhat country can afford not to have this infrastructure, just as every country realizes you have communications, transportation, healthcare, fundamental infrastructures \u2014 the fundamental infrastructure of any country surely must be the manufacturer of intelligence,\u201d said Huang. \u201cFor Denmark to be one of the handful of countries in the world that has now initiated on this vision is really incredible.\u201d\nThe new supercomputer is expected to address global challenges with insights into infectious disease, climate change and food security. Gefion is now being prepared for users, and a pilot phase will begin to bring in projects that seek to use AI to accelerate progress, including in such areas as quantum computing, drug discovery and energy efficiency.\n\u201cThe era of computer-aided drug discovery must be within this decade. I\u2019m hoping that what the computer did to the technology industry, it will do for digital biology,\u201d Huang said.\n\nSupporting Next Generation of Breakthroughs With Gefion\nThe Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) is in the pilot and aims to deliver faster and more accurate weather forecasts. It promises to reduce forecast times from hours to minutes while greatly reducing the energy footprint required for these forecasts when compared with traditional methods.\nResearchers from the University of Copenhagen are tapping into Gefion to implement and carry out a large-scale distributed simulation of quantum computer circuits. Gefion enables the simulated system to increase from 36 to 40 entangled qubits, which brings it close to what\u2019s known as \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d or essentially outperforming a traditional computer while using less resources.\nThe University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark are working together on a multi-modal genomic foundation model for discoveries in disease mutation analysis and vaccine design. Their model will be used to improve signal detection and the functional understanding of genomes, made possible by the capability to train LLMs on Gefion.\nStartup Go Autonomous seeks training time on Gefion to develop an AI model that understands and uses multi-modal input from both text, layout and images. Another startup, Teton, is building an AI Care Companion with large video pretraining, using Gefion.\nAddressing Global Challenges With Leading Supercomputer\nThe Gefion supercomputer and ongoing collaborations with NVIDIA will position Denmark, with its renowned research community, to pursue the world\u2019s leading scientific challenges with enormous social impact as well as large-scale projects across industries.\nWith Gefion, researchers will be able to work with industry experts at NVIDIA to co-develop solutions to complex problems, including research in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and protein design using the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform.\nScientists will also be collaborating with NVIDIA on fault-tolerant quantum computing using\u00a0NVIDIA CUDA-Q, the open-source hybrid quantum computing platform.\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Human error remains a serious problem and the primary cause of these incidents.\n\u201cImproving safety on our roads is critical,\u201d Shapiro said, noting that NVIDIA has been working for over two decades with the auto industry, including advanced driver assistance systems and fully autonomous driving technology development.\nNVIDIA\u2019s approach to AV development is centered on the integration of three computers: one for training the AI, one for simulation to test and validate the AI, and one in the vehicle to process sensor data in real time to make safe driving decisions. Together, these systems enable continuous development cycles, always improving the AV software in performance and safety.\nRosekind, a highly regarded automotive safety expert, spoke about the patchwork of regulations that exists across the U.S., explaining that federal agencies focus on the vehicle, while the states focus on the operator, including driver education, insurance and licensing.\nPavone commented on the emergence of new tools that allow researchers and developers to rethink how AV development is carried out, as a result of the explosion of new technologies related to generative AI and neural rendering, among others.\nThese technologies are enabling new developments in simulation, for example to generate complex scenarios aimed at stress testing vehicles for safety purposes. And they\u2019re harnessing foundation models, such as vision language models, to allow developers to build more robust autonomy software, Pavone said.\n\nOne of the relevant and timely topics discussed during the panel was an announcement made during the AI Summit by MITRE, a government-sponsored nonprofit research organization.\nMITRE announced its partnership with Mcity at the University of Michigan to develop a virtual and physical AV validation platform for industry deployment.\nMITRE will use Mcity\u2019s simulation tools and a digital twin of its Mcity Test Facility, a real-world AV test environment in its digital proving ground. The jointly developed platform will deliver physically based sensor simulation enabled by NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX applications programming interfaces.\nBy combining these simulation capabilities with the MITRE digital proving ground reporting and analysis framework, developers will be able to perform exhaustive testing in a simulated world to safely validate AVs before real-world deployment.\n\nRosekind commented: The MITRE announcement \u201crepresents an opportunity to have a trusted source who\u2019s done this in many other areas, especially in aviation, to create an independent, neutral setting to test safety assurance.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the most exciting things about this endeavor is that simulation is going to have a key role,\u201d added Pavone. \u201cSimulation allows you to test very dangerous conditions in a repeatable and varied way, so you can simulate different cases at scale.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of simulation,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s repeatable, it\u2019s controllable. We can control the weather in the simulation. We can change the time of day, and then we can control all the scenarios and inject hazards. Once the simulation is created, we can run it over and over, and as the software develops, we can ensure we are solving the problem, and can fine-tune as necessary.\u201d\nThe panel wrapped up with a reminder that the key goal of autonomous driving is one that businesses and regulators alike share: to reduce death and injuries on our roadways.\nWatch a replay of the session. To learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to bringing safety to our roads, read the NVIDIA Self-Driving Safety Report.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | NVIDIA DRIVE | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It requires complex computation \u2014 involving electromagnetic physics, photochemistry, computational geometry, iterative optimization and distributed computing. A typical foundry dedicates massive data centers for this computation, and yet this step has traditionally been a bottleneck in bringing new technology nodes and computer architectures to market.\nComputational lithography is also the most compute-intensive workload in the entire semiconductor design and manufacturing process. It consumes tens of billions of hours per year on CPUs in the leading-edge foundries. A typical mask set for a chip can take 30 million or more hours of CPU compute time, necessitating large data centers within semiconductor foundries. With accelerated computing, 350 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU-based systems can now replace 40,000 CPU systems, accelerating production time, while reducing costs, space and power.\nNVIDIA cuLitho brings accelerated computing to the field of computational lithography. Moving cuLitho to production is enabling TSMC to accelerate the development of next-generation chip technology, just as current production processes are nearing the limits of what physics makes possible.\n\u201cOur work with NVIDIA to integrate GPU-accelerated computing in the TSMC workflow has resulted in great leaps in performance, dramatic throughput improvement, shortened cycle time and reduced power requirements,\u201d said Dr. C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC, at the GTC conference earlier this year.\nNVIDIA has also developed algorithms to apply generative AI to enhance the value of the cuLitho platform. A new generative AI workflow has been shown to deliver an additional 2x speedup on top of the accelerated processes enabled through cuLitho.\nThe application of generative AI enables creation of a near-perfect inverse mask or inverse solution to account for diffraction of light involved in computational lithography. The final mask is then derived by traditional and physically rigorous methods, speeding up the overall optical proximity correction process by 2x.\nThe use of optical proximity correction in semiconductor lithography is now three decades old. While the field has benefited from numerous contributions over this period, rarely has it seen a transformation quite as rapid as the one provided by the twin technologies of accelerated computing and AI. These together allow for the more accurate simulation of physics and the realization of mathematical techniques that were once prohibitively resource-intensive.\nThis enormous speedup of computational lithography accelerates the creation of every single mask in the fab, which speeds the total cycle time for developing a new technology node. More importantly, it makes possible new calculations that were previously impractical.\nFor example, while inverse lithography techniques have been described in the scientific literature for two decades, an accurate realization at full chip scale has been largely precluded because the computation takes too long. With cuLitho, that\u2019s no longer the case. Leading-edge foundries will use it to ramp up inverse and curvilinear solutions that will help create the next generation of powerful semiconductors.\nImage courtesy of TSMC.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Industrial and Manufacturing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nAI chatbots use generative AI to provide responses based on a single interaction. A person makes a query and the chatbot uses natural language processing to reply.\nThe next frontier of artificial intelligence is agentic AI, which uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems. And it\u2019s set to enhance productivity and operations across industries.\nAn AI agent for customer service, for instance, could operate beyond simple question-answering. With agentic AI, it could check a user\u2019s outstanding balance and recommend which accounts could pay it off \u2014 all while waiting for the user to make a decision so it could complete the transaction accordingly when prompted.\nAgentic AI systems ingest vast amounts of data from multiple data sources and third-party applications to independently analyze challenges, develop strategies and execute tasks. Businesses are implementing agentic AI to personalize customer service, streamline software development and even facilitate patient interactions.\n\nAgentic AI uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to solve complex, multi-step problems.\nHow Does Agentic AI Work?\nAgentic AI uses a four-step process for problem-solving:\n\nPerceive: AI agents gather and process data from various sources, such as sensors, databases and digital interfaces. This involves extracting meaningful features, recognizing objects or identifying relevant entities in the environment.\nReason: A large language model acts as the orchestrator, or reasoning engine, that understands tasks, generates solutions and coordinates specialized models for specific functions like content creation, visual processing or recommendation systems. This step uses techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to access proprietary data sources and deliver accurate, relevant outputs.\nAct: By integrating with external tools and software via application programming interfaces, agentic AI can quickly execute tasks based on the plans it has formulated. Guardrails can be built into AI agents to help ensure they execute tasks correctly. For example, a customer service AI agent may be able to process claims up to a certain amount, while claims above the amount would have to be approved by a human.\nLearn: Agentic AI continuously improves through a feedback loop, or\n\u201cdata flywheel,\u201d where the data generated from its interactions is fed into the system to enhance models. This ability to adapt and become more effective over time offers businesses a powerful tool for driving better decision-making and operational efficiency.\n\nFueling Agentic AI With Enterprise Data\nAcross industries and job functions, generative AI is transforming organizations by turning vast amounts of data into actionable knowledge, helping employees work more efficiently.\nAI agents build on this potential by accessing diverse data through accelerated AI query engines, which process, store and retrieve information to enhance generative AI models. A key technique for achieving this is RAG, which allows AI to intelligently retrieve the right information from a broader range of data sources.\nOver time, AI agents learn and improve by creating a data flywheel, where data generated through interactions is fed back into the system, refining models and increasing their effectiveness.\nThe end-to-end NVIDIA AI platform, including NVIDIA NeMo microservices for developing custom generative AI applications, provides the ability to manage and access data efficiently, which is crucial for building responsive agentic AI applications.\nAgentic AI in Action\nThe potential applications of agentic AI are vast, limited only by creativity and expertise. From simple tasks like generating and distributing content to more complex use cases such as orchestrating enterprise software, AI agents are transforming industries.\n\nCustomer Service: AI agents are improving customer support by enhancing self-service capabilities and automating routine communications. Over half of service professionals report significant improvements in customer interactions, reducing response times and boosting satisfaction.\nThere\u2019s also growing interest in digital humans \u2014 AI-powered agents that embody a company\u2019s brand and offer lifelike, real-time interactions to help sales representatives answer customer queries or solve issues directly when call volumes are high.\nContent Creation: Agentic AI can help quickly create high-quality, personalized marketing content. Generative AI agents can save marketers an average of three hours per content piece, allowing them to focus on strategy and innovation. By streamlining content creation, businesses can stay competitive while improving customer engagement.\nSoftware Engineering: AI agents are boosting developer productivity by automating repetitive coding tasks. It\u2019s projected that by 2030 AI could automate up to 30% of work hours, freeing developers to focus on more complex challenges and drive innovation.\nHealthcare: For doctors analyzing vast amounts of medical and patient data, AI agents can distill critical information to help them make better-informed care decisions. Automating administrative tasks and capturing clinical notes in patient appointments reduces the burden of time-consuming tasks, allowing doctors to focus on developing a doctor-patient connection.\nAI agents can also provide 24/7 support, offering information on prescribed medication usage, appointment scheduling and reminders, and more to help patients adhere to treatment plans.\nVideo analytics: Enterprises and public sector organizations around the world are developing video analytics AI agents to boost the capabilities of workforces that rely on visual information from a growing number of devices \u2014 including cameras, IoT sensors and vehicles. Video analytics AI agents can analyze large amounts of live or archived videos, request tasks via natural language and perform complex operations like video search, summarization and visual question-answering.

Powered by the Firefly Video Model, it\u2019s designed to be commercially safe and only trained on content Adobe has permission to use, so artists can create with confidence.\n\nAdobe Substance 3D Collection apps offer numerous RTX-accelerated features for 3D content creation, including ray tracing, AI delighting and upscaling, and image-to-material workflows powered by Adobe Firefly.\n\nSubstance 3D Viewer, entering open beta at Adobe MAX, is designed to unlock 3D in 2D design workflows by allowing 3D files to be opened, viewed and used across design teams. This will improve interoperability with other RTX-accelerated Adobe apps like Photoshop.\nAdobe Firefly integrations have also been added to Substance 3D Collection apps, including Text to Texture, Text to Pattern and Image to Texture tools in Substance 3D Sampler, as well as Generative Background in Substance 3D Stager, to further enhance the 3D content creation with generative AI.\nThe October NVIDIA Studio Driver, designed to optimize creative apps, will be available for download tomorrow. For automatic Studio Driver notifications, as well as easy access to apps like NVIDIA Broadcast, download the NVIDIA app beta.\nVideo Editing Evolved\nAdobe Premiere Pro has transformed video editing workflows over the last four years with\u00a0features like Auto Reframe and Scene Edit Detection.\nThe recently launched GPU-accelerated Enhance Speech, AI Audio Category Tagging and Filler Word Detection features allow editors to use AI to intelligently cut and modify video scenes.\nThe Adobe Firefly Video Model \u2014 now available in limited beta at Firefly.Adobe.com \u2014 brings generative AI to video, marking the next advancement in video editing. It allows users to create and edit video clips using simple text prompts or images, helping fill in content gaps without having to reshoot, extend or reframe takes. It can also be used to create video clip prototypes as inspiration for future shots.\n\nTopaz Labs has introduced a new plug-in for Adobe After Effects, a video enhancement software that uses AI models to improve video quality. This gives users access to enhancement and motion deblur models for sharper, clearer video quality. Accelerated on GeForce RTX GPUs, these models run nearly 2.5x faster on the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU compared with the MacBook Pro M3 Max.\nStay tuned for NVIDIA TensorRT enhancements and more Topaz Video AI effects coming to the After Effects plug-in soon.\n3D Super Powered\nThe Substance 3D Collection is revolutionizing the ideation stage of 3D creation with powerful generative AI features in Substance 3D Sampler and Stager.\nSampler\u2019s Text to Texture, Text to Pattern and Image to Texture tools, powered by Adobe Firefly, allow artists to rapidly generate reference images from simple prompts that can be used to create parametric materials.\nStager\u2019s Generative Background feature helps designers explore backgrounds for staging 3D models, using text descriptions to generate images. Stager can then match lighting and camera perspective, allowing designers to explore more variations faster when iterating and mocking up concepts.\nSubstance 3D Viewer also offers a connected workflow with Photoshop, where 3D models can be placed into Photoshop projects and edits made to the model in Viewer will be automatically sent back to the Photoshop project. GeForce RTX GPU hardware acceleration and ray tracing provide smooth movement in the viewport, producing up to 80% higher frames per second on the GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU compared to the MacBook M3 Pro.\nThere are also new Firefly-powered features in Substance 3D Viewer, like Text to 3D and 3D Model to Image, that combine text prompts and 3D objects to give artists more control when generating new scenes and variations.\nThe latest After Effects release features an expanded range of 3D tools that enable creators to embed 3D animations, cast ultra-realistic shadows on 2D objects and isolate effects in 3D space.\nAfter Effects now also has an RTX GPU-powered Advanced 3D Renderer that accelerates the processing-intensive and time-consuming task of applying HDRI lighting \u2014 lowering creative barriers to entry while improving content realism.

Y2K preppers hoarded cash and canned Spam, fearing a worldwide computer crash. Teens gleefully downloaded Britney Spears and Eminem on Napster.\nBut amid the caffeinated fizz of turn-of-the-millennium tech culture, something more transformative was unfolding.\nThe release of NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce 256 twenty-five years ago today, overlooked by all but hardcore PC gamers and tech enthusiasts at the time, would go on to lay the foundation for today\u2019s generative AI.\nThe GeForce 256 wasn\u2019t just another graphics card \u2014 it was introduced as the world\u2019s first GPU, setting the stage for future advancements in both gaming and computing.\n\nWith hardware transform and lighting (T&L), it took the load off the CPU, a pivotal advancement. As Tom\u2019s Hardware emphasized: \u201c[The GeForce 256] can take the strain off the CPU, keep the 3D-pipeline from stalling, and allow game developers to use much more polygons, which automatically results in greatly increased detail.\u201d\nWhere Gaming Changed Forever\nFor gamers, starting up Quake III Arena on a GeForce 256 was a revelation. \u201cImmediately after firing up your favorite game, it feels like you\u2019ve never even seen the title before this moment,\u201d as the enthusiasts at AnandTech put it,\nThe GeForce 256 paired beautifully with breakthrough titles such Unreal Tournament, one of the first games with realistic reflections, which would go on to sell more than 1 million copies in its first year.\nOver the next quarter-century, the collaboration between game developers and NVIDIA would continue to push boundaries, driving advancements such as increasingly realistic textures, dynamic lighting, and smoother frame rates \u2014 innovations that delivered far more than just immersive experiences for gamers.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs evolved into a platform that transformed new silicon and software into powerful, visceral innovations that reshaped the gaming landscape.\nIn the decades to come, NVIDIA GPUs drove ever higher frame rates and visual fidelity, allowing for smoother, more responsive gameplay.\nThis leap in performance was embraced by platforms such as Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Facebook, as gamers were able to stream content with incredible clarity and speed.\nThese performance boosts not only transformed the gaming experience but also turned players into entertainers. This helped fuel the global growth of esports.\nMajor events like The International (Dota 2), the League of Legends World Championship, and the Fortnite World Cup attracted millions of viewers, solidifying esports as a global phenomenon and creating new opportunities for competitive gaming.\nFrom Gaming to AI: The GPU\u2019s Next Frontier\nAs gaming worlds grew in complexity, so too did the computational demands.\nThe parallel power that transformed gaming graphics caught the attention of researchers, who realized these GPUs could also unlock massive computational potential in AI, enabling breakthroughs far beyond the gaming world.\nDeep learning \u2014 a software model that relies on billions of neurons and trillions of connections \u2014 requires immense computational power.\nTraditional CPUs, designed for sequential tasks, couldn\u2019t efficiently handle this workload. But GPUs, with their massively parallel architecture, were perfect for the job.\nBy 2011, AI researchers had discovered NVIDIA GPUs and their ability to handle deep learning\u2019s immense processing needs.\nResearchers at Google, Stanford and New York University began using NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate AI development, achieving performance that previously required supercomputers.\nIn 2012, a breakthrough came when Alex Krizhevsky from the University of Toronto used NVIDIA GPUs to win the ImageNet image recognition competition. His neural network, AlexNet, trained on a million images, crushed the competition, beating handcrafted software written by vision experts.\nThis marked a seismic shift in technology. What once seemed like science fiction \u2014 computers learning and adapting from vast amounts of data \u2014 was now a reality, driven by the raw power of GPUs.\nBy 2015, AI had reached superhuman levels of perception, with Google, Microsoft and Baidu surpassing human performance in tasks like image recognition and speech understanding \u2014 all powered by deep neural networks running on GPUs.\nIn 2016, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang donated the first NVIDIA DGX-1 AI supercomputer \u2014 a system packed with eight cutting-edge GPUs \u2014 to OpenAI, which would harness GPUs to train ChatGPT, launched in November 2022.\nIn 2018, NVIDIA debuted GeForce RTX (20 Series) with RT Cores and Tensor Cores, designed specifically for real-time ray tracing and AI workloads.\nThis innovation accelerated the adoption of ray-traced graphics in games, bringing cinematic realism to gaming visuals and AI-powered features like NVIDIA DLSS, which enhanced gaming performance by leveraging deep learning.\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT, launched in 2022, would go on to reach more than 100 million users within months of its launch, demonstrating how NVIDIA GPUs continue to drive the transformative power of generative AI.\nToday, GPUs aren\u2019t only celebrated in the gaming world \u2014 they\u2019ve become icons of tech culture, appearing in Reddit memes, Twitch streams, T-shirts at Comic-Con and even being immortalized in custom PC builds and digital fan art.\nShaping the Future\nThis revolution that began with the GeForce 256 continues to unfold today in gaming and entertainment, in personal computing where AI powered by NVIDIA GPUs is now part of everyday life \u2014 and inside the trillion-dollar industries building next-generation AI into the core of their businesses.\nGPUs are not just enhancing gaming but are designing the future of AI itself.\nAnd now, with innovations like NVIDIA DLSS, which uses AI to boost gaming performance and deliver sharper images, and NVIDIA ACE, designed to bring more lifelike interactions to in-game characters, AI is once again reshaping the gaming world.\nThe GeForce 256 laid the bedrock for a future where gaming, computing, and AI are not just evolving \u2014 together, they\u2019re transforming the world.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Gaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Our initial beta release in February was the first step in our journey to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience and RTX Experience.\nA new update, available now in-app and from our website, further enhances the NVIDIA app beta, adding G-SYNC controls, RTX HDR multi-monitor support, driver rollback, and more.\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers, enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW and NVIDIA Broadcast, allows you to adjust GPU options, record gameplay, monitor real-time statistics via an on-screen display, enhance games with HDR and filters, and so much more.\nRead on to learn more about the new NVIDIA app features and what\u2019s coming next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-SYNC Controls Added To GPU Control Center\nIn our previous update, we introduced the Display Settings section, which enables you to modify your display\u2019s resolution, refresh rate, and orientation. Today\u2019s new update adds G-SYNC controls, and in future updates we\u2019ll introduce the remaining features from the NVIDIA Control Panel, such as Surround options, custom resolutions, and multi-monitor setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX HDR Multi-Monitor Support Arrives\nRTX HDR is an AI-powered game filter accessible in games via Alt+Z > Game Filter that seamlessly brings the vibrant world of High Dynamic Range (HDR) to games without HDR. Only 12 of the top 50 most-played GeForce games offer HDR support and, with the RTX HDR filter, you can take full advantage of your HDR-compatible monitor in thousands of SDR games running on DX12, DX11, DX9, and Vulkan, further enhancing your experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock HDR gaming with RTX HDR (image simulated for SDR displays; click here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison). Download the HDR source image for comparison on HDR displays here, and the SDR image here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy installing our new NVIDIA app beta update, and GeForce Game Ready Driver 565.90 WHQL, which launches at 6am PT October 1st, or a newer driver, RTX HDR can now be enabled on systems with multiple displays. For system requirements, setup instructions, and further info, please visit the NVIDIA Consumer Support Knowledge Base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Additions From User Feedback\u00a0\nYou can send feedback via the button at the top right of the app, helping shape the NVIDIA app. Based on your comments, additional features have been introduced in today's new release.\nThe Heads Up Display lets you view system statistics, frame rates, and latency information during gameplay and on your desktop. In our new update, you can now change the font color for improved accessibility. It also supports hex color codes to support thousands of colors. This joins the host of other options available under Alt+Z > Statistics > Configure Heads Up Display, enabling you to fine-tune the stats shown and how they\u2019re shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia the Graphics tab, users can quickly apply Optimal Settings for games and apps, finding a balance between performance and image quality in seconds. And by scrolling down in the list of app-specific settings, driver options can also be configured on a per-app basis.\nWith the release of our new NVIDIA app beta update, user sorting and filtering of games and apps now persists. Users can also hide programs and remove manually added programs by clicking the three dots in the upper right corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the NVIDIA app overlay now notifies users if restricted Digital Rights Management (DRM) content prevents ShadowPlay video recording.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriver Rollback Ready To Roll\nNVIDIA app beta now offers the ability to roll back to a driver previously installed via the NVIDIA app. This option will appear at the bottom of the Drivers window once you\u2019ve updated NVIDIA app, and installed our future drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\u00a0\nYour feedback matters, and we appreciate your continued support. In future updates, we\u2019ll continue to add the remaining NVIDIA Control Panel options, with the goal of unifying the NVIDIA Control Panel and GeForce Experience\u2019s key features in one app, boasting new features and additional enhancements that deliver an even better experience for our users.\nAdditionally, we intend to migrate all remaining GeForce Experience users to the new NVIDIA app when it exits beta before the end of the year.\nPlease continue to share your thoughts about NVIDIA app beta via the in-app feedback feature at the top right of the window and let us know what other features you\u2019d like to see incorporated.\nStay tuned for more updates about the NVIDIA app on GeForce.com, and if you haven\u2019t already tried the NVIDIA app beta, download it from our website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Instead of a human typing in a prompt or automating pre-existing business steps, agentic AI systems can act on the intent of the user, create new workflows and take appropriate actions based on their environment that can reinvent entire processes or functions.\nAccenture and NVIDIA are already helping clients adopt and scale agentic AI systems. For example, Indosat Group announced the first sovereign AI in Indonesia that enables businesses to securely deploy AI while ensuring data governance and adhering to regulations. It is collaborating with Accenture to build industry-specific solutions on top of Indosat\u2019s data center, which includes NVIDIA AI software and accelerated computing, to support local enterprises. With an initial focus on the financial services sector, the new solutions, powered by the AI Refinery platform, will help Indonesian banks harness AI to drive profitability, operational efficiency and sustainable growth in a highly competitive market.\nAccenture will also debut a new NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprint for virtual facility robot fleet simulation, which integrates NVIDIA Omniverse, Isaac and Metropolis software, to enable industrial companies to build autonomous, robot-operated software-defined factories and facilities.\nAccenture will use these new capabilities at Eclipse Automation, an Accenture-owned manufacturing automation company, to deliver as much as 50% faster designs and 30% reduction in cycle time on behalf of its clients.\nNetwork of AI Engineering HubsAs part of its Center for Advanced AI, Accenture is introducing a network of hubs with deep engineering skills and the technical capacity for using agentic AI systems to transform large-scale operations. These hubs will focus on the selection, fine-tuning and large-scale inferencing of foundation models, all of which pose significant accuracy, cost, latency and compliance challenges when development is scaled. Building on existing hubs in Mountain View, Calif., and Bangalore, Accenture is adding AI Refinery Engineering Hubs in Singapore, Tokyo, Malaga and London.\nAccenture Embraces Agentic AIIn addition to its use of agentic AI at Eclipse Automation, Accenture\u2019s marketing function is integrating the AI Refinery platform with autonomous agents to help create and run smarter campaigns faster. This will result in a 25-35% reduction in manual steps, 6% cost savings and is expected to achieve a 25-55% increase in speed to market.\nAbout AccentureAccenture is a leading global professional services company that helps the world\u2019s leading organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services\u2014creating tangible value at speed and scale.

It took 19 days from the time the first rack rolled onto the floor until training began.\nWhile training the extremely large Grok model, Colossus achieves unprecedented network performance. Across all three tiers of the network fabric, the system has experienced zero application latency degradation or packet loss due to flow collisions. It has maintained 95% data throughput enabled by Spectrum-X congestion control.\nThis level of performance cannot be achieved at scale with standard Ethernet, which creates thousands of flow collisions while delivering only 60% data throughput.\n\u201cAI is becoming mission-critical and requires increased performance, security, scalability and cost-efficiency,\u201d said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at NVIDIA. \u201cThe NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform is designed to provide innovators such as xAI with faster processing, analysis and execution of AI workloads, and in turn accelerates the development, deployment and time to market of AI solutions.\u201d\n\u201cColossus is the most powerful training system in the world,\u201d said Elon Musk on X. \u201cNice work by xAI team, NVIDIA and our many partners/suppliers.\u201d\n\u201cxAI has built the world\u2019s largest, most-powerful supercomputer,\u201d said a spokesperson for xAI. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Hopper GPUs and Spectrum-X allow us to push the boundaries of training AI models at a massive-scale, creating a super-accelerated and optimized AI factory based on the Ethernet standard.\u201d\nAt the heart of the Spectrum-X platform is the Spectrum SN5600 Ethernet switch, which supports port speeds of up to 800Gb/s and is based on the Spectrum-4 switch ASIC. xAI chose to pair the Spectrum-X SN5600 switch with NVIDIA BlueField-3\u00ae SuperNICs for unprecedented performance.\nSpectrum-X Ethernet networking for AI brings advanced features that deliver highly effective and scalable bandwidth with low latency and short tail latency, previously exclusive to InfiniBand. These features include adaptive routing with NVIDIA Direct Data Placement technology, congestion control, as well as enhanced AI fabric visibility and performance isolation \u2014 all key requirements for multi-tenant generative AI clouds and large enterprise environments.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform, NVIDIA Spectrum SN5600 Ethernet switch, Spectrum-4 switch ASIC, and NVIDIA BlueField-3 SuperNICs; features of xAI\u2019s Colossus supercomputer cluster; xAI being in the process of doubling the size of Colossus to a combined total of 200,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs; the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform being designed to provide innovators such as xAI with faster processing, analysis and execution of AI workloads, and in turn accelerating the development, deployment and time to market of AI solutions; NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper GPUs and Spectrum-X allowing xAI to push the boundaries of training AI models at a massive scale, creating a super-accelerated and optimized AI factory based on the Ethernet standard are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Elise Gould from the Economic Policy Institute discussed the latest employment data as she highlighted the continued strength of the U.S. labor market.Payroll employment increased by 254,000 in September, with revisions adding 72,000 jobs from previous months. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.1% and showed declines among various demographics, especially among men.  Gould emphasized that the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is at a 23-year high, which shows a strong economy. Despite wage growth reaching 4%, she downplayed concerns that this could lead to inflation and mentioned improvements in productivity and a low labor share of corporate income.She expressed confidence in the labor market\u2019s strength and suggested that it may influence the Fed\u2019s decisions on interest rates. She also believes that the Fed should normalize rates, which remain high historically given current employment levels.Gould observed that the overall labor market is strong, but not excessively heated, as shown by softer job turnover rates.Economic Resilience and Its Impact on the Stock MarketAt CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel discussed the impact of the recent economic data on the stock market. He noted that while 550,000 jobs were added in the third quarter, wages remained flat, leading to a GDP growth projected at 2.5% to 3%.Siegel believes that the Federal Reserve will likely implement smaller rate cuts of 25 basis points rather than larger cuts and will aim for a long-term neutral rate of about 3.5% by the second half of next year.He expressed optimism regarding the stock market and suggested that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, he mentioned that higher yields may present challenges.Despite concerns about equity valuations appearing high, Siegel pointed out that with cash still abundant and a resilient economy, the market remains attractive. He acknowledged that while the forward earnings ratio for the market is around 21.5x, it is not expensive in the current economic climate. He emphasized the absence of recession indicators and the potential for earnings growth and suggested that while significant market gains may not be expected, there is still room for growth.Our MethodologyFor this article, we looked at the October 2 holdings of iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF and narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors.

CEO Jensen Huang has confirmed that the company is ramping up Blackwell GPU production and aims to begin shipments by the fourth quarter. While some engineering issues may delay certain releases, the company remains on course to scale up production as it moves forward into the next year.The company is expected to benefit from significant growth driven by the AI-driven data center expansion. At the GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at around $250 billion, potentially reaching between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the next decade.While the company will face competition from companies such as AMD and AI accelerators developed by Google, Amazon, and Apple, analysts expect NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center market share between 2025 and 2029 to exceed $950 billion. Despite the competition, the company is expected to be the dominant force in the market.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also recently introduced its new series of multimodal large language models, NVLM 1.0, which performs at the highest level on both vision-language and text tasks.According to the company, it competes with top proprietary models like GPT-4o and open-access ones such as Llama 3-V 405B and also improves on text-only tasks after multimodal training. The model weights and training code are being made open-source through Megatron-Core.The model excels in various multimodal tasks, such as following instructions, recognizing humor, reasoning, and solving math problems step-by-step. It uses a hybrid architecture that improves training efficiency and accuracy, along with a unique 1-D tile-tagging design for high-resolution image tasks.The company\u2019s LLM stands as a new major competitor in the industry that META and Alphabet dominated.Generation Investment Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: \u201cRecent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund\u2019s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance. Nvidia is, clearly, an earnings juggernaut. In the past year its revenue has more than tripled, as cloud companies load up on hardware to power AI models. So while its earnings multiple has increased, we are not seeing a repeat of the dotcom mania of the late 1990s. This company\u2019s valuation is backed by cold, hard cash\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text) Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best momentum stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Table Of Contents The AI GiantIf for more than a decade, the attention of tech investors has been on \u201cBig Tech\u201d (Microsoft (MSFT +2.58%), Google (GOOG +1.75%), Facebook (META +2.96%), etc.), the last few years have seen a marked shift toward hardware over software. The first sign was the spectacular rise of Tesla (TSLA +3.86%) from a niche cult-like stock to one of the largest companies in the world.But there would be one company sitting at the border between software and hardware that would capture as good, if not stronger, returns:\u00a0NVIDIA (NVDA +5.27%).Now mostly viewed as an AI company with sudden success, NVIDIA has actually patiently built its unique technology and market position over 20-30 years. This might give it a strong position to stay a dominant actor in the world of tech for the years to come.NVIDIA's Path To SuccessCPU vs GPUFor a long time, NVIDIA was a successful but niche computer hardware company specializing in producing graphic cards or graphics processing units (GPUs). At the time, GPUs were seen as an important computing hardware element but secondary to the all-important central processing unit (CPU).CPUs are designed to perform very quick computations that require doing one after the other, making them great at complex calculations.In contrast, GPUs are less powerful but designed to perform many parallel calculations simultaneously, making them better at handling large amounts of data.During this period from the 1990s to the 2010s, CPU producers like Intel (INTC +1.48%) reigned over the industry, while high-quality GPUs were mostly only used by gamers and graphic designers for high-end PC.Building A GPU BusinessEarly on, NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang and his co-founders reasoned that the pace of computing would outstrip CPU capacity.\u00a0Jensen was instrumental in developing the first GPUs for Sun Microsystems, today Oracle (ORCL +1.09%).He would then become one of the co-founders of NVIDIA in 1993, embracing the PC revolution in the early 1990s.\u201cWe thought, you know, maybe 3D graphics would be the thing that\u2019d be really cool. And for the very first time, you have a platform that could both be a computer and used for, you know, whatever you want to use it for. You could also use it to play games. And, we just need to go build a chip that makes it possible to play games.None of us had even seen a PC before. So we had to go buy a PC. We bought a Gateway 2000. Nobody even knows how to program Windows or DOS. Nobody even seen DOS. And so we had to tear it apart, start learning about the industry.\u201dJensen Huang, in an interview with SequoiaIt's funny to think that, in retrospect, gaming was not a very \u201cserious\u201d market at the time compared to more lucrative and larger enterprise-focused business models.\u00a0The first cards were not a commercial success. Their 2nd generation GPU was better but turned suddenly obsolete when the market turned toward Microsoft's DirectX architecture for videogames.Ultimately, it took NVIDIA six years and three product lines to find product-market fit, with many near-death events for the company.Success would come with the Riva 128: in its first four months, it sold 1 million units. It would be followed by a long line of successful graphic card designs, including the GeForce series, to this day the dominant player in the market alongside AMD\u2019s (AMD +2.92%)\u00a0Radeon.Source: UBuyCUDA & CryptoIn 2006, now a well-established GPU leader, NVIDIA released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface for NVIDIA's GPUs, opening the door for other uses than gaming.\u00a0This was done because some researchers were already using GPUs to perform calculations instead of the usual supercomputers.Source: NVIDIA\u201cResearchers realized that by buying this gaming card called GeForce, you add it to your computer, you essentially have a personal supercomputer.\u00a0Molecular dynamics, seismic processing, CT reconstruction, image processing\u2014a whole bunch of different things.\u201dJensen Huang, in an interview with SequoiaThis wider adoption of GPUs, and more specifically NVIDIA hardware, created a positive feedback loop based on network effects: the more uses, the more end users and programmers familiar with it, the more sales, the more R&D budget, the more acceleration in computing speed, the more uses, etc.Source: NVIDIAToday, the installed base includes hundreds of millions of CUDA GPUs.Source: NVIDIANot only would this prove very useful to researchers, but a new technology would make great use of GPU parallel computing: blockchain and cryptos.Crypto BoomNow getting a little sidelined by AI enthusiasm, crypto was the first large-scale application of GPU beyond gaming and scientific research. Many blockchains and crypto projects require a lot of computing power. Quickly, NVIDIA GPUs became the central hardware for performing these calculations.This created a boom in NVIDIA sales, and the company stock started to rise in unison with the forming crypto boom, with the stock price increasing more than 10x.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA +5.27%) The stock price action from cryptos lost some steam in 2022 before markets realized that NVIDIA had been building up a remarkable AI strategy for many years.AINeural NetworksFrom the early 2010s, researchers had started to deploy GPUs to study neural networks. These are a type of computing method that differs from usual programming and was awarded 2 different Nobel Prizes in 2024, in Physics and Medicine.Neural networks are the technical basis for what is commonly referred to as \u201cAI\u201d today.In 2009, one of my students at the time, Ian Goodfellow, who was my undergrad, helped me build a GPU server in his dorm room. And that server wound up being what we used for our first deep-learning experiments to train neural networks.We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do a thousand or 10,000 things in parallel, rather than one step after another.Andrew Ng\u00a0\u2013 DeepLearning.AI\u00a0founder & managing general partner of AI Funds, in an interview with SequoiaThis was before AlexNet, the first breakthrough in computer image recognition in 2012, and years before AlphaGo.Pivoting NVIDIA To AINVIDIA realized AI's potential early, ways before anybody, out of specialized researchers, cared about neural networks.This was, at the time, a risky move into an unproven, barely existing sector, or as Jensen Huang put it:\u201cWe're investing in zero-billion dollar markets.\u201dIn 2016 & 2017, NVIDIA released the Pascal and Volta architectures, respectively, the first GPU-based AI accelerator, while Volta introduced the Tensor Cores, which accelerated deep learning tasks by up to 12 times.It was a wholesale pivot in this new direction. When we pivoted the ship in that direction, we sought out every single AI researcher on the planet. And our platform being useful to them was the positive feedback that we were getting at the time. Which is the reason why I\u2019m friends with, you know, all of the world\u2019s great AI researchers. They were all helpful in providing the early indications of future success along the way for me and, you gotta make a big deal out of those small wins.Jensen Huang, in an interview with SequoiaThis would prefigure the building up of AI computing infrastructure, emerging massively into the public consciousness in 2023, with the release of popular LLMs (Large Language Models) like Chat GPT.But this was actually built over the slow and often forgotten development of ever more powerful AI-dedicated GPUs by NVIDIA since 2016.Source: NVIDIAAnother remarkable thing about the evolution of AI computing power is that it follows an exponential law instead of the more linear Moore\u2019s Law for CPU.\u00a0This is because not only is the GPU hardware getting better, but the required processing power has decreased over radical improvement in how neural networks are trained.In addition, more available data makes training more efficient, giving researchers many angles to work in parallel to boost performances.This has led to a radical decrease in energy consumed to train the same GPT model over time, 350x less in 8 years, and an even more extreme reduction in energy required to make a request to these LLMs.Source: NVIDIANVIDIA PartnershipsNVIDIA has from its inception been a company deeply connected within the industry. Instead of a vertically integrated company, it seeks to establish deep ties with the best, while staying razor-focused on its own competitive advantages.For example, NVIDIA is a so-called \u201cfabless\u201d hardware manufacturer, focusing on design and concepts, leaving to world-leading semiconductor \u201cfab\u201d like TSMC (TSM +1.46%) to produce its GPUs.By not developing its own LLMs or AI system, NVIDIA is also a trusted partner for virtually all \u201cBig Tech\u201d and AI startups, which see it as an essential partner rather than a potential competitor.\u00a0In turn, this gives NVIDIA the scale of sales to keep reinvesting in R&D and stay on top of the game from a technology standpoint.This has proven to be the right choice, with NVIDIA the largest beneficiary of the most impressive capital expenditure (capex) spending spree in the history of the tech industry.AI capex is expected to reach as much as $200B in 2025, on top of an ever-growing cumulated capex by the largest tech companies in the world since 2016.Source: SherwoodFinancialsNVIDIA's growth just from 2023 to 2024 has been incredible for a company that size:Revenues are up 126%, from $27B to $60B.Operating income tripled (311%) from $9B to $37.1BGross Margin went up from 59.2% to 73.8%Overall, the company is richly valued, but not even that much due to its earning growth. Still, with a P/E ratio above 60, and a dividend yield of just 0.03%, investors buying NVIDIA are assuming a lot of future growth to justify the current stock price.Source: NVIDIAFuture Of NVIDIASustainable Growth?NVIDIA's triple-digit growth rate has been astonishing and reflected in the company's stock price. Of course, every good thing comes to an end one day, and investors are becoming concerned that this might be sooner rather than later.The same concerns were already loud when NVIDIA sales were booming from crypto sales or in the early stages of the AI boom, so pessimism is not necessarily a sound investing strategy.In an interview on the BG2Pod podcast, Huang explained that the world needs to update up to $1T worth of datacenter and computing to incorporate and adapt to AI. And that so far only $150B has been spent of that total.So, according to him, there is still plenty of space for NVIDIA to keep growing sales, even if it is only due to existing computing needs. That\u2019s before even more applications for AI became mainstream, such as\u00a0self-driving cars.Such concerns about total demand also ignore that, ultimately, all industries will likely deploy AI at multiple levels in one way or another, including sectors like healthcare that represent a double-digit percentage of GDP.Source: NVIDIABlackwellIn March 2024, NVIDIA released the Blackwell platform, \u201cenabling organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\u201d.Source: NVIDIAThis is a very important step, as energy consumption is quickly becoming one of the main concerns of AI-focused companies, as illustrated by the recent Microsoft deal to re-open a whole nuclear power plant and use all its power output for the next 20 years at a pre-agreed price.In-House DesignsOne risk for NVIDIA is that while it is a key partner to the world\u2019s largest companies, it is also a very expensive and profitable one (70% gross margin).\u00a0So when companies with the size and skill set of Alphabet/Google are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI chips, they are tempted to do it in-house.And this is not just hypothetical, with for example Tesla having developed its own hardware by hiring top designers from NVIDIA competitor AMD. Up to 2019, Tesla was using the NVIDIA Drive PX 2 AI computing platform instead. As Tesla is seemingly getting really close to actually commercializing robotaxi, this could become a massive missed sale for NVIDIA.At the same time, Tesla\u2019s case might be more of an exception to the rule, with Tesla and Elon Musk's other companies, like SpaceX, notorious for always looking for more vertical integration and a stronger level of control over its hardware.Companies less experienced in hardware or more software and/or marketing-focused, like Facebook or Microsoft, will likely be fine relying on the finest and latest NVIDIA technology.In addition, many AI models are currently built and coded with the assumption that they will run on NVIDIA architectures, and the AI programmers are experienced with NVIDIA's hardware, which are both valuable business moats for the company.AI Market RisksThe AI market as a whole may be a larger risk over which NVIDIA's excellent management has less control. It is booming for now. However, there is a growing concern that the AI applications released have failed to transform into massive new revenues as the iPhone did for Apple back in the day.This is likely just a sign that the technology is still finding its mark and developing its market.But would this situation persist too long, and we could be at risk of a situation like in the late 1990s, where the predictions about the importance of the PC and Internet were right, but the timing was a little too optimistic, leading to the dot-com bubble popping.For sure, Jensen Huang signing an autograph on a woman\u2019s breast in June 2024 is somewhat a surprising sign, and maybe a bit concerning for investors worried about a potential financial mania around AI.Jensen Huang signs women\u2019s chestWatch this video on YouTubeFinancial history is not necessarily repeating, but investors will want to properly analyze this risk for NVIDIA and look at potential parallels with telecom & Internet hardware manufacturer Sun Microsystems (Jensen Huang's first employer) in 2000.At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. (\u2026)Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?Scott McNealy \u2013 \u00a0then CEO of Sun MicrosystemsFor reference, NVIDIA's current P/S ratio is 35.Source: YChartConclusionNVIDIA is a company built on taking the correct calculated risks several times in a row at the right time, from PC graphic cards to CUDA release for new applications to embracing neural networks early.\u00a0This has made its founder, Jensen Huang, something like a rockstar in the semiconductors and IT industry.The company's recent performance has stunned the market and created massive enthusiasm for the stock of the like only Tesla can claim in recent years.\u00a0This creates a massive opportunity, as many early investors in Tesla know, having faced almost a decade of naysayers expecting the company and its stock to fail \u201cany minute now.\u201dThis also creates some risks, as the AI boom has yet to generate the sort of revenues justifying the current capex and might experience a downturn before becoming a fully established economic sector.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)The rally wasn\u2019t limited to Nvidia alone. Asian chip stocks tied to Nvidia\u2019s supply chain saw significant gains as investor optimism spilled over.South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix, which produces high bandwidth memory chips for AI applications, saw its shares jump 2.8%. Samsung Electronics, another potential supplier for Nvidia\u2019s products, experienced a 0.5% increase.In Taiwan, semiconductor giant TSMC and electronics manufacturer Foxconn saw their stocks climb by 2.4% and 3.5% respectively. Japanese firms in the sector also benefited, with Tokyo Electron surging 5%, Advantest gaining 3.8%, and Renesas Electronics rising over 4%.The surge in Nvidia\u2019s stock price comes as Wall Street gears up for the upcoming earnings season. Many of Nvidia\u2019s top customers, including tech giants Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon, have been investing heavily in Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) to power their advanced AI initiatives.These companies are set to report their quarterly results by the end of October, potentially providing further insight into the demand for AI chips.Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise has been nothing short of remarkable. The company\u2019s shares have skyrocketed by almost 180% since the beginning of the year, reflecting the growing enthusiasm for AI technologies across various industries. This impressive performance has allowed Nvidia to recoup earlier losses it experienced following its second-quarter earnings report in August.Looking ahead, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world\u2019s largest contract chip manufacturer, is scheduled to release its third-quarter financial report on Thursday.As a key supplier to Nvidia, TSMC\u2019s results could offer valuable insights into the ongoing demand for AI chips. Early indicators suggest robust performance, with TSMC\u2019s monthly revenue reports pointing to year-over-year growth of around 39% for the quarter ended September 30.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been vocal about the company\u2019s future prospects, particularly regarding its next-generation Blackwell architecture. In recent interviews, Huang stated that Blackwell is in full production and that demand for the new chips is \u201cinsane.\u201dThis enthusiasm is echoed by analysts at Morgan Stanley, who project that Nvidia could generate $10 billion from Blackwell chips during the company\u2019s fiscal 2025 fourth quarter.While Nvidia\u2019s stock price already reflects significant growth expectations, many analysts believe that the AI revolution is still in its early stages.Estimates suggest that the market value of generative AI could reach between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually in the coming years, potentially providing ample room for further expansion in the sector.Stay Ahead of the Market with Benzinga Pro!

This follows an equally impressive performance in 2023 when Nvidia\u2019s stock more than tripled in value. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)The company\u2019s meteoric rise is largely attributed to the insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become essential components in the development and deployment of AI technologies.Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently described the demand for the company\u2019s newest AI chip, Blackwell, as \u201cinsane.\u201dThe chip, which is expected to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is set to begin production in the fourth quarter of this year, with shipments continuing into fiscal 2026. Nvidia anticipates shipping several billion dollars worth of Blackwell chips, highlighting the scale of investment that major tech companies are willing to make in AI infrastructure.The company\u2019s financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly earnings report showing a 122% year-over-year increase in revenue. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, exceeding market expectations. Nvidia also provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, further fueling investor optimism.Major tech companies such as Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI continue to unveil new AI technologies and products that rely heavily on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. This ongoing investment in AI capabilities by industry leaders has helped to maintain Nvidia\u2019s dominant market position, with some analysts estimating that the company holds approximately 95% market share in AI training and inference chips for data center applications.Despite its current success, Nvidia faces potential challenges. These include the risk of escalating export restrictions to China, geopolitical tensions regarding Taiwan, and the possibility of a significant pullback in AI server spending. However, for now, the company\u2019s growth trajectory remains strong, with demand for its current-generation Hopper chip expected to increase over the next two quarters.Nvidia\u2019s stock performance has not gone unnoticed by investors and asset managers. Impax Asset Management, a $50 billion London-based firm, recently increased its stake in Nvidia after recognizing the company\u2019s potential. Ian Simm, CEO and founder of Impax, admitted that they had previously underestimated the market potential of Nvidia\u2019s products and now believes that even at its current $3.2 trillion valuation, the company may still be undervalued.As the tech earnings season approaches, all eyes will be on Nvidia\u2019s top customers, including Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet, to provide updates on their planned investments in AI technologies. These announcements are likely to have a significant impact on Nvidia\u2019s stock price and future growth prospects.Stay Ahead of the Market with Benzinga Pro! Want to trade like a pro?

Three years later, the value of the company tripled again. And in just the past 12 months, Nvidia stock is on the verge of tripling its market cap once again. Already one of the largest companies in the world with a $3.2 trillion market cap, is it possible Nvidia extends its streak to surpass $10 trillion over the next five years?\n\nNvidia's end markets are going crazy\nNvidia ended 2019 with a market cap of $144 billion. At the time, nearly half of its revenue stemmed from chips designed for the video game market, while the data center segment accounted for about 30%. But as of the most recent quarter, 87% of the top line comes from the data center and AI segment. This is undoubtedly the category that will most influence the future of the business. \nPart of the reason AI chips now dominate the company's top line is the sheer growth of the industry. In 2024, Gartner expects demand for AI chips to rise 33%. Over the next five years, average annual growth is expected to top 20%. Right now, Nvidia has a stranglehold on the market with an estimated 88% share of GPU spending. Data from Jon Peddie Research suggests Nvidia's market share has only continued to grow over the last 12 months. \nEven if Nvidia's market share pulls back in the face of competitive pressure over the next few years, the underlying market growth can still fuel strong results for the company. AI is on its way to becoming the biggest new trend in a generation, and there will be plenty of industry spending to go around. Wall Street analysts are forecasting 52.5% annual sales growth for Nvidia over the next five years, which is only a small decrease from the 57.2% compound annual growth it's delivered in the previous five years. \nBut can Nvidia support a $10 trillion valuation?\nWhen Nvidia had a $144 billion market cap five years ago, shares were valued at 15 times sales. As a $3.2 trillion company as of this writing, Nvidia's price-to-sales valuation has climbed to 34 (down from its peak at 46). Based on that year-end 2019 multiple, Nvidia would be worth $1.4 trillion today. While that's still impressive, it's a stark reminder to investors that Nvidia's value has surged thanks to multiple expansion as well as its underlying sales growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts.\nBecause Nvidia is growing so quickly, though, one could argue its premium valuation is justified. And if the company lives up to analysts' expectations for 52.5% annual revenue growth going forward, Nvidia will report a whopping $794 billion of revenue by 2029. At that level, the company would need a price-to-sales multiple of about 12.5 to bring its market cap to $10 trillion.\nThere are zero guarantees this incredibly bullish scenario will come to pass, but if analysts' growth forecasts for Nvidia are even close to accurate, the company could indeed approach the $10 trillion milestone.\n\n\n\nRyan Vanzo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The purchase was made on Nov. 22, 2023, for 50 call options in Nvidia, with a $120 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. The disclosure listed the purchase price range of $1 million to $5 million. Unusual Whales pinned the purchase to a price of $1.8 million. Nvidia shares traded between $476.90 and $503.35 on Nov. 22, 2023, when the purchase was made. The call options would have been purchased for around $360 each.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.   Story Continues On Monday, these $12 call options traded at $132.05, valuing the Pelosis' position at $6,602,500. Based on the estimated cost basis of $1.8 million, the Pelosis are now up $4.8 million on this trade from last November.The options trade isn't the only one the Pelosis made over the last year. The former House Speaker also disclosed buying 10,000 NVDA shares on June 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million, and 10,000 NVDA shares on July 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million.Here's a look at those two purchases based on the intraday highs for Nvidia stock.June 26: 10,000 shares, $128.12 per share, purchase price $1,281,200, now worth $1,437,100 July 26: 10,000 shares, $116.20 per share, purchase price $1,162,000, now worth $1,437,100 The two purchases are now worth $2.87 million and up at least $430,000, depending on the timing of the purchases.Did You Know?Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Missed Profits?: While the Pelosis are now up over $5 million from their purchases of Nvidia stock and options over the last year, they could have been sitting on more profits if they hadn't sold shares back in July 2022.The sale happened after a disclosure of buying Nvidia shares ahead of the CHIPS Act, set to benefit semiconductor stocks, drew scrutiny and increased attention.In a filing, Pelosi reported selling 25,000 Nvidia shares at an average price point of $165.05. The total sale was valued at $4,126,250. The filing shows that the transaction was at a loss of $341,365.The 25,000 shares would now be 250,000 shares based on the stock split from earlier this year. Based on a price of $143.71 for Nvidia shares on Tuesday, the 250,000 shares would be worth $35,927,500. This means the Pelosis missed out on potential profits of $31,801,250 from their sale in July 2022.Nancy Pelosi says she does not share information on congressional activities with her husband. Observers remain skeptical, given the questionable timing of her disclosed trades.Pelosi\u2019s annual salary falls between $174,000 and $197,000 as a senior member of Congress. When she served as Speaker of the House, her annual salary was $223,500.An ETF to track the stock trading activity of Democrats in Congress, the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (BATS:NANC), bears the Representative\u2019s name in the stock ticker.Increased calls to ban Congress members and their spouses from trading have also centered on Pelosi, a Democrat. One bill even uses her name as an acronym: the PELOSI Act.NVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares closed at $143.71 on Monday, hitting new all-time highs.

Nvidia once generated most of its sales from gaming GPUs for PCs, but the rise of generative AI platforms drove more companies to buy its high-end data center GPUs -- which are used to process complex AI tasks more efficiently than stand-alone CPUs.\nNvidia's early-mover advantage made it a simple way to profit from the secular expansion of the booming AI market, but some investors might be wondering if the hot chipmaker will run out of steam. Could AMD (AMD -0.65%), which generated a more modest gain of 380% over the past five years, represent a smarter way to profit from the AI market's growth?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe differences and similarities between Nvidia and AMD\nNvidia and AMD are both fabless chipmakers that outsource their production to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, but they operate different business models. Nvidia generates most of its revenue from discrete GPUs, and it relied on the data center market for a whopping 87% of its revenues in its most recent quarter. The rest of its revenue mainly came from the gaming, professional visualization, auto, and OEM markets.\nAMD sells x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, discrete GPUs, and APUs, which merge a CPU and GPU together in a single package. It also sells programmable chips through Xilinx, which it acquired in 2022. In its latest quarter, AMD generated 48% of its revenue from its data center segment, which sells its Instinct GPUs and Epyc CPUs.\n\nNvidia controlled 88% of the discrete GPU market at the beginning of this year, according to JPR, while AMD held the remaining 12%. TechInsights estimates that Nvidia controlled a whopping 98% of the data center GPU market last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD is also an underdog in the x86 CPU market compared to Intel. According to PassMark Software, AMD currently controls 36% of that market while Intel holds a 61% share. However, AMD has been gaining ground against Intel over the past eight years as its larger competitor grappled with persistent chip shortages and delays.\n\nIn the GPU market, Nvidia's main strategy has been to sell pricier but more power-efficient chips than AMD. AMD usually sells cheaper but less power-efficient chips that can offer comparable performance to Nvidia's chips. That's why Nvidia's H100 GPUs currently cost roughly four times more than AMD's comparable MI300X Instinct GPUs.\nWhich chipmaker is growing faster?\nIn the past, Nvidia and AMD relied heavily on the cyclical PC market. However, the rapid AI-driven expansion of Nvidia's data center business reduced its exposure to the PC market -- which slowed down over the past two years as it lapped its stay-at-home growth spurt during the pandemic. AMD, which still relies heavily on the PC market, faced more headwinds.\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 51% and 56%, respectively, as the market's demand for its data center chips continues to outstrip its available supply. Nvidia's data center chips are pricier than AMD's chips, but its focus on power efficiency still makes it the more compelling choice for data center operators, which are consuming massive amounts of power.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect AMD's revenue to increase at a CAGR of 20% as the PC market stabilizes and it expands its data center CPU and GPU business. But on the bottom line, they expect its EPS to soar at a CAGR of 102% as it sells a higher mix of higher-margin chips. Economies of scale should also kick in across AMD's data center business as it bundles together its Epyc CPUs, Instinct GPUs, and Xilinx's programmable chips.\nWhich stock is the better value?\nNeither of these chip stocks is a screaming bargain right now. Nvidia trades at 38 times next year's estimated earnings, while AMD has a higher forward multiple of 44. Yet Nvidia looks more reasonably valued relative to its long-term growth potential than AMD. Nvidia should remain the top seller of picks and shovels for the AI gold rush for the foreseeable future, and it has a much simpler business model than AMD. AMD remains an underdog in both the GPU and CPU markets, and its exposure to the cyclical PC market could offset its hard-won gains in the AI market.\nNvidia and AMD are both better investments in the semiconductor sector than Intel, but I think Nvidia is still a stronger bet on the expanding AI market than AMD. Nvidia is growing faster, it's more focused on the data center market, and it will likely remain the top choice for companies that want to upgrade their AI infrastructure to support the latest AI applications.\n\n\n\nLeo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Unlike chatbots such as ChatGPT, these agents do not require prompts from humans, and they are not meant to automating pre-existing business steps.\nHow Accenture Plans To Use Nvidia\u2019s Tech\nMost of the work done by Accenture\u2019s new business group will happen through its AI Refinery platform, which takes advantage of three key Nvidia software platforms:\nNvidia AI Foundry aids with the development of custom generative AI models by providing access to foundation models, frameworks and tools. Nvidia AI Enterprise offers microservices and tools for developing, optimizing and deploying AI applications. Nvidia Omniverse, on the other hand, enables development and deployment of 3-D applications.\nThe latter two technologies are paid offerings from Nvidia, and they require systems that are powered by the company\u2019s popular and powerful GPUs.\nJulie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, said the company is \u201cbreaking significant new ground\u201d and helping clients use generative AI as a catalyst for reinvention.\u201d\n\u201cAccenture AI Refinery will create opportunities for companies to reimagine their processes and operations, discover new ways of working, and scale AI solutions across the enterprise to help drive continuous change and create value,\u201d she said in a statement.\nIn tandem with the launch of the Nvidia business group and massive training effort, Accenture said it\u2019s opening a network of AI engineering hubs in Singapore, Tokyo, Malaga and London that will aid with its push to drive adoption of \u201cagentic AI systems.\u201d These hubs become part of Accenture\u2019s Center for Advanced AI and complement existing locations in Mountain View, Calif., and Bangalore.\nAccenture also plans to offer a new microservice meant to enable and optimize virtual facility robot fleet simulation workloads as part of Nvidia\u2019s NIM Agent Blueprints, which is a category of pre-trained, customizable AI workflows that debuted in August.\nWhy Accenture Sees \u2018Agentic AI\u2019 As A Big Deal\nGuan called \u201cagentic AI systems\u201d a \u201cgame-changer in how our clients reinvent their business\u201d and said these agents will have \u201cself-reflecting capabilities\u201d and a \u201cmemory engine\u201d that will allow them to learn from mistakes.\nAgents within these systems will specialize in specific tasks, whether that\u2019s to research topics or orchestrate \u201cmultiple functions across your enterprise,\u201d according to Guan.\nFor example, Accenture designed a system consisting of 14 agents that allows its marketing team to \u201ccreate and run smarter campaigns faster.\u201d The company said this is expected to reduce the manual steps taken for such tasks by 25-35 percent, decrease costs by 6 percent and accelerated completion of said tasks by 22-55 percent.\nElsewhere, the IT services giant said it plans to use its new NIM Agent for robot fleet simulation at Eclipse Automation, an Accenture-owned manufacturing automation company, and it expects the agent to speed up designs by as much as 50 percent.\n\u201cI believe that this is the future we are heading towards: AI that does not just respond, but also actually learns, improves and works as a part of the team,\u201d Guan said.\nAccenture is doubling down on its partnership with Nvidia after the company said last week that it had $3 billion in new generative AI bookings in its 2024 fiscal year, $1 billion of which came from the fourth quarter that ended on Aug. 31.\nNvidia\u2019s Big Push For Expanded GSI Partnerships\nNvidia\u2019s expanded partnership with Accenture is part of a concerted effort by the AI computing giant to grow its influence with global systems integrators (GSIs) and other multinational IT services companies that have significant influence within enterprises.\nAmong the other GSIs that have developed extended relationships with Nvidia, Infosys said a year ago that it would train and certify 50,000 employees on the chip designer\u2019s AI hardware and software solutions for example.\nAt the helm of these efforts is Alvin Da Costa, Nvidia\u2019s former global channel chief who became the leader of its global consulting organization in June 2023. Da Costa told CRN last year that Nvidia formed the new group to focus on its growing relationships with GSIs and service delivery partners\u2014a move backed by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\u201cJensen has been a very big advocate of partners, and he\u2019s really giving us the latitude to make our partners profitable, to make them successful,\u201d he said at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Even so, the stock could jump from about $120 now to around $800 by 2030, according to one analyst.\nPhil Panaro, a former senior advisor at the Boston Consulting Group, believes that the continuing growth of AI and the arrival of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell processors could lead to annual revenue of $600 billion in 2030 from $61 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nLet's look at the catalysts mentioned by Panaro and check if they are strong enough to help Nvidia sustain its phenomenal growth in the long run.\nThe increasing demand for accelerated computing\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on his company's August earnings conference call that accelerated computing is going to be a long-term growth driver. Huang said the transition from general-purpose computing -- using central processing units (CPUs) -- to accelerated computing based on graphics processing units (GPUs) could help reduce computing costs by 90%.\nBecause GPUs speed up demanding workloads in data centers that would have otherwise taken longer using CPUs, Nvidia says, accelerated computing is not only faster, but it is also more sustainable because of its smaller energy footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang projected\u00a0\"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing\" based on their energy efficiency.\nData centers are estimated to account for 1% to 2% of global energy consumption, a figure expected to double by the end of the decade. So the much faster pace of GPUs compared to CPUs is expected to help reduce energy consumption long term.\nThe demand for data center accelerators is forecast to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% through the next five years. And the massive end market that the transition to accelerated computing is likely to create, Huang said, could mean that his company is at the beginning of a phenomenal growth curve.\nThat's because Nvidia is the dominant player in the data center GPU market. It reportedly controlled 98% of this space at the end of last year, so it stands to win big from the secular growth in accelerated computing even if it loses some of that market share.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outlook for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell AI GPUs seems to be solid, with the company saying demand is tracking ahead of supply, a trend that's likely to continue next year as well.\nWhy a $600 billion top line seems achievable\nNvidia's solid prospects discussed above help explain why the company's revenue estimates have received a nice bump for the next three fiscal years.\n\nNVDA revenue estimates; data by YCharts.\nAs shown in the chart above, Nvidia's top line is expected to cross $207 billion in fiscal 2027, more than triple its fiscal 2024 revenue. The company's fiscal 2027 will coincide with the majority of calendar year 2026. So to hit $600 billion in revenue by calendar year 2030 (Nvidia's fiscal 2031), it will need an annual growth rate of 30% over a four-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia serves multiple fast-growing markets such as AI chips (expected to grow at an annual pace of 41% through 2032), digital twins, and cloud gaming, so there is a good chance that it could indeed hit $600 billion in revenue by the 2030 calendar year. But it remains to be seen if that growth translates into the potential upside that Panaro predicts for the stock.\nAssuming Nvidia does reach $600 billion in sales in 2030, the stock will have to maintain its current price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 32 to generate 561% returns from this level. That would translate into a market cap of $19.2 trillion, compared to the current level of just under $3 trillion.\nIf we don't give Nvidia such a rich sales multiple and assume that it is trading at a P/S of 8 (in line with the U.S. technology sector's average) by 2030, its market cap would jump to $4.8 trillion.\nSo, Nvidia could deliver 61% gains from current levels assuming it trades at a more reasonable valuation. But if the market decides to keep rewarding the company with a rich multiple because of its healthy growth, there is a good chance that it could deliver a much stronger upside in the long run -- and might even get close to Panaro's ambitious estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Johnny Rice   October 15, 2024 5 min read        7   In This Article:  NVDA         The roller coaster doesn't seem to be stopping as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The centerpiece of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has also been the main driver of the S&P 500 index's performance since late 2022. This year alone, roughly a quarter of the index's 20% rise can be attributed to the chipmaker.  That's a lot of weight on Nvidia's shoulders. Investors are hyperfocused on its every move, seeing it as a bellwether for the market at large. The good news for investors, then, is that the AI giant is charging full steam ahead. It will face challenges and overcome obstacles, but Nvidia has several catalysts that could boost its bottom line in the not-too-distant future. What will the next year bring for Nvidia? Demand is still extremely high for its bread and butter The uber-powerful chips the company designs and sells are the backbone of its success. That's why investors were spooked when the company announced its first real snafu since the AI boom took off. Production issues were discovered in the newest version of its AI chips originally set to begin rolling out in the third quarter. These chips, dubbed Blackwell, are now expected to hit the market a quarter later in Q4. Luckily, this delay is shorter than some feared, and the company assured investors that the delay had been accounted for in its guidance.  Critically, any loss from Blackwell chips in the short term is being compensated for by the still extremely high demand for its current-generation Hopper chips. When Blackwell does begin rolling out, the company expects the demand to be even stronger. As CEO Jensen Huang put it, \"The anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\" Now, while Nvidia has generally delivered on its promises in the past, it's a good idea to take a company's promises with a grain of salt. Company brass was a little light on details around the delay, and there is always a chance that things won't go as planned. If more delays are announced, it could spell trouble for Nvidia. Still, I don't see any reason to believe that will happen here or that this will develop into a major problem. Nvidia makes more than its flagship chips Nvidia's data center segment, under which its AI chips fall, is by far its most lucrative. I think the chart below puts into perspective just how important the segment is for the company. See that incredible inflection point in 2023? That is almost entirely coming from its data center growth. Now, its chips are undoubtedly the heart of this, but it's not the only product the company offers in this segment. Nvidia aims to be a full-service provider of data center hardware and software. Nvidia has a platform called Spectrum-X that, although launched as recently as last year, has already seen a big uptick in sales.   Story Continues The platform is a networking solution that allows customers to keep up with the intensive networking demands of AI computing without abandoning ethernet. Ethernet \u2014 a networking technology \u2014 has been the standard for decades and is used in almost every data center in the world. As Nvidia continues to build ever more powerful chips, existing ethernet networks are struggling to keep up with the flow of data, creating a bottleneck.This could mean having to retrofit a data center, removing the miles and miles of ethernet cables and associated hardware, and replacing it with faster technology. Remember, these data centers are massive \u2014 we're talking the size of multiple football fields in some cases \u2014 so you can imagine this would be incredibly costly. Spectrum-X allows the bones of these networks to remain, upgrading only critical parts of the network infrastructure. This is a huge cost saver for data centers.Nvidia leadership was excited by Spectrum-X in the company's latest earnings call. CFO, Colette Kress reported that Nvidia's \"Ethernet for AI\" \u2014 of which Spectrum-X is a primary part \u2014 revenue \"doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings\" and that the platform \"has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners.\" The company expects Spectrum to be a multibillion-dollar product line in a year.Beyond this, Nvidia is rolling out new software to help companies build custom AI solutions and is pushing further into the automotive industry, a segment that could be massive in a few years' time once driverless technology matures. In the short term, however, this will still be a significant revenue source as AI is integrated into car \"infotainment\" systems. This is already happening, but expect to see more car companies advertise this system in the coming year.Nvidia is on the right pathWithout getting specific about a price target, I think Nvidia will outperform the market over the coming year. Yes, at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 56.07, it does carry a premium, but this is pretty much at or below where it has been trading since the beginning of 2020. Furthermore, its forward P/E is currently sitting at 34.2, slightly below its average since the AI boom took off. These figures look fine to me considering Nvidia's growth potential.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

More importantly, it appears that the company's phenomenal run could be sustainable in 2025 as well, thanks to the developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHere, we will take a closer look at the reasons why Nvidia's stunning run may continue next year.\n\nStrong Blackwell demand and improving supply will be tailwinds for Nvidia next year\nConsensus estimates forecast Nvidia to end the ongoing fiscal year 2025 with $125.5 billion in revenue, which would be a 125% increase from the previous year. However, analysts at KeyBanc are forecasting the company's revenue to come in at $130.6 billion in the current fiscal year (which will end in January 2025).\nKeyBanc points out that Nvidia is on track to deliver stronger growth this year thanks to the sales ramp of its new Blackwell AI processors. That's not surprising, as Nvidia management pointed out on the recent earnings conference call that it expects \"to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue\" in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia believes that the sales of its current-generation Hopper chips, the H100 and H200 processors, are on track to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025 on the back of strong demand and improved supply. KeyBanc analysts also point out that the demand for these Hopper chips is extremely strong.\nEven better, Nvidia's suppliers are taking steps to ensure that the chip giant is able to fulfill more orders. For instance, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn has announced that it is building the world's largest production facility for Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This particular chip consists of two of Nvidia's B200 Tensor Core GPUs (graphics processing units) that are connected to its Grace CPU (central processing unit).\nEach Nvidia GB200 Superchip is expected to be priced between $60,000 to $70,000. More importantly, the server systems manufactured using multiple GB200 Superchips are in robust demand. Nvidia reportedly increased its orders for the Blackwell GPUs by 25% in July this year, and Foxconn's announcement suggests that demand remains robust.\nMarket research firm TrendForce estimates that Nvidia could ship 60,000 units of GB200 NVL36 servers next year, and this particular configuration reportedly commands an average selling price of $1.8 million. What that means is that Nvidia may be able to sell $108 billion worth of its GB200 NVL36 servers next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese investment bank Mizuho is forecasting sales of 6.5 million to 7 million units of Nvidia's AI graphics cards next year, suggesting that the company could pull in close to $200 billion in data center revenue in calendar 2025 (which will coincide with the majority of its fiscal 2026). If that indeed happens, Nvidia could be well on its way to smashing analysts' revenue expectations for the next fiscal year.\nThe stock seems built for more upside in 2025\nAs the chart shows us, analysts are expecting Nvidia to clock $177 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nThe estimate has moved substantially higher as the year has progressed. So, there is a good chance that it could indeed breach the $200 billion mark going forward, considering the potential revenue that Nvidia is expected to generate from sales of its data center chips alone. That healthy jump in Nvidia's revenue is set to translate into impressive earnings growth as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts are expecting Nvidia to post $4.02 in earnings in fiscal 2026, up 41% from this year's projected earnings of $2.84 per share. However, next year's earnings estimate has moved up significantly in the past 90 days. Three months ago, consensus estimates were projecting $3.69 per share in earnings from Nvidia for the next fiscal year.\nIn all, Nvidia seems well placed to sustain its healthy growth next year as well. The stock has a median 12-month price target of $150, per 65 analysts covering it, pointing toward a 13% upside from current levels. However, the Street-high 12-month price target of $203 would translate into 53% gains from where this AI stock is right now, and it won't be surprising to see Nvidia approaching that mark in 2025 thanks to the points discussed.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Colossus, the world\u2019s largest AI supercomputer, is being used to train xAI\u2019s Grok family of large language models, with chatbots offered as a feature for X Premium subscribers. xAI is in the process of doubling the size of Colossus to a combined total of 200,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. The supporting facility and state-of-the-art supercomputer was built by xAI and NVIDIA in just 122 days, instead of the typical timeframe for systems of this size that can take many months to years. It took 19 days from the time the first rack rolled onto the floor until training began. While training the extremely large Grok model, Colossus achieves unprecedented network performance. Across all three tiers of the network fabric, the system has experienced zero application latency degradation or packet loss due to flow collisions. It has maintained 95% data throughput enabled by Spectrum-X congestion control. This level of performance cannot be achieved at scale with standard Ethernet, which creates thousands of flow collisions while delivering only 60% data throughput. \u201cAI is becoming mission-critical and requires increased performance, security, scalability and cost-efficiency,\u201d said Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at NVIDIA. \u201cThe NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform is designed to provide innovators such as xAI with faster processing, analysis and execution of AI workloads, and in turn accelerates the development, deployment and time to market of AI solutions.\u201d \u201cColossus is the most powerful training system in the world,\u201d said Elon Musk on X. \u201cNice work by xAI team, NVIDIA and our many partners/suppliers.\u201d \u201cxAI has built the world\u2019s largest, most-powerful supercomputer,\u201d said a spokesperson for xAI. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Hopper GPUs and Spectrum-X allow us to push the boundaries of training AI models at a massive-scale, creating a super-accelerated and optimized AI factory based on the Ethernet standard.\u201d At the heart of the Spectrum-X platform is the Spectrum SN5600 Ethernet switch, which supports port speeds of up to 800Gb/s and is based on the Spectrum-4 switch ASIC. xAI chose to pair the Spectrum-X SN5600 switch with NVIDIA BlueField-3\u00ae SuperNICs for unprecedented performance. Spectrum-X Ethernet networking for AI brings advanced features that deliver highly effective and scalable bandwidth with low latency and short tail latency, previously exclusive to InfiniBand. These features include adaptive routing with NVIDIA Direct Data Placement technology, congestion control, as well as enhanced AI fabric visibility and performance isolation \u2014 all key requirements for multi-tenant generative AI clouds and large enterprise environments.

And AI chip stock Nvidia NVDA has been the poster child of this movement, as the Jensen Huang-led company's shares have become a multi-bagger investment, creating massive wealth for its shareholders. Up a staggering 2,511% in the past five years, most analysts believe there is more upside still to come for NVDA.However, Q3\u00a02024 was a disappointing stretch for Nvidia stock. During the July-September quarter, NVDA shares shed 1.7%, as the stock notched the largest market cap decline in history during the period on the heels of its quarterly earnings report.But while Nvidia was cooling its heels over the past few months, three of its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d club comfortably outperformed the AI chip leader's returns. While shares of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, and Microsoft MSFT all joined Nvidia in delivering a relatively underwhelming quarter, Q3 of 2024 was a very good one for investors in iPhone maker Apple AAPL (+10.7%), Facebook owner Meta META (+13.6%) and Elon Musk-led Tesla TSLA (+32.2%). Here's a closer look at these mega-cap outperformers.#1. Apple StockCupertino-based behemoth Apple AAPL has gone far beyond being a mere tech company. Co-founded by the legendary Steve Jobs and now helmed by Tim Cook, Apple has become a consumer brand synonymous with aspirational devices, and has been a part of our cultural zeitgeist for years.\u00a0With products like its flagship iPhone, Macbooks, Apple Watch, Air Pods, and iMacs in its repertoire, all connected by the ecosystem of its highly profitable Services business, the company is now the most valuable in the world, with a gargantuan market cap of $3.57 trillion.Up 17.5% on a YTD basis, Apple stock offers a dividend yield of 0.43%, backed by 10 years of consistent growth. Further, with a payout ratio of just 14.89%, Apple can comfortably continue to grow its dividends in the coming years. In the most recent quarter, AAPL beat estimates on both revenue and earnings. During its fiscal Q3, Apple's net sales rose to $85.8 billion, up 4.9% on growth in both Products ($61.6 billion, +1.6% YoY) and Services ($24.2 billion, +14.1% YoY). The company reported record-breaking revenues in two dozen countries, including Germany, Canada, Mexico, and the UK. Q3 EPS rose by 11.1% to $1.40, surpassing Wall Street's expectations and marking the company's sixth consecutive quarterly earnings beat.Always a cash-rich company, Apple closed the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $25.6 billion, more than double its current debt levels of $12.1 billion.Apple's launch of new iPhone 16 models has shifted Wall Street's attention to its AI strategy. In addition to the usual selling points, Apple said it will gradually roll out Apple Intelligence to approximately 40% of its iPhone user base by the end of this year, with plans to expand that to over 70% by the end of next year.\u00a0Apple Intelligence will focus on enhancing user experiences through new writing tools and emojis, improving photo capture and editing for reliving memories, offering smarter email and notification summaries for better prioritization, and refining control features with upgraded Siri, improved natural language understanding, and personalized settings. Notably, a recent Morgan Stanley survey revealed that nearly 60% of iPhone owners planning to upgrade in the next 12 months, citing Apple Intelligence as an important factor in their decision.Before the device launch, Apple has been building up its AI prowess quietly over the years. Between 2016 and 2020, Apple was the biggest acquirer of AI startups, scooping up 25 companies in the process. The company also has its own AI large language model (LLM) named Ajax, which has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. It is also working on a new version of Xcode and other development tools that build in AI for code completion, which should improve the quality of third-party apps on the iPhone.Analysts have an average rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d for AAPL stock, with a mean target price of $247.55. This indicates an upside potential of about 10.1% from current levels. Out of 31 analysts covering the stock, 18 have a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, 4 have a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating, 8 have a \u201cHold\u201d rating, and 1 has a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating. #2. Tesla StockHelmed by its charismatic, maverick CEO Elon Musk, Tesla TSLA is a leader in the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) market. The newly Austin-headquartered company is a leading manufacturer of EVs, solar panels, and battery storage systems. They aim to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, with ambitions in AI and robotics, as well. Tesla's market cap, which years ago surpassed the $1T mark at its peak, currently stands at $834.3 billion.Tesla stock is up 4.6% on a YTD basis, after having spent much of 2024 in negative territory. Tesla's results for the latest quarter were a mixed bag, as earnings missed estimates, while revenues came in stronger than expected. Tesla reported revenues of $25.5 billion in Q2, up 2% from the previous year, helped by strength in energy generation ($3 billion, +100% YoY) and services ($2.6 billion, +21% YoY). However, a 7% decline in the company's core automotive revenues to $19.9 billion was disappointing.Further, Tesla's Q2 EPS fell 43% YoY to $0.52, as it failed to surpass Wall Street's consensus estimate for the fourth consecutive quarter on softening operating margins. Production and deliveries slipped by 14% and 5% from the prior year to 410,831 units and 443,956 units, respectively. Tesla is currently still the world's largest EV seller globally, holding roughly 51% of the U.S. electric vehicle market by the end of 2023, with plans to sell 20 million EVs by 2030.\u00a0However, the company's cash generation capabilities remained robust, with net cash from operating activities coming in at $3.6 billion, up from $3.1 billion in the year-ago period. Overall, Tesla's liquidity position remained solid as it closed the quarter with a cash balance of $30.7 billion, up from $23.1 billion in the prior year.\u00a0Tesla is investing heavily in the autonomous vehicle (AV) market, a sector expected to grow at a blistering 28.6% CAGR by 2032. The company's efforts on AV will be in focus later this month, when the long-promised robotaxi makes its debut in an Oct. 10 event.\u00a0Outside the usual crop of TSLA bulls, none other than Goldman Sachs GS recently recommended buying call options on TSLA to take advantage of the stock's catalyst-packed month of October, which also includes the release of Q3 earnings and delivery numbers.However, analysts maintain a consensus \u201cHold\u201c rating for TSLA stock overall, and the shares have already outpaced their average price target of $201.89. Out of 36 analysts covering the stock, 10 have a \u201dStrong Buy\u201d rating, 1 has a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating, 18 have a \u201cHold\u201d rating, and 7 have a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating. #3. Meta Platforms StockWe conclude our list of Q3 Mag 7 outperformers with Facebook owner Meta Platforms META. Founded in 2004, Meta operates a wide range of social media platforms under its \u201cFamily of Apps\u201d umbrella, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger, serving billions of users worldwide. Due to the ubiquity of its offerings and near-monopoly in the social media landscape, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company now commands a market cap of $1.45 trillion.META stock has been on a tear in 2024, zooming 63.4% higher on a YTD basis. It also offers a dividend yield of 0.35%. Notably, Meta's rise to a trillion-dollar market cap has been driven by significant compounding in its revenue and earnings over the years. Over the past 10 years, while Meta's revenues have compounded at a CAGR of 31.07%, earnings have grown at a CAGR of 35.97%.In its results for the second quarter, Meta surpassed both revenue and earnings estimates. Meta's revenues for the quarter came in at $39.1 billion, up 22% from the prior year, while EPS popped by 73.2% to $5.16, outpacing the consensus estimate of $4.72. This marked META's sixth consecutive quarterly earnings beat.The company generated net cash from operating activities of $19.4 billion, up from $17.3 billion in the year-ago period, and Meta closed the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $33 billion.The recent Meta Connect 2024 event has raised expectations, with the company pivoting more towards AI and virtual technology, while positioning social media as a foundational element in its broader ecosystem. Management emphasized their goal of making Meta AI \"the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\" They also showcased AI translation services, featuring UFC Champion Brandon Moreno, underscoring the company's celebrity-driven marketing approach.\u00a0Particularly impressive was the demonstration of emotive language and video overdubbing technology, which alters a speaker\u2019s lips to match translated speech while maintaining their original tone. This innovation holds immense value for global connectivity, and could make Meta a key player in international business communication.In addition, Meta is gaining traction in the virtual reality (VR) space, further competing with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. During the event, Meta introduced the Quest 3S, a more affordable version of the Quest 3, priced at $200.99 for the base model. The company also slashed the price of its 512GB Meta Quest 3 VR headset by $150, making it $499.00, significantly more affordable than the $3,499 Vision Pro. This price strategy positions Meta well to capture a larger share of the growing VR market.\u00a0In the meantime, Meta is leveraging AI to strengthen its core advertising business. The company\u2019s AI ad tools are gaining widespread adoption, with over a million advertisers creating more than 15 million ads using these tools in the past month. Campaigns that employed Meta's generative AI ad features saw an 11% increase in click-through rates and a 7.6% higher conversion rate compared to those that did not.On average, analysts tracking Meta stock have assigned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, with a mean target price of $585.16. Out of 45 analysts covering the stock, 39 have a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, 1 has a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating, 3 have a \u201cHold\u201d rating, and 2 contrarians have a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.

The former is a critical supplier in the artificial intelligence economy, and the latter has built enviable brand authority in the restaurant business. In turn, they have been such rewarding investments of late that both companies conducted stock splits in June to reset their soaring share prices.  However, the billionaire hedge fund managers below still sold shares of Nvidia in the second quarter while buying shares of Chipotle. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia and purchased 673,292 shares of Chipotle. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 672,242 shares of Nvidia and added 3.5 million shares of Chipotle. Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold 409,042 shares of Nvidia and purchased 1.4 million shares of Chipotle. Steven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 370,349 shares of Nvidia and added 131,715 shares of Chipotle.  Investors should not interpret those trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment. All four fund managers still have some level of exposure to the semiconductor company, and the exposure is significant in some cases. For instance, Nvidia is still the largest position in AQR's portfolio. Nevertheless, the trades are worth consideration. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Chipotle. 1. Nvidia Nvidia is the foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerated computing, which pairs specialized hardware and software to speed up data center workloads, like AI training and inference. Nvidia has 80% market share in AI accelerators. That utter dominance reflects not only the superior performance of its GPUs but also the unparalleled breadth of its software development tools. Vivek Arya at Bank of America recently raised his 12-month price target to $190 per share. The rationale behind the revision is that Nvidia will still have a 75% market share in AI accelerators by the end of the decade, such that data center revenue increases at 20% annually in the interim. That seems plausible, given that Nvidia is gaining share in adjacent data center hardware verticals, especially AI networking equipment.  Nvidia reported strong financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion due to particularly strong momentum in the data center segment, driven by demand for AI hardware. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings soared 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.   Story Continues Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue. Nvidia has a big catalyst on the horizon with the launch of its next-generation GPU, Blackwell. The production ramp will begin in the fourth quarter, and demand is already so strong that the processors are booked out for 12 months. That means customers who place orders today will not receive Blackwell GPUs until late 2025.Importantly, the hedge fund managers mentioned earlier were selling Nvidia in the second quarter. During that period, the stock traded at an average valuation of 66.4 times earnings, and earnings were projected to increase 34% annually over the next three years. But the stock is more attractive today. The stock currently trades at 64.7 times earnings, and analysts expect earnings to increase by 38% annually over the next three years.Building on that, the present earnings multiple divided by the three-year earnings forecast gives a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 1.7, a significant discount to the three-year average of 3.1. Long-term investors should consider buying a few shares here, though I would keep the purchase relatively small. The valuation is reasonable, but it's not cheap.2. Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle operates more than 3,500 fast-casual restaurants in North America and Europe. The company has built brand authority and consumer loyalty by focusing on \"food with integrity.\" It sources only responsibly raised meats, never treated with hormones or antibiotics, and uses only fresh ingredients, meaning no preservatives, freezers, or can openers involved. As a result, Chipotle consistently ranks above average in same-store sales and customer traffic.Chipotle has been laser-focused on improving throughput. It regularly retrains workers on fundamentals to ensure ingredients are stocked, food is prepared, and stores are properly staffed. Additionally, following the pandemic, the company launched new labor management and coaching tools and added technologies that automate certain workflows. Those efforts get customers through the line more quickly, which tends to improve satisfaction and loyalty.Chipotle reported solid financial results in the second quarter. Revenue rose 18% to $3 billion on strong same-store sales driven by increased customer traffic and larger checks. Non-GAAP net income jumped 36% to $0.34 per diluted share. Former CEO Brian Niccol said, \"Our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the strong demand trends with terrific service and speed.\"Importantly, the hedge fund managers mentioned earlier were buying Chipotle in the second quarter. At the time, shares traded at an average valuation of 65.9 times earnings, and earnings were forecasted to grow by 21% annually over the next three years. But the stock looks more attractive today. Shares currently trade at 58.2 times earnings, and earnings are projected to increase by 22% annually over the next three years.That said, Chipotle stock is still expensive. The present earnings multiple divided by the three-year earnings forecast gives a PEG ratio of 2.6, a premium to the three-year average of 2.4. Prospective investors should wait for a pullback (maybe 10%) before buying shares.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia stock NVDA is nearly there \u2014 after erasing a plunge as deep as 30% earlier this year, shares of the AI chipmaker are just about $3 shy of logging a new record. The existing one, hit in June, is sitting at around $135 and Nvidia\u2019s closing price on Wednesday was $132.65 a share. This year alone, the AI juggernaut is up more than 170% but not without some major challenges and price crashes along the way.  One of the concerns that\u2019s now largely out of the way is the delay to shipments of the company\u2019s powerful Blackwell AI chip. Chief executive Jensen Huang recently addressed the issue, saying there will likely be billions of dollars pulled in from \u201cinsane\u201d demand for Blackwell this quarter when deliveries finally start rolling out. With this in mind, traders could once again start seeing more substance than froth in Nvidia\u2019s valuation, which briefly ranked as the world\u2019s number one.  In other news, a research note by analysts at JPMorgan JPM came out with some optimistic figures in the near future. It projects Nvidia\u2019s revenue to top $175 billion next year and $225 billion by 2027 (up from $60.92 billion in 2023). As far as spending on AI is concerned, the note slapped an estimated (and lofty) price tag of $1 trillion on full-blown AI expenses across hardware supply chain, R&D and other operating expenses.

Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg Television that demand for the next-generation Blackwell chips was \u201ccrazy,\u201d echoing similar remarks from Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang last week. The Taiwanese company is now building the world\u2019s largest assembly plant for servers housing Nvidia\u2019s most advanced Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico. Hon Hai will have a planned capacity of 20,000 GB200 NVL 72 servers in 2025, according to Liu, disclosing its scale for the first time.

But it looks like the demand is still growing. So that\u2019s beyond our expectations,\u201d Liu said. However, Liu said there was a \u201chiccup\u201d in the production of GB200 servers, confirming again a delay with Blackwell supply. Shipments are now expected to start in the late fourth quarter instead of early in the October-December period, he said. Still, Nvidia\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in August that the company expects to ship several billion dollars worth of Blackwell chips in its fiscal fourth quarter. --With assistance from Lauren Faith Lau.

Using the Llama 3 NIM microservice, Ntropy achieved up to 20x better utilization and throughput for its large language models (LLMs) compared with running the native models.\nAirbase, a leading procure-to-pay software platform provider, boosts transaction authorization processes using LLMs and the Ntropy data enricher.\nAt Money20/20, Ntropy will discuss how its API can be used to clean up customers\u2019 merchant data, which boosts fraud detection by improving the accuracy of risk-detection models. This in turn reduces both false transaction declines and revenue loss.\nAnother demo will highlight how an automated loan agent taps into the Ntropy API to analyze information on a bank\u2019s website and generate a relevant investment report to speed loan dispersal and decision-making processes for users.\nContextual AI Advances Retrieval-Augmented Generation for FSI\nContextual AI \u2014 based in Mountain View, California \u2014 offers a production-grade AI platform, powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and ideal for building enterprise AI applications in knowledge-intensive FSI use cases.\n\u201cRAG is the answer to delivering enterprise AI into production,\u201d said Douwe Kiela, CEO and cofounder of Contextual AI. \u201cTapping into NVIDIA technologies and large language models, the Contextual AI RAG 2.0 platform can bring accurate, auditable AI to FSI enterprises looking to optimize operations and offer new generative AI-powered products.\u201d\nThe Contextual AI platform integrates the entire RAG pipeline \u2014 including extraction, retrieval, reranking and generation \u2014 into a single optimized system that can be deployed in minutes, and further tuned and specialized based on customer needs, delivering much greater accuracy in context-dependent tasks.\nHSBC plans to use Contextual AI to provide research insights and process guidance support through retrieving and synthesizing relevant market outlooks, financial news and operational documents. Other financial organizations are also harnessing Contextual AI\u2019s pre-built applications, including for financial analysis, policy-compliance report generation, financial advice query resolution and more.\nFor example, a user could ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s our forecast for central bank rates by Q4 2025?\u201d The Contextual AI platform would provide a brief explanation and an accurate answer grounded in factual documents, including citations to specific sections in the source.\nContextual AI uses NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library for accelerating and optimizing LLM inference performance.\nNayaOne Provides Digital Sandbox for Financial Services Innovation\nLondon-based NayaOne offers an AI sandbox that allows customers to securely test and validate AI applications prior to commercial deployment. Its technology platform allows financial institutions the ability to create synthetic data and gives them access to a marketplace of hundreds of fintechs.\nCustomers can use the digital sandbox to benchmark applications for fairness, transparency, accuracy and other compliance measures and to better ensure top performance and successful integration.\n\u201cThe demand for AI-driven solutions in financial services is accelerating, and our collaboration with NVIDIA allows institutions to harness the power of generative AI in a controlled, secure environment,\u201d said Karan Jain, CEO of NayaOne. \u201cWe\u2019re creating an ecosystem where financial institutions can prototype faster and more effectively, leading to real business transformation and growth initiatives.\u201d\nUsing NVIDIA NIM microservices, NayaOne\u2019s AI Sandbox lets customers explore and experiment with optimized AI models, and take them to deployment more easily. With NVIDIA accelerated computing, NayaOne achieves up to 10x faster processing for the large datasets used in its fraud detection models, at up to 40% lower infrastructure costs compared with running extensive CPU-based models.\nThe digital sandbox also uses the open-source NVIDIA RAPIDS set of data science and AI libraries to accelerate fraud detection and prevention capabilities in money movement applications. The company will demonstrate its digital sandbox at the NVIDIA AI Pavilion at Money20/20.\nSecuriti Improves Financial Planning With AI Copilot\nPowering a broad range of generative AI applications \u2014 including safe enterprise AI copilots and LLM training and tuning \u2014 Securiti\u2019s highly flexible Data+AI platform lets users build safe, end-to-end enterprise AI systems.\nThe company is now building an NVIDIA NIM-powered financial planning assistant. The copilot chatbot accesses diverse financial data while adhering to privacy and entitlement policies to provide context-aware responses to users\u2019 finance-related questions.\n\u201cBanks struggle to provide personalized financial advice at scale while maintaining data security, privacy and compliance with regulations,\u201d said Jack Berkowitz, chief data officer at Securiti. \u201cWith robust data protection and role-based access for secure, scalable support, Securiti helps build safe AI copilots that offer personalized financial advice tailored to individual goals.\u201d\nThe chatbot retrieves data from a variety of sources, such as earnings transcripts, client profiles and account balances, and investment research documents. Securiti\u2019s solution safely ingests and prepares it for use with high-performance, NVIDIA-powered LLMs, preserving controls such as access entitlements. Finally, it provides users with customized responses through a simple consumer interface.\nUsing the Llama 3 70B-Instruct NIM microservice, Securiti optimized the performance of the LLM, while ensuring the safe use of data. The company will demonstrate its generative AI solution at Money20/20.\nNIM microservices and Triton Inference Server are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nLearn more about AI for financial services by joining NVIDIA at Money20/20, running through Wednesday, Oct. 30.\u00a0\nExplore a new NVIDIA AI workflow for fraud detection.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Banking | Customer Stories | Data Science | Financial Services | GPU | Inception | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The stock's tumble began before the market opened in response to a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.75 -2.78 (-2.33%)  As of 3:09:35 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA AMD INTC   Advanced Chart    The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell on the news. Intel declined to comment on the report. Nvidia and AMD did not immediately respond to requests from Yahoo Finance. \"While NVDIA has not disclosed its sales to the Gulf region, the level of investment in AI from that region has been very substantial,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance. \"More importantly, if the government continues to narrow the geographies chip companies can sell into, they are significantly narrowing the market for AI services for NVDIA customers Microsoft, Google and Amazon.\"  Adding to the woes of chip stocks Tuesday was a dismal earnings report from semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML). The Dutch company \u2014 which sells equipment to Nvidia's chip manufacturer TSMC as well as Intel \u2014 reported booking orders worth just \u20ac2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) for the third quarter, far lower than the \u20ac5.39 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 5.3% Tuesday, far underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which was down 0.7% at market close.

Market Open.   ^SOX ^GSPC   Advanced Chart    Nvidia\u2019s decline Tuesday partially reverses a two-week winning streak that saw the stock rally to a new record closing price Monday, nearly eclipsing Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street\u2019s most valuable company. Shares closed above $138 Monday, ahead of its previous record of $135.58 in June. Nvidia's tear was fueled by industry leaders' comments about intense demand for its AI chips and renewed bullishness over AI. Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector \u2014 which Nvidia leads \u2014 has pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year \u2014 when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips \u2014 before extending its historic rally.   Nvidia office building in Santa Clara, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS Despite Tuesday\u2019s decline, Nvidia shares are up 190% from last year. While demand for its AI chips is strong in the near term, a potential slowdown in AI spending by Big Tech companies is another cause for concern to investors, in addition to geopolitical risks. DA Davidson's Gil Luria recently told Yahoo Finance that AI spending could ease as soon as 2025, which would be bad news for Nvidia shares.   Story Continues Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Evidence Is Piling Up That Provides a Compelling Answer.      Danny Vena, The Motley Fool   October 11, 2024 6 min read        10   In This Article:  NVDA       ACN         There are no two ways about it: The dawn of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in early 2023 has been a windfall for chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for a variety of use cases by providing the computational horsepower needed to underpin video games, data centers, and even earlier versions of AI.  Generative AI went viral early last year, with Nvidia at the heart of what many are calling the next industrial revolution. The results have been striking: Nvidia stock is up more than 800% since the start of 2023 and hovers less than 2% off its all-time high (as of this writing) -- but it's been a bumpy ride. Nvidia stock lost as much as 27% during the four weeks starting in early July but has rebounded vigorously, gaining nearly all that back over the past month. Causing the recent decline were fears that demand for AI could dwindle, and a great deal of future growth was already baked into the stock price. That said, there's mounting evidence that answers the question: Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock?   Image source: Getty Images.   Faltering demand, or the calm before the storm? What distinguishes generative AI from its predecessors is the need for not only massive amounts of data, but also the corresponding computational horsepower needed to parse the data. When it comes to AI-centric processors, Nvidia is without equal, controlling an estimated 98% of the market in 2023, similar to its share in 2022, according to semiconductor analyst company TechInsights. This dominance put Nvidia in pole position when generative AI burst on the scene. The unprecedented demand fueled triple-digit revenue and profit growth for Nvidia for five successive quarters. So, when the company forecast only 79% growth for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ends in late October), some investors saw the writing on the wall. They concluded that demand was ebbing and they headed for the exits, but that move was likely premature -- and costly. The evidence is growing that demand for AI continues unabated.  Super Micro Computer, commonly called Supermicro, provided one piece to the demand puzzle on Monday. In a press release, the company revealed that it had delivered more than 2,000 direct liquid-cooling (DLC) rack systems since June and was currently shipping more than 100,000 GPUs per quarter. Shipments of that magnitude suggest that demand for Nvidia's GPUs remains robust. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang provided some boots-on-the-ground commentary as well. In an interview late last week, the chief executive said that demand for Blackwell -- the company's next-generation AI platform -- is \"insane.\" He called this the \"first wave of AI,\" which started with the modernization of $1 trillion worth of existing data centers, upgrading them with chips capable of processing generative AI. Huang went on to say that the next phase -- the \"biggest wave of AI\" -- will involve \"companies using AI to be more productive.\" These comments suggest that the AI boom has only just begun.   Story Continues Furthermore, Nvidia recently expanded its partnership with global IT consultancy company Accenture\u00a0to help enterprise companies \"rapidly scale their AI adoption.\" To that end, Accenture launched the new Accenture Nvidia Business Group, which will be staffed by 30,000 business professionals to help customers with \"process reinvention, AI-powered simulation, and sovereign AI.\" Accenture noted in the press release that generative AI drove $3 billion in bookings in its recently completed fiscal year and shows no signs of slowing.Finally, data provided on Wednesday by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly called TSMC, left no question about the ongoing demand for AI. The company released its September Revenue Report, which reported quarterly revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($24.6 billion), increasing 39% year over year and coasting past Wall Street's consensus estimate of NT$748. Nvidia is one of TSMC's largest customers, accounting for roughly 11% of sales last year. This suggests that AI-related demand remains strong for Nvidia as well.The evidence is clearNvidia investors have been on a non-stop thrill ride since early last year. The company's fiscal 2025 second-quarter results help illustrate its success. For the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that grew 122% year over year to $30 billion, fueled by record data center revenue of $26.3 billion, up 154%. Profits also soared as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67 surged 168%.Nvidia won't report its fiscal third-quarter results until late November, so we won't know for sure until then. However, if the latest developments are any indication, Nvidia should have another strong showing in the works.The company's forecast is calling for revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 79%, with a corresponding increase in profitability. While that's slower than the triple-digit growth investors had become accustomed to, it's remarkable nonetheless.Then there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 62 times earnings, it certainly appears expensive -- at least at first glance. However, Wall Street is forecasting EPS of $4.02 for Nvidia's fiscal year that begins in January. That works out a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33, which is only slightly higher than the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.For me, the evidence is clear: Nvidia stock is still a buy.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "response": "NVIDIA: Could AI Solve its Own Sustainability Issues | Sustainability MagazineArticleTech & AINVIDIA: Could AI Solve its Own Sustainability IssuesBy Jasmin JessenOctober 07, 2024undefined minsShareNVIDIA says AI can increase energy efficiency in data centresNVIDIA says that AI can make data centres more sustainable and help to increase energy efficiency across industries using accelerated computing platformsAs the capabilities of AI continue to expand, so too does its market size, with an overwhelming majority of companies across various industries exploring and implementing AI solutions.\u00a0However, this rapid growth raises important questions about the environmental impact of the technology, particularly in terms of energy consumption.At the heart of the AI revolution lie data centres, the powerhouses of modern computing.\u00a0These facilities can house tens of thousands of devices and run 24/7 to meet the constant demand for services.These services include data storage, cloud computing, media streaming and AI processing.\u00a0The sheer scale of these operations translates into significant energy requirements, both for powering the machines and keeping them cool.Jensen Huang, CEO and Co-Founder of NVIDIA, explains: \"Data centres are already about 1-2% of global electricity consumption and that consumption is expected to continue to grow. Jensen Huang, CEO and Co-Founder at NVIDIA\u201cThis continued growth is not sustainable, neither for operating budgets nor for our planet.\"NVIDIA's approach to sustainable AIChip-maker NVIDIA has become one of the largest American companies by market cap.The company invented graphics processing units (GPUs) in the 1990s and has become a dominant supplier of AI hardware and software.Headquartered in California, USA, NVIDIA has more than 26,000 employees and had revenue of US$60.9bn in 2023.In March 2024 it became only the third company in the history of the US to close with a market capitalization in excess of US$2tn.NVIDIA is optimistic about AI\u2019s ability to solve sustainability problems including the energy consumption of data centres.\u00a0Joshua Parker, Senior Director of Corporate Sustainability at NVIDIA, says: \"AI, I firmly believe, is going to be the best tool that we've ever seen to help us achieve more sustainability and more sustainable outcomes.\"Joshua Parker, Senior Director of Corporate Sustainability at NVIDIANVIDIA's approach centres on the concept of accelerated computing, which combines GPUs and CPUs to handle complex computations quickly and efficiently.\u00a0The company says these systems can be up to 20 times more energy efficient than traditional CPU-only systems for AI inference and training.Joshua explains: \"If you compare the energy efficiency for AI inference from eight years ago until today, it's 45,000 times more energy efficient.\"Cooling solutions for data centresBeyond processor efficiency, NVIDIA is also exploring innovative cooling solutions to further reduce energy consumption in data centres.\u00a0The company is advocating for direct-to-chip liquid cooling, which offers significantly higher efficiency compared to traditional air conditioning methods.\"Our recommended design for the data centres for our new B200 chip is focused all on direct-to-chip liquid cooling,\" Joshua explains.\u00a0This approach not only reduces energy consumption but also allows for higher computing densities, potentially reducing the overall footprint of data centres.How AI can help to address climate changeWhile optimising energy consumption in data centres is crucial, AI's potential to address climate change extends far beyond this single application.\u00a0NVIDIA and other industry leaders are exploring various ways in which AI can contribute to sustainability efforts across different sectors.AI can have a big impact on weather forecasting by enhancing the accuracy of weather predictions.This can enable better preparation for climate-related weather events, potentially saving lives and resources.Another promising AI application is the use of digital twins \u2013 virtual replicas of physical systems or processes.\u00a0These AI-powered simulations allow companies to optimise energy consumption without making costly and potentially risky changes in the real world.Joshua says: \"AI and accelerated computing in general are game-changers when it comes to weather and climate modelling and simulation.\"AI is also helping to improve the efficiency of electric vehicle batteries and enhance the performance of solar panels.******Make sure you check out the latest edition of Sustainability Magazine and also sign up to our global conference series - Sustainability LIVE 2024******Sustainability Magazine is a BizClik brand******SustainabilityAIClimateTechNVIDIAData centresEnergy efficiencyShareLatestDigital MagazineRead Now RelatedContentHow is Henkel Advancing the Sustainability Agenda?SustainabilityQ&A: How Team Brady is Winning Sustainability & RacingSustainabilityAmazon: How AI is a Workplace Sustainability Game-ChangerTech & AICarbon Credits: Apple Accused of False Carbon Neutral ClaimsNet ZeroFeatured ArticlesAmazon: How AI is a Workplace Sustainability Game-ChangerAI-based tools built on AWS are supporting Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge commitment, helping the tech giant conserve water & improve energy efficiency worldwide\u2026How IBM is Ramping Up Renewables to Power its Data CentresClean Energy Capital is planning for a solar development around 500 metres from IBM's Hursley site, which includes a data centre\u2026Need For Sustainable Speed: Oracle & Red Bull's F1 AdvancesOracle Red Bull Racing leverages new OCI Compute shapes to increase simulation speed for race strategy decisions amid expanding AI implementation\u2026This Week's Top 5 Stories in SustainabilitySustainabilityEY: How Businesses Can Navigate Reporting Post-EU OmnibusNet ZeroLEGO Group: Growing Profits & Reducing Environmental ImpactESGQ&A: The NHS\u2019 Alexandra Hammond on Sustainable ProcurementHow Could the North Sea Ship Crash Impact the Environment?ABB: How to Achieve the Clean Industrial Deal's GoalsNetflix: The Sustainability Lessons from Toxic TownBank of America and BlackRock Remove DEI Terms From ReportsSustainability Magazine connects the leading sustainability and ESG executives of the world's largest brands.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Sai writes about healthcare, innovation and technology.Follow AuthorOct 21, 2024, 08:00am EDTShareSaveCommentNVIDIA.AFP via Getty Images\nNvidia announced today that it will partner with Aidoc, a startup focused on enabling healthcare organizations with artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the clinical setting, to develop a novel framework to promote and define AI adoption in the healthcare industry. The new framework will be entitled the \u201cBlueprint for Resilient Integration and Deployment of Guided Excellence\u201d (BRIDGE), and will provide guidelines which organizations can use to determine how best to integrate AI services into clinical workflows in order to ultimately improve patient outcomes.\n\n\nThe purpose behind the BRIDGE initiative is to help foster a structured approach to the vast array of AI services, systems and opportunities that currently exist. Given how quickly this space has evolved, many AI solutions have failed to take into consideration key aspects regarding integration, interoperability and cohesiveness. That is, fueled by incredible demand, many AI developers have started to \u201crun\u201d before learning to \u201cwalk\u201d\u2014 leaving the ecosystem mired with numerous siloed and disparate products.\n\nNow, as the industry is gaining some footing and the inherent value for AI is slowly being recognized, there are opportunities to tie the work together in a systematic and organized fashion.\n\nOther such frameworks have started to emerge in recent years. For example, earlier this year, Microsoft, which has been incredibly involved in the healthcare AI space, announced that it would be expanding its work with the Trustworthy & Responsible AI Network (TRAIN) that it originally launched in March 2024. Another key initiative has been the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI), backed by industry titans such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Stanford Medicine and Mass General Hospital. CHAI\u2019s vision is to \u201cdevelop \u2018guidelines and guardrails\u2019 to drive high-quality health care by promoting the adoption of credible, fair and transparent health AI systems.\u201d\n\n\nNow, the BRIDGE framework is hoping to augment this space with a more tactical approach.\nDemetri Giannikopoulos, Chief Transformation Officer at Aidoc, explains that the company \u201clooks at AI as overall good for healthcare...we want to encourage innovators to continue to do this important work\u2026especially by pulling in academic partners, innovators from all fields. The goal is to make an agnostic set of guidelines that people can use to help deploy their work... and moreover, help after deployment to really scale and provide value.\u201d\nThe announcement is also an indicator of Nvidia\u2019s growing interest in the space. Without a doubt, the company has invested billions already into the field indirectly and has a wide moat for providing services in the healthcare sector. For example, the company\u2019s hardware and MONAI platform are supporting numerous organizations with their AI advancements. Additionally, I recently wrote about how Nvidia\u2019s venture capital arm, NVentures, has been quietly investing tens of millions of dollars in healthcare startups. With its incredibly strong footprint in hardware, in addition to its expertise in scaling industry solutions, Nvidia is clearly trying to expand its healthcare work and portfolio. The BRIDGE framework provides yet another opportunity for the company to expand its presence in this industry.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nKimberly Powell, Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare at Nvidia, explains that BRIDGE provides an opportunity to codify the best processes and practices of AI implementation: \u201cThe last mile expertise that companies like Aidoc have are invaluable and can truly help others in this space as well...the best thing we [Nvidia] can do for startups is help them with technology and also connect them with industry partners to learn and leverage best practices and help them cover that last mile.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the evolution and advancement of this technology is unprecedented. Initiatives and frameworks like BRIDGE will ultimately be a way for organizations to learn and grow alongside one another in what will undoubtedly be a rapidly changing ecosystem in the coming decades.\n\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It then illuminates different parts of the breast with distinct colors \u2014 the vascular system, or veins, may be red; tumors are shown in blue; surrounding tissue is gray.\nSurgeons can then easily manipulate the 3D visualization on a computer screen, gaining important insight to help guide surgeries and influence treatment plans. The technology, called TumorSight Viz, calculates key surgery-related measurements, including a tumor\u2019s volume and how far tumors are from the chest wall and nipple.\nIt also provides key data about a tumor\u2019s volume in relation to a breast\u2019s overall volume, which can help determine \u2014 before a procedure begins \u2014 whether surgeons should try to preserve a breast or choose a mastectomy, which often presents cosmetic and painful side effects. Last year, TumorSight received FDA clearance.\nAcross the world, nearly 2.3 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, according to the World Health Organization. Every year, breast cancer is responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 women. Around 100,000 women in the U.S. annually undergo some form of mastectomy, according to the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\nAccording to Jyoti Palaniappan, chief commercial officer at SimBioSys, the company\u2019s visualization technology offers a step-change improvement over the kind of data surgeons typically see before they begin surgery.\n\u201cTypically, surgeons will get a radiology report, which tells them, \u2018Here\u2019s the size and location of the tumor,\u2019 and they\u2019ll get one or two pictures of the patient\u2019s tumor,\u201d said Palaniappan. \u201cIf the surgeon wants to get more information, they\u2019ll need to find the radiologist and have a conversation with them \u2014 which doesn\u2019t always happen \u2014 and go through the case with them.\u201d\nDr. Barry Rosen, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, said one of the technology\u2019s primary goals is to uplevel and standardize presurgical imaging, which he believes can have broad positive impacts on outcomes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move the surgical process from an art to a science by harnessing the power of AI to improve surgical planning,\u201d Dr. Rosen said.\nSimBioSys uses NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud for pretraining its models. It also uses NVIDIA MONAI for training and validation data, and NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries including cuBLAS and MONAI Deploy to run its imaging technology. SimBioSys is part of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups.\nSimBioSys is already working on additional AI use cases it hopes can improve breast cancer survival rates.\nIt has developed a novel technique to reconcile MRI images of a patient\u2019s breasts, taken when the patient is lying face down, and converts those images into virtual, realistic 3D visualizations that show how the tumor and surrounding tissue will appear during surgery \u2014 when a patient is lying face up.\nThis 3D visualization is especially relevant for surgeons so they can visualize what a breast and any tumors will look like once surgery begins.\nTo create this imagery, the technology calculates gravity\u2019s impact on different kinds of breast tissue and accounts for how different kinds of skin elasticity impact a breast\u2019s shape when a patient is lying on the operating table.\nThe startup is also working on a new strategy that also relies on AI to quickly provide insights that can help determine the risk of recurrence to support providers in determining the best treatment to avoid cancer recurrence.\nCurrently, hospital labs run pathology tests on tumors that surgeons have removed. The biopsies are then sent to a different outside lab, which conducts a more comprehensive molecular analysis.\nThis process routinely takes up to six weeks. Without knowing how aggressive a cancer in the removed tumor is, or how that type of cancer might respond to different treatments, patients and doctors are unable to quickly chart out treatment plans to avoid recurrence.\nSimBioSys\u2019s new technology uses an AI model to analyze the 3D volumetric features of the just-removed tumor, the hospital\u2019s initial tumor pathology report and a patient\u2019s demographic data. From that information, SimBioSys generates \u2014 in a matter of hours \u2014 a risk analysis for that patient\u2019s cancer, which can help doctors quickly determine the best treatment to avoid recurrence.\nAccording to SimBioSys\u2019s Palaniappan, the startup\u2019s new method matches or exceeds the risk of recurrence scoring ability of more traditional methodologies, based upon its internal studies. It also takes a fraction of the time of these other methods while costing far less money.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Inception | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

[+] illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\nNvidia finally poked its head briefly above the stock value of the dominant Apple empire this week, before settling back down to market value of $3.47 trillion with Apple\u2019s value at $3.52 trillion.\n\n\nReuters reporting shows how close this is, with a chart showing Nvidia\u2019s rise against Apple and Microsoft, the other two dominant tech companies.\n\n\u201cThe Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights, to dominate the emerging technology,\u201d write Reuters reporters Sruthi Shankar and Noel Randewich. \u201cKnown since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft now rests slightly below the other two, with around $3.18 trillion in value.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Past Stock Activity\n\nA look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm\u2019s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise.\nSticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world.\nThe Difference Between Nvidia And Apple\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nWhat this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another.\nYou could express this three different ways:\n\nYou could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes \u2018back end\u2019 server/hardware technology.\nYou could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology.\n\n\nOr you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think.\nWith items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution.\nThe Threat Of ASICs\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs.\nSome of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology.\nHowever, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology.\n\u201cThere has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-centric approach,\u201d writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. \u201cNow NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.\u201d\nMaybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market.\nIn any case, it\u2019s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We\u2019re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out \u2013 at least for now.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It all happened as part of a PC building contest by Nvidia and WD that I won, but hey, it still counts. After planning for years for an upgrade from my GTX 1660 Ti, I suddenly had a new gaming PC with an RTX 3080. To say the next two years went by smoothly would be an understatement. \nIn early 2024, however, the itch to upgrade came back in full force. I wasn't able to play the latest titles in all their glory, Frame Generation wasn't available on my card, and a bit of FOMO was also in play. When I finally decided that I wanted to move to the RTX 4080 Super, we were already in rumor season as the RTX 5000 series was on the horizon. So, I decided to wait, but the latest reports have made me worried that my RTX 5000 upgrade dream might never see the light of day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t4 reasons you might regret buying a budget GPU\n\t\t\n\nBudget graphics cards might look attractive, but in 2024, they might do you more harm than good\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 \n\n                            My existing power supply might not hold up\n                    \n\n            The next-gen cards will stress existing power supplies\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was picking components for my RTX 3080 build, I looked at the recommended PSU wattage (750W), the CPU, and the cooler (the Ryzen 7 5700X and a 240mm AIO). I swiftly picked an 850W Gold PSU for the build, confident in my choice, as I'd accounted for some headroom and maybe a future upgrade. Now that the \"future upgrade\" is dangerously close, I'm rethinking my PSU choice.\n\n\n\nThis added burden on my budget might delay my dream upgrade to the RTX 5080 for quite some time. \n\n\nThe RTX 5000 series is still a few months away, but all rumors point to a significant increase in the TGP of the high-end SKUs. To compare, both the RTX 3080 and RTX 4080 Super have a 320W TGP, which is perfectly fine for the 850W EVGA power supply I'm running. However, if the RTX 5080 does bring a 400W TGP (as rumored), along with more stringent power excursion requirements and/or a new connector, I'm afraid I'll need to replace my PSU (just to be safe).\nConsidering the power supply protects thousands of dollars worth of precious hardware inside the PC, I'll err on the side of caution and upgrade to a high-quality 1000W unit. This added burden on my budget might delay my dream upgrade to the RTX 5080 for quite some time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t4 reasons why you should always go for quality PSUs\n\t\t\n\nWhile they might seem tempting when you're on a budget, cheap PSUs from no-name brands aren't worth it in the long run\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n                            The RTX 5000 GPU I want might cost a ton\n                    \n\n            I have my eyes set on the RTX 5080\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPUs, especially at the high end, cost a lot \u2014 we all know that. By now, we've been conditioned to accept the insane prices that accompany the flagship SKUs every generation. No single manufacturer is at fault here \u2014 both Nvidia and AMD are equally guilty. The RTX 4080 Super launching with a price cut was a bit surprising. Although the card was what the RTX 4080 always should have been, it was a welcome change, nonetheless.\n\n\n\nThe RTX 5080 will probably cost north of $1,000, and by a lot, if Nvidia's past shenanigans are anything to go by. \n\n\nNow that we're waiting for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 to arrive later this year or early next year, I'm concerned about what Nvidia will charge for the next 80-series card. It's a brand-new generation of cards that's coming out, not a refresh to an existing card, or a \"Ti\" variant that costs $100 more than the base card. The RTX 5080 will probably cost north of $1,000, and by a lot, if Nvidia's past shenanigans are anything to go by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: NVIDIA\n\n Some reports do believe that Nvidia will somehow price the RTX 5080 at $999, but I find that hard to stomach. If it happens to be faster than the RTX 4090 (which is looking increasingly plausible), Nvidia has no reason not to charge a pretty premium for it. Sure, this doesn't mean they'll necessarily charge over $1,500 for it (which was the launch MSRP of the RTX 4090), but there are still a lot of rungs between $999 and $1,500.\nIn this case, my tentative budget of $1,000 will fall short of the dream upgrade I now have in mind. Most probably, I'll have to wait a few months for the RTX 5070 or RTX 5070 Ti, settling with one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t 3 reasons why 2023 was a colossal disappointment for graphics cards\n\t\t\n\nComing out of the GPU crisis, 2023 was supposed to bring a breath of fresh air. It did bring something fresh, but not what we expected\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n                            Nvidia has no incentive to offer value for money\n                    \n\n            Team Green is free to charge what it wants\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's no secret that Nvidia has been jacking up the prices of their GPUs for a few generations now. What started with the RTX 2000 series looks set to continue with the upcoming RTX 5000 launch. If some of you are hoping Nvidia will price its new GPUs competitively out of the goodness of its heart, you're sadly mistaken. Nvidia enjoys colossal mindshare and market share in the GPU space, and reasonably wants to benefit from it.\n\n\n\nIts biggest rival, AMD, has formally exited the race to produce the greatest high-end GPU. \n\n\nTo make matters worse, there's even less motivation for Team Green to reduce prices this generation. Its biggest rival, AMD, has formally exited the race to produce the greatest high-end GPU, and will only compete in the mid-range and budget segments. Intel, the distant third player, will look to solidify the little market share it has with its Battlemage GPUs. Nvidia, then, can charge arbitrary prices for its next-gen GPUs at all price points, but more so for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080.\nMoreover, Nvidia has shifted focus from the gaming GPU market to the AI data center market. There's simply much more to be gained by satisfying the AI computing demand than innovating or competing in the consumer GPU space. This doesn't bode well for my RTX 5080 upgrade at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWe may soon end up with a 3-way battle royale for desktop GPUs\n\t\t\n\nWith the way things are looking, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are set to slice up the market into 3 distinct fragments\n\n\nPosts\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Do I even want a high-end GPU at this point?\n    \nThe desktop GPU market has established graphics cards as luxury items, and people are ready to pay whatever the latest GPU costs every generation. From $700 flagships to $1,500 ones, we've seen graphics cards outpace inflation by a mile. My dream of upgrading to a high-end RTX 5000 GPU is driven in part by my desire to drive my favorite games at maxed-out settings, but if I'm being honest, a mid-range GPU can get me most of the way there.\nFor instance, an RTX 4070 Ti Super is more than enough to experience the latest titles at high framerates and excellent settings. You don't need an RTX 4080 Super, let alone an RTX 4090 or a next-gen GPU to have fun with the biggest AAA games. Well, the heart wants what the heart wants \u2014 let's just leave it at that and hope for the best. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\n\n\nrtx 4090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

Market Open.   ^SOX ^IXIC ^GSPC   Advanced Chart    Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from \u201cthird parties\u201d weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software.  \u201cMicrosoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can\u2019t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft\u2019s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen.   CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark. (MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN via Getty Images \u201cAs long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow \u2026 the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.\u201d Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. \u201cAs we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,\u201d said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company\u2019s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be \u201clikely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.\u201d  Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company\u2019s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday.   Story Continues To be sure, Big Tech companies\u2019 AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google\u2019s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday.Meta said it expects \"significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.\"Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, the substantial size and intensive computational requirements of these models may have challenges in configuring, deploying, and scaling them effectively on graphic processing units (GPUs). Moreover, these organizations would also like to achieve low-latency and high-performance inference in a cost-efficient way.\nTo help deploying LLMs, NVIDIA introduced NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM) containers. These containers are designed to streamline and accelerate the deployment of LLMs by using the capability of Kubernetes with these benefits:\n\nStreamlines AI model deployment and management for developers and IT teams.\nOptimizes performance and resource usage on NVIDIA hardware.\nEnables enterprises to maintain control and security of their AI deployments.\n\nIn this post, we show you how to deploy NVIDIA NIM on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), demonstrating how you can manage and scale LLMs such as Meta\u2019s\u00a0Llama-3-8B on Amazon EKS. We cover everything from prerequisites and installation to load testing, performance analysis, and observability.\u00a0Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of using Amazon EKS combined with Karpenter for dynamic scaling and efficient management of these workloads.\nSolution overview\nThis solution deploys the NVIDIA NIM container with the Llama-3-8B model across two g5.2xlarge Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for high availability (HA). Each instance hosts one replica of the NIM container because each g5.2xlarge instance has a single GPU. These nodes are provisioned by Karpenter when the Llama-3-8B model is deployed through the NIM Helm chart. This setup makes sure that resources are used efficiently, scaling up or down based on the demand.\nThe Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can further scale these replicas based on throughput or other metrics, with data provided by Prometheus. Grafana is used for monitoring and visualizing these metrics. To access the LLM model endpoints, the solution uses a Kubernetes service, a NGINX ingress controller, and a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Users can send their inference requests to the NLB endpoint, while the NIM pods pull container images from the NVIDIA NGC Container registry and uses Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for shared storage across the nodes.\n\n\nFigure 1. Architecture of NVIDIA NIM LLM on Amazon EKS\n\nDeploying Llama-3-8B model with NIM\nTo streamline the deployment and management of NVIDIA NIM with the Llama-3-8B model, you use Data on EKS Blueprints with Terraform. This infrastructure as code (IaC) approach makes sure of a consistent, reproducible deployment process, which lays a strong foundation for scalable and maintainable model serving on Amazon EKS.\nPrerequisites\nBefore we begin, make sure you have the following:\n\nAWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)\ncurl\nPython3 and pip\nkubectl\nTerraform\nNVIDIA NGC account and API key (check this documentation for detailed instructions)\n\nSetup\n1. Configure the NGC API Key\nRetrieve your NGC API key from NVIDIA and set it as an environment variable:\nexport TF_VAR_ngc_api_key=<replace-with-your-NGC-API-KEY>\n2. Installation\nMake sure that you update the region as your desired deployment AWS Region in the variables.tf file before deploying the blueprint. Furthermore, confirm that your local AWS Region setting matches the specified AWS Region to prevent discrepancies. For example, set your export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=\"<REGION>\u201d to the desired Region.\nThen, clone the repository and run the installation script:\ngit clone https://github.com/awslabs/data-on-eks.git\ncd data-on-eks/ai-ml/nvidia-triton-server\nexport TF_VAR_enable_nvidia_nim=true\nexport TF_VAR_enable_nvidia_triton_server=false\n./install.sh\nThis installation process takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. If the installation doesn\u2019t complete successfully for any reason, then you can try re-running the install.sh script to reapply the Terraform templates.\n3. Verify the installation\nWhen the installation finishes, you may find the configure_kubectl\u00a0command from the Terraform output. Enter the following command to create or update the kubeconfig file for your cluster. Replace region-code with the Region that your cluster is in.\naws eks --region <region-code> update-kubeconfig --name nvidia-triton-server\nEnter the following command to check that the nim-llm pods status is running:\nkubectl get\u00a0all\u00a0-n nim\nYou should observe output similar to the following:\n\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct-0   1/1     Running   0          4h2m\n\nNAME                                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\nservice/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct       ClusterIP   172.20.5.230   <none>        8000/TCP   4h2m\nservice/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct-sts   ClusterIP   None           <none>        8000/TCP   4h2m\n\nNAME                                          READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct   1/1     4h2m\n\nNAME                                                             REFERENCE                                TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct   StatefulSet/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct   2/5       1         5         1          4h2m\n\n\nThe llama3-8b-instruct model is deployed with a StatefulSet in NIM namespace. As it is running, Karpenter provisioned a GPU instance. To check the Karpenter provisioned EC2 instances, enter the following command:\nkubectl get node -l type=karpenter -L node.kubernetes.io/instance-type\nYou should observe output similar to the following:\n\nNAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION               INSTANCE-TYPE\nip-100-64-77-39.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   4m46s   v1.30.0-eks-036c24b   g5.2xlarge\n\n\nTesting NIM with example prompts\nFor demonstration purposes, we\u2019re using port-forwarding with the Kubernetes service instead of exposing the load balancer endpoint. This approach allows you to access the service locally without making the NLB publicly accessible.\nkubectl port-forward -n nim service/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct 8000\nThen, open another terminal and you can invoke the deployed model with an HTTP request with the curl command\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n    \"http://localhost:8000/v1/completions\" \\\n    -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -d '{\n    \"model\": \"meta/llama3-8b-instruct\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Once upon a time\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 64\n    }'\nYou should observe output similar to the following.\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"cmpl-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"object\": \"text_completion\",\n  \"created\": 1719742336,\n  \"model\": \"meta/llama3-8b-instruct\",\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"text\": \", there was a young man named Jack who lived in a small village at the foot of a vast and ancient forest.

To further increase the load, you may introduce more iterations to the script by adding the\u00a0--iterations\u00a0flag with the number of iterations you want to run. For example, to run five iterations, you can run the following:\npython3 client.py \\\n  --input-prompts prompts.txt \\\n  --results-file results.txt \\\n  --iterations 5\nYou can also repeat this multiple times. At the same time, you may use the following command to find that there are new pods, and when it\u2019s started it takes some time to be ready.\nkubectl get po,hpa -n nim\nLater you might get the similar output as the following\n\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct-0   1/1     Running   0          35m\npod/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct-1   1/1     Running   0          7m39s\npod/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct-2   1/1     Running   0          7m39s\npod/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct-3   1/1     Running   0          7m39s\n\nNAME                                          REFERENCE             TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE\nhorizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct   StatefulSet/nim-llm   18/5      1         5         4          9d\n\n\nThere is an HPA resource named nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct, which is deployed alongside the nim-llm Helm chart. The autoscaling is driven by the num_requests_running metric, which is exposed by NIM. We have preconfigured Prometheus Adapter to enable HPA to use this custom metric, which facilitates the autoscaling of NIM pods based on real-time demand.\n\n$ kubectl describe hpa nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct -n nim\n\n\u2026\nReference:                         StatefulSet/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct\nMetrics:                           ( current / target )\n  \"num_requests_running\" on pods:  1 / 5\nMin replicas:                      1\nMax replicas:                      5\nBehavior:\n  Scale Up:\n    Stabilization Window: 0 seconds\n    Select Policy: Max\n    Policies:\n      - Type: Pods     Value: 4    Period: 15 seconds\n      - Type: Percent  Value: 100  Period: 15 seconds\n  Scale Down:\n    Stabilization Window: 300 seconds\n    Select Policy: Max\n    Policies:\n      - Type: Percent  Value: 100  Period: 15 seconds\nStatefulSet pods:      4 current / 4 desired\n\u2026\n\n\nAt the instance level, Karpenter automatically helps you launch instances if pods are unscheduable, and it matches the NodePool definition.\u00a0GPU instances (g5) launched for NIM pods because we have configured the NodePool as follows:\n\nnodePool:\n  labels:\n    - type: karpenter\n    - NodeGroupType: g5-gpu-karpenter\n  taints:\n    - key: nvidia.com/gpu\n      value: \"Exists\"\n      effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n  requirements:\n    - key: \"karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family\"\n      operator: In\n      values: [\"g5\"]\n    - key: \"karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-size\"\n      operator: In\n      values: [ \"2xlarge\", \"4xlarge\", \"8xlarge\", \"16xlarge\", \"12xlarge\", \"24xlarge\"]\n    - key: \"kubernetes.io/arch\"\n      operator: In\n      values: [\"amd64\"]\n    - key: \"karpenter.sh/capacity-type\"\n      operator: In\n      values: [\"spot\", \"on-demand\"]\n\n\nKarpenter provides the flexibility for you to define a range of instance specifications rather than being limited to fixed instance types. When both spot and on-demand instances are configured as options, Karpenter prioritizes the use of Spot Instances using the Price Capacity Optimized allocation strategy. This strategy requests Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near-term. Then, the fleet requests Spot Instances from the lowest priced pools.\nObservability\nTo monitor the deployment, we\u2019ve implemented the Prometheus stack, which includes both the Prometheus server and Grafana for monitoring capabilities.\nStart by verifying the services deployed by the Kube Prometheus stack with the following command:\nkubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack\nWith this command to list the services, you should observe an output similar to the following:\n\nNAME                                             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE\nkube-prometheus-stack-grafana                    ClusterIP   172.20.225.77    <none>        80/TCP              10m\nkube-prometheus-stack-kube-state-metrics         ClusterIP   172.20.237.248   <none>        8080/TCP            10m\nkube-prometheus-stack-operator                   ClusterIP   172.20.118.163   <none>        443/TCP             10m\nkube-prometheus-stack-prometheus                 ClusterIP   172.20.132.214   <none>        9090/TCP,8080/TCP   10m\nkube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-node-exporter   ClusterIP   172.20.213.178   <none>        9100/TCP            10m\nprometheus-adapter                               ClusterIP   172.20.171.163   <none>        443/TCP             10m\nprometheus-operated                              ClusterIP   None             <none>        9090/TCP            10m\n\n\nThe NVIDIA NIM LLM service exposes metrics through the /metrics endpoint from the nim-llm service at port 8000. Verify it by running the following:\nkubectl get svc -n nim\nkubectl port-forward -n nim svc/nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct 8000\nOpen another terminal, and enter the following:\ncurl localhost:8000/metrics\nYou should observe numerous metrics (such as num_requests_running, time_to_first_token_seconds) in the Prometheus format exposed by the NIM service.\nGrafana dashboard\nWe\u2019ve set up a pre-configured Grafana dashboard that displays several key metrics:\n\nTime to First Token (TTFT): The latency between the initial inference request to the model and the return of the first token.\nInter-Token Latency (ITL): The latency between each token after the first.\nTotal Throughput: The total number of tokens generated per second by the NIM.\n\nYou can find more metrics descriptions in this NVIDIA document.\nTo view the Grafana dashboard, refer to our guide on the Data on EKS website.\n\n\nFigure 2. Grafana dashboard example provided by NVIDIA\n\nPerformance testing with the NVIDIA GenAI-Perf tool\nGenAI-Perf is a command-line tool designed to measure the throughput and latency of generative AI models because they are served through an inference server. It serves as a standard benchmarking tool, which allows you to compare the performance of different models deployed with inference servers.\nTo streamline the testing process, in particular because the tool needs a GPU, we\u2019ve provided a pre-configured manifest file, genaiperf-deploy.yaml, which allows you to deploy and run GenAI-Perf within your environment. This setup enables you to quickly assess the performance of your AI models and make sure that they meet your latency and throughput requirements.\ncd gen-ai/inference/nvidia-nim\nkubectl apply -f genaiperf-deploy.yaml\nWhen the pod is ready with the running status 1/1, first enter into the pod with the following command:\nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get po -l app=tritonserver -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')\nkubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- bash\n\nThen enter the following command to test the deployed NIM Llama3 model:\ngenai-perf \\\n  -m meta/llama3-8b-instruct \\\n  --service-kind openai \\\n  --endpoint v1/completions \\\n  --endpoint-type completions \\\n  --num-prompts 100 \\\n  --random-seed 123 \\\n  --synthetic-input-tokens-mean 200 \\\n  --synthetic-input-tokens-stddev 0 \\\n  --output-tokens-mean 100 \\\n  --output-tokens-stddev 0 \\\n  --tokenizer hf-internal-testing/llama-tokenizer \\\n  --concurrency 10 \\\n  --measurement-interval 4000 \\\n  --profile-export-file my_profile_export.json \\\n  --url nim-llm-llama3-8b-instruct.nim:8000\nYou should observe similar output to the following:\n\n2024-07-18 07:11 [INFO] genai_perf.parser:166 - Model name 'meta/llama3-8b-instruct' cannot be used to create artifact directory.

Karpenter\u2019s dynamic scaling of worker nodes made sure of efficient resource allocation based on demand. We also benchmarked performance metrics using NVIDIA\u2019s GenAI-Perf tool, showcasing the system\u2019s capabilities.\nTo streamline the deployment process, Data on EKS provides ready-to-deploy IaC templates, which allow organizations to set up their infrastructure in a few hours. These templates can be customized to fit your specific IaC needs.\nTo get started scaling and running your data and machine learning (ML) workloads on Amazon EKS, checkout the Data on EKS project on GitHub.\nThank you to all the reviewers who provided valuable feedback and guidance in shaping this blog.

These AI microservices serve as virtual assistants and notetakers, letting therapists focus on connecting with their clients.\n\u201cIn a therapy setting, having a strong alliance between counselor and client is everything,\u201d said Alessandro De Sario, founder and CEO of Therapyside. \u201cWhen a therapist can focus on the session without worrying about note-taking, they can reach that level of trust and connection much quicker.\u201d\nFor the therapists and clients who have opted in to test these AI tools, a speech recognition model transcribes their conversations. A large language model summarizes the session into clinical notes, saving time for therapists so they can speak with more clients and work more efficiently. Another model powers a virtual assistant, dubbed Maia, that can answer therapists\u2019 questions using retrieval-augmented generation, aka RAG.\nTherapyside aims to add features over time, such as support for additional languages and an offline version that can transcribe and summarize in-person therapy sessions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just opened the door,\u201d said De Sario. \u201cWe want to make the tool much more powerful so it can handle administrative tasks like calendar management and patient follow-up, or remind therapists of topics they should cover in a given session.\u201d\nAI\u2019s in Session: Enhancing Therapist-Client Relationships\nTherapyside, founded in 2017, works with around 1,000 licensed therapists in Europe offering counseling in English, Italian and Spanish. More than 500,000 therapy sessions have been completed through its virtual platform to date.\nThe company\u2019s AI tools are currently available through a beta program. Therapists who choose to participate can invite their clients to opt in to the AI features.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly helpful to have a personalized summary with a transcription that highlights the most important points from each session I have with my patients,\u201d said Alejandro A., one of the therapists participating in the beta program. \u201cI\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by its ability to identify the most significant areas to focus on with each patient.\u201d\nA speech recognition AI model can capture live transcriptions of sessions.\nThe therapists testing the tool rated the transcriptions and summaries as highly accurate, helping them focus on listening without worrying about note-taking.\n\u201cThe recaps allow me to be fully present with the clients in my sessions,\u201d said Maaria A., another therapist participating in the beta program.\nDuring sessions, clients share details about their life experiences that are captured in the AI-powered transcriptions and summaries. Therapyside\u2019s RAG-based Maia connects to these resources to help therapists quickly recall minutiae like the name of a client\u2019s sibling, or track how a client\u2019s main challenges have evolved over time. This information can help therapists pose more personalized questions and provide better support.\n\u201cMaia is a valuable tool to have when you\u2019re feeling a little stuck,\u201d said Maaria A. \u201cI have clients all over the world, so Maia helps remind me where they live. And if I ask Maia to suggest exercises clients could do to boost their self-esteem, it helps me find resources I can send to them, which helps save time.\u201d\nMaia can answer therapist\u2019s questions based on session transcripts and summaries.\nTake Note: AI Microservices Enable Easy Deployment\nTherapyside\u2019s AI pipeline runs on NVIDIA GPUs in a secure cloud environment and is built with NVIDIA NIM, a set of easy-to-use microservices designed to speed up AI deployment.\nFor transcription, the pipeline uses NVIDIA Riva NIM microservices, which include NVIDIA Parakeet, a record-setting family of models, to deliver highly accurate automatic speech recognition. \nOnce the transcript is complete, the text is processed by a NIM microservice for Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 family of open-source AI models to generate a summary that\u2019s added to the client\u2019s clinical history.\nThe Maia virtual assistant, which also uses a Llama 3.1 NIM microservice, accesses these clinical records using a RAG pipeline powered by NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM microservices. RAG techniques enable organizations to connect AI models to their private datasets to deliver contextually accurate responses.\nTherapyside plans to further customize Maia with capabilities that support specific therapeutic methods, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. The team is also integrating NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails to further enhance the tools\u2019 safety and security.\nKimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA, will discuss Therapyside and other healthcare innovators in a keynote address at HLTH, a conference taking place October 20-23 in Las Vegas.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Inception and get started with NVIDIA NIM microservices at ai.nvidia.com. \n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | NVIDIA in Europe | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When the great economist died in 1790 James Watt\u2019s two-cylinder steam engine passed for the height of technological sophistication. If he recognised the prefix \u201cnano\u201d\u2014a fair bet for a precocious classicist proficient in dead languages by 14\u2014it would be as a derivation of the Greek word for \u201cdwarf\u201d, not as a reference to the billionths of a metre in which modern semiconductors are measured. The word \u201cbillion\u201d had entered the English language by Smith\u2019s time but the number it denotes would have seemed unfathomable. Some 200bn transistors etched onto a few halfpennies in Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell artificial-intelligence (AI) chip?

The launch of AMD\u2019s Instinct MI325X accelerator marks an escalation in the AI hardware arms race, with implications for businesses investing in AI.\nAMD\u2019s announcement came during its Advancing AI 2024 event, where the company revealed a broad portfolio of data center solutions for AI, enterprise, cloud and mixed workloads. This portfolio includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerators, 5th Gen AMD EPYC server CPUs, AMD Pensando Salina DPUs, AMD Pensando Pollara 400 NICs and AMD Ryzen AI PRO 300 series processors for enterprise AI PCs.\nThe generative AI boom, fueled by technologies like large language models, has created a high demand for powerful GPUs capable of training and running complex AI systems. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of this trend, with its data center revenue jumping in recent earnings reports.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s dominant position in the AI chip market has remained virtually unchallenged,\u201d Max (Chong) Li, an adjunct professor at Columbia University and founder CEO of decentralized AI data provider Oort, told PYMNTS. \u201cAMD\u2019s new chip should at least provide some competition, which could lead to pricing pressure in the long term. Some reports have estimated that Nvidia earns as much as a 75% profit margin on AI chips. Should AMD start to eat market share, one would assume prices will begin to drop, as they often do across most industries when companies compete for customers.\u201d\nThe Battle for AI Chip Supremacy\nThe CUDA ecosystem is Nvidia\u2019s proprietary parallel computing platform and programming model, which has become the standard for AI and high-performance computing tasks. AMD\u2019s challenge extends beyond hardware performance to providing a compelling software ecosystem for developers and data scientists.\nAMD has invested in its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software stack, reporting at the event that it has doubled AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator inferencing and training performance across popular AI models. The company said over one million models run seamlessly out of the box on AMD Instinct, triple the number available when MI300X launched.\n\u201cAMD\u2019s launch of the Instinct MI325X chip marks a significant step in challenging NVIDIA\u2019s dominance in the data center GPU market, but it\u2019s unlikely to dramatically alter the competitive landscape immediately,\u201d Dev Nag, CEO of QueryPal, a support automation company, told PYMNTS. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s 95% market share in AI chips is deeply entrenched, largely due to their mature and dominant CUDA ecosystem.\n\u201cThe success of AMD\u2019s initiative hinges not just on the performance of their chips, but on their ability to address the software side of the equation,\u201d he added. \u201cNVIDIA spends about 30% of its R&D budget on software and has more software engineers than hardware engineers, meaning that it will continue to push its ecosystem lead forward aggressively.\u201d\nImplications for Businesses and the AI Market\nAMD\u2019s entry into the market could affect businesses looking to adopt AI technologies. Increased competition might lead to more options and better pricing in the long term. Nag suggested that over the next 2-3 years, \u201cas AMD refines its offerings and potentially gains market share, we could see more options at various price points. This could make AI hardware more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises that have been priced out of the current market.\u201d\nAccording to Nag, immediate price drops are unlikely.\n\u201cCurrent demand for AI chips far outstrips supply, giving manufacturers little incentive to lower prices,\u201d he told PYMNTS. \u201cAMD appears to be positioning itself as a value option rather than significantly undercutting Nvidia on price.\u201d\nAMD\u2019s focus on open standards could have broader implications.\n\u201cIf successful, it could lead to more cost-effective solutions by reducing dependency on proprietary ecosystems like CUDA,\u201d Nag said. \u201cThis approach could encourage more interoperability and flexibility in AI development, potentially making it easier for businesses to adopt and integrate AI solutions.\u201d\nIndustry partners have responded positively to AMD\u2019s announcement. The company showcased collaborations with major players, including Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Supermicro.\nAMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su said in a statement that the data center AI accelerator market could grow to $500 billion by 2028. Even a tiny slice of this market could represent significant revenue for AMD, making its push into AI chips a critical strategic move.\nFor businesses across various sectors, from retail to manufacturing, developing a more competitive AI chip market could speed up the integration of AI into core operations and customer-facing services. More accessible and powerful AI hardware could make tasks like demand forecasting, process optimization and personalized customer experiences more feasible for a broader range of companies.\n\u201cLower prices always lower barriers to entry and enable more businesses and people to take advantage of newer technologies,\u201d Li said. \u201cTake, for example, mobile phones. Back when they first debuted, the public\u2019s view of a mobile phone user was that of a wealthy person in a fancy car making calls on the go. Now, most people in developed and many people in emerging countries tend to have at least a basic smartphone; soon, access to AI is likely to experience a similar adoption boom.\u201d\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    Advanced Micro Devices, AI, AI Chips, AI infrastructure, AMD, artificial intelligence, Dev Nag, digital transformation, GenAI, generative AI, Innovation, Max Li, News, NVIDIA, Oort, PYMNTS News, QueryPal, Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n                FlexTecs Updates FlexTrap Tool to Capture Payments Discrepancies            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These Inception members will be showcasing their solutions onsite in the Startup Pavilion, in panel discussions and in a startup pitch session. Startups can also attend a reverse pitch session where venture capital firms share their vision for the next wave of innovation.\nConversational AI for Indian Railway Customers\nBengaluru-based startup CoRover.ai already has over a billion users of its LLM-based conversational AI platform, which includes text, audio and video-based agents.\n\u201cThe support of NVIDIA Inception is helping us advance our work to automate conversational AI use cases with domain-specific large language models,\u201d said Ankush Sabharwal, CEO of CoRover. \u201cNVIDIA AI technology enables us to deliver enterprise-grade virtual assistants that support 1.3 billion users in over 100 languages.\u201d\nCoRover\u2019s AI platform powers chatbots and customer service applications for major private and public sector customers, such as the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, the official provider of online tickets, drinking water and food for India\u2019s railways stations and trains.\nDubbed AskDISHA, after the Sanskrit word for direction, the IRCTC\u2019s multimodal chatbot handles more than 150,000 user queries daily, and has facilitated over 10 billion interactions for more than 175 million passengers to date. It assists customers with tasks such as booking or canceling train tickets, changing boarding stations, requesting refunds, and checking the status of their booking in languages including English, Hindi, Gujarati and Hinglish \u2014 a mix of Hindi and English.\nThe deployment of AskDISHA has resulted in a 70% improvement in IRCTC\u2019s customer satisfaction rate and a 70% reduction in queries through other channels like social media, phone calls and emails.\nCoRover\u2019s modular AI tools were developed using NVIDIA NeMo, an end-to-end, cloud-native framework and suite of microservices for developing generative AI. They run on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, enabling CoRover to automatically scale up compute resources during peak usage \u2014 such as the moment train tickets are released.\nWatch CoRover\u2019s session live at the AI Summit or on demand, and learn more about Indian businesses building multilingual language models with NeMo.\nPowering the Future of Sports Media\nVideoVerse, founded in Mumbai with offices in six countries, has built a family of AI models to support content creation in the sports media industry \u2014 enabling global customers including the Indian Premier League for cricket, the Vietnam Basketball Association and the Mountain West Conference for American college football to generate game highlights up to 15x faster and boost viewership.\n\u201cShort-form video highlights that can be easily shared on social media can also help lesser-known sports gain audience attention and grow their fanbases,\u201d said VideoVerse CEO Vinayak Shrivastav. \u201cAI-assisted content creation makes it feasible for emerging sports like longball and kabbadi to raise awareness with a limited marketing budget.\u201d\nVideoVerse\u2019s enterprise solution, called Magnifi, uses AI technologies such as vision analysis, natural language processing and optical character recognition to streamline editing workflows by detecting players, identifying key moments and tracking ball movement across multiple camera angles. Magnifi also adjusts video sizes automatically for horizontal and vertical formats across laptops, tablets and phones, ensuring the primary action remains centered in the frame.\nVideoVerse uses NVIDIA CUDA libraries to accelerate AI models for image and video understanding, automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding. The company runs its custom AI models on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs for inference.\nWatch VideoVerse\u2019s session live at the AI Summit or on demand.\nRewriting the Narrative of Enterprise Efficiency\u00a0\nMumbai-based startup Fluid AI offers generative AI chatbots, voice calling bots and a range of application programming interfaces to boost enterprise efficiency. Its AI tools can access an organization\u2019s knowledge base to provide teams with insights, reports and ideas \u2014 or to help accurately answer questions.\nFluid AI\u2019s chatbots can be applied in customer service to increase agent productivity and reduce response times, generating accurate outputs in real time. Or, organizations can choose to deploy them with sales and customer-facing teams, using them for tasks like creating slide decks in under 15 seconds.\nFluid AI taps NVIDIA NIM microservices, the NVIDIA NeMo platform and the NVIDIA TensorRT inference engine to deliver a complete, scalable platform for developing custom generative AI for its customers.\nThe company is also exploring the use of NVIDIA Riva microservices to develop a voice experience for its chatbots that will help significantly reduce latency and offer higher-fidelity experiences. Its AI models run on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\n\u201cOur work with NVIDIA has been invaluable \u2014 the low latency and high fidelity that we offer on AI-powered voice calls come from the innovation that NVIDIA technology allows us to achieve,\u201d said Abhinav Aggarwal, founder of Fluid AI.\nWatch Fluid AI\u2019s session live at the AI summit or on demand.\nProviding Data Work to Bridge the Digital Divide\nKarya, based in Bengaluru, is a smartphone-based digital work platform that enables members of low-income and marginalized communities across India to earn supplemental income by completing language-based tasks that support the development of multilingual AI models.\nNearly 100,000 Karya workers are recording voice samples, transcribing audio or checking the accuracy of AI-generated sentences in their native languages, earning nearly 20x India\u2019s minimum wage for their work. Karya also provides royalties to all contributors each time its datasets are sold to AI developers.\n\u201cBy fairly compensating these communities for their digital work, we are able to boost their quality of life while supporting the creation of multilingual AI tools they\u2019ll be able to use in the future,\u201d said Manu Chopra, CEO of Karya.\nKarya\u2019s work helps enterprises accelerate the data design and collection process, enabling the creation of deployable AI solutions that cater to non-English speakers in India. The company will use NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA NIM to build its AI platform, which offers custom AI model training and pretrained models tailored to customers\u2019 business needs.\nBusinesses and research centers can purchase the datasets Karya collects to train diverse, multilingual AI models. For example, Karya is working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to build the largest gender-intentional, open-source AI dataset in Indic languages yet. Karya is employing over 30,000 low-income women participants across six language groups in India to help create the dataset, which will support the creation of diverse AI applications across agriculture, healthcare and banking.\nWatch Karya\u2019s session live at the AI Summit or on demand.\nFor more from the AI Summit, watch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s fireside chat with Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Events | Inception | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

C  Catherine Brock   R  Robin Hartill, CFP\u00ae     October 10, 2024 7 min read        Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. In 2024, the company gained $2 trillion in market value. The catalyst was a steep rise in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as enterprises globally began building data centers to support their growing need for high-performance computing. However, the company recently lost nearly $600 billion in market value in one day \u2014 the largest single-day drop for a U.S. company \u2014 after a Chinese startup unveiled its DeepSeek AI model, which it claims requires far fewer chips than past models. The news sparked panic among investors, who worried demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips would tank. Still, Nvidia's standout growth remains intriguing to many investors. Understanding the company\u2019s revenue model empowers you to evaluate corporate updates quickly for more confident and appropriate investing decisions. Nvidia GPUs: the flagship product Nvidia designs and sells graphics processing units or GPUs. The company's history in this space dates to the late 1990s, when Nvidia invented the GPU for use in gaming applications. The architecture was innovative because it allowed small computations to run simultaneously rather than sequentially. The technology ushered in a new era of more realistic video game graphics. Nvidia has since developed an ecosystem of software and computing tools around its GPUs. Developers use those tools to design and run complex, resource-intensive applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia AI: The new opportunity Today, those applications go well beyond gaming. The company's most significant opportunity is in the field of AI, which has been a focus for Nvidia since 2013 when CEO Jensen Huang realized that high-performance GPUs could play an instrumental role in the growing adoption of machine learning technology. That revelation began paying off when the 2022 launch of ChatGPT took AI computing mainstream. The sudden, sweeping popularity of the AI chatbot motivated enterprises globally to launch new AI tools and related services. The need for computing hardware that is powerful and efficient enough to support AI applications skyrocketed. That hardware includes GPUs, tensor processing units, routers, switches, and storage solutions, among other things. These, along with software that enables AI development, are collectively called AI infrastructure. Enterprises house this infrastructure in technology facilities called data centers.  Nvidia\u2019s industries and customers served Data center infrastructure has been the primary growth source for Nvidia, but the company also serves other industries. Gaming is still a core segment, though its contribution is relatively small. The company is working to marry its expertise in AI and graphics, which could create revenue synergies. In 2024, for example, Nvidia launched \u201cNvidia Ace,\u201d a suite of tools for developing interactive avatars, called \"digital humans.\" Nvidia hardware is also used in the automotive and robotics industries, including autonomous driving applications. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at independent asset manager Wealth Enhancement Group, believes autonomous driving is Nvidia's next big opportunity \u2014 although it may not come quickly. \"They will be tied up in AI for some time,\" Yoshioka said.  Telecommunications is another segment to watch. Nvidia hardware is already used in 5G data centers. The company envisions advancing telecommunications services to support the growing needs of the AI computing revolution. Connectivity demand for robotics, driverless vehicles, smart factories, and more will increase as AI technology matures. Nvidia has also launched a research platform to support the development of 6G wireless technology. Nvidia's customer list includes some of the world's largest companies: Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA).

Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantages Nvidia has some noteworthy advantages that insulate it from competition. These include forward-thinking leadership, a proven ability to innovate, and a robust and proprietary platform around its hardware. Forward-thinking leadership. Twice in Nvidia's history, Huang has identified broad market opportunities where his company could innovate and excel. Ability to innovate. Nvidia has the expertise and resources to create new solutions to fill unmet demands. This partly relates to the company's focus on design rather than manufacturing. Nvidia is a fabless company, which means it outsources production to other companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). In early 2025, Nvidia released its new Blackwell GeForce RTX 50 Series of GPUs, which it says will transform AI computer graphics, offering faster performance and greater energy efficiency at just a fraction of the cost of the GeForce RTX 4090. Platform strategy. Hardware sales drive revenue, but Nvidia also provides a full suite of tools and resources developers can use to build and run applications. \"This tight integration of hardware, software, and developer tools creates a moat around Nvidia's offerings that is difficult for competitors to match,\" Tower Hills Capital founder and CIO Drayton D'Silva said. Broad ecosystem. Though Nvidia is best known for its GPUs that are primarily used for data centers, AI and machine learning applications, and gaming, its technology is used across a huge range of industries, including healthcare research and personalized medicine, financial services, the automotive sector, and more.  Nvidia risks to watch Despite its strong market position and formidable advantages, Nvidia and its investors face significant risks. These include rising competition, high investor expectations, and the changing demands of a fast-paced industry. Rising competition. Nvidia's dominant position in AI-capable chips has a downside. Nvidia competitors want their share of this growing market, and clients want more options. \"There are a lot of companies, including Nvidia's own clients, that are working on custom chip design. Those clients don't want to be locked into a single chip supplier,\u201d Yoshioka said. Several major Big Tech companies, including Amazon, Meta, and Google, are racing to develop their own AI chips to make them less dependent on outside suppliers like Nvidia. The introduction of newer AI models, like DeepSeek, could also lower demand for Nvidia chips. Investor expectations. Investor optimism pushes the price of NVDA stock higher. If the company fails to satisfy expectations, a price correction will follow. Yoshioka recommends investors proceed with caution when expectations are high. Volatility can result when \"too many investors look at Nvidia's growth and expect it to continue.\u201d Fast-paced industry. In 2023, Nvidia announced it would expedite its product roadmap by launching upgrades annually. The company previously followed a two-year refresh cycle. The change puts pressure on Nvidia to execute product launches flawlessly. Any delays or product failures could allow other providers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to gain traction. AMD also upgrades its chips annually. Export restrictions. Nvidia faces significant export controls on its AI chips, with especially tight restrictions on shipments to China. If the Trump administration imposes additional tariffs amid the growing U.S.-China trade war, Nvidia could face additional pressures.   Whether you are interested in trading Nvidia or another stock, understanding the business model is an essential early step in your research. With that knowledge, you can better evaluate financial performance and growth strategies to ensure the asset is right for your portfolio. FAQs What is Nvidia?

This is a key ability for studying realistic large-scale devices, which, in this particular study, also allowed for the exploration of quantum machine learning tasks that batch training data.\nMany of the QML techniques covered by the review \u2014 such as hybrid quantum convolution neural networks \u2014 also require CUDA-Q\u2019s ability to write programs interweaving classical and quantum resources.\nThe increased reliance on GPU supercomputing demonstrated in this work is the latest example of NVIDIA\u2019s growing involvement in developing useful quantum computers.\nNVIDIA plans to further highlight its role in the future of quantum computing at the SC24 conference, Nov. 17-22 in Atlanta.\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: CUDA | Quantum Computing | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To accelerate breakthroughs, leading biotech and biopharma companies are turning to Biological Foundation Models (BioFMs), a type of advanced generative AI models trained on biological data.\nWe are excited to announce that NVIDIA\u2019s generative AI Blueprints, foundational models and inference microservices, are now available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) HealthOmics, providing drug researchers with a comprehensive solution to streamline computer-aided virtual screening.\nWhile BioFMs hold immense promise for accelerating drug discovery, researchers face significant challenges in leveraging their full potential. Scientists require sophisticated tools that enable efficient experimentation, allowing them to quickly get started with proven example workflows and adapt every aspect of these recipes to their specific scientific tasks. Additionally, they need the ability to seamlessly transition from discovery and testing to running their customized pipelines at scale on the same platform, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.\nFurthermore, collaboration is crucial, as researchers must be able to share their proven workflows with colleagues across the organization, fostering knowledge sharing and enabling everyone to move faster toward breakthroughs. Funding agencies like the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)\u2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2010Industry Partnerships initiative also create opportunities and mechanism to support collaborations between biopharma and academic researchers to advance Investigative New Drug (IND) in clinical innovation.\nFigure 2\nThe HealthOmics and NVIDIA Solution\nAWS HealthOmics is a fully managed biological data compute and storage service designed to accelerate scientific breakthroughs in clinical diagnostics and drug discovery. By offloading the complexities of building, orchestrating, and managing bioinformatics and drug discovery pipelines, HealthOmics enables researchers to focus on core scientific activities. Leading biopharma companies like Roche, Amgen, and Takeda are already leveraging HealthOmics to significantly accelerate their scientific outcomes and drive faster time-to-insights.\nThrough this collaboration with NVIDIA, researcher can now access state-of-the-art AI models and infrastructure for their drug discovery workflows. The integrated solution combines NVIDIA BioNeMo foundation models and NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints, with the robust workflow orchestration, scalability, security, and compliance features of HealthOmics.\nThis offering addresses the key challenges faced by researchers in leveraging generative AI for reliable and reproducible drug discovery research. It enables scientists to leverage leading BioFMs and high-performance computing resources in a seamless, scalable, and cost-effective manner. Furthermore, pre-packaged technical assets are now available through the HealthOmics drug discovery workflows GitHub repository to help biopharma and biotech researchers get started quickly.\nIntegrated Drug Discovery Technical Assets\nThe HealthOmics drug discovery GitHub repository demonstrates the process of building, deploying, and customizing generative AI applications on HealthOmics. Key components of the example virtual screening workflow include:\n\nSample drug discovery workflow and processes using NVIDIA NIMs containers are defined in Nextflow Domain Specific Language (DSL).\nCommand line scripts and python SDK examples demonstrate how to orchestrate multi-step workflows on HealthOmics in a scalable, robust and cost-effective way.\n\nBy leveraging these pre-packaged assets, researchers can gain a head start in creating their own generative AI applications for drug discovery, benefiting from NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI tools and end-to-end discovery experience tailored for this use case. This combined solution streamlines the process of harnessing the power of generative AI, enabling biotech and biopharma companies to accelerate their drug research and discovery efforts and unlock new possibilities for groundbreaking therapies.\nFigure 3\nTo get started, you will first need to create a private workflow in HealthOmics using the example Nextflow DSL main.nf file. This sample workflow includes three core processes: MolMIM, AlphaFold2, and DiffDock.\nMolMIM can be used to explore \u201cdrug-like\u201d chemical space to generate novel small molecules, structurally similar to a given query in a SMILES string, with the improved values of the desired properties. This transformer-based model can also be used to:\n\nEmbed molecular representation in numeric high dimensional space\nDecode embeddings back into SMILES\nGenerate hidden/latent states to analyze underlying properties and patterns\nSample the latent space to generate novel and diverse set of small molecules for a given seed\nGenerate novel small molecules using CMA-ES-guided sampling with desired properties or characteristics\n\nThe example presented here is using the CMA-ES-guided generation API function in a MolMIM container. You can configure the criteria for the desired properties (for example, QED and LogP) and similarity thresholds in the molmim_generate python script.\nAlphaFold2 folds the protein sequences into 3D structures. There are two main steps for this prediction:\n\nMultiple sequence alignment (MSA) by searching for a collection of similar protein sequences from the reference databases, such as UniRef90, MGnify, BFD, and so on.\nIdentify co-evolutionary signals highlighting similarities and differences of MSA results and generate structure hypothesis using an Evoformer neural network.\n\nDiffDock is designed to predict ligand-protein binding poses when provided the ligand as an input in SDF format and protein in PDB format. Once the HealthOmics workflow is successfully created, you will be able to see additional details and create jobs on the AWS management console.\nFigure 4\nYou can run a job with similar example to identify novel small molecules, which may bind and inhibit SARS CoV-2 protease activities. All you need to provide are SMILES strings in the SMI file, as well as the protein sequence for SARS CoV-2 protease in the FASTA file. Key challenges include:\n\nDownloading large reference sequence databases to run AlphaFold2.\nRetry mechanism for the failed jobs.\nRunning processes in parallel.\n\nOnce the job is submitted, you can track the job status and logs on the HealthOmics console. HealthOmics takes advantage of Nextflow queue channels to run distributed jobs. In this example, each SMI input file will trigger a separate MolMIM run task, and the same for an AlphaFold run task triggered by a FASTA file. In Figure 4, you can see five MolMIM tasks and two AlphaFold tasks run in parallel.\nFigure 5\nThe DiffDock tasks were triggered by the combination of MolMIM and AlphaFold outputs, and two separate DiffDock run tasks were triggered. The user will only be charged for the compute runtime for the selected instance size, which translates to a more predictable cost.\nAdditionally, there are no persistent resources, such as storage for the 500+ GB reference data which AlphaFold requires. This means that when work is not being done, your costs scale to $0. Figure Six is an example of a timeline chart for a run, which includes data staging of the resources. You can generate similar graphs using the open source AWS HealthOmics Tools.\nFigure 6 \nMolMIM and AlphaFold2 jobs do not depend on each other, so they run in parallel. However, AlphaFold2 needs to download 500+ GBs of model weights and reference sequences, so the actual AlphaFold2 starts later after the MolMIM job is finished.\nConclusion\nFigure 7 \nLeveraging BioFMs presents significant opportunities and challenges for drug researchers. The collaboration between AWS HealthOmics and NVIDIA Blueprints represents a comprehensive approach to overcoming these hurdles and streamlining the entire drug discovery workflow\u2014from initial experimentation to large-scale production.\nCustomers can start by building their generative AI drug discovery applications using NVIDIA Blueprints, which provide everything needed to build and deploy customized generative AI applications that provide GPU-optimized state-of-the-art AI models. These Blueprints include sample applications, reference code, customization documentation, and deployment tools, enabling researchers to leverage NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI tools for virtual screening.\nOnce the initial applications are built and tested, customers can seamlessly transition to scaling up their drug design pipelines using AWS HealthOmics. This combined solution offers robust capabilities for security, compliance, and cost optimization, while offloading the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing BioFMs at scale while providing access to high-performance computing resources.\n\n\n\n\n         TAGS: \n        AI, aws, biotech, drug discovery, pharmaceuticals\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Greene\nRyan Greene is a Senior Product Marketing Manager in the Global Healthcare and Life Sciences team at Amazon Web Services.

Around 10% of its residents speak English, the internet\u2019s most common language.\nAs India, the world\u2019s most populous country, forges ahead with rapid digitalization efforts, its enterprises and local startups are developing multilingual AI models that enable more Indians to interact with technology in their primary language. It\u2019s a case study in sovereign AI \u2014 the development of domestic AI infrastructure that is built on local datasets and reflects a region\u2019s specific dialects, cultures and practices.\nThese projects are building language models for Indic languages and English that can power customer service AI agents for businesses, rapidly translate content to broaden access to information, and enable services to more easily reach a diverse population of over 1.4 billion individuals.\nTo support initiatives like these, NVIDIA has released a small language model for Hindi, India\u2019s most prevalent language with over half a billion speakers. Now available as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, the model, dubbed Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi-4B, can be easily deployed on any NVIDIA GPU-accelerated system for optimized performance.\nTech Mahindra, an Indian IT services and consulting company, is the first to use the Nemotron Hindi NIM microservice to develop an AI model called Indus 2.0, which is focused on Hindi and dozens of its dialects. Indus 2.0 harnesses Tech Mahindra\u2019s high-quality fine-tuning data to further boost model accuracy, unlocking opportunities for clients in banking, education, healthcare and other industries to deliver localized services.\nTech Mahindra will showcase Indus 2.0 at the NVIDIA AI Summit, taking place Oct. 23-25 in Mumbai. The company also uses NVIDIA NeMo to develop its sovereign large language model (LLM) platform, TeNo.\nNVIDIA NIM Makes AI Adoption for Hindi as Easy as Ek, Do, Teen\nThe Nemotron Hindi model has 4 billion parameters and is derived from Nemotron-4 15B, a 15-billion parameter multilingual language model developed by NVIDIA. The model was pruned, distilled and trained with a combination of real-world Hindi data, synthetic Hindi data and an equal amount of English data using NVIDIA NeMo, an end-to-end, cloud-native framework and suite of microservices for developing generative AI.\nThe dataset was created with NVIDIA NeMo Curator, which improves generative AI model accuracy by processing high-quality multimodal data at scale for training and customization. NeMo Curator uses NVIDIA RAPIDS libraries to accelerate data processing pipelines on multi-node GPU systems, lowering processing time and total cost of ownership. It also provides pre-built pipelines and building blocks for synthetic data generation, data filtering, classification and deduplication to process high-quality data.\nAfter fine-tuning with NeMo, the final model leads on multiple accuracy benchmarks for AI models with up to 8 billion parameters. Packaged as a NIM microservice, it can be easily harnessed to support use cases across industries such as education, retail and healthcare.\nIt\u2019s available as part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which gives businesses access to additional resources, including technical support and enterprise-grade security, to streamline AI development for production environments.\nBevy of Businesses Serves Multilingual Population\nInnovators, major enterprises and global systems integrators across India are building customized language models using NVIDIA NeMo.\nCompanies in the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups are using NeMo to develop AI models for several Indic languages.\nSarvam AI offers enterprise customers speech-to-text, text-to-speech, translation and data parsing models. The company developed Sarvam 1, India\u2019s first homegrown, multilingual LLM, which was trained from scratch on domestic AI infrastructure powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nSarvam 1 \u2014 developed using NVIDIA AI Enterprise software including NeMo Curator and NeMo Framework \u2014 supports English and 10 major Indian languages, including Bengali, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu.\nSarvam AI also uses NVIDIA NIM microservices, NVIDIA Riva for conversational AI, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to optimize and deploy conversational AI agents with sub-second latency.\nAnother Inception startup, Gnani.ai, built a multilingual speech-to-speech LLM that powers AI customer service assistants that handle around 10 million real-time voice interactions daily for over 150 banking, insurance and financial services companies across India and the U.S. The model supports 14 languages and was trained on over 14 million hours of conversational speech data using NVIDIA Hopper GPUs and NeMo Framework.\nGnani.ai uses TensorRT-LLM, Triton Inference Server and Riva NIM microservices to optimize its AI for virtual customer service assistants and speech analytics.\nLarge enterprises building LLMs with NeMo include:\n\nFlipkart, a major Indian ecommerce company majority-owned by Walmart, is integrating NeMo Guardrails, an open-source toolkit that enables developers to add programmable guardrails to LLMs, to enhance the safety of its conversational AI systems.\nKrutrim, part of the Ola Group of businesses that includes one of India\u2019s top ride-booking platforms, is developing a multilingual Indic foundation model using Mistral NeMo 12B, a state-of-the-art LLM developed by Mistral AI and NVIDIA.\nZoho Corporation, a global technology company based in Chennai, will use NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to optimize and deliver language models for its over 700,000 customers. The company will use NeMo running on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs to pretrain narrow, small, medium and large models from scratch for over 100 business applications.\n\nIndia\u2019s top global systems integrators are also offering NVIDIA NeMo-accelerated solutions to their customers.\n\nInfosys will work on specific tools and solutions using the NVIDIA AI stack. The company\u2019s center of excellence is also developing AI-powered small language models that will be offered to customers as a service.\nTata Consultancy Services has developed AI solutions based on NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints for the telecommunications, retail, manufacturing, automotive and financial services industries. TCS\u2019 offerings include NeMo-powered, domain-specific language models that can be customized to address customer queries and answer company-specific questions for employees for all enterprise functions such as IT, HR or field operations.\nWipro is using NVIDIA AI Enterprise software including NIM Agent Blueprints and NeMo to help businesses easily develop custom conversational AI solutions such as digital humans to support customer service interactions.\n\nWipro and TCS also use NeMo Curator\u2019s synthetic data generation pipelines to generate data in languages other than English to customize LLMs for their clients.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with businesses and developers in India, watch the replay of company founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s fireside chat at the NVIDIA AI Summit.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Inception | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Shares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June.  NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.66 -2.87 (-2.40%)  As of 3:09:40 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Nvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains. The stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.  Nvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.   Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president for AI and robotics makes a speech at Foxconn's annual tech day in Taiwan on Oct. 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang)  \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters Nvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.   Story Continues \u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201dThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201dNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

Learn More\n\n\n\nNvidia quietly unveiled a new artificial intelligence model on Tuesday that outperforms offerings from industry leaders OpenAI and Anthropic, marking a significant shift in the company\u2019s AI strategy and potentially reshaping the competitive landscape of the field.\nThe model, named Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct, appeared on the popular AI platform Hugging Face without fanfare, quickly drawing attention for its exceptional performance across multiple benchmark tests.\nNvidia reports that their new offering achieves top scores in key evaluations, including 85.0 on the Arena Hard benchmark, 57.6 on AlpacaEval 2 LC, and 8.98 on the GPT-4-Turbo MT-Bench. \nThese scores surpass those of highly regarded models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, catapulting Nvidia to the forefront of AI language understanding and generation.\nNvidia\u2019s AI gambit: From GPU powerhouse to language model pioneer\nThis release represents a pivotal moment for Nvidia. Known primarily as the dominant force in graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI systems, the company now demonstrates its capability to develop sophisticated AI software. This move signals a strategic expansion that could alter the dynamics of the AI industry, challenging the traditional dominance of software-focused companies in large language model development.\nNvidia\u2019s approach to creating Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct involved refining Meta\u2019s open-source Llama 3.1 model using advanced training techniques, including Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This method allows the AI to learn from human preferences, potentially leading to more natural and contextually appropriate responses.\nWith its superior performance, the model has the potential to offer businesses a more capable and cost-efficient alternative to some of the most advanced models on the market.\nThe model\u2019s ability to handle complex queries without additional prompting or specialized tokens is what sets it apart. In a demonstration, it correctly answered the question \u201cHow many r\u2019s are in strawberry?\u201d with a detailed and accurate response, showcasing a nuanced understanding of language and an ability to provide clear explanations.\nWhat makes these results particularly significant is the emphasis on \u201calignment,\u201d a term in AI research that refers to how well a model\u2019s output matches the needs and preferences of its users. For enterprises, this translates into fewer errors, more helpful responses, and ultimately, better customer satisfaction.\nHow Nvidia\u2019s new model could reshape business and research\nFor businesses and organizations exploring AI solutions, Nvidia\u2019s model presents a compelling new option. The company offers free hosted inference through its build.nvidia.com platform, complete with an OpenAI-compatible API interface.\nThis accessibility makes advanced AI technology more readily available, allowing a broader range of companies to experiment with and implement advanced language models.\nThe release also highlights a growing shift in the AI landscape toward models that are not only powerful but also customizable. Enterprises today need AI that can be tailored to their specific needs, whether that\u2019s handling customer service inquiries or generating complex reports. Nvidia\u2019s model offers that flexibility, along with top-tier performance, making it a compelling option for businesses across industries.\nHowever, with this power comes responsibility. Like any AI system, Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct is not immune to risks. Nvidia has cautioned that the model has not been tuned for specialized domains like math or legal reasoning, where accuracy is critical. Enterprises will need to ensure they are using the model appropriately and implementing safeguards to prevent errors or misuse.\nThe AI arms race heats up: Nvidia\u2019s bold move challenges tech giants\nNvidia\u2019s latest model release signals just how fast the AI landscape is shifting. While the long-term impact of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct remains uncertain, its release marks a clear inflection point in the competition to build the most advanced AI systems.\nBy moving from hardware into high-performance AI software, Nvidia is forcing other players to reconsider their strategies and accelerate their own R&D. This comes on the heels of the company\u2019s introduction of the NVLM 1.0 family of multimodal models, including the 72-billion-parameter NVLM-D-72B.\nThese recent releases, particularly the open-source NVLM project, have shown that Nvidia\u2019s AI ambitions go beyond just competing\u2014they are challenging the dominance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in areas ranging from image interpretation to solving complex problems.\nThe rapid succession of these releases underscores Nvidia\u2019s ambitious push into AI software development. By offering both multimodal and text-only models that compete with industry leaders, Nvidia is positioning itself as a comprehensive AI solutions provider, leveraging its hardware expertise to create powerful, accessible software tools.\nNvidia\u2019s strategy seems clear: it\u2019s positioning itself as a full-service AI provider, combining its hardware expertise with accessible, high-performance software. This move could reshape the industry, pushing rivals to innovate faster and potentially sparking more open-source collaboration across the field.\nAs developers test Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct, we\u2019re likely to see new applications emerge across sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and beyond. Its success will ultimately depend on whether it can turn impressive benchmark scores into real-world solutions.\nIn the coming months, the AI community will closely watch how Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct performs in real-world applications beyond benchmark tests. Its ability to translate high scores into practical, valuable solutions will ultimately determine its long-term impact on the industry and society at large.\nNvidia\u2019s deeper dive into AI model development has intensified the competition. If this is the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence, it\u2019s one where fully integrated solutions may set the pace for future breakthroughs.\n\n\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

AI Summit      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated October 9, 2024 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMD   -0.73%    NVDA   -2.41%     T   -0.82%    T-PA   -0.09%    INTC   +1.41%      Nvidia (NVDA) is best known for its highly coveted artificial intelligence chips. But at its Nvidia AI Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, the Nvidia vice president of Enterprise Platforms, Bob Pette, delivered an address providing greater insights into the company\u2019s various software platforms. Nvidia says companies ranging from AT&T (T), Deloitte, and Quantiphi to research centers like the National Cancer Institute and the SETI Institute are using its software technologies to do everything from helping employees work through software development and network engineering jobs to searching for signs of extraterrestrial life.  Nvidia has a number of AI software platforms including Nvidia NIM Agent Blueprints, Nvidia NIM, and Nvidia NeMo. NIM Agent Blueprints is designed to help businesses develop generative AI applications, while NIM provides the ability to quickly put together chatbots and AI assistants. Nvidia NeMo gives companies the means to build their own custom generative AI models. Shares of Nvidia rose 3.7% following the announcement. The offerings are part of Nvidia\u2019s strategy of ensuring that companies don\u2019t just look to the company for AI processors but also for its software as well, driving additional revenue streams outside of hardware sales.   President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, Sunday, June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS According to Nvidia, AT&T is teaming with Quantiphi to create a conversational AI platform to assist employees with software development and financial services tasks. The University of Florida is using Nvidia\u2019s NIM and MeMo to improve its learning management system for teaching assistants, and Deloitte is using Nvidia\u2019s NIM Agent Blueprint alongside its own cybersecurity products. Nvidia says the National Cancer Institute is using NIM Agent Blueprint to help cut down on the time and cost of developing novel drug molecules, while the SETI Institute used the company\u2019s Holoscan software development kit to create software for receiving and analyzing radio waves from space.  Nvidia is also teaming with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh as part of its new AI Tech Community initiative, establishing two new AI centers at the schools. The company says its Nvidia Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University for Robotics, Autonomy, and AI will provide students, faculty, and researchers with technologies related to robotics and autonomy, while the Nvidia Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will revolve around AI focused on health sciences. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.67 -2.86 (-2.39%)  As of 3:09:46 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA AMD INTC   Advanced Chart    Nvidia has developed the most sought-after AI chips in the world, which has sent its stock price skyrocketing a staggering 934% over the last two years. To put that in perspective, and maybe generate some envy, if you invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2022, your stake would now be worth $103,400.   Story Continues But the company is facing increasing competition in the hardware space from longtime rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia\u2019s own customers are also developing their own chips to power their AI software, which could cut into the company\u2019s bottom line in the future.Nvidia\u2019s endgame is to use software to hold on to its customers well into the future while providing recurring revenue streams.  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.  Highlighting its software also attracts developers to Nvidia\u2019s offerings, and the more developers that build on Nvidia\u2019s services, the more companies will seek out those platforms.Nvidia\u2019s hardware lead isn\u2019t going to disappear anytime soon, though. The company has been investing in AI technology for years, and it should continue to hold on to its competitive edge for some time. But by showing off its software, Nvidia is looking to prove it\u2019s more than just a chip firm.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware giant NVIDIA plans to launch its \u201cAI Tech Community\u201d initiative in Pittsburgh Monday. The chipmaking giant said the project will \u201csupercharge public-private partnerships across communities rich with potential for enabling technological transformation using AI.\u201dAs part of the new initiative, two NVIDIA technology centers will be established with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The centers are envisioned as \u201ca bridge for academia, industry and public-sector groups to partner on artificial intelligence innovation,\u201d the company said in a release.NVIDIA\u2019s center with CMU will focus on robotics, autonomy and AI by using NVIDIA\u2019s latest technology to develop new ideas in the fields of AI and robotics. Pitt\u2019s center will be aimed at innovating computational development across the health sciences, including how to use AI in clinical medicine and biomanufacturing.NVIDIA has seen a stratospheric rise in recent years as companies invest in the potential of artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s fortunes outpaced Microsoft and Apple in June. Last week, NVIDIA once again eclipsed Microsoft\u2019s market cap, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple. NVIDIA\u2019s hardware is used in all Tesla vehicles. That growth has prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to open an inquiry into potential antitrust violations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWESA Inbox Edition Newsletter\n\n        Do you like science, health and tech stories?

The cities and regions that embrace this shift will emerge as the economic winners of the future,\u201d said Joanna Doven, strategy consultant who alongside the AI Avenue Working Group will host an AI summit in Bakery Square Monday.\u201cTogether, we are positioning Pittsburgh not only as a global AI leader but also as a powerhouse for job creation, fostering thousands of new, high-quality jobs in the industries of tomorrow,\" she said.Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to speak at the summit, where more details about the new technology hubs will be unveiled.NVIDIA will provide CMU and Pitt with its computing chips, AI and graphics software as well as a slate of other software for robotics learning and custom generative AI. The company said NVIDIA\u2019s tech support will allow the centers to enhance the speed and scalability of their work.\u201cThese centers will tap into NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack AI platform and accelerated computing expertise to gear up tomorrow\u2019s technology leaders for next-generation innovation,\u201d the company said in a blog post last week.\n\n\nNews from WESA\n\n\n\nPittsburgh museums and libraries face possible federal funding turmoil\n\n\nPittsburgh NAACP branch grapples with its future\n\n\nPittsburgh's Warhol Museum hosts its first show by CMU art students\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPairing Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s existing deep expertise and resources in AI and robotics with NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge platform, software and tools has tremendous potential to power Pittsburgh\u2019s already vibrant innovation ecosystem,\u201d said Theresa Mayer, vice president for research at CMU.CMU has been ranked as the nation\u2019s top AI university according to the U.S. News & World Report, and maintains the world\u2019s largest university-affiliated robotics research group.Rob Rutenbar, senior vice chancellor for research at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a statement that the university has a long history of \u201cextraordinary research\u201d in life sciences.\u201cBy focusing on computational and AI opportunities across these \u2018meds and eds\u2019 areas, we plan to leverage our collaboration with NVIDIA to explore new ways to connect these breakthroughs to improved health and education outcomes for everybody,\u201d he said.The centers will also partner with Pittsburgh\u2019s local AI tech startups including Lovelace AI and Skild AI as well as the Pittsburgh Robotics Network.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nHealth, Science & Tech\nTop Story\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiley Koscinski\n\n\n                \n                    Kiley Koscinski is 90.5 WESA's health and science reporter.

Learn More\n\n\n\nNvidia has released a powerful open-source artificial intelligence model that competes with proprietary systems from industry leaders like OpenAI and Google.\nThe company\u2019s new NVLM 1.0 family of large multimodal language models, led by the 72 billion parameter NVLM-D-72B, demonstrates exceptional performance across vision and language tasks while also enhancing text-only capabilities.\n\u201cWe introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models,\u201d the researchers explain in their paper.\nBy making the model weights publicly available and promising to release the training code, Nvidia breaks from the trend of keeping advanced AI systems closed. This decision grants researchers and developers unprecedented access to cutting-edge technology.\nBenchmark results comparing NVIDIA\u2019s NVLM-D model to AI giants like GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Llama 3-V, showing NVLM-D\u2019s competitive performance across various visual and language tasks. (Credit: arxiv.org)\nNVLM-D-72B: A versatile performer in visual and textual tasks\nThe NVLM-D-72B model shows impressive adaptability in processing complex visual and textual inputs. Researchers provided examples that highlight the model\u2019s ability to interpret memes, analyze images, and solve mathematical problems step-by-step.\nNotably, NVLM-D-72B improves its performance on text-only tasks after multimodal training. While many similar models see a decline in text performance, NVLM-D-72B increased its accuracy by an average of 4.3 points across key text benchmarks.\n\u201cOur NVLM-D-1.0-72B demonstrates significant improvements over its text backbone on text-only math and coding benchmarks,\u201d the researchers note, emphasizing a key advantage of their approach.\nNVIDIA\u2019s new AI model analyzes a meme comparing academic abstracts to full papers, demonstrating its ability to interpret visual humor and scholarly concepts. (Credit: arxiv.org)\nAI researchers respond to Nvidia\u2019s open-source initiative\nThe AI community has reacted positively to the release. One AI researcher commenting on social media, observed, \u201cWow! Nvidia just published a 72B model with is ~on par with llama 3.1 405B in math and coding evals and also has vision ?\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s decision to make such a powerful model openly available could accelerate AI research and development across the field. By providing access to a model that rivals proprietary systems from well-funded tech companies, Nvidia may enable smaller organizations and independent researchers to contribute more significantly to AI advancements.\nThe NVLM project also introduces innovative architectural designs, including a hybrid approach that combines different multimodal processing techniques. This development could shape the direction of future research in the field.\n\nWow nvidia just published a 72B model with is ~on par with llama 3.1 405B in math and coding evals and also has vision ? pic.twitter.com/c46DeXql7s\u2014 Phil (@phill__1) October 1, 2024\n\nNVLM 1.0: A new chapter in open-source AI development\nNvidia\u2019s release of NVLM 1.0 marks a pivotal moment in AI development. By open-sourcing a model that rivals proprietary giants, Nvidia isn\u2019t just sharing code\u2014it\u2019s challenging the very structure of the AI industry.\nThis move could spark a chain reaction. Other tech leaders may feel pressure to open their research, potentially accelerating AI progress across the board. It also levels the playing field, allowing smaller teams and researchers to innovate with tools once reserved for tech giants.\nHowever, NVLM 1.0\u2019s release isn\u2019t without risks. As powerful AI becomes more accessible, concerns about misuse and ethical implications will likely grow. The AI community now faces the complex task of promoting innovation while establishing guardrails for responsible use.\nNvidia\u2019s decision also raises questions about the future of AI business models. If state-of-the-art models become freely available, companies may need to rethink how they create value and maintain competitive edges in AI.\nThe true impact of NVLM 1.0 will unfold in the coming months and years. It could usher in an era of unprecedented collaboration and innovation in AI. Or, it might force a reckoning with the unintended consequences of widely available, advanced AI.\nOne thing is certain: Nvidia has fired a shot across the bow of the AI industry. The question now is not if the landscape will change, but how dramatically\u2014and who will adapt fast enough to thrive in this new world of open AI.\n\n\n\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

More than two-thirds (69%) of organizations expect to use generative AI for open innovation by 2025\u2014up from 29% in 2022.\u00a0\nTo help clients embrace generative AI, IBM is extending its high-performance computing (HPC) offerings, giving enterprises more power and versatility to carry out research, innovation and business transformation. With the general availability of NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances on IBM Cloud, which we previewed during Think 2024, businesses will have access to a powerful platform for AI applications, including large language model (LLM) training. This new GPU joins IBM Cloud\u2019s existing lineup of accelerated computing offerings to leverage during every stage of an enterprise\u2019s AI implementation.\nClients looking to transform with AI can apply IBM\u2019s watsonx AI studio, data lakehouse, and governance toolkit to even the most demanding, compute-intensive applications, raising the ceiling for innovation\u2014even in the most highly regulated industries.\nCutting-edge power\n\r\nNVIDIA H100 on IBM Cloud builds on IBM\u2019s work to support generative AI model training and inferencing. Last year, we began making the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs available to clients through IBM Cloud, giving them immense processing headroom to innovate with AI via our watsonx platform, or as GPUaaS for custom needs.\nThe new NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU takes this progression a step further, which NVIDIA reports can enable up to 30X faster inference performance over the A100. It has the potential to give IBM Cloud customers a range of processing capabilities while also addressing the cost of enterprise-wide AI tuning and inferencing. Businesses can start small, training small-scale models, fine-tuning models, or deploying applications like chatbots, natural language search, and using forecasting tools using NVIDIA L40S and L4 Tensor Core GPUs. As their needs grow, IBM Cloud customers can adjust their spend accordingly, eventually harnessing the H100 for the most demanding AI and HPC use cases.\u00a0\nBy offering direct access to these NVIDIA GPUs on IBM Cloud, in VPC and managed Red Hat OpenShift environments, we are driving easier transformation to gain a competitive advantage with generative AI. Combined with watsonx for building AI models and managing data complexity and governance, as well as our tools for security, enterprises of all sizes have the potential to tackle the challenges of scaling AI.\u00a0\nWhy IBM Cloud for AI and HPC?\nIBM Cloud offers a comprehensive platform for enterprises to build custom AI applications, manage their data, and support security and compliance initiatives.\u00a0\n\nData privacy, security and compliance support. IBM Cloud applies multi-level security protocols designed to protect AI and HPC processes and guard against data leakage and data privacy concerns. It also includes built-in controls to establish infrastructure and data guardrails for AI workloads.\nAI model governance. Operationalizing AI efficiently is not possible without end-to-end AI lifecycle tracking using automated processes for clarity, monitoring and cataloging. Built on the IBM\u00ae watsonx AI and data platform, watsonx.governance helps direct and manage organizations\u2019 AI activities and monitors them for quality and drift. Regulators and auditors can get access to documentation that provides explanations of the model\u2019s behavior and predictions.\u00a0\nDeployment automation. IBM Cloud automates the deployment of AI-powered applications, to help address the time and errors that could occur with manual configuration. It also provides essential services such as AI lifecycle management solutions, serverless platform, storage, security and solutions to help clients monitor their compliance.\u00a0\n\nThe NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances on IBM Cloud are now available in our multi-zone regions (MZRs) in North America, Latin America, Europe, Japan and Australia.

And if there\u2019s one company that everyone is watching, it\u2019s Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.  The jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company\u2019s upcoming Blackwell chip is \u201cinsane\u201d during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday. Nvidia\u2019s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule.   Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS In the company\u2019s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn\u2019t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors. Don\u2019t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company\u2019s stock price to recover. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.65 -2.88 (-2.41%)  As of 3:09:48 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA AMD INTC   Advanced Chart    The AI trade hasn\u2019t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%. Broadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.  Then there\u2019s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space. But Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.   Story Continues They\u2019ll also look at how other chip companies perform this quarter ahead of Nvidia\u2019s announcement, which tends to be far later in the earnings cycle than its contemporaries.Wall Street will similarly be on the lookout for information about Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell rollout and whether the company is facing any supply constraints as it did with its Hopper chips. Either way, it\u2019s going to be a wild few weeks. Buckle up.  Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 yahoofinanceEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The creation process was accelerated using the NVIDIA Studio content creation platform and Amirazodi\u2019s NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPU.\nThis year, Amirazodi deployed new AI workflows in ComfyUI, Adobe Firefly and Photoshop to create digital portraits \u2014 inspired by his family \u2014 as part of the installation.\nGive \u2019em Pumpkin to Talk About\nComfyUI is a node-based interface that generates images and videos from text. It\u2019s designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to design workflows, adjust settings and see results immediately. It can combine various AI models and third-party extensions to achieve a higher degree of control.\nFor example, this workflow below requires entering a prompt, the details and characteristics of the desired image, and a negative prompt to help omit any undesired visual effects.\n\nSince Amirazodi wanted his digital creations to closely resemble his family, he started by applying Run IP Adapters, which use reference images to inform generated content.\nComfyUI nodes and reference material in the viewer.\nFrom there, he tinkered with the settings to achieve the desired look and feel of each character.\nThe Amirazodis digitized for the \u2018Halloween Sanctuary\u2019 installation.\nComfyUI has NVIDIA TensorRT acceleration, so RTX users can generate images from prompts up to 60% faster.\n\nGet started with ComfyUI.\nIn Darkness, Let There Be Light\nAdobe Firefly is a family of creative generative AI models that offer new ways to ideate and create while assisting creative workflows. They\u2019re designed to be safe for commercial use and were trained, using NVIDIA GPUs, on licensed content like Adobe Stock Images and public domain content where copyright has expired.\nTo make the digital portraits fit as desired, Amirazodi needed to expand the background.\nAdobe Photoshop features a Generative Fill tool called Generative Expand that allows artists to extend the border of their image with the Crop tool and automatically fill the space with content that matches the existing image.\n\nPhotoshop also features \u201cNeural Filters that allow artists to explore creative ideas and make complex adjustments to images in just seconds, saving them hours of tedious, manual work.\n\nWith Smart Portrait Neural Filters, artists can easily experiment with facial characteristics such as gaze direction and lighting angles simply by dragging a slider. Amirazodi used the feature to apply the final touches to his portraits, adjusting colors, textures, depth blur and facial expressions.\n\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs help power AI-based tasks, accelerating the Neural Filters in Photoshop.\n\nLearn more about the latest Adobe features and tools in this blog.\n\nAI is already helping accelerate and automate tasks across content creation, gaming and everyday life \u2014 and the speedups are only multiplied with an NVIDIA RTX- or GeForce RTX GPU-equipped system.\nCheck out and share Halloween- and fall-themed art as a part of the NVIDIA Studio #HarvestofCreativity challenge on Instagram, X, Facebook and Threads for a chance to be featured on the social media channels.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AI Decoded | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Vasseur and Cisco did not respond to requests for comment.\nNvidia Makes Multibillion-Dollar Ethernet Sales Push\nVasseur\u2019s announcement comes a little more than a month after Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that the company\u2019s Spectrum-X line of Ethernet networking products for data centers is \u201cwell on track to begin a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\u201d\nKress made the comment during Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earnings report in late August and also said that the company\u2019s Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X products, doubled sequentially from the previous quarter.\n\u201cSpectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by [cloud service providers], GPU cloud providers and enterprise, including [Elon Musk\u2019s] X.ai, to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world,\u201d she said.\nClaiming that Spectrum-X \u201csupercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6 [times greater] the performance of traditional Ethernet,\u201d Kress said Nvidia plans to launch new Spectrum-X products every year\u2014alongside new chips\u2014to \u201csupport demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future.\u201d\nThe decision for Nvidia to hire a Cisco engineering veteran with experience at the intersection of AI and networking should serve as another sign that the AI computing giant is making networking a major priority, a principal engineer at a solution provider told CRN.\n\u201cThey want to focus on networking in a big way, which makes sense why that guy went over to them,\u201d said the engineer, who asked that he not be named because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak as a representative of his company.\nNvidia started making a big push into networking when it acquired high-speed interconnect vendor Mellanox Technologies for $7 billion in 2019. Since then, Mellanox\u2019s technologies have played a significant role in Nvidia\u2019s strategy to become a \u201cdata center-scale computing company,\u201d as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang once said.\nWhile the company sells a variety of networking products, from Ethernet and InfiniBand switches to data processing units and SmartNICs, Nvidia uses these products as essential building blocks for AI servers and data centers that are designed in house and increasingly sold to a variety of customers, from enterprises to cloud service providers.\nWith Nvidia recently joining the Ultra Ethernet Consortium alongside other tech giants to develop specifications for high-speed networking solutions, the principal engineer at the solution provider said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Nvidia eventually expanded its networking sales push to cover a much wider portion of the data center market.\n\u201cI think they might be banking on the fact that they'll get out of just deploying Mellanox networking and [the company\u2019s] BasePod and SuperPod [AI supercomputer clusters] and start making that be a part of enterprise networks as they begin to go down this Ultra Ethernet Consortium-type approach,\u201d he said.\nVasseur: A Celebrated Engineer And Top Inventor At Cisco\nWith a doctorate and master\u2019s in computer systems networking and telecommunications from T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris in France and the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, respectively, Vasseur spent the past 25 years at Cisco where he was a celebrated engineer and top inventor who worked on high-priority initiatives.\nA blog post by Cisco in 2019 called Vasseur the company\u2019s \u201ctop inventor,\u201d with 483 issued patents carrying his name and \u201cspanning key tech areas from machine learning and AI in security in enterprises to the Internet of Things.\u201d\n\u201cHe is one of only 19 Cisco Fellows out of 30,000 engineers, constantly pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d Cisco said in the blog post.\nIn his most recent role as vice president of engineering of machine learning and AI for networking, Vasseur said he led the development of \u201clarge language model and generative AI use case specifications, system architecture design, prompt engineering, model tuning and sophisticated techniques such as Knowledge DB and [retrieval-augmented generation],\u201d according to his LinkedIn profile.\nHe previously served as the head of engineering for various high-profile areas including predictive networks, IoT and advanced threat detection.\nWhen Vasseur announced that he was leaving Cisco two weeks ago, he said, \u201cone of the most exciting parts of my journey has been contributing to the birth and explosive growth of a new industry: the Internet, to which Cisco made significant contributions.\u201d\nNow at Nvidia, Vasseur seemed to indicate that he sees his work at the AI computing giant as another journey that will bring about great change.\n\u201cJensen Huang\u2019s vision for Nvidia to build the new area of accelerated computing and industry with the AI factory is incredibly inspiring, and I am thrilled to join this journey and a highly talented team!\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The models are built on the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, which allows models with a high number of parameters to maintain efficiency. The Flux models are trained on 12 billion parameters for high-quality image generation.\nDiT models are efficient and computationally intensive \u2014 and NVIDIA RTX GPUs are essential for handling these new models, the largest of which can\u2019t run on non-RTX GPUs without significant tweaking. Flux models now support the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit, which improves their performance up to 20%. Users can try Flux and other models with TensorRT in ComfyUI.\nPrompt: \u201cA magazine photo of a monkey bathing in a hot spring in a snowstorm with steam coming off the water.\u201d Source: NVIDIA\nFlux Appeal\nFLUX.1 excels in generating high-quality, diverse images with exceptional prompt adherence, which refers to how accurately the AI interprets and executes instructions. High prompt adherence means the generated image closely matches the text prompt\u2019s described elements, style and mood. Low prompt adherence results in images that may partially or completely deviate from given instructions.\nFLUX.1 is noted for its ability to render the human anatomy accurately, including for challenging, intricate features like hands and faces. FLUX.1 also significantly improves the generation of legible text within images, addressing another common challenge in text-to-image models. This makes FLUX.1 models suitable for applications that require precise text representation, such as promotional materials and book covers.\nFLUX.AI is available in three variants, offering users choices to best fit their workflows without sacrificing quality:\n\nFLUX.1 pro: State-of-the-art quality for enterprise users; accessible through an application programming interface.\nFLUX.1 dev: A distilled, free version of FLUX.1 pro that still provides high quality.\nFLUX.1 schnell: The fastest model, ideal for local development and personal use; has a permissive Apache 2.0 license.\n\nThe dev and schnell models are open source, and Black Forest Labs provides access to its weights on the popular platform Hugging Face. This encourages innovation and collaboration within the image generation community by allowing researchers and developers to build upon and enhance the models.\nEmbraced by the Community\nThe Flux models\u2019 dev and schnell variants were downloaded more than 2 million times on HuggingFace in less than three weeks since their launch.\nUsers have praised FLUX.1 for its abilities to produce visually stunning images with exceptional detail and realism, as well as to process complex prompts without requiring extensive parameter adjustments.\nPrompt: \u201cA highly detailed professional close-up photo of an animorphic Bengal tiger wearing a white, ribbed tank top, sunglasses and headphones around his neck as a DJ with its paws on the turntable on stage at an outdoor electronic dance music concert in Ibiza at night; party atmosphere, wispy smoke with caustic lighting.\u201d Source: NVIDIA\n\u00a0\nPrompt: \u201cA photographic-quality image of a bustling city street during a rainy evening with a yellow taxi cab parked at the curb with its headlights on, reflecting off the wet pavement.

Streetlights illuminate the area, casting a warm glow over the scene, while raindrops create a misty effect in the air. In the background, a tall building with a large digital clock displays the time as 8:45 p.m.\u201d Source: NVIDIA\nIn addition, FLUX.1\u2019s versatility in handling various artistic styles and efficiency in quickly generating images makes it a valuable tool for both personal and professional projects.\nGet Started\nUsers can access FLUX.1 using popular community webpages like ComfyUI. The community-run ComfyUI Wiki includes step-by-step instructions for getting started.\nMany YouTube creators also offer video tutorials on Flux models, like this one from MDMZ:\n\nShare your generated images on social media using the hashtag #fluxRTX for a chance to be featured on NVIDIA AI\u2019s channels.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nThe U.S. healthcare system is adopting digital health agents to harness AI across the board, from research laboratories to clinical settings.\nThe latest AI-accelerated tools \u2014 on display at the NVIDIA AI Summit taking place this week in Washington, D.C. \u2014 include NVIDIA NIM, a collection of cloud-native microservices that support AI model deployment and execution, and NVIDIA Blueprints, a catalog of pretrained, customizable workflows.\u00a0\nThese technologies are already in use in the public sector to advance the analysis of medical images, aid the search for new therapeutics and extract information from massive PDF databases containing text, tables and graphs.\u00a0\nFor example, researchers at the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are using several AI models built with NVIDIA MONAI for medical imaging \u2014 including the VISTA-3D NIM foundation model for segmenting and annotating 3D CT images. A team at NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is using the NVIDIA Blueprint for generative AI-based virtual screening to reduce the time and cost of developing novel drug molecules.\nWith NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA Blueprints, medical researchers across the public sector can jump-start their adoption of state-of-the-art, optimized AI models to accelerate their work. The pretrained models are customizable based on an organization\u2019s own data and can be continually refined based on user feedback.\nNIM microservices and NVIDIA Blueprints are available at ai.nvidia.com and accessible through a wide variety of cloud service providers, global system integrators and technology solutions providers.\u00a0\nBuilding With NVIDIA Blueprints\nDozens of NIM microservices and a growing set of NVIDIA Blueprints are available for developers to experience and download for free. They can be deployed in production with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\n\nThe blueprint for generative virtual screening for drug discovery brings together three NIM microservices to help researchers search and optimize libraries of small molecules to identify promising candidates that bind to a target protein.\nThe multimodal PDF data extraction blueprint uses NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM microservices to extract insights from enterprise documents, helping developers build powerful AI agents and chatbots.\nThe digital human blueprint supports the creation of interactive, AI-powered avatars for customer service. These avatars have potential applications in telehealth and nonclinical aspects of patient care, such as scheduling appointments, filling out intake forms and managing prescriptions.\n\nTwo new NIM microservices for drug discovery are now available on ai.nvidia.com to help researchers understand how proteins bind to target molecules, a crucial step in drug design. By conducting more of this preclinical research digitally, scientists can narrow down their pool of drug candidates before testing in the lab \u2014 making the discovery process more efficient and less expensive.\u00a0\nWith the AlphaFold2-Multimer NIM microservice, researchers can accurately predict protein structure from their sequences in minutes, reducing the need for time-consuming tests in the lab. The RFdiffusion NIM microservice uses generative AI to design novel proteins that are promising drug candidates because they\u2019re likely to bind with a target molecule.\u00a0\nNCATS Accelerates Drug Discovery Research\nASPIRE, a research laboratory at NCATS, is evaluating the NVIDIA Blueprint for virtual screening and is using RAPIDS, a suite of open-source software libraries for GPU-accelerated data science, to accelerate its drug discovery research. Using the cuGraph library for graph data analytics and cuDF library for accelerating data frames, the lab\u2019s researchers can map chemical reactions across the vast unknown chemical space.\u00a0\nThe NCATS informatics team reported that with NVIDIA AI, processes that used to take hours on CPU-based infrastructure are now done in seconds.\nMassive quantities of healthcare data \u2014 including research papers, radiology reports and patient records \u2014 are unstructured and locked in PDF documents, making it difficult for researchers to quickly search for information.\u00a0\nThe Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, also run by NCATS, is exploring using the PDF data extraction blueprint to develop generative AI tools that enhance the center\u2019s ability to glean information from previously unsearchable databases. These tools will help answer questions from those affected by rare diseases.\n\u201cThe center analyzes data sources spanning the National Library of Medicine, the Orphanet database and other institutes and centers within the NIH to answer patient questions,\u201d said Sam Michael, chief information officer of NCATS. \u201cAI-powered PDF data extraction can make it massively easier to extract valuable information from previously unsearchable databases.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nMi-NIM-al Effort, Maximum Benefit: Getting Started With NIM\u00a0\nA growing number of startups, cloud service providers and global systems integrators include NVIDIA NIM microservices and NVIDIA Blueprints as part of their platforms and services, making it easy for federal healthcare researchers to get started.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAbridge, an NVIDIA Inception startup and NVentures portfolio company, was recently awarded a contract from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to help transcribe and summarize clinical appointments, reducing the burden on doctors to document each patient interaction.\nThe company uses NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM to accelerate AI inference and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for deploying its audio-to-text and content summarization models at scale, some of the same technologies that power NIM microservices.\nThe NVIDIA Blueprint for virtual screening is now available through AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service that helps customers orchestrate biological data analyses.\u00a0\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a partner of the NIH Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability Initiative, aka STRIDES Initiative, which aims to modernize the biomedical research ecosystem by reducing economic and process barriers to accessing commercial cloud services. NVIDIA and AWS are collaborating to make NVIDIA Blueprints broadly accessible to the biomedical research community.\u00a0\nConcertAI, another NVIDIA Inception member, is an oncology AI technology company focused on research and clinical standard-of-care solutions. The company is integrating NIM microservices, NVIDIA CUDA-X microservices and the NVIDIA NeMo platform into its suite of AI solutions for large-scale clinical data processing, multi-agent models and clinical foundation models.\u00a0\nNVIDIA NIM microservices are supporting ConcertAI\u2019s high-performance, low-latency AI models through its CARA AI platform. Use cases include clinical trial design, optimization and patient matching \u2014 as well as solutions that can help boost the standard of care and augment clinical decision-making.\nGlobal systems integrator Deloitte is bringing the NVIDIA Blueprint for virtual screening to its customers worldwide. With Deloitte Atlas AI, the company can help clients at federal health agencies easily use NIM to adopt and deploy the latest generative AI pipelines for drug discovery.\u00a0\nExperience NVIDIA NIM microservices and NVIDIA Blueprints today.\nNVIDIA AI Summit Highlights Healthcare Innovation\nAt the NVIDIA AI Summit in Washington, NVIDIA leaders, customers and partners are presenting over 50 sessions highlighting impactful work in the public sector.\u00a0\nRegister for a free virtual pass to hear how healthcare researchers are accelerating innovation with NVIDIA-powered AI in these sessions:\u00a0\n\nFederal Healthcare Leadership Panel: The Growing Importance of AI to U.S. Government Health features leaders from NVIDIA, NIH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and more.\nBoosting U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness in AI-Enabled Healthcare and Biology features Renee Wegrzyn, director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, and Rory Kelleher, global head of business development for life sciences at NVIDIA.\nAccelerated Computing Improves Translational Genomics Research features Justin Zook, coleader of the biomarker and genomic sciences group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Laura Egolf, computational scientist at the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, discussing their use of NVIDIA Parabricks software for genomics research.\nBuilding a Specialized Interactive Foundation Model for 3D CT Segmentation features Baris Turkbey, senior clinician and head of MRI and Artificial Intelligence Resource in the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Molecular Imaging Branch, and Pengfei Guo, applied research scientist at NVIDIA.\n\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | Research | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inference | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Public Sector | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The summit included keynote remarks from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, discussing Pittsburgh\u2019s global role in human-first AI innovation.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for Pitt and for Pittsburgh,\u201d said Chancellor Joan Gabel in remarks preceding the MOU signing. \u201cI want to express our pride of collaboration with NVIDIA as well as our pride in our city and with our neighbor and our friends at Carnegie Mellon University on what is truly a historic, new legacy-building day.\u201d\nHooman Rashidi, associate dean for AI in medicine at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s School of Medicine, also served as a panelist on a session examining the AI innovations that will shape the future of health, including data protection and patient privacy.\nAnantha Shekhar, senior vice chancellor for the health sciences and John and Gertrude Petersen Dean of the School of Medicine, said the collaboration with NVIDIA will be leveraged to explore new ways to connect computing breakthroughs to improved health outcomes for everyone.\n\u201cAs a top-tier institution for the study of health sciences, it\u2019s imperative that we continually educate our entire academic community on the best ways to optimize AI for the equitable study, prevention and treatment of disease,\u201d Shekhar said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the potential for this partnership to help us achieve this goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t  \t  From left, NVIDIA Federal Vice President Anthony Robbins, Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian and Gov.

Pitt\u2019s Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC) is investigating how AI can improve student learning and has already established collaborative infrastructure for researchers from areas as diverse as business, law, psychology, education and computer science to study disciplinary\u00a0differences in AI learning tech across these spaces.\n\u201cPitt has extraordinary research strengths in life sciences and in learning sciences,\u201d said Rob A. Rutenbar, Pitt\u2019s senior vice chancellor for research. \u201cOur new NVIDIA partnership gives us access to state-of-the-art AI technologies applicable across the full spectrum of our world-leading \u2018meds and eds\u2019 research.\u201d\nAdditional information regarding the AI Tech Community and NVIDIA\u2019s Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems can be found on NVIDIA\u2019s blog.\n\u00a0\nPhotography by Aimee Obidzinski\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\nPitt\u2019s spring commencement will be held at PPG Paints Arena on May 4\n\nEntrepreneurs, join Pitt\u2019s updated alumni business directory\n\nPitt undergrads will offer free tax assistance starting in February\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Menu\n\n\nApply\n\n\nVisit\n\n\nGive\n\n\nPittwire\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nAcademics\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nLife at Pitt\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links & Resources\n\n\nQuick Links & Resources\n\n\nAccessibility Statement\n\n\nAffordability\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nDepartments A-Z\n\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\n\nFind People\n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\nLGBTQ+\n\n\nNondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nPromoting Accountability and Trust\n\n\nMy Pitt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Campuses\n\n\nRegional Campuses\n\n\nBradford\n\n\nGreensburg\n\n\nJohnstown\n\n\nTitusville\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColleges & Schools\n\n\nColleges & Schools\n\n\nArts & Sciences\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\nComputing & Information\n\n\nDental Medicine\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\nGeneral Studies\n\n\nHealth & Rehabilitation\n\n\nHonors College\n\n\nLaw\n\n\nMedicine\n\n\nNursing\n\n\nPharmacy\n\n\nPublic & Intl Affairs\n\n\nPublic Health\n\n\nSocial Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4200 Fifth Ave.\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\nUnited States\n\n\n+1 412-624-4141\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

city\u2019s robotics, autonomy and artificial intelligence innovation ecosystem.\u00a0The initiative was launched Oct. 14 during a ceremonial signing at the\u00a0AI Horizons Summit(opens in new window) with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, CMU President Farnam Jahanian(opens in new window), Pitt Chancellor Joan Gabel and Anthony Robbins, federal vice president at NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJahanian, Robbins, Shapiro and Gabel.\n\n\u201cWe need to lean into innovation and adapt to the changing tech environment while we continue to educate ourselves about new technology \u2014 that\u2019s why last year, I signed an executive order to govern the use of generative artificial intelligence and take advantage of the opportunities this new technology presents to ensure our commonwealth approaches gen AI responsibly and ethically,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cWhen I signed that executive order, I also announced that my administration was partnering with Carnegie Mellon University, one of Pennsylvania\u2019s leading generative AI research institutions, to leverage the expertise we have in Pennsylvania on generative AI usage. Building on that collaboration, the NVIDIA AI Tech Community is an example of how Pennsylvania is working to bring industry leaders together to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits of artificial intelligence. With strong institutions like NVIDIA and Carnegie Mellon, Pennsylvania is continuing to lead the nation in responsible, ethical uses of generative artificial intelligence.\u201dThe academic foundation of the NVIDIA AI Tech Community will be two new joint research centers established in Pittsburgh. CMU will lead a center focused on robotics, autonomy and AI; the University of Pittsburgh will lead a center focused on AI and intelligent systems to advance computational opportunities across the health sciences.\u00a0Through its joint research center, CMU researchers will be able to collaborate with an embedded NVIDIA \u201csolutions architect\u201d to leverage NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack AI platform, software and computing expertise and gain early access to new technologies that could advance their research.\u00a0\u00a0It will enhance the university\u2019s existing deep knowledge and resources in machine learning, programming, data analysis, design, physics and math, which has made CMU a world center for AI for more than half a century.\"AI and robotics are transforming society and reshaping markets and industries at a truly unprecedented scale and pace, and with its many innovation assets, the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned at the center of this transition,\" said Jahanian. \"This exciting partnership will further accelerate that leadership, bringing together NVIDIA\u2019s expertise in cutting-edge technologies with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s pioneering AI research to unlock groundbreaking solutions across public and private sectors, including in energy, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, and more. This partnership aligns with Governor Shapiro\u2019s ambitious economic development plan for the Commonwealth and will further catalyze a future where AI and emerging technologies bring new economic opportunities and enhanced quality of life for all.\"Pittsburgh start-ups and local software companies will also gain access to the technologies and training resources needed to fuel growth through NVIDIA\u2019s AI Tech Community initiative. NVIDIA will increase engagement with its\u00a0NVIDIA Inception(opens in new window) program for AI startups and\u00a0NVIDIA Connect(opens in new window) program for software development companies and service providers.\u00a0For example,\u00a0Skild AI(opens in new window), a startup founded in 2023 by CMU professors\u00a0Deepak Pathak(opens in new window) and\u00a0Abhinav Gupta(opens in new window), is developing a scalable robotics foundation model, Skild Brain, that can easily adapt across hardware and tasks. Skild AI is exploring NVIDIA technology that allows developers to design, simulate, test and train AI-based robots and autonomous machines.\u00a0NVIDIA is also collaborating with technology accelerators like\u00a0Innovation Works(opens in new window) and the\u00a0Pittsburgh Robotics Network(opens in new window), which supports the commercialization of robotics, autonomy and AI companies in southwestern Pennsylvania.\u00a0\u201cPittsburgh's transformation into a tech hub makes it an ideal city for launching the NVIDIA AI Tech Community,\u201d said Jack Wells, Director of Global Business Development Higher Education and Research, NVIDIA.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re working with the world-class thought leaders at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh to accelerate advances in critical areas such as generative AI, distributed autonomy, and intelligent healthcare systems.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Related Content \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA AI Tech Community Announced in Pittsburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s AI-Powered Renaissance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGov.

The majority of the presented work is focused on automotive research, including:\n\nRealGen: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Controllable Traffic Scenarios is inspired by the success of retrieval-augmented generation in large language models. RealGen is a novel retrieval-based, in-context learning framework for traffic scenario generation. It synthesizes new scenarios by combining behaviors from multiple retrieved examples.\nThe NeRFect Match: Exploring NeRF Features for Visual Localization examines visual localization \u2014 the task of determining the camera pose of a query image with respect to a 3D environment. The ability to localize an agent in 3D is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving.\nDolphins: Multimodal Language Model for Driving introduces Dolphins, a novel vision-language model architected to imbibe human-like driving abilities. Dolphins is adept at processing multimodal inputs comprising video or image data, text instructions and historical control signals to generate informed outputs corresponding to the provided instructions.\n\nIn addition, Tsung-Yi Lin, principal research scientist at NVIDIA, has been awarded the Koenderink Prize, a Test of Time award that honors fundamental contributions in computer vision. The prize is awarded biannually for an impactful paper published 10 years ago at ECCV. This year\u2019s prize recognizes the 2014 publication Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context, coauthored by Lin.\nNVIDIA researchers are co-organizing and speaking in a number of ECCV workshops. Of note is the Workshop on Cooperative Intelligence for Embodied AI, which focuses on cooperative intelligence within multi-agent autonomous systems. The Workshop on Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving covers visual perception and vision-language models for autonomous driving, as well as neural rendering of driving scenes.\nLaura Leal-Taix\u00e9, senior research manager at NVIDIA, is the general chair of the conference. NVIDIA\u2019s Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research; Jose Alvarez, director of AV applied research; Sanja Fidler, vice president of AI research; and Marco Pavone, director of AV research, are on organizing committees.\nSee the full list of NVIDIA\u2019s ECCV-accepted publications:\n\nRealGen: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Simulating Realistic and Controllable Driving Scenarios\nThe NeRFect Match: Exploring NeRF Features for Visual Localization\nDolphins: Multimodal Language Model for Driving\nPhotorealistic Object Insertion With Diffusion-Guided Inverse Rendering\nSEGIC: Unleashing the Emergent Correspondence for In-Context Segmentation\nBetter Call SAL: Towards Learning to Segment Anything in Lidar\nAccelerating Online Mapping and Behavior Prediction via Direct BEV Feature Attention\nSPAMming Labels: Efficient Annotations for the Trackers of Tomorrow\nDiffiT: Diffusion Vision Transformers for Image Generation\nLITA: Language Instructed Temporal-Localization Assistant\nAvatar Fingerprinting for Authorized Use of Synthetic Talking-Head Videos\nCOIN: Control-Inpainting Diffusion Prior for Human and Camera Motion Estimation\nA Semantic Space Is Worth 256 Language Descriptions: Make Stronger Segmentation Models With Descriptive Properties\nLCM-Lookahead for Encoder-Based Text-to-Image Personalization\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA Research and watch the NVIDIA DRIVE Labs video series.\nImage credit: The NeRFect Match: Exploring NeRF Features for Visual Localization.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | ResearchTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA Research \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nAhead of a visit to the hospital for a surgical procedure, patients often have plenty of questions about what to expect \u2014 and can be plenty nervous.\nTo help minimize presurgery jitters, Deloitte is enhancing its Quartz Frontline AI, an AI solution for customer service powered by NVIDIA AI, to now include AI agents to bring the next generation of digital, frontline teammates to patients before they even step foot inside the hospital.\n\u201cThe Frontline AI Teammate offers a novel and innovative solution to help combat our health human resource crisis.\u201d \u2014 Mathieu LeBreton, digital experience lead at The Ottawa Hospital\n\nThese virtual teammates, built with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, can have natural, human-like conversations with patients, answer a wide range of questions and provide support prior to preadmission appointments at hospitals.\nWorking with NVIDIA, Deloitte has added Frontline AI Teammate to its Quartz platform for use in settings like hospitals, where the digital avatar can have practical conversations \u2014 in multiple languages \u2014 that give the end user, such as a patient, instant answers to pressing questions.\n\u201cAvatar-based conversational AI agents offer an incredible opportunity to reduce the productivity paradox that our healthcare system faces with digitization,\u201d said Niraj Dalmia, partner at Deloitte Canada. \u201cIt could possibly be the complementary innovation that reduces administrative burden, complements our healthcare human resources to free up capacity and helps solve for patient experience challenges.\u201d\nNext-Gen Technologies Powering Digital Humans\nDigital human technology can provide lifelike interactions that can enhance experiences for doctors and patients.\nDeloitte\u2019s Frontline AI Teammate, built with NVIDIA AI Enterprise and Deloitte\u2019s Conversational AI Framework, is designed to deliver human-to-machine experiences in healthcare settings. Developed on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, Deloitte\u2019s lifelike avatar can respond to complex, domain-specific questions that are pivotal in healthcare delivery.\nDevelopers can tap into NVIDIA NIM microservices, which streamline the path for developing AI-powered applications and moving AI models into production, to craft digital humans for healthcare industry applications.\nNVIDIA Blueprints offer a customizable, reference AI workflow for creating interactive, AI-driven avatars that are ideal for telehealth \u2014 and include best practices for how to use NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, an industry-leading embedding, retrieval and re-ranking model that allows for fast responses based on up-to-date healthcare data.\nCustomizable digital humans \u2014 like James, an interactive demo developed by NVIDIA \u2014 can handle tasks such as scheduling appointments, filling out intake forms and answering questions about upcoming health services. This can make healthcare services more efficient while also improving patient access.\nIn addition to NIM microservices, the James interactive demo also uses NVIDIA ACE to provide natural, low-latency responses.\nNVIDIA ACE is a suite of AI, graphics and simulation technologies for bringing digital humans to life. It can integrate every aspect of a digital human into healthcare applications \u2014 from speech and translation abilities capable of understanding diverse accents and languages, to realistic animations of facial and body movements.\nPersonalized Experiences for Hospital Patients\n\nPatients can get overwhelmed with the amount of preoperative information. Typically, they have only one pre-admission appointment, often many weeks before the surgery, which can leave them with lingering questions and escalating concerns. The stress of a serious diagnosis may also prevent them from asking all the necessary questions during these brief interactions, leaving them without comprehensive knowledge about the appointment\u2019s purpose, duration, location and necessary documents \u2014 and potentially leading to delays or even rescheduling of their surgeries.\nTo enhance patient preparation and reduce pre-procedure anxiety, The Ottawa Hospital is using AI agents, powered by NVIDIA and Deloitte\u2019s technologies, to provide more consistent, accurate and continuous access to information.\nWith the Frontline AI teammate, patients can experience benefits including:\n\n24/7 access to the digital teammate using a smartphone, tablet or home computer.\nReliable, preapproved answers to detailed questions, including information around anesthesia or the procedure itself.\nPostsurgery consultation to resolve any questions about the recovery process, potentially improving treatment adherence and health outcomes.\n\nIn user acceptance testing conducted this summer, a majority of the testers noted that responses provided were clear, relevant and met the needs of the given interaction.\n\u201cThe Frontline AI Teammate offers a novel and innovative solution to help combat our health human resource crisis \u2014 it has the potential to reduce the administrative burden, giving back time to healthcare providers to provide the quality care our population deserves and expects from The Ottawa Hospital,\u201d said Mathieu LeBreton, digital experience lead at The Ottawa Hospital. \u201cThe opportunity to explore these technologies is well-timed, given the planning of the New Campus Development, a new hospital project in Ottawa. Proper identification of the problems we are trying to solve is imperative to ensure this is done responsibly and transparently.\u201d\nDeloitte is working with other hospitals and healthcare institutions to deploy digital agents. A patient-facing pilot with Ottawa Hospital is expected to go live by the end of the year.\nDevelopers can get started by accessing the digital human NVIDIA Blueprint.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NIM | Omniverse | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The joint platform will deliver physically based sensor simulation enabled by NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs.\nBy combining these simulation capabilities with the MITRE DPG reporting framework, developers will be able to perform exhaustive testing in a simulated world to safely validate AVs before real-world deployment.\nThe current regulatory environment for AVs is highly fragmented, posing significant challenges for widespread deployment. Today, companies navigate regulations at various levels \u2014 city, state and the federal government \u2014 without a clear path to large-scale deployment. MITRE and Mcity aim to address this ambiguity with comprehensive validation resources open to the entire industry.\nMcity currently operates a 32-acre mock city for automakers and researchers to test their technology. Mcity is also building a digital framework around its physical proving ground to provide developers with AV data and simulation tools.\nRaising Safety Standards\nOne of the largest gaps in the regulatory framework is the absence of universally accepted safety standards that the industry and regulators can rely on.\nThe lack of common standards leaves regulators with limited tools to verify AV performance and safety in a repeatable manner, while companies struggle to demonstrate the maturity of their AV technology. The ability to do so is crucial in the wake of public road incidents, where AV developers need to demonstrate the reliability of their software in a way that is acceptable to both industry and regulators.\nEfforts like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) have been instrumental in setting benchmarks for vehicle safety in traditional automotive development. However, NCAP is insufficient for AV evaluation, where measures of safety go beyond crash tests to the complexity of real-time decision-making in dynamic environments.\nAdditionally, traditional road testing presents inherent limitations, as it exposes vehicles to real-world conditions but lacks the scalability needed to prove safety across a wide variety of edge cases. It\u2019s particularly difficult to test rare and dangerous scenarios on public roads without significant risk.\nBy providing both physical and digital resources to validate AVs, MITRE and Mcity will be able to offer a safe, universally accessible solution that addresses the complexity of verifying autonomy.\nPhysically Based Sensor Simulation\nA core piece of this collaboration is sensor simulation, which models the physics and behavior of cameras, lidars, radars and ultrasonic sensors on a physical vehicle, as well as how these sensors interact with their surroundings.\nSensor simulation enables developers to train against and test rare and dangerous scenarios \u2014 such as extreme weather conditions, sudden pedestrian crossings or unpredictable driver behavior \u2014 safely in virtual settings.\nIn collaboration with regulators, AV companies can use sensor simulation to recreate a real-world event, analyze their system\u2019s response and evaluate how their vehicle performed \u2014 accelerating the validation process.\nMoreover, simulation tests are repeatable, meaning developers can track improvements or regressions in the AV stack over time. This means AV companies can provide quantitative evidence to regulators to show that their system is evolving and addressing safety concerns.\nBridging Industry and Regulators\nMITRE and its ecosystem are actively developing the Digital Proving Ground platform to facilitate industry-wide standards and regulations.\nThe platform will be an open and accessible national resource for accelerating safe AV development and deployment, providing a trusted simulation test environment.\nMcity will contribute simulation infrastructure, a digital twin and the ability to seamlessly connect virtual and physical worlds with NVIDIA Omniverse, an open platform enabling system developers to build physical AI and robotic system simulation applications. By integrating this virtual proving ground into DPG, the collaboration will also accelerate the development and use of advanced digital engineering and simulation for AV safety assurance.\nMcity\u2019s simulation tools will connect to Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs and render a Universal Scene Description (USD) model of Mcity\u2019s physical proving ground. DPG will be able to access this environment, simulate the behavior of vehicles and pedestrians in a realistic test environment and use the DPG reporting framework to explain how the AV performed.\nThis testing will then be replicated on the physical Mcity proving ground to create a comprehensive feedback loop.\nThe Road Ahead\nAs developers, automakers and regulators continue to collaborate, the industry is moving closer to a future where AVs can operate safely and at scale. The establishment of a repeatable testbed for validating safety \u2014 across real and simulated environments \u2014 will be critical to gaining public trust and regulatory approval, bringing the promise of AVs closer to reality.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | SoftwareTags: Omniverse | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Generative AI enables robots to perceive and understand the context of their surroundings, communicate naturally with humans and make adaptive decisions autonomously.\nGenerative AI Comes to ROS Community\nReMEmbR, built on ROS 2, uses generative AI to enhance robotic reasoning and action. It combines large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation to allow robots to build and query long-term semantic memories and improve their ability to navigate and interact with their environments.\nThe speech recognition capability is powered by the WhisperTRT ROS 2 node. This node uses NVIDIA TensorRT to optimize OpenAI\u2019s Whisper model to enable low-latency inference on NVIDIA Jetson, resulting in responsive human-robot interaction.\nThe ROS 2 robots with voice control project uses the NVIDIA Riva ASR-TTS service to make robots understand and respond to spoken commands. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory independently demonstrated ROSA, an AI-powered agent for ROS, operating on its Nebula-SPOT robot and the NVIDIA Nova Carter robot in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.\nAt ROSCon, Canonical is demonstrating NanoOWL, a zero-shot object detection model running on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano system-on-module. It allows robots to identify a broad range of objects in real time, without relying on predefined categories.\nDevelopers can get started today with ROS 2 Nodes for Generative AI, which brings NVIDIA Jetson-optimized LLMs and VLMs to enhance robot capabilities.\nEnhancing ROS Workflows With a \u2018Sim-First\u2019 Approach\n\nSimulation is critical to safely test and validate AI-enabled robots before deployment. NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a robotics simulation platform built on OpenUSD, provides ROS developers a virtual environment to test robots by easily connecting them to their ROS packages. A new Beginner\u2019s Guide to ROS 2 Workflows With Isaac Sim, which illustrates the end-to-end workflow for robot simulation and testing, is now available.\nFoxglove, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, demonstrated an integration that helps developers visualize and debug simulation data in real time using Foxglove\u2019s custom extension, built on Isaac Sim.\nNew Capabilities for Isaac ROS 3.2\nNVIDIA Isaac ROS, built on the open-source ROS 2 software framework, is a suite of accelerated computing packages and AI models for robotics development. The upcoming 3.2 release enhances robot perception, manipulation and environment mapping.\nKey improvements to NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator include new reference workflows that integrate FoundationPose and cuMotion to accelerate development of pick-and-place and object-following pipelines in robotics.\nAnother is to NVIDIA Isaac Perceptor, which features a new visual SLAM reference workflow, enhanced multi-camera detection and 3D reconstruction to improve an autonomous mobile robot\u2019s (AMR) environmental awareness and performance in dynamic settings like warehouses.\nPartners Adopting NVIDIA Isaac\u00a0\n\nRobotics companies are integrating NVIDIA Isaac accelerated libraries and AI models into their platforms.\n\nUniversal Robots, a Teradyne Robotics company, launched a new AI Accelerator toolkit to enable the development of AI-powered cobot applications.\nMiso Robotics is using Isaac ROS to speed up its AI-powered robotic french fry-making Flippy Fry Station and drive advances in efficiency and accuracy in food service automation.\n\n\nWheel.me is partnering with RGo Robotics and NVIDIA to create a production-ready AMR using Isaac Perceptor.\nMain Street Autonomy is using Isaac Perceptor to streamline sensor calibration.\nOrbbec announced its Perceptor Developer Kit, an out-of-the-box AMR solution for Isaac Perceptor.\nLIPS Corporation has introduced a multi-camera perception devkit for improved AMR navigation.\nCanonical highlighted a fully certified Ubuntu environment for ROS developers, offering long-term support out of the box.\n\nConnecting With Partners at ROSCon\nROS community members and partners, including Canonical, Ekumen, Foxglove, Intrinsic, Open Navigation, Siemens and Teradyne Robotics, will be in Denmark presenting workshops, talks, booth demos and sessions. Highlights include:\n\u201cNav2 User Meetup\u201d Birds of a Feather session with Steve Macenski from Open Navigation LLC\n\u201cROS in Large-Scale Factory Automation\u201d with Michael Gentner from BMW AG and Carsten Braunroth from Siemens AG\n\u201cIntegrating AI in Robot Manipulation Workflows\u201d Birds of a Feather session with Kalyan Vadrevu from NVIDIA\n\u201cAccelerating Robot Learning at Scale in Simulation\u201d Birds of a Feather session with Markus Wuensch from NVIDIA\n\u201cOn Use of Nav2 Docking\u201d with Open Navigation\u2019s Macenski\n\nAdditionally, Teradyne Robotics and NVIDIA are co-hosting a lunch and evening reception on Tuesday, Oct. 22, in Odense, Denmark.\nThe Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) organizes ROSCon. NVIDIA is a supporter of Open Robotics, the umbrella organization for OSRF and all its initiatives.\nFor the latest updates, visit the ROSCon page.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: NVIDIA Isaac Sim \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Leveraging NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark could help payment companies reduce data processing times and save on their data processing costs.\nTo efficiently manage large-scale datasets and deliver real-time AI performance with complex AI models, financial institutions are turning to NVIDIA\u2019s AI and accelerated computing platforms.\nThe use of gradient-boosted decision trees \u2014 a type of machine learning algorithm \u2014 tapping into libraries such as XGBoost, has long been the standard for fraud detection.\nThe new NVIDIA AI workflow for fraud detection enhances XGBoost using the NVIDIA RAPIDS suite of AI libraries with graph neural network (GNN) embeddings as additional features to help reduce false positives.\nThe GNN embeddings are fed into XGBoost to create and train a model that can then be orchestrated with the NVIDIA Morpheus Runtime Core library and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for real-time inferencing.\nThe NVIDIA Morpheus framework securely inspects and classifies all incoming data, tagging it with patterns and flagging potentially suspicious activity. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server simplifies inference of all types of AI model deployments in production, while optimizing throughput, latency and utilization.\nNVIDIA Morpheus, RAPIDS and Triton Inference Server are available through NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nLeading Financial Services Organizations Adopt AI\nDuring a time when many large North American financial institutions are reporting online or mobile fraud losses continue to increase, AI is helping to combat this trend.\nAmerican Express, which began using AI to fight fraud in 2010, leverages fraud detection algorithms to monitor all customer transactions globally in real time, generating fraud decisions in just milliseconds. Using a combination of advanced algorithms, one of which tapped into the NVIDIA AI platform, American Express enhanced model accuracy, advancing the company\u2019s ability to better fight fraud.\nEuropean digital bank bunq uses generative AI and large language models to help detect fraud and money laundering. Its AI-powered transaction-monitoring system achieved nearly 100x faster model training speeds with NVIDIA accelerated computing.\nBNY announced in March that it became the first major bank to deploy an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD with DGX H100 systems, which will help build solutions that support fraud detection and other use cases.\nAnd now, systems integrators, software vendors and cloud service providers can integrate the new NVIDIA AI workflow for fraud detection to boost their financial services applications and help keep customers\u2019 money, identities and digital accounts safe.\nExplore the fraud detection NVIDIA AI workflow and read this NVIDIA Technical Blog on supercharging fraud detection with GNNs.\nLearn more about AI for fraud detection by visiting the NVIDIA AI Pavilion featuring AWS at Money 20/20, running this week in Las Vegas.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Banking | Customer Stories | Cybersecurity | Data Science | Financial Services | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA AI Workflow | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
