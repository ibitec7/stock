DIPS\u2019s potential for gains from decreases in the share price of NVDA is limited, while its potential for losses resulting from increases in the share price of NVDA is up to 100%.\u00a0DIPS does not invest directly in NVDA and does not directly short NVDA. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of NVDA should consider an investment other than this Fund.\nDIPS Portfolio Construction\nDIPS\u2019s\u00a0synthetic covered put strategy\u00a0consists of the following four elements:\n\nSynthetic short exposure to NVDA, consisting of a long at-the-money put option and a short at-the-money call option, which allows DIPS to seek to participate on an inverse, unleveraged basis in changes, up or down, to the share price of NVDA;\nCovered put writing (where NVDA put options are sold against the synthetic short portion of the strategy), which allows DIPS to generate income;\nU.S. Treasuries, which are used for collateral for the options, and which also generate income; and\nOut-of-the money (\u201cOTM\u201d) call options, which are purchased to seek to cap DIPS\u2019s potential losses from its short exposure to NVDA if NVDA\u2019s share price appreciates significantly in value.\n\nThe loss capping works only if the NVDA share price rises to or above the strike price of the purchased OTM call options. If the NVDA share price increases but stays below the strike price of these options, DIPS will incur losses proportionate to this price increase, which may be up to 100% of your investment.\nWhy Invest in DIPS?\n\nDIPS seeks to generate current income, which is not dependent on the price depreciation of NVDA.\nDIPS seeks to benefit when the NVDA share price decreases, however DIPS\u2019s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the NVDA share price is limited.\nDIPS\u2019s short exposure to NVDA is not leveraged so does not result in daily resetting.\n\nDIPS\u00a0is the newest member of the growing YieldMax\u2122 ETF family and, like all YieldMax\u2122 ETFs, aims to deliver current income to investors. Please see table below for distribution and yield information for all outstanding YieldMax\u2122 ETFs. Note: DIPS, FIAT and CRSH are hereinafter referred to as the \u201cShort ETFs\u201d.\nPlease note that distributions may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF\u2019s NAV and trading price over time, and may have additional tax implications.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nETF\n\t\t\tTicker1\nETF Name\nReference\n\t\t\tAsset\nDistribution\n\t\t\tRate2,4\n30-Day\n\t\t\tSEC Yield3\n\n\nTSLY\nYieldMax\u2122 TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF\nTSLA\n73.08%\n3.89%\n\n\nOARK\nYieldMax\u2122 Innovation Option Income Strategy ETF\nARKK\n26.30%\n4.32%\n\n\nAPLY\nYieldMax\u2122 AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF\nAAPL\n21.15%\n3.93%\n\n\nNVDY\nYieldMax\u2122 NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF\nNVDA\n107.86%\n4.08%\n\n\nAMZY\nYieldMax\u2122 AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF\nAMZN\n43.88%\n4.18%\n\n\nFBY\nYieldMax\u2122 META Option Income Strategy ETF\nMETA\n46.89%\n4.18%\n\n\nGOOY\nYieldMax\u2122 GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF\nGOOGL\n32.21%\n4.02%\n\n\nNFLY\nYieldMax\u2122 NFLX Option Income Strategy ETF\nNFLX\n27.04%\n4.19%\n\n\nCONY\nYieldMax\u2122 COIN Option Income Strategy ETF\nCOIN\n91.45%\n4.89%\n\n\nMSFO\nYieldMax\u2122 MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF\nMSFT\n21.74%\n4.13%\n\n\nDISO\nYieldMax\u2122 DIS Option Income Strategy ETF\nDIS\n26.82%\n4.42%\n\n\nXOMO\nYieldMax\u2122 XOM Option Income Strategy ETF\nXOM\n13.53%\n4.23%\n\n\nJPMO\nYieldMax\u2122 JPM Option Income Strategy ETF\nJPM\n13.72%\n4.17%\n\n\nAMDY\nYieldMax\u2122 AMD Option Income Strategy ETF\nAMD\n57.64%\n4.19%\n\n\nPYPY\nYieldMax\u2122 PYPL Option Income Strategy ETF\nPYPL\n32.22%\n4.87%\n\n\nSQY\nYieldMax\u2122 SQ Option Income Strategy ETF\nSQ\n43.20%\n4.60%\n\n\nMRNY\nYieldMax\u2122 MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF\nMRNA\n37.81%\n5.32%\n\n\nAIYY\nYieldMax\u2122 AI Option Income Strategy ETF\nAI\n41.66%\n4.76%\n\n\nMSTY\nYieldMax\u2122 MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF\nMSTR\n92.88%\n0.00%\n\n\nYBIT\nYieldMax\u2122 Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF\nBitcoin ETP\n88.35%\n4.15%\n\n\nCRSH\nYieldMax\u2122 Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF\nTSLA\n70.41%\n4.29%\n\n\nGDXY\nYieldMax\u2122 Gold Miners Option Income Strategy ETF\nGDX\u00ae\n50.65%\n4.41%\n\n\nSNOY*\nYieldMax\u2122 SNOW Option Income Strategy ETF\nSNOW\n-\n-\n\n\nABNY*\nYieldMax\u2122 ABNB Option Income Strategy ETF\nABNB\n-\n-\n\n\nFIAT*\nYieldMax\u2122 Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF\nCOIN\n-\n-\n\n\nYMAX\nYieldMax\u2122 Universe Fund of Option Income ETFs\nMultiple\n40.82%\n62.89%\n\n\nYMAG\nYieldMax\u2122 Magnificent 7 Fund of Option Income ETFs\nMultiple\n37.79%\n46.89%\n\n\nULTY\nYieldMax\u2122 Ultra Option Income Strategy ETF\nMultiple\n92.75%\n\n0.00%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe performance data quoted above represents past performance.

Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero.\u00a0Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant.\nInvestors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s).\n\n\n\n\n*\u00a0\nThe inception date for SNOY is June 10, 2024. The inception date for ABNY is June 24, 2024. The inception date for FIAT is July 9, 2024.\n\n\n1\nAll YieldMax\u2122 ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX, YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.\u00a0YMAX\u00a0and\u00a0YMAG\u00a0have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. \u201cAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses\u201d are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax\u2122 ETFs.\u00a0ULTY\u00a0has a gross expense ratio of 1.24% but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025.\n\n\n2\nThe Distribution Rate shown is as of close on\u00a0July\u00a023, 2024.\u00a0The\u00a0Distribution Rate\u00a0is the annual\u00a0distribution\u00a0an investor would receive if the most recently declared\u00a0distribution,\u00a0which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The\u00a0Distribution Rate\u00a0is calculated by multiplying\u00a0such\u00a0distribution\u00a0by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the\u00a0ETF\u2019s most recent NAV.\u00a0The\u00a0Distribution Rate\u00a0represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return.\u00a0As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.\n\n\n3\nThe 30-Day SEC Yield\u00a0represents net investment income,\u00a0which excludes option income,\u00a0earned by such ETF over the 30-Day\u00a0period ended\u00a0June 30, 2024, expressed\u00a0as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF\u2019s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.\u00a0As of\u00a0such date,\u00a0the\u00a0ULTY\u00a0subsidized\u00a0and\u00a0unsubsidized 30-Day SEC\u00a0Yields were\u00a00.00% and\u00a00.00%,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0subsidized yield reflects fee waivers\u00a0in effect\u00a0while the\u00a0unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect.\n\n\n4\nEach ETF\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0(except\u00a0those of\u00a0the\u00a0Short ETFs)\u00a0will cap potential gains\u00a0if\u00a0its\u00a0reference asset\u2019s\u00a0shares increase in value,\u00a0yet subjects an investor\u00a0to all potential losses if\u00a0the reference asset\u2019s\u00a0shares\u00a0decrease in value. Such potential losses\u00a0may not be offset by income received by the\u00a0ETF.\u00a0Each\u00a0Short ETF\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0will cap potential gains\u00a0if\u00a0its\u00a0reference asset\u2019s\u00a0shares\u00a0decrease\u00a0in value,\u00a0yet subjects an investor\u00a0to all potential losses if\u00a0the reference asset\u2019s\u00a0shares\u00a0increase\u00a0in value.

This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest.\nThere is no guarantee that any Fund\u2019s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund.\nContact Gavin Filmore at\u00a0gfilmore@tidalfg.com\u00a0for more information.\nTidal Financial Group\u00a0is the adviser for all YieldMax\u2122 ETFs and\u00a0ZEGA Financial\u00a0is their sub-adviser.\nTHE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERNCE ASSET.\nRisk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above,\u00a0except\u00a0the Short ETFs)\nYMAX\u00a0and\u00a0YMAG\u00a0generally invest in other YieldMax\u2122 ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax\u2122 ETFs they may hold from time to time.\nInvesting involves risk. Principal loss is possible.\nCall Writing Strategy Risk.\u00a0The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund\u2019s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund\u2019s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods.\nCounterparty Risk.\u00a0The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (\u201ccleared derivatives\u201d). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund\u2019s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (\u201cclearing members\u201d) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.\nDerivatives Risk.\u00a0Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund\u2019s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund\u2019s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.\nOptions Contracts.\u00a0The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.\nDistribution Risk.\u00a0As part of the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next.\nHigh Portfolio Turnover Risk.\u00a0The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nLiquidity Risk.\u00a0Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.\nNon-Diversification Risk.\u00a0Because the Fund is \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.\nNew Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.\nPrice Participation Risk.\u00a0The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period.\nSingle Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX\u00ae, SNOW, ABNB), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.\nRisk Disclosures (applicable\u00a0only\u00a0to GDXY)\nRisk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX\u00ae\u2019s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities.\nRisk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies.\u00a0The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX\u00ae\u2019s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies.\nRisk Disclosures (applicable\u00a0only\u00a0to YBIT)\nYBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current \u201cspot\u201d or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT.\nBitcoin Investment Risk:\u00a0The Fund\u2019s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends.\nDigital Assets Risk:\u00a0Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.\nBitcoin\u00a0ETP Risk:\u00a0The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered.\nRisk Disclosures (applicable\u00a0only\u00a0to the Short ETFs)\nInvesting involves risk. Principal loss is possible.\nPrice Appreciation Risk.\u00a0As part of the Fund\u2019s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the share price of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund\u2019s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the share price of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the share price of the underlying reference asset increases.\nPut Writing Strategy Risk.\u00a0The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund\u2019s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the price decreases of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund\u2019s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods.\nPurchased OTM Call Options Risk.\u00a0The Fund\u2019s strategy is subject to potential losses if shares of the underlying reference asset increase in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund\u2019s potential losses from the Fund\u2019s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund\u2019s losses only to the extent that the share price of the underlying reference asset increases to a price that is at or above the strike price of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the share price of the underlying reference asset to a price that is below the strike price of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike price that is approximately 100% above the then-current share price of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the share price of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund\u2019s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund\u2019s investment strategy.\nCounterparty Risk.\u00a0The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (\"cleared derivatives\"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (\"clearing members\") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.\nDerivatives Risk.\u00a0Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund\u2019s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund\u2019s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.\nOptions Contracts.\u00a0The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.\nDistribution Risk.\u00a0As part of the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next.\nHigh Portfolio Turnover Risk.\u00a0The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nLiquidity Risk.\u00a0Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.\nNon-Diversification Risk.\u00a0Because the Fund is \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.\nNew Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.\nPrice Participation Risk.\u00a0The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period.\nSingle Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.\nHoldings\nAs of July 23, 2024, the YieldMax\u2122 Short NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF did not hold any shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).

Is It Overvalued?      TipRanks   July 20, 2024 5 min read        2   In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NVDA), the leading AI chipmaker in the world, has seen its market value surge 2,742% in the last five years. On the back of these stellar gains, Wall Street analysts are divided on the prospects for Nvidia stock today. While some analysts argue that Nvidia\u2019s valuation is expensive, others make the case that the company still has a long runway to grow, which justifies its premium valuation. I am neutral on the outlook for Nvidia stock, as I believe the current valuation reflects the economic reality facing the company.    Analyst Optimism on Innovation and Market Dominance Nvidia still has the backing of analysts who believe in its innovation and market competitiveness. For example, Morgan Stanley (MS) recently upgraded its rating on Nvidia and set a price target of $144, citing their confidence in the company\u2019s ability to stay at the top of the AI chip industry. Blackwell chips, which are faster and more versatile compared to existing AI chips, are expected to attract strong demand from big tech companies, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as these companies accelerate their AI investments.  Each Blackwell chip is expected to be priced between $35,000 and $50,000, contributing positively to Nvidia\u2019s profit margins, given that H100 and H200 chips \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s best-selling products today \u2013 are priced between $25,000 to $40,000. Edward Jones analysts also pointed out recently that Nvidia\u2019s massive share in the AI chip market and its comfortable lead in the GPU market highlight the company\u2019s competitive advantages. Nvidia has successfully transitioned from a gaming-oriented chip developer to one focused on data centers. This new focus has allowed the company to expand its horizons and cater to the growing demand for data center GPUs. The CUDA platform \u2013 an AI development standard across various domains that allows developers to optimize processor performance while easily creating robust AI applications \u2013 has also been a growth driver in recent times and is expected to contribute positively to Nvidia\u2019s growth in the future. According to many Wall Street analysts, Nvidia\u2019s ability to continue to attract and retain engineering talent is also a key differentiator, as it positions the company to be at the forefront of innovation. Concerns About Growth, Sustainability, and Valuation Though analysts are generally positive about Nvidia stock, some are questioning the sustainability of earnings growth as well as current valuation levels. For instance, New Street Research recently downgraded Nvidia due to its extended valuation. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu believes there will be limited upside from here unless Nvidia boosts the outlook beyond 2025 meaningfully, which is not likely to happen anytime soon.   Story Continues Nvidia is currently valued at a forward P/E of 47x, which does not scream overvaluation, but this may change if growth decelerates in the foreseeable future.DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria is bearish on Nvidia, as he believes the demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will decline in the next 18 months as tech giants such as Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) are likely to develop their own chips. Barclays (BCS) analyst Blayne Curtis also noted recently that Nvidia\u2019s long-term outlook is not as rosy as it seems, given that some of its biggest customers are already looking for a solution to reduce their dependency on Nvidia chips.Beyond Analyst RemarksNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, evident from its industry-leading gross margin and leading market share. According to Mizuho Securities, Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the market for AI chips, which gives the company pricing power. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins came to 78% compared to just 41% for Intel (INTC) and 51% for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).These competitive advantages will help Nvidia report strong earnings growth in the next few quarters, but some risks are looming on the horizon. Last November, at the DealBook Summit, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that he wakes up every morning in fear that the company will fail due to increasing competition.AMD, with its Radeon Instinct GPUs, is trying to capture a share of the growing data center market, and the company\u2019s acquisition of Xilinx in 2022 has helped it gain traction in the AI and machine learning field. Intel is also making inroads into the data center market with its Habana Gaudi AI processors, which are designed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs.The biggest threat to Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance comes from big tech giants who are focused on reducing their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s products.Google, wanting to be self-sufficient when it comes to sourcing advanced AI chips, has developed an in-house AI chip series called Tensor Processing Units. These chips are already used in Google\u2019s data centers. Amazon has also developed its own AI chips called Inferentia and Trainium, targeting AWS customers who use Nvidia GPUs for AI applications. In addition to these tech giants, Microsoft and Meta have also announced investments in their own AI chips.What Is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?Based on the ratings of 41 Wall Street analysts, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with 37 Buy ratings and four Holds. The average Nvidia stock price target is $140.85, which implies upside potential of 11.5% from the current market price.  The Takeaway: Nvidia Seems Reasonably ValuedNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, which justifies the premium valuation it trades at. However, competition in the AI chip market is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years, with rival chipmakers and big tech companies aggressively investing in AI chips to grab a share of this booming market. Because of this looming threat, Nvidia seems fairly valued today, with no margin of safety to attract new investors at the current stock price.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Call traders have been unfazed by the semiconductor stalwart's recent pullback from its recent peak, as NVDA's options pits have been in a frenzy over the last 10 days.\nTo no one's surprise, Nvidia stock took the top spot on on Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's list of names that attracted the most options volume during the last two weeks. Over that period, the equity saw 78,689,431 calls and 48,081,396 puts traded, nearly 100 million more total options than the second place stock, Tesla (TSLA). The most activity took place at with the weekly 6/28 125-strke call.\n\nOn the year, NVDA is closing in on a 160% gain. The company's position as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaking have helped solidify Nvidia as the most valuable publicly traded company, culminating in a June 20, record high of $140.76 -- adjusted following NVDA's 10-for-1 split. Longer term, the equity boasts a 201.2% year-over-year lead.\n\nConsidering the chip stock's outperformance, this penchant for bullish bets is nothing new. At the\u00a0International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the stock's 50-day call/put volume ratio of 1.55 ranks higher than all other readings from the past 12 months.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.16%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.06%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 4.6% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.47% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.96% in that time.  Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Nvidia in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.63 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 133.33%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $28.24 billion, showing a 109.04% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter. NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.69 per share and revenue of $117.75 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +106.92% and +93.29%, respectively. It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.  The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.48% higher within the past month. At present, Nvidia boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). In terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 45.95. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 32.31 of its industry. It is also worth noting that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.22. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Semiconductor - General industry stood at 2.65 at the close of the market yesterday. The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 216, finds itself in the bottom 15% echelons of all 250+ industries.   Story Continues The Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Keep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nvidia (NVDA) launched its new Blackwell system of AI-powering processors this spring. The group continues to hold a commanding share of the market for the chips and systems needed to build out the massive data systems that so-called hyperscalers \u2014 such as Meta Platforms (META) , Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 will use to further their new technology ambitions.  Related: Analysts reboot Nvidia stock forecasts after shares dip Blackwell products are more expensive than their H100 and H200 predecessors but provide more power and are more energy-efficient. Their introduction, however, had raised concern about a so-called air pocket in sales, as customers canceled orders of the legacy chips and waited for the new line of processors. Those worries were largely mitigated by a robust near-term outlook from Nvidia in late May, which called for current-quarter revenue to rise to around $28 billion, with a 2% margin for error. The outlook came even as Nvidia noted that Blackwell wouldn't start shipping until the back half of the year. For the three months ended in April, data center sales, which include the group's key AI offerings, surged more than fivefold to a record $22.6 billion while gross profit margin expanded to 78.9%   Nvidia Co-Founder and CEO Jensen Huang saw the company add more than $1 trillion in value over the second quarter. Nvidia  Adding to that optimism, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore boosted his Nvidia price target by $28 to $144 a share on Monday while affirming an overweight rating following checks from his team following visits to China and Taiwan suggest that \"sales of both products will remain strong.\" Morgan Stanley: No NVDA Blackwell 'air pocket' \"The catalyst path remains strong, as the very strong surge in H20 builds and demand removes any concern for us about a pre-Blackwell pause,\" Moore and his team wrote. \"Hopper builds continue to go up, as H100 starts to transition to H200 (bringing better memory bandwidth from HBM3e as well as higher memory content),\" they added. Nvidia, Moore and his team wrote, \"remains the most compelling narrative in the AI [semiconductor] space,\" adding that \"visibility and backlog will improve materially\" as the transition from the H100 and H200 to Blackwell progresses. Nvidia is also moving forward with Rubin, another advanced line of AI-powering chips, which CEO Jensen Huang unveiled during a speech at the National Taiwan University in Taipei.   Story Continues Named after the American astronomer Vera Rubin, who is credited with discovering so-called dark matter, the new Rubin systems will be rolled out in 2026, Huang said.More AI Stocks:Nvidia has $4 trillion value in sight as AI seen powering chip sales Adobe faces troubling FTC lawsuit for \u2018trapping' customers Apple plans major change to future iPhones \u201cOur company has a one-year rhythm,\" Huang said. \"Our basic philosophy is very simple: build the entire data-center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits.\u201dNvidia shares were last marked 0.41% higher in late day Monday trading to change hands at $124.05 each, extending the stock's 2024 gain to a staggering 157%.Related: Single Best Trade: Wall Street veteran picks Palantir stock  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.The CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d \u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d In this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186Cramer said in a latest program mentioned a new research paper by Hendrik Bessembinder from Arizona State University. Here is what the paper said: \u00a0\u201cThe highest annualized compound return for any stock with at least 20 years of return data was 33.38%, earned by NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholders,\u201d the paper said. Cramer said that he thought this was an \u201camazing number\u201d until his colleague David Faber reminded him that this is \u201cwhat-have-you-done-for-me-lately business, so it does not matter.\u201d \u201cThis kind of selloff, that\u2019s the prevailing attitude. That\u2019s why everyone wants out,\u201d Cramer said. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135. \u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said. NYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.Aswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 174% over the past year.Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter: \u201cIn the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn\u2019t immediately evident from\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (\u201cthe Index\u201d) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date. Our Portfolio has no exposure to NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies currently benefiting from demand for foundational AI Hardware. The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple, and Salesforce. For the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious \u201cAI winner\u201d due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating. Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Remember the dot-com bubble? While I\u2019m as excited as anyone about AI\u2019s transformative potential, I can\u2019t help but wonder if we\u2019re due for a reality check.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I still believe in these companies\u2019 long-term prospects. But it\u2019s hard not to feel a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The chip market has always been cyclical, and predicting its future means betting on the staying power of the AI revolution.\nWill the current AI frenzy fizzle out like the early internet did, leaving overeager investors holding the bag? Or will this prove to be a true paradigm shift with room for multiple winners? It\u2019s hard to tell unless we dig deeper. Let\u2019s take a look!\nNvidia (NVDA)\nThe AI boom has propelled Nvidia to stratospheric heights, with the stock recently hitting an all-time high of $135 (post-split). Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm is palpable. Analysts are falling over themselves to raise price targets, with some projecting NVDA stock could go as high as $200 per share.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results were jaw-dropping, with revenue up 262% year-over-year to $26 billion. The company is riding massive tailwinds in AI, data centers, and gaming. Its GPUs are the gold standard for training large language models. And with the company\u2019s new Blackwell architecture on the horizon, Nvidia seems poised to maintain its technological edge. Its Compute & Networking segment has been booming.\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\nEven then, I can\u2019t help feeling a bit queasy about the stock\u2019s nosebleed valuation. At over 49-times forward earnings, Nvidia is priced for perfection. The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, and we\u2019re likely in the late innings of this economic cycle.\nThat said, the AI revolution shows no signs of slowing down. Companies are racing to build out AI infrastructure, and Nvidia remains the premier picks-and-shovels play in this sector. To justify its lofty multiple, Nvidia will need to keep delivering massive earnings beats. Anything less than stellar results could trigger a sharp pullback in this name.\nRegardless, I\u2019ve been proven wrong whenever I\u2019ve doubted Nvidia. The company continues to deliver massive beats quarter after quarter. If this AI wave is truly as transformative as it seems, today\u2019s lofty valuation may end up looking cheap in hindsight. In the near-term, Nvidia looks risky at these levels. But zooming out over a five to 10 year time horizon, I still see tremendous potential. If the AI boom continues, $500+ per share doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Of course, that\u2019s a big if.\nMicron Technology (MU)\nMicron\u2019s stock price has surged over 65% year-to-date on the back of the strong demand for its memory chips from data center and AI customers. The company recently reported solid Q3 fiscal 2024 results, beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue jumped 81% year-over-year to $6.81 billion, while 30 cents of earnings per share handily beat estimates.\nMicron is benefiting from some powerful megatrends right now, especially the rapid growth of artificial intelligence applications that require enormous amounts of memory and storage. The company is a key supplier to AI leaders like Nvidia, with its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips integrated into Nvidia\u2019s latest AI accelerators. Micron expects record revenue in fiscal 2024 and 2025 driven by these AI tailwinds.\nAnalysts are largely bullish on the stock, with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently upgrading Micron to \u201cequal-weight\u201d and hiking its price target. The firm cited better-than-expected AI chip demand as a key reason for its more positive stance. Of the 27 analysts covering Micron, 25 have buy ratings.\nHowever, I have some reservations about Micron\u2019s longer-term prospects. The memory chip industry is highly cyclical, and Micron\u2019s growth is expected to slow dramatically after fiscal 2025, unless AI demand significantly exceeds expectations.\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\nThe stock also doesn\u2019t look particularly cheap at around 14-times forward earnings, given the boom-bust nature of its business.\nSo while I believe Micron will continue to ride high in the near-term on the AI wave, investors should be aware of the risks further out on the horizon. I believe the stock could trade less than $300 a decade from now. I\u2019d love to be proven wrong, though.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nAMD\u2019s strategy seems to be taking a page out of its playbook against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market \u2013 targeting budget-conscious companies and developers with its lower-cost AI offerings. The company\u2019s MI300 series GPUs are reportedly delivering strong performance for AI workloads at a better value than Nvidia\u2019s pricey H100 chips. This approach could be especially appealing to cash-strapped AI startups looking to keep costs in check.\nFinancially, AMD is already seeing a big AI boost, with data center revenue up 80% year-over-year in Q1 to $2.3 billion. Management now expects data center GPU sales to top $4 billion this year, up from a prior $3.5 billion forecast. Analysts are taking notice, with Piper Sandler naming AMD its top large-cap pick and New Street Research setting a bullish $345 price target for 2026.\nHowever, AMD still has a steep hill to climb to catch Nvidia, which controls around 70-95% of the AI chip market. And while AMD stock trades at a premium, its growth and margins pale in comparison to Nvidia\u2019s jaw-dropping numbers. Growth in the company\u2019s Data Center segment also hasn\u2019t been as eye-popping.\nClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\nSo, can AMD pull off in AI what it did against Intel in CPUs?

What to Watch.NVDAMETALater today, Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang will sit down for a fireside chat regarding artificial intelligence and related developments with journalist Lauren Goode, according to a Barron\u2019s report. Immediately following that meeting, Huang will discuss the trajectory of generative AI with Meta Platforms META CEO Mark Zuckerberg. It\u2019s a rare meeting of the greatest minds in technology. In addition, Huang has an opportunity to productively frame NVDA stock.One of the most significant factors underlying this discussion is the enormous weight that both Nvidia and Meta leverage. Despite some rough performances in the past month, NVDA stock still carries a market capitalization of $2.76 trillion. Similarly, META struggled during the past 30 days. However, it\u2019s also part of the trillion-dollar market cap club \u2013 $1.19 trillion at time of writing.Still, concerns do exist among recent stakeholders of NVDA stock. Last month, Nvidia began trading on a split-adjusted basis. While nothing fundamentally changes with a share split, it helps to improve accessibility for retail investors, especially those who have brokerages that don\u2019t support fractional share ownership. Therefore, the AI discussion may be an opportunity for Huang to convince investors to think long term. Below are other elements to watch.NVDA Stock May Benefit from Latest AI and Graphics Tech AdvancementsInvestors should tune in to see what Nvidia has in store regarding recent innovations in AI, along with the graphics processing tech that undergirds machine intelligence. As well, it\u2019s possible that Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg may reveal insights on how the social media firm and big data juggernaut plans to utilize Nvidia\u2019s solutions.Spotlight on Generative AI TrendsWith Bloomberg reporting that generative AI could become a $1.3 trillion ecosystem by 2032, the tech obviously commands significant interest. Moving forward, investors will want to see how NVDA stock can benefit from its practical applications. Additionally, market participants should listen for clues regarding the potential for new revenue streams.Addressing the Competitive LandscapeWhile Nvidia and Meta have the benefit of dominating their core business lines, shareholders will also seek reassurances that this lead position in the marketplace will be protected. For NVDA stock, it\u2019s important for Huang to discuss the competitive arena and how it plans to address rivals in the space. A discussion on how to avoid the commoditization of graphics processors may be helpful.Hype or No Hype?Recently, a Goldman Sachs report noted that tech firms, utilities and other enterprises will spend more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure in the years ahead. However, concerns also exist about the productivity gains justifying the expenditure. Anxieties that NVDA stock may be overhyped could be contributing to its latest underperformance. Therefore, the Nvidia head has the opportunity to assuage nerves.Regulation and EthicsWhile no one doubts the profound changes that machine intelligence has sparked, ethical concerns have also jumped to the forefront. This then raises the specter of broader regulations. As one of the gatekeepers of this groundbreaking innovation, Nvidia has an opportunity in the upcoming discussion to frame the AI narrative in a positive light. This framing can also potentially help NVDA stock.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.On the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) has received a rare downgrade from New Street Research, with the analyst citing concerns about the stock\u2019s overvaluation.\nWhat Happened: New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded Nvidia\u2019s stock from buy to neutral, citing that the stock is \"getting fully valued\" after a remarkable 161% surge this year to date. The stock had previously seen a gain of almost 240% in 2023.\nFerragu expressed doubt about any additional upside, stating that it would only materialize in a bull case, which is not yet certain. He also warned of a potential risk of derating if the current outlook remains unchanged.\nSubscribe to the\u00a0Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter\u00a0to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nDespite the AI frenzy, Ferragu notes that there is a normalization when it comes to demand for Nvidia's AI-oriented graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\t\t\n\n\n\"When you listen to clients of Nvidia, we see demand is completely in line with expectations,\" said Ferragu in an interview with CNBC.\nSee Also: Tech Bull Shares Top Stock Picks For Second Half Of 2024 After AI-Fueled Rally: Do You Own These Stocks?\nDespite the downgrade, Nvidia remains the second-best performer among S&P 500 components this year, trailing Super Micro Computer Inc., another AI investor favorite. The company\u2019s market capitalization has increased by almost $1.9 trillion, briefly making it the world\u2019s largest company.\nWhy It Matters: The recent surge in the U.S. stock market, largely driven by the promise of artificial intelligence, has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.\nThis has raised concerns about another overvaluation scenario, as the market is currently dominated by a small group of tech giants, with Nvidia among the top performers.\n\t\t\n\n\nDespite the downgrade, New Street Research is positive on both Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.

Investors are likely taking profits in megacap tech companies ahead of a big earnings week. Some of the big tech companies reporting earnings later in the week include Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.  Also, investors may be positioning ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 31, 2024, for an update on the pace of rate cuts expected in the near term. The consensus estimate is for the Committee to start cutting rates as early as September 2024. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free. What is the market telling us: Nvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago, when the company dropped 5.6% as major indices declined, with the Nasdaq down 3%, while the S&P 500 fell by 1.7% following weaker-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (YouTube Advertising revenue missed estimates) and Tesla (7% drop in auto revenue). Tech giants, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple, have shed some of their year-to-date gains as a new market narrative\u2014in favor of small-caps stocks\u2014gains some momentum following the growing conviction that the Fed will start to cut rates in the second half of the year. The sentiment also benefitted from improved inflation prints last month, as the headline numbers edged closer to the Fed's 2% target. Overall, the shift suggests investors are finding more reasons to hold positions in risk assets, especially small caps that tend to be more volatile.  Nvidia is up 120% since the beginning of the year, but at $106.10 per share it is still trading 21.7% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024.

Jim Cramer in a fresh episode of \u201cMad Money\u201d on CNBC said that while investing isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s made even more difficult by \u201cauthentic Wall Street gibberish\u201d and \u201carcane technology.\u201d Cramer said that there\u2019s an \u201centire industry\u201d in Wall Street wanting people to think that investing is hard and \u201cordinary people\u201d cannot do it on their own. Cramer said that many people in the financial industry are just \u201cafter your fees\u201d and they aren\u2019t interested in making money from original investing. Cramer said that hedge fund managers and mutual funds make investing look inaccessible and impenetrable.  Cramer said that he\u2019s \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d and emphasized that investing isn\u2019t \u201crocket science\u201d or \u201cbrain surgery\u201d and you don\u2019t need to go to a business school to understand it. Cramer pitched himself as a \u201ccoach\u201d or a \u201ctranslator\u201d who can explain the meaning of complex financial terms to ordinary people. \u201cYou can comprehend all the mystical-sounding vocabulary we throw around here as long as you have a translator, a coach like me, who can explain what the darn words mean.\u201d  For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Top Stock in July?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 Jim Cramer in a latest program yet again repeated his thesis on NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), saying \u201cown it don\u2019t trade it.\u201d Cramer said when the second quarter of this year started, there was a \u201cwidely-held\u201d belief that the stock had \u201cmoved too much\u201d and it was time to do some selling. \u201cI heard that several times a day during our network.\u201d  Cramer said that despite its $3 trillion market cap, NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is \u201cunrivaled in its ability to usher in this new industrial revolution.\u201d Cramer said that he\u2019s been lauding for NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0for over a decade. Dan Ives is one of the biggest NVDA bulls on the Street. Recently, responding to Newstreet Research\u2019s downgrade of NVDA, Ives on Twitter wrote:   Story Continues \u201cWe cannot disagree more with this negative Nvidia call as discussed on\u00a0@LastCallCNBC\u00a0last night as the AI Revolution is just starting in our view being led by Nvidia and the Godfather of AI Jensen in this 9 pm party.\u201d There is no shortage of Wall Street analysts calling NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) a top dog in the AI race. Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight.NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.L1 Capital International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cSimply not owning\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was a key contributor to the relative underperformance of the Fund against its Benchmark.

In recent weeks, tech giants, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple, have shed some of their year-to-date gains as a new market narrative\u2014in favor of small-caps stocks\u2014gains some momentum following the growing conviction that the Fed will start to cut rates in the second half of the year. Notably, the Russell 2000 index has gained 9% since the beginning of the month. The sentiment also benefitted from improved inflation prints last month, as the headline numbers edged closer to the Fed's 2% target. Overall, the shift suggests investors are finding more reasons to hold positions in risk assets, especially small caps that tend to be more volatile. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free. What is the market telling us: Nvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago, when the company dropped 6.1% after Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is planning to implement tighter trade restrictions if semiconductor companies continue granting China access to technologies made in the United States. The report follows ongoing trade tensions between both countries, which might raise uncertainty about market dynamics in the semiconductor segment heading into the new earnings season. Nvidia is up 141% since the beginning of the year, but at $115.93 per share it is still trading 14.5% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $25,955. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What's The Opportunity In NVIDIA? According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 74.56x is currently well-above the industry average of 31.27x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. What does the future of NVIDIA look like?   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth July 13th 2024   Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.  Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.   Story Continues In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.  No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 8.5% in value last week. Still, the 142% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Ownership Breakdown July 29th 2024   What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NVIDIA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth July 29th 2024   Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 4.4% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.  Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.   Story Continues Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can see that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$109b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple are down today. We observe that the Russell 2000 Index is up 3%, suggesting that investors could be rotating into smaller stocks. The rotation could have been sparked by today's inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of June 2024 came in better than expected at 3% year on year (the lowest level in more than three years).  The recent inflation prints supported the argument that the Fed will start cutting rates this year as the headline figures moved closer to the 2% target. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free. What is the market telling us: Nvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 16 days ago, when the company gained 6.4% as the stock rebounded after shedding more than $400b in market cap since the previous week. We'd note that there were no specific fundamental reasons driving the move, just as there were no major ones driving the decline in the stock in the previous week or so. The last major fundamental datapoint we had on the company was May 22, 2024, when Nvidia reported Q1'2024 earnings that were quite strong and above expectations.\u00a0 Nvidia is up 166% since the beginning of the year, and at $128.19 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $30,838. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

Attiya Zainib   July 24, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Over the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.  Amid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends. There is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience. In this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 It\u2019s almost impossible to find a mainstream AI ETF without NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its top holdings. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX)\u2019s second-biggest holding is Nvidia. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.   Story Continues \u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said. NYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.Aswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 206% over the past year.Recently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cIn the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn\u2019t immediately evident from\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (\u201cthe Index\u201d) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date. Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The report follows ongoing trade tensions between both countries, which might raise uncertainty about market dynamics in the semiconductor segment heading into the new earnings season. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free. What is the market telling us: Nvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago, when the stock dropped 5.8% as investors seemed to be rotating out of large-cap tech stocks that have been winners year-to-date.\u00a0 We observed that the Russell 2000 Index rose 3%, suggesting that investors could be rotating into smaller stocks. The rotation could have been sparked by the inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of June 2024 came in better than expected at 3% year on year (the lowest level in more than three years).  The recent inflation prints supported the argument that the Fed will start cutting rates this year as the headline figures moved closer to the 2% target. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. Nvidia is up 143% since the beginning of the year, but at $116.94 per share it is still trading 13.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $27,561. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Aswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d \u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d  Damodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d But in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d  However, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall. In this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Best AI Value Stock That is \u2018Money Machine\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran?   NVIDIA Corp Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 Aswath Damodoran has been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand. Aswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.   Story Continues Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.NVIDIA\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares have gained about 206% over the past one year.Recently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The company has experienced strong performance recently due to booming demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. A major driver of Nvidia\u2019s recent success has been the growing adoption of its GPU accelerators for AI training and inference across various end markets. The company\u2019s GPUs have become an industry standard for training large language models (LLMs), and its networking solutions, such as NVLink and InfiniBand, are critical to maximizing the performance of AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell GPU platform is expected to further extend its lead in the AI accelerator market, with significant performance and total cost of ownership benefits over its predecessors. As the AI market continues to expand with growing adoption across enterprises and sovereign nations, we expect Nvidia to maintain its dominance and experience sustained growth in its data center business. Beyond data centers, Nvidia has also benefited from strong demand in its gaming business, which has recovered after a period of inventory digestion in 2022. The company\u2019s gaming GPUs have been well-received, and its focus on the high-end market has supported growth in average selling prices. Looking ahead, we expect the gaming market to remain healthy with ongoing growth potential. Nvidia also sees opportunities to diversify its business and foray into new markets, such as automotive and robotics. We continued to hold our position in Nvidia.\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July.

Indeed, investors are clearly anxious ahead of tech earnings from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) as well as the all-important rate-cut decision tomorrow.\nWhat do you need to know about NVDA stock lately?\nWell, after carrying the stock market over the first six months of the year, Nvidia is in the midst of a correction. NVDA is down more than 15% over the past month as investors capture profits after riding the stock\u2019s more than 100% gains year-to-date (YTD). NVDA is currently trading at its lowest level since late May.\nAside from the company\u2019s August earnings report, this week may prove the strongest indicator of what\u2019s to come for the chip stock.\nInterest rates remain one of the biggest headwinds for highly leveraged, growth-centric tech stocks of which Nvidia is the kingpin. While most traders have already priced in no change to rates this month, they\u2019ll be watching closely for any hint at what\u2019s to come in September. Many analysts believe the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates at the September policy meeting. Depending on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s tone this week, these hopes may either be confirmed or crushed.\nNVDA Stock Slides Ahead of Crucial Earnings\nNvidia fans are also closely watching Microsoft\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report due later this afternoon. There has been recent buzz that some tech companies have been pursuing chips from non-Nvidia sources. This includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has apparently been training its new artificial intelligence (AI) models on Google-designed semiconductors, according to a new research paper.\nAs such, investors will be closely watching the Windows company to see its progress in the AI space \u2014 and whether Nvidia will play a role in the venture.\nAMD also reports earnings later this evening. As a fellow chipmaker, the company\u2019s financial results will likely reflect onto the state of the industry as a whole which, of course, includes Nvidia.\nNVDA stock is down more than 5.5% heading to the bell today as investors recalibrate their holdings of the mega-cap company.\nOn the date of publication, Shrey Dua held LONG positions in NVDA.

Laiba Immad   July 20, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          ^GSPC            We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks. The stock market has a long history of generating wealth for investors. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, studying successful companies can provide valuable insights. By understanding the factors that drive these companies' growth, we can potentially make better investment decisions in the future. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and conducting thorough research is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors frequently overlook revenue in favor of profitability when evaluating stocks. Profit is what's left over after all costs are paid. Revenue is the total amount of goods and services sold. Because it is essential to determine if a business is a growth stock or a value one, profitability is important. To learn more about growth stocks, see 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. You can also discover some undervalued value stocks by reading 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now. The U.S. stock market has seen several major events since 2000, including the dot-com boom and fall, the 2008 financial crisis, a tech boom with trillion-dollar values, and the 2020 pandemic crisis. The S&P's broader market index produced double-digit yearly returns thirteen times between 2003 and 2023. This strong performance can be largely attributed to the phenomenal returns generated by technology stocks, which significantly boosted the overall return of the large-cap market. According to a recent estimate, the aggregate market value of the top seven S&P 500 corporations is almost double that of the Japanese market. The head of topical research and global economics, Jim Reid, cautions that this is the most concentrated the US market has ever been.  As interest in growth stocks increases due to the hype surrounding AI and the prospect of rate cuts, these companies' fortunes are expected to soar. To satisfy market demand, businesses are making significant investments in AI. AI's impact on altering work patterns was highlighted by Satya Nadella du. According to them,: \u201cA growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\"  Our Methodology\u00a0 To identify the most profitable stocks, we looked at the 20-year annualized returns of publicly traded companies in the US market from 2004 to 2024 and selected and ranked those with the highest 20-year annualized returns.   Story Continues   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)20-Year Annualized Return: 39.81%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops the list for being one of the most profitable stocks over the past 20 years, delivering exceptional returns to investors. Bullish analysts are highly optimistic about NVIDIA's future prospects. NVIDIA has recently achieved significant milestones across various sectors, particularly in AI and cloud computing. GeForce NOW, its cloud gaming platform, has reached over 30 million users and added popular games like \"Resident Evil Village.\" In AI, NVIDIA AI Enterprise has gained traction, helping businesses implement AI solutions. In the automotive sector, NVIDIA's system-on-a-chip is deployed in NIO's self-driving cars.The NVIDIA Partner Network has expanded, recognizing 14 partners for AI achievements across industries. Additionally, NVIDIA leads in generative AI development, and five leaders were honored by the Silicon Valley YWCA for their contributions, underscoring the company's leadership and diversity commitment.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recorded revenue of $26.0 billion in Q1 2025, marking an impressive 262% surge year-over-year. The non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12, up 461% year-over-year. The stellar performance was largely driven by the Data Center segment, which reached a record $22.6 billion in revenue, up 23% quarter-over-quarter and 427% year-over-year. This growth was fueled by strong demand for NVIDIA's Hopper-based GPUs, particularly for generative AI training and inference across cloud providers, consumer internet firms, enterprises, and other sectors. NVIDIA's upcoming Blackwell platform, designed for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI, is anticipated to further accelerate data center revenue starting in Q4. Additionally, Networking revenue surged over triple digits year-over-year to $3.2 billion which was driven by increasing AI infrastructure needs.In Q1 2024, there were 186 hedge fund holders in the company, up from 173 in the previous quarter. Citadel Investment Group held the largest position in the company with 207,354,000 shares worth $18,735,678,024.NVIDIA stock holds a \"Strong Buy\" rating from 40 analysts. Among the 39 analysts providing 12-month price forecasts, the average target is $125.64, ranging from $62 to $200. This suggests a potential decrease of -2.06% from the current stock price of $128.28.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years. You can visit 20 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years\u00a0to see the other profitable stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

This has contributed to its 750% gains since the beginning of 2023, when Nvidia witnessed a golden cross between its 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs). On June 20, NVDA stock topped out. Now, based on recent Nvidia technical analysis, the pullback appears poised to continue while the stock trades below the 50-day MA around $120 per share.\nNvidia\u2019s impressive revenue and earnings growth have undoubtedly contributed to its stock performance. \nYet, as the market anticipates substantial growth in AI-related technologies, what remains to be seen is whether Nvidia stock can continue its uptrend on a technical basis. \nNvidia\u2019s Long-Term Trend Is Intact Despite Correction\nAfter eight consecutive weeks of gains, NVDA stock reversed in June. Momentum lost steam after revisiting deep overbought levels as prices tilted higher, showing divergence. The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaled this correction by revealing a bearish divergence between prices and the two RSI peaks.\u00a0\nDespite continuing their recent decline, NVDA share prices remain above the 20-week MA, which suggests a bullish long-term outlook.\u00a0\n\nChart by TradingView\n\nDeclining below the 50-day MA near $120 signals potential pressure in the short term. Yet, Nvidia shares still trade substantially above the 200-day MA, which is around $80 per share. The long-term trend remains up until a cross of the 50-day MA below the 200-day MA occurs, known as the death cross.\nBased on Nvidia\u2019s RSI, momentum appears near 42% currently, signaling a potential move to 30%, which could end the short-term decline. Plus, the Stochastic oscillator supports a bullish turnaround now, as it has traded in the oversold zone for a few sessions. Finally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also shows a negative trend, with the signal line below zero and the histogram in the red.\n\nChart by TradingView\n\nAll of this suggests that in the long term, the strength in Nvidia will continue. \nBut Nvidia Technical Analysis May Suggest Short-Term Pain\nIn the short term, NVDA stock may present a selling opportunity based on the current Nvidia technical analysis. \nShould prices experience a short-term upside but fail to reclaim $126, this could be a good opportunity to sell NVDA above the 50-day MA. An exit scenario would see de-risking at $100 per share and subsequently at $90 per share.\nA tactful risk strategy would involve trailing stop-losses every $5 per share or 5% to protect potential gains while enabling the trade\u2019s downside. Placing an initial stop-loss above Nvidia\u2019s record peak of $142 per share may allow the trade time to work out. This would offer a total starting risk-reward profile of 2.25 times.\nHowever, investors need to exercise caution in the short term due to Nvidia\u2019s recent 3-day morning star pattern and proximity to the 50% RSI. The morning star is known to signal reversals, be they short or longer term, and the 50% RSI level indicates changing sentiment between bulls and bears.\nThe Bottom Line: NVDA Under Short-Term Risk\nNvidia\u2019s technical analysis presents a bullish picture in the long term. Moving averages suggest an overall uptrend but with signs of slowing momentum. Weekly charts show a natural correction, with RSI and MACD in positive territories unless the MACD signal line continues to point down in the upcoming weeks. Technical analysis of its daily charts indicates potential declines in RSI oversold conditions.\nBased on this, shares could be a cautious sell while trading below $126. Investors and traders alike may consider joining the trend down on potential short-term pullbacks. Key resistance levels start at Nvidia\u2019s 50-day MA and range up to $136 per share, depending on different risk-reward profiles.\nFor those considering a position, higher entry points could offer better risk-reward. However, as prices tilt higher, the probability of Nvidia turning around would also reduce.

However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cbull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.\u201d The analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any end to the bull market. We do think there\u2019s a good chance we see a rotation and small caps, the laggards, do much better in the second half of the year as the Fed starts to cut rates.\u201d  Some analysts believe the latest decline in tech stocks is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to pile into AI stocks for gains. In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the top AI stock upgrades and downgrades this month. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrade and Downgrade in July So Far?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135. \u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.  NYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.   Story Continues Aswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 206% over the past year.Recently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.Alger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming. PCs, data centers, virtual reality and high- performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported solid fiscal fourth quarter results above analyst expectations, driven by strong demand from data centers. Further, large cloud service providers contributed over 50% of revenue and inference tasks-using trained Al models on new data-accounted for over 40% of data center revenue. Management also raised their fiscal first quarter guidance noting that demand is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing Al data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

Some statements from Donald Trump have cast doubt over the future of companies within the semiconductor manufacturing space, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and NVDA stock.\nThe former president recently\u00a0offered some insight\u00a0into his plans for international trade, and they aren\u2019t good for many U.S. companies. In an interview with\u00a0Bloomberg News, he stated, when asked how he would handle U.S.-Taiwan relations: \u201cI think Taiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything.\u201d\nMeanwhile, trouble is also brewing for chip stocks on the other side of the aisle. The Biden administration is reportedly considering imposing even stricter crackdowns on nations that give Chinese companies access to advanced chipmaking. These developments are casting dark shadows over the entire sector today.\nWhat\u2019s Happening With NVDA Stock\nBoth TSM and NVDA stocks are down 6% today as these news stories continue to trend. This combination of bad news from both Trump and Biden will make it difficult for companies in the chipmaking space to overcome the market\u2019s negative momentum today. Things are even worse for ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), a Dutch semiconductor company that will be significantly impacted if the White House moves forward with these further crackdowns. ASML stock is down 12% as of this writing, even after beating analyst estimates for second-quarter earnings.\nRight now, things are a bit uncertain for the tech sector in general. Trump\u2019s recent pick for vice president, J.D. Vance, has made it clear that he supports anti-trust crackdowns on big tech. But given Vance\u2019s history as a venture capitalist himself, it\u2019s unclear exactly what would happen if he were to gain the power of the Oval Office.\nWhat is clear is that Nvidia is likely to bounce back from this difficult trading day. Right now, Trump is in full focus, but the former president has a history of making bold statements and then failing to deliver on what he has promised. However, NVDA stock has a history of rallying through difficult economic times due partly to its strong financials. InvestorPlace contributor Vandita Jadeja recently provided detailed context on the company\u2019s strengths, stating:\n\n\u201cFor the\u00a0first quarter,\u00a0it saw a 262% year-over-year jump in revenue to $26 billion and a 427% YOY jump in the data center revenue to hit $22.6 billion. Once known for setting a gold standard in Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), Nvidia has become\u00a0the hottest company today.\u00a0It announced a stock split in the first-quarter results\u00a0which\u00a0has made\u00a0the stock accessible to all.\u00a0For the second quarter, it\u00a0is aiming\u00a0for a revenue of $28 billion.\u201d\n\nWhen the winds shift again, which they likely will soon, powerful tech stocks will be back to trending upward.

Please see disclaimer.\nIs Nvidia Stock a High-Risk Play Ahead of the U.S. Election?Ebube Jones - Barchart - Mon Jul 22, 2024As we approach the 2024 U.S. election, Nvidia (NVDA) stock has been on an increasingly volatile ride, leaving investors to wonder each day whether they're in for an exciting adventure or a nerve-wracking drop. Last week, Nvidia was among the high-profile semiconductor stocks to turn lower, with the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader responding to headlines from both President Biden and GOP nominee Donald Trump that ramped up the hawkish talk around advanced semiconductor tech and China trade. That followed closely on the heels of a rocky end to June for NVDA, with many investors taking profits after the stock's 10-for-1 split.While Vice President Harris seems the likeliest nominee following Biden's weekend withdrawal from the presidential race, the DNC convention is about a month away. That said, the VP isn't necessarily expected to deviate from the current administration's stance on semiconductors, including advanced tech trade with China and semiconductor manufacturing at domestic companies, like Intel(INTC).Despite the recent volatility, Nvidia's financial performance has been stellar. The company reported record revenue, with its data center segment showing an incredible 427% surge. This growth is driven by the relentless demand for AI technologies, putting Nvidia at the forefront of the AI revolution. And reports today suggest that the AI chip giant is working to design a compliant AI chip for the Chinese market, with shipments expected as soon as Q2 of 2025.So, is Nvidia stock a high-risk play ahead of the U.S. election, or do the recent dips present a golden buying opportunity for savvy investors? Let's examine the numbers, growth engines, and analysts' latest insights.Nvidia\u2019s Financial PerformanceNvidia (NVDA), the tech giant behind top-tier GPUs and AI technologies, is known for its dominance in gaming and data centers. Nvidia's business model revolves around selling specialized chips that power everything from gaming consoles to autonomous vehicles.Nvidia's stock performance has been nothing short of spectacular. The stock is up 178% over the last 52 weeks, and NVDA has surged 149% in 2024 alone. However, the shares have retreated about 16% from their June 1 all-time highs, presenting a potential buying opportunity.www.barchart.comFor Q1 of fiscal year 2025, Nvidia posted record-breaking revenue of $26.0 billion, up 262% year-over-year, primarily driven by their data center segment, which recorded a staggering 427% increase. GAAP earnings per diluted share hit $0.59, up 21% from the previous quarter and 629% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.61, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 461% from a year ago. This growth was fueled by the high demand for AI chips, which have become essential for tech giants like Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META).Of course, with a market cap of $2.9 trillion, Nvidia is something of a tech giant itself. And Nvidia's valuation metrics reflect both its stellar performance and the optimistic consensus expectations for the company. With a forward P/E ratio of 43.10, NVDA is valued at an (arguably deserved) premium to the tech sector median. That said, the P/E to growth (PEG) ratio of 1.29 looks quite reasonable, and suggests NVDA might still be reasonably valued, given its expected growth trajectory.\u00a0Analysts are split on Nvidia's valuation. Some argue the stock is overvalued due to its high P/E ratio and the challenge of maintaining such rapid growth over time. However, Nvidia's ongoing innovation and strategic investments in AI and data center technologies, bolstered by its asset-light business model, suggest the company is well-positioned for long-term upside.Nvidia also offers a modest dividend yield of 0.02%, and the company may have room to reward shareholders with buybacks or special dividends if its financial performance continues to outpace expectations.\u00a0Beyond the Chips: Nvidia's Growth Engines and HeadwindsNvidia has made big moves in AI and cloud computing, with some analysts arguing that it's undervalued for its software prowess. One standout development is its partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to launch the NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE portfolio. This collaboration aims to speed up the adoption of generative AI in businesses by combining Nvidia\u2019s AI computing power with HPE\u2019s cloud infrastructure. The highlight, HPE Private Cloud AI, offers a fast, energy-efficient, and flexible solution for developing AI applications, potentially boosting Nvidia's market reach and revenue.In June, Nvidia also introduced the Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices designed to simulate sensors accurately. This AI-powered innovation is crucial for developing autonomous machines, enabling safer and more cost-effective testing environments. This kind of AI tech positions Nvidia at the forefront of the growing autonomous technology sector.Furthermore, Nvidia's AI Enterprise-IGX platform, combined with Holoscan, aims to streamline AI deployment in medical, industrial, and scientific fields. This enterprise-grade solution enhances real-time AI computing at the edge, offering robust performance and security, which could attract a broad range of industrial clients.While these advancements highlight Nvidia's growth engines, the company does face challenges - most notably from geopolitical tensions and potential U.S. tech export restrictions to China, given its key relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Stricter policies could potentially limit Nvidia's market expansion and impact its stock performance, making it a somewhat higher-risk play ahead of the U.S. election, as trade with China will no doubt remain a key talking point.\u00a0However, the company's efforts to adapt to tighter trade conditions, coupled with longer-term growth initiatives, should provide a longer-term floor - which means that Nvidia still looks like a strong buy on pullbacks.What Do Analysts Say About Nvidia Stock?Wall Street analysts are bullish on NVDA, with Loop Capital raising its price target to $175 today, and Piper Sandler hiking its own target to $140. The average analyst price target for NVDA was $139.41 heading into Monday's trading, about 13% higher than current levels.Out of 39 analysts covering Nvidia, 33 rate it as a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d two as a \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and four suggest a \u201chold.\u201dwww.barchart.comFinally, it's worth pointing out that record levels of insider selling on NVDA stock - including by CEO Jensen Huang - isn't necessarily cause for concern, or some indication that he's lost confidence in his own company. Executives at growth-fueled tech companies are often compensated in stock, and their stock sales are generally scheduled ahead of time, and are often set to be triggered based on price and/or volume - specifically to avoid the implication of nefarious intentions on the part of company insiders.Rolling the Dice or Calculated Risk?When you look at the big picture, Nvidia's stock feels more like a smart bet than a risky dice roll. Sure, there may be some bumps in the road caused by broader market swings and geopolitical issues, but the company's strong growth, remarkable AI innovations, and generally reasonable valuation make it a solid buy when the price dips. With a bright future ahead and plenty of room to grow, Nvidia seems ready to handle whatever the U.S. election throws its way and keep climbing.On the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The company decided to launch a 10-for-1 split to bring its shares down to a level that would make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy. These operations involve the issuance of more shares to current holders to make that happen.  Prior to the operation, Nvidia surged to more than $1,000 a share \u2014 a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors and a difficult buy for those aiming to take a small position. Now, with Nvidia shares trading around $120, these problems have disappeared. So, though stock splits aren't catalysts for share performance, they can represent a positive move for a company. But Nvidia's big moves this year aren't over. In fact, Nvidia has something major planned for the second half. My prediction is this move from the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant will be much bigger than the stock split \u2014 and offer you a great reason to buy the stock. Let's check out what's ahead.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia's lower per-share price Of course, gaining access to Nvidia for a lower per-share price, thanks to the stock split, is exciting, but it's important to remember that splits don't change a company's valuation: Nvidia isn't any cheaper today than it was prior to the split. In fact, a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental. This upcoming move, however, will. First, a bit of background. Nvidia already is the world's AI chip leader, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) holding 80% share of the market. This is because Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, powering critical AI tasks like training and inferencing \u2014 the processes that help large language models do their job of solving complex tasks.  Nvidia also sells a variety of related AI products and services that make it the go-to destination for those launching an AI project. All of this has helped the company increase revenue and net income in the triple digits quarter after quarter. Now, moving along to my prediction: Nvidia's upcoming launch of its Blackwell architecture and best chip yet is much bigger news for the company and could represent a significant catalyst for the stock in the near term as well as over time as this platform adds to revenue. Blackwell could be a game changer because it represents a whole new way of powering AI, achieving incredible performance at a cost and energy consumption that's as much as 25 times lower than Hopper, the previous system. This is a critical feature because this savings reduces an AI customer's overall costs, potentially making the Nvidia system the most economical choice over time.   Story Continues Blackwell's game-changing innovationsBlackwell includes six transformative innovations, including the world's most powerful chip; the next generation Nvidia NVLink to offer high-speed communication among as many as 576 GPUs; a system of preventative maintenance to maximize system function; and more. And the Blackwell GPU offers as much as four-times-faster training and 30-times-faster inference than Nvidia's current leading chip, the H100.And now the really good news is this: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply, and he expects this to continue into next year. The launch strategy, making Blackwell available in more than 100 original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer systems, could ensure a strong start. All of this is reason to be optimistic about the platform's debut and its contribution to revenue in the coming quarters.The Blackwell launch also may reassure investors who worry about rivals taking market share from the chip giant because it should set Nvidia significantly ahead.So, even though Nvidia made headlines for its stock split in recent times, the upcoming launch of Blackwell is much bigger news \u2014 and news that could help this already top-performing AI stock continue its gains in the second half and beyond. And that makes Nvidia a great buy now, even after its 150% increase in the first half of the year.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Other shows include The Sphere Experience featuring Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Postcard From Earth, a specially created multisensory cinematic experience that showcases all of the venue\u2019s immersive technologies, including high-resolution visuals, advanced concert-grade sound, haptic seats and atmospheric effects such as wind and scents.\n\u201cPostcard From Earth\u201d is a multisensory immersive experience.

The content is then streamed in real time to rack-mounted workstations equipped with NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, achieving unprecedented performance capable of delivering three layers of 16K resolution at 60 frames per second.\nThe NVIDIA Rivermax software helps provide media streaming acceleration, enabling direct data transfers to and from the GPU. Combined, the software and hardware acceleration eliminates jitter and optimizes latency.\nNVIDIA BlueField DPUs also facilitate precision timing through the DOCA Firefly Service, which is used to synchronize clocks in a network with sub-microsecond accuracy.\n\u201cThe integration of NVIDIA RTX GPUs, BlueField DPUs and Rivermax software creates a powerful trifecta of advantages for modern accelerated computing, supporting the unique high-resolution video streams and strict timing requirements needed at Sphere and setting a new standard for media processing capabilities,\u201d said Nir Nitzani, senior product director for networking software at NVIDIA. \u201cThis collaboration results in remarkable performance gains, culminating in the extraordinary experiences guests have at Sphere.\u201d\u00a0\nWell-Rounded: From Simulation to Sphere Stage\nTo create new immersive content exclusively for Sphere, Sphere Entertainment launched Sphere Studios, which is dedicated to developing the next generation of original immersive entertainment. The Burbank campus consists of numerous development facilities, including a quarter-sized version of Sphere screen in Las Vegas, dubbed Big Dome, which serves as a specialized screening, production facility and lab for content.\nThe Big Dome is 100 feet high and 28,000 square feet. Image courtesy of Sphere Entertainment.\nSphere Studios also developed the Big Sky camera system, which captures uncompressed, 18K images from a single camera, so that the studio can film content for Sphere without needing to stitch multiple camera feeds together. The studio\u2019s custom image processing software runs on Lenovo servers powered by NVIDIA A40 GPUs.\nThe A40 GPUs also fuel creative work, including 3D video, virtualization and ray tracing. To develop visuals for different kinds of shows, the team works with apps including Unreal Engine, Unity, Touch Designer and Notch.\nFor more, explore upcoming sessions in NVIDIA\u2019s room at SIGGRAPH and watch the panel discussion \u201cImmersion in Sphere: Redefining Live Entertainment Experiences\u201d on NVIDIA On-Demand.\nAll images courtesy of Sphere Entertainment.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: Art | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its share price has skyrocketed over 150% so far this year following a gain of nearly 240% in 2023. The company's sales jumped 262% year over year in the first quarter. \nEverything seems to be going Nvidia's way. So why did one analyst just downgrade Nvidia stock?\n\nThe main concern with Nvidia\nOn Friday, NewStreet Research analyst Pierre Ferragu did something rare these days: He downgraded Nvidia stock. Ferragu previously recommended the stock as a buy; he now maintains a neutral rating on the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker. \nFerragu's primary concern with Nvidia isn't surprising. He thinks the stock's valuation has reached a point where it simply doesn't have much room to run, writing last week, \"We see limited further upside based on what we hear from the value chain.\" Ferragu said that upside potential \"will only materialize in a bull case,\" and that he doesn't \"have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\"\nNewStreet Research isn't the only party concerned about Nvidia's valuation. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran, one of the most prominent stock valuation experts in the world, has an even more dire outlook. Damodaran believes Nvidia could be close to 50% overvalued after its remarkable run. \n\n\n\n\n\nNot all bad news\nDon't think Ferragu has become an Nvidia bear, though. His one-year price target for the stock is $135, slightly higher than the current share price. Ferragu's two-year price target for Nvidia is $143, reflecting an upside potential of roughly 9%.\nHe also remains optimistic about Nvidia's underlying business, stating, \"The quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact.\" Ferragu added, \"[W]e would be buyers again, but only on prolonged weakness.\"\nNewStreet Research's downgrade of Nvidia was quickly followed by good news from another analyst. On Monday, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised his 12-month price target to $150 from $120 and maintained a buy recommendation on the stock.\nArcuri's more optimistic outlook stems from his research on the demand for Nvidia's soon-to-be-released Blackwell platform. He wrote, \"Our recent supply chain checks confirm our prior suspicions that demand momentum for Blackwell rack-scale systems remains exceedingly robust.\" Arcuri now projects Nvidia will generate 2025 revenue of $204 billion, up 12% from his previous forecast. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhich analyst is right about Nvidia?\nFerragu's cautious price target for Nvidia matches up pretty well with the broader Wall Street consensus. The average analysts' 12-month price target for the stock is $129.53, according to LSEG. On the other hand, 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in July rated Nvidia as a buy or strong buy, versus 15 who had a neutral rating on the stock. This is more in line with Arcuri's position. \nThe differing views on Wall Street stem from uncertainty about how strong Nvidia's growth will be going forward. Tremendous growth expectations are already baked into the share price. Ferragu's downgrade reflects this. However, the demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chips fueled by generative AI could cause analysts to revise their growth projections -- something Arcuri seems to be banking on happening.\nWhich analyst is right about Nvidia? We'll have to wait and see. My hunch is that Nvidia could have more room to run than Ferragu predicts. But I agree with him 100% about the quality of the company's business and that the stock would be an excellent buy on a sustained pullback.\n\n\n\nKeith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

While stock splits are mostly a cosmetic effect, their psychological effect on investments is a far bigger deal.\nHowever, two companies that recently have undergone stock splits, Nvidia (NVDA -2.11%) and Broadcom (AVGO -2.65%), are two that didn't need more interest sparked in the stock. Regardless, both are some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street after their splits. But of the two, which is the better buy right now?\nBoth companies have vital AI technology\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split was completed on June 10, while Broadcom's 10-for-1 split was effective July 15. This slashed the price of each stock by one-tenth, so instead of trading for more than $1,000 per share, each stock is in the $100 range.\n\nStock splits usually only occur after extreme growth, and both companies have experienced that, thanks to the rise in artificial intelligence (AI).\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the power behind AI models, as they are used to train and create AI technology. While there are other GPU producers, Nvidia holds a massive market share in the data center market due to its supreme technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcom also makes products that go into data centers, including its Jericho3-AI networking switch. This product allows data centers to use up to 32,000 GPUs with near-zero delays. It also designs other semiconductors that are designed for specific applications.\nBoth companies are vital in AI, although they have different roles.\nNvidia's growth is outpacing Broadcom's\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended May 5), Broadcom's revenue grew 43% year over year to $12.5 billion. However, that headline number is misleading because its acquisition of VMware skews it. If you subtract that, its revenue growth falls to 12%. While that's still healthy growth, it pales in comparison to Nvidia.\nIn Q1 of fiscal year 2025 (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue increased by 262% year over year to $26 billion. Last year's revenue was $7.2 billion, so Nvidia added $18.8 billion in revenue over the past year -- one and a half times what Broadcom brought in this quarter. While this isn't a nail in the coffin to this comparison, it heavily skews it in Nvidia's favor. However, this rapid growth is expected to slow down in the next few quarters because Nvidia's comparison quarters will be much more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of growth can investors expect in the future? Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's sales to grow by 98% this fiscal year and 36% next year. Broadcom's revenue is expected to rise by 51% this year and 44% next year, so its growth is expected to be better than Nvidia's next year. This is a key point in Broadcom's investment thesis, as it could be a better stock to own for the long term versus Nvidia, as some of its tailwinds are starting to kick in.\n\nBroadcom's stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's\nLastly, let's look at valuation. This will tell investors how much of a premium they're paying to own each stock right now. Because each company is fully profitable but undergoing many changes, we'll look at the forward earnings (P/E) ratio to determine how expensive each stock is based on analyst projections.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nFrom this standpoint, Broadcom's stock is quite a bit cheaper than Nvidia's. This is a great argument for ownership, as it hasn't seen the extreme hype that Nvidia has (even though it has had a fair share of its own).\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, which stock split is the better buy? While Nvidia is all the rage right now, its time has come. I think Broadcom is a better investment due to its lower price and longer-term tailwinds. If you're sitting on some massive profits from Nvidia, it may be wise to move some of that money into Broadcom to align yourself for the next wave of AI investing.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

However, some hedge fund billionaires sold Nvidia stock during the first quarter, while purchasing shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and/or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), two supercharged AI stocks with year-to-date returns of 59% and 198%, respectively.  Louis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 19%. Meanwhile, Bacon started a small position in Super Micro Computer. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,000 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, Englander increased his positions in Palantir and Super Micro Computer by 4% and 235%, respectively. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2.9 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, Laffont increased his position in Palantir by 40%.  Trades made by Israel Englander are especially noteworthy because Millennium Management handily beat the S&P 500 over the last three years , and it ranks as the second-best performing hedge fund of all-time as measured by net gains since inception. Here's what investors should know about Palantir and Supermicro. 1. Palantir Technologies Palantir specializes in data analytics. Its software lets government and commercial clients integrate data, develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that lean on those data sets and models to improve decision-making. Palantir recently introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a product that brings support for large language models and generative AI to its existing software. Certain industry analysts have praised the company for its technological prowess. Forrester Research ranked Palantir Foundry as the best AI/ML platform in a report published in July 2022. And Dresner Advisory Services ranked Palantir as a leader in the AI/ML and data science market in a report published in August 2023.  However, other analysts are skeptical. Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital says conversations with industry observers and company employees have led to the conclusion that Palantir does not offer \"anything truly differentiated when it comes to generative AI.\" Palantir reported reasonably good financial results in the first quarter, beating estimates on the top line and meeting expectations on the bottom line. Its customer count increased 42% to 554, and the average existing customer spent 11% more. In turn, revenue increased 21% to $634 million, the third consecutive sequential acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 60% to $0.08 per diluted share.   Story Continues CFO Dave Glazer said the commercial segment benefited from \"unprecedented demand driven by momentum from AIP.\" However, the stock still slipped 7% following the first-quarter report because management guided for full-year revenue growth of 20%, implying a slight deceleration in the coming quarters. Analysts anticipated full-year revenue growth of 22%.Going forward, Wall Street expects Palantir to grow adjusted earnings per share at 22% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 97 times earnings look very expensive. Investors should be cautious with this stock. Personally, I plan to avoid Palantir until earnings growth accelerates or the valuation improves.2. Super Micro ComputerSuper Micro Computer designs high-performance computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its portfolio includes servers and storage systems, ranging from individual devices to full rack solutions. Its products can be optimized for use cases like artificial intelligence and 5G infrastructure, and they feature chips like Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and Intel central processing units (CPUs).Importantly, Supermicro is the market leader in AI servers due to manufacturing prowess and its building-block approach to product development. To elaborate, nearly half of its workforce are engineers, and it handles most research and development internally. \"Our engineering aptitude, coupled with our internal manufacturing capability, enables rapid prototyping and product roll-out.\"Additionally, Supermicro's modular product design reduces time to market, and affords clients flexibility in designing custom solutions. It can \"quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines.\" In other words, Supermicro can rapidly integrate the latest CPUs, GPUs, and memory into preassembled server chassis, such that it often beats competitors to market by two to six months.Indeed, Supermicro \"anticipates being first-to-market in deploying full rack clusters featuring Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.\" That is advantageous because businesses are eager to purchase AI hardware, so they are turning to the server maker that brings computing products to market at the fastest clip. As a result, Supermicro's AI server market share is expected to reach 23% by the end of 2024, up from 10% at the beginning of the year.Going forward, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 48% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 47 times earnings look very reasonable. Indeed, it gives a PEG ratio \u2014 the price-to-earnings ratio divided by the forecasted earnings growth \u2014 of roughly 1. For context, using the same methodology, Palantir currently has a PEG ratio of 4.4.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

Both Nvidia (NVDA -2.11%) and Amazon (AMZN -1.14%) are members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a catchy moniker used to collectively describe the world's largest tech businesses.\nWith shares of each stock outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes over the last year, investors may be wondering what the long-term picture might look like.\nLet's dig into the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) and assess why both Nvidia and Amazon are emerging as leaders in the space. More importantly, after taking a close look at the longer-term picture, I think investors will see why one of these Magnificent Seven members might have more upside.\n\nWhat the next five years could look like for Nvidia\nNvidia is undoubtedly having a moment right now. The company is essentially synonymous with the term \"AI,\" and investors can't seem to get enough of the stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth asking how Nvidia actually got to its prominent position in the AI realm, though. When the company was founded roughly three decades ago, Nvidia's primary mission was to enhance the graphics capabilities in video games.\nWhile gaming is still a big business for Nvidia, the technology powering its innovative graphics processing units (GPUs) has evolved significantly. Today, GPUs are implemented across a wide array of generative AI applications -- from training autonomous driving and large language models to developing humanoid robotics, and more.\nWhile the proliferation of AI has been a bellwether for Nvidia, the company is far from the only chipmaker out there.\nRight now, two of Nvidia's closest competitors in the semiconductor industry are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Although Nvidia is considered to be the market leader in AI-powered chips, demand for GPUs is so high that AMD and Intel have a unique opportunity to pounce on Nvidia's lead as the company faces supply constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of rising competition, perhaps the biggest threat to Nvidia's longer-term momentum is the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. While AI in general should continue to witness strong secular tailwinds, the chip space will likely ebb and flow.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat the next five years could look like for Amazon\nAmazon is one of the most diversified businesses I can think of. The company dominates e-commerce and cloud computing, and has ventured into other growth areas across media and entertainment, advertising, streaming, grocery delivery, smart home appliances, robotics, and gaming.\nThis level of diversification provides Amazon with a high degree of flexibility when it comes to competition. What's even more encouraging is that the company's expansion opportunities don't appear to be slowing down.\nOver the last year, Amazon has made a number of investments in generative AI that I think have a lot of potential to propel the business ahead of other big tech peers.\n\n\n\n\n\nNamely, the company invested $4 billion into a start-up called Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon's homegrown Trainium and Inferentia chips to hone its AI models. Not only should this be a major catalyst for Amazon's cloud business, but it also puts the company in a position to compete with Nvidia. So, in addition to direct competitors like AMD and Intel, Nvidia is also facing tangential competition from the likes of Amazon.\nMoreover, Amazon also announced that it is investing $11 billion in data centers in Indiana. This is yet another area where Amazon could be competing with Nvidia, which also has a large data center services business.\nThe bottom line\nOutside of its hardware, Nvidia also has an under-the-radar software business called compute unified device architecture (CUDA). While CUDA could be a good source of alternative growth if the chip business begins to decelerate, I don't think it'll be enough to move the needle.\nConsidering shares of Nvidia have soared almost 150% over the last year and the company has grown its market cap by nearly $2 trillion just in 2024, it's hard to imagine it sustaining this level of momentum.\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely, considering the deal with Anthropic is still new and the data center initiative is currently ongoing, I think Amazon is laying the groundwork to set it apart from the competition. To me, I think Amazon's best days are very much ahead, as its AI ambitions have yet to lead to material acceleration in revenue or profits.\nWhile both Nvidia and Amazon have promising futures, I think Amazon will be the better Magnificent Seven investment in the long run due to the company's diversification and the potential of its various investments.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Right above it in valuation is Apple (AAPL -0.88%), with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion, while Microsoft is currently in the top spot at just over $3.4 trillion.\nThough Microsoft is a tech stalwart and a safe stock, I think Apple and Nvidia both possess better growth prospects in the long run. So which of them is the most likely to reach a $4 trillion valuation first?\n\nNvidia sports a mammoth growth rate\nIt's hard to bet against Nvidia when you consider just how well its business has performed of late. The company is the leading provider of the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that other tech companies need to develop their next-gen software and models. And with AI infrastructure and development still in its early stages, Nvidia could be on the cusp of much more growth.\nThat's in stark contrast to Apple, which has been struggling lately to grow its top line at all.\n\nQuarterly revenue growth data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there is reason to expect that the gap between these growth rates will shrink. While Nvidia is a growth beast, it isn't likely to continue tripling its revenue on a year-over-year basis. As it starts lapping its latest huge numbers, it will become more difficult for it to keep its growth rate so high. And with so many companies loading up on AI chips, Nvidia may be punching above its weight right now. As more competing chips come to market in quantity and chip buyers potentially ease up on their AI-related spending, its growth rate could come down drastically.\nOn the flip side, Apple's growth rate should improve thanks to its recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will inject AI capabilities into its latest iPhones, Macs, and iPads. That will give users an incentive to get the latest Apple devices when they come out later this year, so it could be the catalyst for a strong upgrade cycle. As Apple dives deeper into AI and enhances its services, it has the potential to tap into more growth opportunities down the road.\n\nApple has the friendlier valuation\nWhat may be the biggest impediment for Nvidia's stock to rally much higher in the near future is its extremely high valuation of more than 70 times earnings.\n\nAAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading at a much more modest P/E ratio of around 34, Apple could have more room to rise, especially if its growth rate improves. Meanwhile, Nvidia's multiple means it will have a high bar to meet each and every time it reports earnings. That leaves the stock vulnerable to a sell-off should it have a quarter that falls short of expectations or if management offers a forecast that isn't sufficiently rosy.\nWhile things are going well for Nvidia today, that doesn't mean it will be able to maintain its current pace.\nMy prediction: Apple hits $4 trillion first\nBoth of these stocks make for good long-term investments, but if I were buying shares today, I would pick Apple over Nvidia.\nThere is a lot of excitement around Nvidia now, and that has me concerned that expectations for it may have climbed too high. Apple may not be as popular with growth investors today, but it shouldn't be counted out as it still has a lot more room for growth left.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Apple is the stock that I think will hit $4 trillion first, beating out both Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\n\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

But There's Something Else That Investors Need to Know.\n\n\n  \n      By Jake Lerch\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Jul 26, 2024 at 7:30AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey insiders like CEO Jensen Huang and Director Mark Stevens sold over $700 million worth of Nvidia stock in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsiders sell for various reasons -- many of which are unrelated to the company's prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Nvidia's sky-high valuation shouldn't be ignored, as it has reached historically-high levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.11%)\u00a0-$2.52\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.01\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:58 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaires are lining up to sell Nvidia stock, but that isn't the big story.\n\nNvidia (NVDA -2.11%), undeniably, has been the standout stock of the year. Its dominance in the stock market extends even further, with a staggering 800% surge in its stock price in less than two years.\nYet, recent sales by billionaires -- including company insiders -- have many investors on edge. Moreover, there is an additional factor, which is flashing warning signs for Nvidia. \nSo, let's dive in and see what's going on with Wall Street's hottest stock.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires are bailing on Nvidia\nFirst, let's get a handle on two things:\n\nWhich billionaires are selling Nvidia stock.\nHow much stock they're selling.\n\nObviously, there are many billionaires who own Nvidia stock, but there are only a select number who are forced to disclose their stock purchases and sales. For the purposes of this article, I'll cover billionaires that are company insiders (defined as company officers or those with over 10% beneficial ownership).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's focus on two billionaire company insiders: Jensen Huang (Nvidia's CEO and founder) and Mark Stevens (Nvidia board member). Huang's net worth is estimated at over $100 billion; Stevens' is estimated at over $8 billion. So far this year, Huang and Stevens sold a combined $731 million in Nvidia stock -- Huang sold $366 million worth of stock; Stevens sold $365 million.\nEven though these are massive stock sales, they must be put into context. Huang, for example, owns more than 800 million shares of Nvidia stock, worth over $100 billion as of this writing. Stevens owns nearly 39 million shares of Nvidia, which are worth close to $5 billion.\nSo, from that standpoint, neither one is dumping Nvidia shares hand over fist. Rather, they have sold very small portions of their massive holdings. Stevens sold 0.7% of his stock this year, while Huang has sold even less -- only 0.3%.\nWhat's more, there are many reasons insiders sell stock. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio diversification.\nCharitable giving.\nPersonal expenses.\nOutside business projects.\n\nInvestors should approach insider sales with caution, understanding that they can sometimes be significant but often require a deeper understanding of the context.\nIn any event, there is another factor regarding Nvidia stock that investors should be paying attention to.\u00a0\nNvidia's stock valuation is reaching precarious heights\nTo properly value a stock, investors have to examine more than just its price. That's because the price investors pay for a stock doesn't take into account important factors such as the number of shares outstanding or the underlying financial health of the company.\n\nThat's why valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are critical when attempting to compare two or more stocks. They allow investors to make apples-to-apples comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem for Nvidia is that by examining its current P/S ratio, for example, it's clear that the stock is trading at an unsustainable level.\nHere is Nvidia's P/S ratio dating back to its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999:\n\nNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\nIts current level (37 times) is nearly 500% greater than its lifetime average (8 times). That's troubling in and of itself, but the concerns grow when comparing Nvidia to other tech stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is another company whose stock price benefited as the AI revolution has taken off. However, its stock trades with a P/S ratio of 14 times. And while that is almost double its historical average (8 times), it's still well below Nvidia's. Moreover, when examining Microsoft's lifetime P/S ratio, you do see a period when its stock traded with a sky-high P/S ratio of 30 times. That was during the lead-up to the dot-com stock bubble of 2001. And remember, following that bubble, Microsoft's stock dropped 65%.\n\nNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\nIn summary, Nvidia's insider selling may be a red herring. However, the stock's lofty valuation should give investors pause. While the company's surging revenue could help moderate its valuation, risks remain that the stock is overpriced at current levels and could experience a pull-back -- particularly if actual sales fall short of heightened expectations. \n\n\n\nJake Lerch has positions in Nvidia.

But certain Wall Street analysts see a substantial opportunity taking shape around Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) due to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.  Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra at Bernstein believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million by 2030. That forecast ultimately implies 1,415% upside from its current price of $66,000. Last year, Cathie Wood estimated Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, but she upped that figure to $3.8 million following approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Her latest forecast implies 5,655% upside from the current price.  Several successful hedge fund managers sold shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, while simultaneously buying shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), one of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 2.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake 68%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. David Shaw at D.E. Shaw sold 1.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 38%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,004 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, he started a rather sizable position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust, such that it ranks as his twelfth-largest holding excluding options contracts.   The three billionaires mentioned above are noteworthy because they run the three top hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Readers should not interpret their trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment, but rather that diversification has merits. Here's why the iShares Bitcoin Trust is a worthwhile long-term holding for risk-tolerant investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are unlocking demand from institutional investors At any given moment, Bitcoin's price is determined by supply and demand. However, its supply is limited to 21 million coins, so demand is ultimately the driving force behind price action. In other words, demand for Bitcoin would need to increase substantially for its price to reach $1 million, and even more substantially for its price to reach $3.8 million. Bernstein and Ark Invest believe that demand will come from spot Bitcoin ETFs, a brand new asset class approved by the SEC earlier this year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin by holding the cryptocurrency as the underlying asset, and they eliminate traditional sources of friction that may have kept retail and institutional investors out of the market, as detailed below.   Story Continues Spot Bitcoin ETFs let investors add Bitcoin exposure through existing brokerage accounts. That eliminates the complexity of maintaining a separate portfolio with a cryptocurrency exchange. It also simplifies tax reporting because most brokerages link directly to tax preparation software. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are often cheaper. The iShares Bitcoin Trust has an expense ratio of 0.25%, meaning investors will pay $25 per year on every $10,000 in the fund. But Coinbase charges 0.4% to 0.6% per transaction for orders under $10,000, meaning investors get hit with higher fees twice \u2014 once when they buy, and again when they sell. Bernstein and Ark Invest expect Bitcoin to follow different trajectories over the next decade, but they agree on one thing: Demand from institutional investors will drive the forecasted gains.We are still in the early stages of adoption, but institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is evident in recent Forms 13F filed with the SEC. As mentioned, the top three hedge funds \u2014 Citadel Advisor, D.E. Shaw, and Millennium Management \u2014 have started positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Several major investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo, have also bought into spot Bitcoin ETFs.However, most institutional investors have very small positions at the present time, meaning their stakes represent inconsequential portions of their portfolios. But Bernstein analysts Chhugani and Sapra believe institutional investors are \"in the process of evaluating 'net long' positions as they get comfortable with the improving ETF liquidity.\"Similarly, Cathie Wood at Ark Invest believes institutional investors will eventually put a little more than 5% of their portfolios into spot Bitcoin ETFs. For context, institutions had nearly $120 trillion in assets under management last year, so Ark's forecast implies that those investors will allocate more than $6 trillion to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the future. Should that happen, Wood says the price of Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million.History says Bitcoin will reach a new high between April 2025 and October 2025Bernstein is also bullish on Bitcoin because of the halving event that took place in April 2024. \"We believe a new cycle commencing with halving is not a coincidence, but driven by unique demand-supply dynamics,\" the analysts wrote in a recent note.To elaborate, Bitcoin block subsidies \u2014 newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners for solving cryptographic puzzles to verify transaction blocks \u2014 are reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain. Those halving events happen about once every four years, and the most recent one took place in April.That is significant because Bitcoin has gone through three halving events before, and it's price has always reached a new peak 12 to 18 months later, as shown in the chart below.Halving DatePeak ReturnTime to Peak ReturnNovember 201210,485%371 daysJuly 20163,103%525 daysMay 2020707%546 daysSource: Fidelity Digital Assets.As shown above, post-halving returns have diminished with each subsequent halving event, simply because each subsequent halving event has a smaller impact on the total supply. But history suggests Bitcoin will peak sometime between April 2025 and October 2025.A word of caution for investorsPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns, and price targets should never be taken for granted. Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and its limited track record means that forecasting its performance is essentially impossible.Additionally, Bitcoin has declined by more than 50% on several occasions and similar drawdowns are plausible (if not probable) in the future. Investors comfortable with those risks should consider buying a position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust today. Adding exposure to the cryptocurrency is a great way to diversify a portfolio overloaded with AI stocks like Nvidia.Should you invest $1,000 in iShares Bitcoin Trust right now?Before you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

And for good reason. The stock has gained nearly 1,000% in less than two years, meaning a $10,000 investment in late 2022 would be worth almost $100,000 today.\nWhile nobody can predict what will happen, there are two paths forward for Nvidia. One path is promising; the other is downright terrifying.\u00a0Let's dive in and see which is more likely.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bull case: Nvidia is Apple circa 2004\nThe bull case for Nvidia goes something like this: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the story of the next 20 years. It will bring changes to the way people interact on a level equal to or exceeding those brought on by the smartphone in the mid-2000s. Therefore, the best historical comparison for Nvidia is Apple in 2004.\n\nBack then, Apple's hot new product was -- wait for it -- the iPod. Remember that? The company wouldn't debut its first iPhone for another three years. \nNevertheless, Apple was already well on its way to becoming the world's largest company. In 2004, its stock grew by more than 200%, making it the top performer in the S&P 500.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2004 until today, its market cap has surged at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. A $10,000 investment made 20 years ago would be worth $4.8 million today.\n\nAAPL total return level data by YCharts.\nIt would be incredibly difficult for Nvidia to repeat that performance, but it is possible. AI is a fascinating new technology, and 20 years is a very long time, giving the company plenty of runway to live up to the lofty expectations surrounding its stock.\nBut what about the bear case?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bear case: Nvidia is Oracle circa 2000\nThis is the bear case for Nvidia: AI is a promising technology but overhyped. Due to elevated valuations in AI stocks, a stock market bubble has formed, and when it pops, Nvidia's stock will feel the pain. In short, Nvidia today is like Oracle in 2000.\nTo recap, the 1990s were full of hope for the internet. In particular, the stock market went gaga for internet stocks. Valuations soared, not just for brand-new companies but also for legacy tech companies that were cashing in on the internet craze. \nIn particular, Oracle, whose business revolved around facilitating the transition from mid-century mainframe computers to modern servers for enterprise clients, saw its stock skyrocket in the late 1990s.\nUnfortunately for Oracle, expectations ran far ahead of actual sales. At its peak in 2000, its stock traded with a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 24, far above its lifetime average of 5. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nORCL PS ratio data by YCharts.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, Oracle experienced an 85% drawdown. The stock has taken over 20 years to recover its pre-bubble high. Those who bought in the summer of 2000 and held through 2020 would have made almost no money on their investment.\n\nORCL data by YCharts.\nIt's a lesson that even companies with the most promising technological innovations and solid business models don't necessarily make great investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo which is it?\nOn the one hand, Nvidia's P/S ratio has a scary resemblance to Oracle's in the run-up to its crash in 2001.\n\nORCL PS ratio; data by YCharts.\nThat should give pause to any Nvidia bull. Simply put, the stock is so expensive now that some moderation must occur. \nEither the company's sales will continue to grow like a weed to bring down the ratio, or the stock price will have to come down. Factors such as increased competition, market saturation, or a slowdown in AI and semiconductor spending could decrease Nvidia's P/S ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy gut tells me it's the latter, although the party could continue for some time. Either way, I recommend caution with Nvidia stock. \nUnlike many of its mega-cap peers, the company lacks a well-diversified business model. Its stock is performing well because AI and semiconductor spending has gone through the roof, but that trend may taper off -- particularly if the economy deteriorates or enters a recession.\n Moreover, if the demand for AI and semiconductor technology were to decline, Nvidia's stock could be in for a rough ride -- perhaps as bad as Oracle's 23 years ago.\n\n\n\nJake Lerch has positions in Nvidia.

By Omkar Godbole|Edited by Sam ReynoldsUpdated Jul 31, 2024, 8:38\u202fp.m.  UTCPublished Jul 31, 2024, 6:19\u202fa.m.  UTCNVDA's 30-day implied volatility has surpassed bitcoin and ether's gauge.Bitcoin has exhibited a strong positive correlation with NVDA since late 2022.Nasdaq-listed Nvidia (NVDA), hailed by Goldman Sachs as the world's most important stock this year, is expected to see more significant price swings than crypto market leaders bitcoin and ether.NVDA's 30-day options implied volatility, a gauge of anticipated price swings over four weeks, has recently surged from an annualized 48% to 71%, according to data source Fintel.Story continuesDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today.

The ETH DVOL index has dropped from 70% to 55%.Options are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from bullish and bearish price swings. The implied volatility, influenced by demand for options, represents the degree of uncertainty or expected price turbulence.NVDA, a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and the producer of graphics processing units formerly used for cryptocurrency mining, has emerged as a barometer of sentiment for both equity and crypto markets since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.Both bitcoin and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and have since exhibited a strong positive correlation. As of writing, the correlation between 90-day prices on bitcoin and NVDA was 0.73.NVDA's stock is down roughly 26% since reaching a high of $140 last month, offering bearish cues to the crypto market. Bitcoin has been locked in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, CoinDesk data show.The spike in NVDA's implied volatility is likely related to the hedging activity of market makers, a phenomenon often seen in the crypto market, according to the crypto financial platform BloFin.\"It must be admitted that negative gamma does not only dominate the crypto market. In the U.S. stock market, SPY and QQQ have experienced significant declines caused by negative gamma hedging, and the high volatility risk has made NVDA's front-month implied volatility level significantly surpass that of cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH,\" Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, told CoinDesk.Negative or short gamma means market makers trade in the direction of the price moves to maintain their overall exposure direction-neutral, inadvertently adding to market volatility.NvidiaBitcoinEtherMarketsOmkar GodboleOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

The debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 wowed the tech world and highlighted the vast potential of the emerging technology. As a result, numerous companies have focused their businesses on AI, hoping to win a slice of a pie that Grand View Research forecasts will be worth nearly $2 trillion annually by 2030. \nIncreased demand for AI services has also increased the need for high-end chips to power them -- chips like the graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia (NVDA -2.11%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.70%) develop. Nvidia's years of dominance in GPUs allowed it to snap up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, leading to soaring earnings and stock growth. AMD got off to a slower start in the niche, but its share price has still experienced a healthy gain since January 2023.\nBoth of these chipmakers are compelling investments as the AI market develops and chip demand shows no signs of slowing. But is Nvidia or AMD the better AI stock to buy in July 2024?\nNvidia\nNvidia has become a Wall Street darling since the boom in AI kicked off -- its stock is up about 745% since the start of 2023. The company is the go-to chip supplier for AI developers worldwide. Soaring demand for Nvidia's GPUs has seen its quarterly revenue and operating income climb 93% and 149% during the past four reported quarters. Meanwhile, free cash flow (what's left of cash flow after capital investments) has soared 147%. \nHowever, the stock tumbled by more than 12% from June 17 to June 24. Some analysts have questioned whether Nvidia's stock has hit its peak. However, the company's tech dominance and vast AI potential suggest this dip will be temporary. The stock remains an investment worth considering for the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has positions in multiple markets. In addition to powering AI models, Nvidia's chips are crucial to running cloud services, consumer products like laptops, and customer-built PCs used for activities such as gaming and video editing. Meanwhile, emerging markets like self-driving cars and virtual/augmented reality are likely to boost demand for Nvidia's hardware.\nThese factors, in combination with the company's lead in AI, suggest that Nvidia's stock is a must-buy.\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nNvidia's success in AI spurred AMD to jump into that segment of the chip business full force.\nThe company launched competing AI GPUs this year, and its data center revenue spiked 80% year over year in the first quarter. However, its total revenue rose just 2% during the period due to steep sales declines in other areas of its business. That result compared to Nvidia's revenue growth of 262% in the same quarter didn't do much to attract investors. AMD stock is up by just 7% year to date, while Nvidia's has jumped 125%. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, history doesn't bode well for AMD when it comes to its efforts to compete against Nvidia in AI. Data from Jon Peddie Research shows that during the past decade, Nvidia's market share in GPUs has risen from 65% to 88% while AMD's has declined from 35% to 12%. \n\nData by YCharts.\nAdditionally, consider the vast differences in these companies' financial growth during the past three years. Nvidia's revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have delivered triple-digit increases. Meanwhile, AMD's operating income and free cash flow have plunged, so it will have fewer financial resources to invest in its business and its efforts to compete in AI.\nIs Nvidia or AMD the better AI stock in 2024?\nNvidia and AMD are at different places in their AI journeys -- one company dominates the market and the other is still trying to find its footing. Often, a contrast of this type would mean the underdog has more room to run over the long term. However, AMD has already experienced significant stock price growth even as it has produced mediocre earnings. This has left AMD's stock considerably overvalued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts.\nNeither Nvidia nor AMD would be considered bargain buys at their current high price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. However, Nvidia still offers the better value between the two stocks.\nIn addition, with Nvidia generating free cash flow of $15 billion last quarter compared to AMD's $379 million, the choice is a no-brainer. Nvidia is the better AI stock and is worth a long-term investment this year.\n\n\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Reports claim the U.S. has told allies that it\u2019s considering placing some of the strictest restrictions on chip companies from sending their products to China.\nOn top of that, former President Donald Trump made some comments concerning Taiwan. That includes suggesting that the country should pay the U.S. for its protection. That\u2019s another blow to chip stocks as Trump is running in the 2024 presidential election.\nDerren Nathan, Head of Equity Research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said this about the comments:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this would cause significant short-term disruption but at the same time the opening of new facilities in the likes of Europe and the United States could see the industry\u2019s reliance on Asia start to subside over the next few years.\u201d\n\nChip Stocks Down Today\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is falling 5.8% as of Wednesday afternoon.\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is dropping 5.5% as of this writing.\nQualcomm\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is taking a 6.8% beating this afternoon.\n\nThere are even more stock market stories traders will want to read about below!\nWe have all of the hottest stock market news investors need to know about on Wednesday!

But recently, the artificial intelligence-fueled rally has cooled, sending Nvidia down 17% from its all-time high, Broadcom down 18%, and AMD down 35%.\nLet's determine whether the sell-off is a buying opportunity, or if these growth stocks ran up too far, too fast.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA market leader worthy of pole position\nOver the last three years, Nvidia's stock price rose a mind-numbing 474%. But its diluted earnings per share (EPS) is up an even better 509%. So, on the surface, Nvidia's massive run-up seems overextended, but the business has largely backed up the rally by growing earnings. The question now is whether the growth is sustainable, and what a reasonable valuation for the stock is.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nNvidia's earnings growth is attributed to a change in revenue mix. In past years, Nvidia generated most of its revenue from gaming, chips for personal computers, software for internet applications, visualization, and more. It was a solid business, but nothing like the Nvidia of today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fiscal 2024, 84.5% of revenue came from Nvidia's Compute and Networking segment, which includes graphics processing units (GPUs) that can handle AI workloads. Five years ago, in fiscal 2020, Compute and Networking comprised less than a fifth of total revenue.\nNvidia's business is almost unrecognizable from just a few years ago. The company could continue growing earnings at a breakneck pace, as long as there's sustained demand for AI systems and Nvidia maintains its market share.\nSurprisingly, Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't high compared to historical levels. Even better, its forward P/E is just 41, implying strong earnings growth expectations over the next year.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is a good example of why a stock isn't necessarily expensive just because its price has increased. Nvidia is a phenomenal company that is flat-out delivering results for investors.\nThe biggest concern with Nvidia is that growth will slow during a cyclical downturn, or that it'll work through its backlog and see lower demand. After all, a lot of its customers have raced to buy AI chips, but it remains to be seen if their repeat purchases will be as large. There's also the concern that Nvidia's pricing power will erode as competition grows -- which could lead to slowing growth or lower profit margins.\nNvidia isn't expensive right now. The stock could begin to look cheap if the AI investment flurry continues. But it's uncertain what Nvidia's market share will look like a few years from now and how much pricing power it will have in this new competitive landscape. Therefore, an investment in Nvidia should only be considered if you have a high risk tolerance.\n\nExpectations are high for AMD to post record profits\nAMD often gets compared to Nvidia. But the companies have noticeably different revenue mixes. While AI chips now dominate Nvidia's business, AMD still makes most of its revenue from other sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nData center revenue grew 80% in first-quarter 2024 compared to first-quarter 2023. But even then, it still made up just 43% of total revenue. AMD's PC chip segment has staged a massive recovery and is contributing to overall results. Demand for AI chips in PCs is a big growth driver for AMD. And there's reason to think AMD's MI300 GPU will experience sustained high demand as customers look for alternatives to Nvidia's lineup, given the high prices and wait times.\nAMD is harder to value than Nvidia because it is chock-full of potential but also doesn't have the proven results -- yet. The biggest near-term risk to AMD is that its investments will take longer to pay off due to slowing demand or an industry-wide downturn.\nAMD's research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of revenue has climbed to 26.3% -- a 10-year high. R&D spending is par for the course in innovative industries, but AMD has to prove to investors that its investments will lead to earnings growth.\nAnalyst expectations are fairly high for AMD -- with 2024 consensus EPS at $3.50 and then $5.53 in 2025. For context, AMD earned just $0.53 in EPS in 2023 -- mostly because it has been focusing on R&D and sales growth. But even then, its 10-year-high EPS was $2.57 in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD is set to continue growing its core business and carve out a sizable chunk of AI chip market share. If it does deliver on those 2025 earnings goals, the stock could look inexpensive. AMD is a riskier bet than Nvidia, but it can potentially produce better gains going forward.\n\nThe most balanced player in a growth industry\nBroadcom embodies the old saying: \"When there's a gold rush, sell picks and shovels.\" Put another way, a company doesn't have to profit from the AI boom by selling GPUs. The infrastructure and software solutions company makes chips and hardware for smartphone makers, internet companies, data centers, and cloud-based tools through its subsidiary, VMware.\nBroadcom doesn't make GPUs like Nvidia. Rather, it provides essential hardware for IT infrastructure and hyper-scale data centers that demand increasingly higher computational power. For example, Broadcom provides network, server, and storage connectivity for data centers -- from ethernet switches to adapters, controllers, and more.\nThe company expects generative AI to accelerate growth in its chipmaking business. Generative AI is already responsible for a fifth of semiconductor revenue, and that business unit makes up 79% of total revenue. Broadcom is an exciting opportunity because generative AI currently makes up a relatively small portion of its business, and it also has plenty of other revenue streams.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this vein, it is arguably the most diversified option in the space. It is also the least expensive stock on this list, with a forward P/E of 31.4. Broadcom pays a growing dividend that currently yields 1.3%.\nThe stock isn't cheap, but it isn't overpriced either. It stands out as a catch-all way to invest in sustained growth in the semiconductor industry without going all-in on AI or a particular GPU maker.\n\nThree good choices to consider now\nOne of my favorite quotes by Warren Buffett is, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" Put another way, popular stocks are probably going to sport premium valuations. Tech is the hottest sector in the market, and semiconductors are the hottest industry in that sector. So before even thinking about investing in the space, it's important to realize that chip stocks, at least right now, are as cheery a consensus as it gets.\nA pullback in chip stocks could be good for long-term investors. Unrealistic expectations can lead to brutal corrections in companies with expensive valuations. Ideally, earnings growth, not euphoria, drives stock prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's an argument that Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are all good buys now. For most investors, I would say Broadcom is the best overall buy because it has the most reasonable valuation and a diversified business model, pays a dividend, and doesn't have sky-high growth exceptions.\nBy the same token, I could also see AMD being the top performer over the next three to five years, but it may be best to take a wait-and-see approach on that company to see more defined signs that R&D investments are paying off.\n\n\n\nDaniel Foelber has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

See today's pick now.\nThe last time a \u201cbearish engulfing pattern\u201d formed on the chart of NVIDIA Corp\u00a0NVDA a large move lower followed. Now another one of these patterns has formed \u2014 and it may also mean a move lower is coming.\nMany technical analysts attempt to identify chart patterns without understanding the price action that creates them. That's why Nvidia is our trading team's Stock of the Day. \nThe chart illustrates two important technical analysis lessons.\nReversals in markets happen when the leadership changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. If the change is slow and gradual, a \u201crounded top\u201d or \u201crounded bottom\u201d pattern may appear on the chart. If the change takes place over a couple of sessions, it may form a \u201cV top\u201d or \u201cinverted V bottom\u201d pattern.\nAnd when the change in leadership takes place in just one day, an \u201cengulfing pattern\u201d may appear.\nBearish Pattern for Nvidia\n\nThe important thing about this bearish engulfing pattern for Nvidia is the price action that caused it to form. In the morning it looked like it was going to be another up day. The opening price was higher than the previous day's close. It looked like the uptrend was going to continue.\nBut by the end of the day, something important happened. The sellers overpowered the buyers. They even pushed the price below the previous day's opening price.\nThe open was higher than the previous close, and the close was lower than the previous open. The price action \u201cengulfed\u201d the prior day's action.\nMost volume trades on the open and the close. Because of this there, is typically support at these levels. The fact that the stock fell right through them shows the sellers are extremely aggressive.\nSupport for Nvidia\nThere's another lesson on this chart.\nAs you can see, after yesterday's sell-off, the shares closed just below $128.00. This isn't a coincidence. There is support here for Nvidia because these levels were previously resistance.\nMany traders who sold while the shares were at the resistance decided they made a mistake when the price moved higher. Some of them decided to buy their shares back if they could get them for the same price that they were sold for.\nAs a result, now that the price has fallen back to these levels, buy orders are placed. And if there are enough of these orders, it will create support at what had been resistance.\nTo understand technical analysis, traders need to understand what chart patterns are. More importantly, they need to understand the price action that creates them.\nThe image was created using artificial intelligence by MidJourney.NVDANVIDIA Corp$119.27-0.22%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

With the latest Reference Image feature currently in beta, users can also upload a sample image to get image results closer to their desired output.\nUse Generative Fill to add content and Reference Image to refine it.\nGenerative Expand allows artists to extend the border of their image with the Crop tool, filling in bigger canvases with new content that automatically blends in with the existing image.\nBigger canvas? Not a problem.\nRTX-accelerated Neural Filters, such as Photo Restoration, enable complex adjustments such as colorizing black-and-white photos and performing style transfers using AI. The Smart Portrait filter, which allows non-destructive editing with filters, is based on work from NVIDIA Research.\n\nThe brand-new Generative Shape Fill (beta) in Adobe Illustrator, powered by the latest Adobe Firefly Vector Model, allows users to accelerate design workflows by quickly filling shapes with detail and color in their own styles. With Generative Shape Fill, designers can easily match the style and color of their own artwork to create a wide variety of editable and scalable vector graphic options.\nGenerative AI.\nAdobe Illustrator\u2019s Generative Recolor feature lets creators type in a text prompt to explore custom color palettes and themes for their vector artwork in seconds.\nColor us impressed.\nNVIDIA will continue working with Adobe to support advanced generative AI models, with a focus on deep integration into the apps the world\u2019s leading creators use.\nMaking Moves on Video\nAdobe Premiere Pro is one of the most popular and powerful video editing solutions.\nIts Enhance Speech tool, accelerated by RTX, uses AI to remove unwanted noise and improve the quality of dialogue clips so they sound professionally recorded. It\u2019s up to 4.5x faster on RTX PCs.\nAdobe Premiere Pro\u2019s AI-powered Enhance Speech tool removes unwanted noise and improves dialogue quality.\nAuto Reframe, another Adobe Premiere feature, uses GPU acceleration to identify and track the most relevant elements in a video, and intelligently reframes video content for different aspect ratios. Scene Edit Detection automatically finds the original edit points in a video, a necessary step before the video editing stage begins.\n\nVisual Effects\nSeparating a foreground object from a background is a crucial step in many visual effects and compositing workflows.\nAdobe After Effects has a new feature that uses a matte to isolate an object, enabling capabilities including background replacement and the selective application of effects to the foreground.\nUsing the Roto Brush tool, artists can draw strokes on representative areas of the foreground and background elements. After Effects uses that information to create a segmentation boundary between the foreground and background elements, delivering cleaner cutouts with fewer clicks.\n\nCreating 3D Product Shots\nThe Substance 3D Collection is Adobe\u2019s solution for 3D material authoring, texturing and rendering, enabling users to rapidly create stunningly photorealistic 3D content, including models, materials and lighting.\nVisualizing products and designs in the context of a space is compelling, but it can be time-consuming to find the right environment for the objects to live in. Substance 3D Stager\u2019s Generative Background feature, powered by Adobe Firefly, solves this issue by letting artists quickly explore generated backgrounds to composite 3D models.\nOnce an environment is selected, Stager can automatically match the perspective and lighting to the generated background.\n\nMaterial Authoring With AI\nAdobe Substance 3D Sampler, also part of the Substance 3D Collection, is designed to transform images of surfaces and objects into photorealistic physically based rendering (PBR) materials, 3D models and high-dynamic range environment lights. With the recent introduction of new generative workflows powered by Adobe Firefly, Sampler is making it easier than ever for artists to explore variations when creating materials for everything from product visualization projects to the latest AAA games.\nSampler\u2019s Text-to-Texture feature allows users to generate tiled images from detailed text prompts. These generated images can then be edited and transformed into photorealistic PBR materials using the machine learning-powered Image-to-Material feature or any Sampler filter.\n\nImage-to-Texture similarly enables the creation of tiled textures from reference images, providing an alternate way to prompt and generate variations from existing visual content.\nAdobe 3D Sampler\u2019s Image-to-Texture feature.\nSampler\u2019s Text-to-Pattern feature uses text prompts to generate tiling patterns, which can be used as base colors or inputs for various filters, such as the Cloth Weave filter for creating original fabric materials.\nAll of these generative AI features in the Substance 3D Collection, supercharged with RTX GPUs, are designed to help 3D creators ideate and create faster.\nPhoto-tastic Features\nAdobe Lightroom\u2019s AI-powered Raw Details feature produces crisp detail and more accurate renditions of edges, improves color rendering and reduces artifacts, enhancing the image without changing its original resolution. This feature is handy for large displays and prints, where fine details are visible.\nEnhance, enhance, enhance.\nSuper Resolution helps create an enhanced image with similar results as Raw Details but with 2x the linear resolution. This means that the enhanced image will have 2x the width and height of the original image \u2014 or 4x the total pixel count. This is especially useful for increasing the resolution of cropped imagery.\n\nFor faster editing, AI-powered, RTX-accelerated masking tools like Select Subject, which isolates people from an image, and Select Sky, which captures skies, enable users to create complex masks with the click of a button.\n\nVisit Adobe\u2019s AI features page for a complete list of AI features using RTX.\nLooking for more AI-powered content creation apps? Consider NVIDIA Broadcast, which transforms any room into a home studio, free for RTX GPU owners.\u00a0\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

Undoubtedly, much of this recent rally has been fueled by the company's position as a key beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave.\nNvidia offers a full-stack AI platform, comprising cutting-edge AI-optimized hardware chips, a complete software ecosystem, high-speed networking solutions, and servers to enable clients to build \"AI factories,\" or the essential infrastructure for AI-based outputs (text, images, audio, video). The company's accelerated product release cadence, from two years to one year, also helps it maintain technological superiority against competition.\n\nFurthermore, besides the booming demand from large hyperscale companies, enterprises, and AI start-ups, Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware and software solutions are now increasingly used in new areas such as Sovereign AI (governments building domestic AI capabilities), automotive vertical, and robotics business.\nThe AI frenzy propelled Nvidia's stock to an all-time high of over $1,200 in early June. Its recently executed 10-for-1 stock split made its stock far more accessible to retail investors.\nWith Nvidia's stock now around $124 at this writing, long-term investors may be keen to know if the stock can again jump to $1,000-plus levels. Let's analyze the company's fundamentals and valuations to find some answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensifying competition and supply challenges\nNvidia's technological superiority in developing AI-optimized hardware and software enabled the company to capture a whopping 90% share of the global AI chip market. However, the company's stronghold may get challenged in the long run. Although currently far behind Nvidia, competitors Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working hard to capture a slice of the AI market.\nAMD's MI300 family of data center chips witnessed strong demand, while the company is also gearing up for launching families of AI chips such as MI325 and MI350 accelerators, based on advanced architectures, in the coming months. AMD expects these chips to demonstrate faster performance, improved memory capacity, and stronger computing capabilities for AI workloads.\nIntel is also aggressively focusing on the AI PC opportunity and hopes to launch Lunar Lake laptop CPUs by September 2024. Lunar Lake chips are expected to be superior in performance, efficiency, and graphics processing compared to their predecessor Meteor Lake chips. Plus, Intel has also introduced Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, offering superior cost-performance benefits for training and inferencing of AI models.\nNvidia also faces the risk of customers such as cloud players and technology giants becoming competitors, as they have been accelerating in-house development of AI-optimized chips and solutions. This risk cannot be ignored, since large cloud players account for roughly 45% of the company's data center revenues.\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple other challenges\nWhile demand for Nvidia's AI chips and solutions has grown dramatically, the company continues to face supply constraints associated with procuring manufacturing, testing, and packaging capacity from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other vendors. Subsequently, the company expects demand for its new H200 chips and next-generation Blackwell chips to outpace supply well until 2025. This headwind can affect the company's growth prospects in the coming years.\nNvidia also accelerated the pace of release cadence (for major products or features) from once every two years to once annually. Continuously innovating and adapting hardware and software is the need of the hour in the face of increasing complexity and rapid evolution of AI models and workloads.\nHowever, this also exposes Nvidia to significant execution risks and to the risk of clients delaying purchases to get access to the most advanced technologies. Nvidia's rapid pace of innovation can result in early product obsolescence for its older offerings and increasing risk of self-cannibalization.\nValuation estimates\nNvidia has consistently posting impressive financial metrics for the past several quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), revenues were up by nearly 262% year over year to $26 billion, while net income soared by 628% year over year to $14.9 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's fiscal 2025 sales to grow by 97% year over year to $120 billion. While the revenue growth rate is expected to moderate in the next decade, analysts expect the company's sales to more than triple to $380.9 billion by 2034.\nNvidia is currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 38.6x. Assuming that this multiple reverts to its 10-year average of 22.27x (a conservative estimate), we can expect Nvidia's market capitalization to reach around $8.5 trillion by 2034. While the market cap seems huge, it is only 2.7 times the company's current $3.1 trillion market capitalization. This implies that the stock can reach north of $340 by 2034 (assuming no significant share repurchases or stock splits).\nAssuming Nvidia's P/S multiple remains at the current 38.6x level (a very aggressive estimate), the company's market capitalization will be around $14.7 trillion -- 4.7 times its current market capitalization. Still, the company's share price can be expected to reach close to $600 by the end of 2034.\nHence, based on current estimates, the chances of Nvidia's share price crossing $1,000 in the next decade appear slim. These projections, however, can change in case Nvidia makes even more dramatic advances in AI technologies in the coming years.\n\n\n\nManali Pradhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The exceptionally robust demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that are deployed in personal computers (PCs), data centers, and automotive applications has led to a terrific increase in the company's revenue and earnings during this period.\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\nNow, it would seem far-fetched to expect Nvidia stock to rise another 30x over the next half-decade considering that it has a market cap of just over $3 trillion right now and is one of the three largest companies in the world. The entire global economy, for comparison, was worth an estimated $105 trillion in 2023. However, considering the catalysts ahead, there is a good chance that shares of Nvidia could continue heading higher over the next five years, even if those gains may not be as astronomical as those of the past five.\nAI is supercharging Nvidia's growth\nFor Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28, its revenue stood at $60.9 billion, up from $11.7 billion in its fiscal 2019. So, Nvidia's top line has increased fivefold over the last five years. Looking ahead, analysts are forecasting something similar may happen thanks to the massive growth driver that is the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMizuho Securities is anticipating Nvidia's data center revenue alone will jump to $280 billion in 2027, which will coincide with the majority of Nvidia's fiscal year 2028. That would be a huge increase over the $47.5 billion data center revenue the company reported in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year and coincided with 11 months of 2023) and the $89 billion revenue it is projected to generate from this market in the current fiscal year 2025.\nOne reason why that forecast may be accurate is that the market for AI chips is expected to reach a whopping $400 billion in annual revenue in 2027 (which would be fiscal 2028 for Nvidia), according to Nvidia's peer AMD. Mizuho's Nvidia revenue estimate for calendar 2027 (fiscal 2028 for Nvidia) suggests that it would be controlling 70% of the AI chip market at that time. Though that would be lower than the 90%-plus share that the company currently commands in this market, it would still be able to deliver a massive bump in revenue considering the potential size of the AI chip market after four fiscal years.\nWhat's worth noting here is that even if the AI chip market takes longer than forecast to hit $400 billion in revenue and even if Nvidia's share shrinks to as low as 50%, its data center revenue alone could grow still four-fold in the coming years.\nThese catalysts could give Nvidia an additional boost\nNvidia has other potential growth drivers that could contribute to the expansion of its top line.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, the market for gaming GPUs that are installed in PCs is likely to benefit from an increase in spending on gaming hardware. Statista predicts that the gaming hardware market will generate $161 billion in revenue in 2024, and forecasts that it could grow to $241 billion by 2029. Nvidia should be a big beneficiary of this growth considering that it controlled an impressive 88% of the market for PC graphics cards in the first quarter of 2024.\nMeanwhile, in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, growing demand for digital twin systems drove revenue in Nvidia's professional visualization business up by 45% year over year to $427 million.\nNvidia is scratching the surface of a potentially huge opportunity in the digital twin market. According to a forecast from Mordor Intelligence, that space could generate $126 billion in revenue in 2029. From this year's forecast $26 billion, that would be a compound annual growth rate of 37%. More importantly, Nvidia is building a solid base of customers for its digital twin offerings. This was evident from the remarks made by CFO Colette Kress on the latest earnings conference call:\n\nCompanies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse-powered digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations.\n\nKress added that industrial software developers such as Cadence, Ansys, Dassault, and Siemens are some of the major names that are adopting its digital twin software. As such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's revenue growth over the next five years could match the growth that it has experienced in the past five. In fact, analysts are forecasting that its top line will triple in the space of just three fiscal years (from fiscal 2024 levels of $60.9 billion).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nAssuming Nvidia does hit $184.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2027, its top line would have increased at a compound annual rate of 45%. If the semiconductor giant's growth tapers off in the two that follow years to, let's say 25% a year, its revenue could reach $288 billion after five years. That would be close to a 5x increase in its revenue from fiscal 2024, and would be almost equivalent to the growth clocked by the company in the past five years.\nOf course, there is a good chance that the company could grow at a faster pace thanks to the catalysts discussed above. That's why investors who haven't bought this growth stock yet can still consider adding Nvidia to their portfolios. The tech giant seems poised for much more upside over the next five years.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Another analyst has issued a new price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the company prepares to roll out new chip architecture systems and expand into new markets. A team of Piper Sandler analysts, led by Harsh V. Kumar, has raised its NVDA stock price target by $20, taking it from $120 to $140, implying a 14% upside. \nThis news has sent Nvidia into the green, which the company needed after struggling last week. But now it seems likely that NVDA stock is mounting a comeback as it shakes off any negative momentum. Other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are rising today as well, but Nvidia is leading the charge, as it often does.\nWhat\u2019s Happening With NVDA Stock\nToday began with an important news story \u2014 Nvidia is working on producing chips to launch and distribute in China. This catalyst has created some steady momentum for NVDA stock. As of this writing, it is up 4% for the day and isn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing down. If this momentum continues, Nvidia will pull itself back into the green for the week in the near future.\nThe company\u2019s chipmaking innovation is still winning favor among Wall Street analysts. Piper Sandler\u2019s team maintains an overweight rating for NVDA stock, laying out why it predicts high growth ahead for the AI leader:\n\n\u201cWe see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\u201d they stated in a note to investors. The experts added that \u201cIn our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market.\u201d\n\nPiper Sander isn\u2019t the only firm that sees NVDA stock as a 2024 winner. Analyst Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital Markets also raised his price target from $120 to $175. That prediction implies an upside potential of more than 41%. Atif Malik of Citigroup maintains a $150 price target, flagging the upcoming SIGGRAPH 2024 conference, scheduled for July 28 to Aug. 1, as a likely growth-driving catalyst.\nWhy It Matters\nEven after last week\u2019s volatility, Nvidia remains one of Wall Street\u2019s best-loved stocks. Out of 41 surveyed analysts, 37 rate it as a buy and none are currently maintaining sell ratings. Few companies are looked upon by the industry\u2019s leading experts with this much favor. \nIt is likely that more institutional investors will double down on NVDA stock as the company moves forward with the Blackwell chip architecture, which Piper Sandler\u2019s team believes will propel it to even greater growth in the coming months.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient\u00a0held a LONG position in NVDA.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in NVDA.\nSamuel O\u2019Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

Most of that rally was driven by the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which boosted its sales of data center GPUs for processing complex AI tasks. The market's insatiable demand for its data center chips continues to outstrip its available supply, and analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027). They expect its earnings per share (EPS) to rise at a CAGR of 51%.   Image source: Nvidia.   So even though Nvidia is already worth more than $3 trillion, it could still have plenty of room to run. But before investors buy this high-flying stock, they should pay attention to these four red flags that could unexpectedly end its historic rally. 1. It's become an all-in play on AI chips Back in fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022), Nvidia generated 46% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, 39% from its data center GPUs, and the rest from its professional visualization, auto, and OEM chips. However, that product mix completely changed over the following two years as its sales of data center chips eclipsed its gaming chips.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated 87% of its revenue from data center chips, 10% from gaming chips, and the remaining 3% from its other categories. It generated $22.6 billion in data center revenue in that single quarter compared to its total revenue of nearly $27 billion for all of fiscal 2023. That breakneck expansion transformed Nvidia from a more diversified GPU maker to an all-in play on AI chips. That's fine if you believe Nvidia will continue dominating the AI market as it expands. But if the AI market abruptly cools off, Nvidia's chip shortage could quickly become a supply glut. If its data center business sputters out, it can't fall back on the growth of its gaming segment and other smaller divisions to soften those year-over-year comparisons. 2. It faces unpredictable regulatory challenges Nvidia's overwhelming dependence on the AI market exposes it to a lot of unpredictable regulatory challenges. U.S. regulators have repeatedly tightened their export curbs on its AI chip shipments to China, and that pressure could drive Chinese chipmakers to accelerate the development of their own AI chips. Tighter regulations for generative AI technologies, which have already taken effect in Europe, could throttle the growth of the red-hot industry and drive companies to rein in their purchases of new AI chips. Complaints about mass plagiarism and other ethical issues could also force AI companies to expand at a slower and more measured pace.   Story Continues 3. It faces clear competitive threatsNvidia controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, but its top rival AMD has been rolling out cheaper AI accelerators. AMD's MI300 Instinct GPUs have already beat Nvidia's H100 GPUs \u2014 which cost about four times more \u2014 in terms of raw processing power and memory usage across several industry benchmarks. Intel also recently claimed its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerators are faster and more power efficient than Nvidia's H100 GPUs.Super Micro Computer, which grew rapidly over the past few years by producing dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidia's chips, has also been developing new servers optimized for AMD's and Intel's cheaper AI accelerators. These cheaper servers could attract cost-conscious data center operators and erode Nvidia's market share.Meanwhile, Nvidia's tight supply and high prices are driving its top customers \u2014 including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Amazon \u2014 to develop their own first-party AI accelerators. These chips won't threaten Nvidia's near-term growth, but they could gradually loosen its iron grip on the hyperscale data center market.4. Its insiders are net sellersNvidia's stock isn't cheap at 49 times forward earnings and 26 times this year's sales. But if it had the potential to double or triple again in near term, its valuations would seem reasonable and its insiders should be scooping up more shares.Yet over the past 12 months, Nvidia's insiders sold more than 4 times as many shares as they bought. Over the past three months, they sold more than 52 times as many shares as they bought. Those insider sales don't necessarily mean it stock is headed off a cliff, but it's a worrisome trend that suggests its near-term upside is limited.Is it still safe to buy Nvidia's stock?I believe Nvidia is still worth buying, but investors shouldn't assume it's a perfect growth stock. Its transformation from a gaming company into an AI one was abrupt, and it could experience significant growing pains over the next few years. But assuming it overcomes all those competitive, regulatory, and macro challenges, it should remain one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular expansion of the AI market.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

While excitement surrounding the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has played an undeniable role in sending the broader market higher, don't overlook the other key trend powering the indexes to new heights: Stock-split euphoria. A stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to adjust its share price and outstanding share count, all while having no effect on its market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic maneuver that's often effected with purpose.   Image source: Getty Images.   Stock splits come in two varieties: Forward and reverse. Companies conducting forward-stock splits are aiming to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors and their employees. Meanwhile, businesses enacting reverse-stock splits are purposely increasing their share price, usually with the goal of maintaining minimum share price listing standards on a major stock exchange.  Although some companies completing reverse-stock splits have gone on to be wildly successful, most reverse splits are enacted from a position of weakness. Comparatively, high-flying stocks that need to reduce their share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors and employees are typically out-executing their competition. This disparity is why most investors tend to gravitate to companies enacting forward-stock splits. Since 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen top-tier businesses have announced stock splits. However, the outlooks for these stock-split stocks differ meaningfully. While AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has shouldered the load in sending the major stock indexes to fresh record closing highs, it's my belief that two other stock-split stocks are positioned to absolutely crush Nvidia in the return column over the next three years. The going is about to get considerably tougher for Nvidia Nvidia's stock has risen by 765% between the start of 2023 and the closing bell on July 16, 2024, which translates into a gain of more than $2.7 trillion in market value. This outsized gain is what convinced the company's board to approve a historic 10-for-1 stock split on May 22. On paper, everything has gone Nvidia's way. The company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) offers clear compute advantages over what few other AI-GPU options are available. As a result, Nvidia was responsible for roughly 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year, according to TechInsights.   Story Continues Furthermore, demand for Nvidia's chips has overwhelmed its supply. This allowed Nvidia to rapidly increase the selling price of its chips, which drove its adjusted gross margin to a scorching 78.35% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).Though things seem great on the surface, history, competition, and valuation are all headwinds that suggest Nvidia could struggle mightily in the coming years.The headwind I continually return to with Nvidia and artificial intelligence is that there hasn't been a single buzzy innovation, technology, or trend for 30 years that's escaped an early innings bubble. Investors consistently overestimate the adoption rate and utility of next-big-thing innovations, and I don't see AI bucking this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, no company is going to take it on the chin more than Nvidia.This is a company that can also be hurt by competition -- even if it maintains its GPU compute advantages. Stalwarts like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are rolling out competing chips to the H100 in AI-accelerated data centers. Moreover, all four of Nvidia's top customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are developing in-house AI-GPUs. With demand swamping supply, Intel and AMD should have no trouble gaining market share in high-compute data centers. All the while, AI-GPU scarcity, and Nvidia's pricing power, will wane.The final trouble spot is Nvidia's valuation. Although its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't off the charts, its trailing 12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is on par with the peak TTM P/S ratios seen from the likes of Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.All signs point to Nvidia's stock struggling mightily over the next three years -- and the following two stock-split stocks leaving it in the dust.  Image source: Sirius XM.  Sirius XM HoldingsThe first stock-split stock with the tools and intangibles needed to handily outperform Nvidia in the return column over the next three years is satellite radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).Sirius XM is the only high-profile stock split of 2024 that's of the reverse-split variety. When Sirius XM completes its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group, during the third quarter, a 1-for-10 reverse split will be conducted.What gives Sirius XM a high probability of outperforming Nvidia by the midpoint of 2027 is its abundance of competitive advantages.To start with, it's the only licensed satellite radio operator. While it still competes for listeners with terrestrial and online radio providers, being the only licensed satellite radio operator gives it meaningful subscription pricing power.More importantly, Sirius XM's operating model is markedly different than traditional radio providers'. Whereas online and terrestrial radio stations rely heavily on advertising to keep the lights on, Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its $2.16 billion in first-quarter revenue from advertising (which traces back to its Pandora Media subsidiary). Advertising revenue can be prone to wild swings that are dependent on the health of the U.S. and global economy.Comparatively, Sirius XM generated almost 78% of its sales from subscriptions in the March-ended quarter. Subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service than advertisers are to pare back their spending during an economic downturn. In short, Sirius XM is better-positioned than its radio peers for whatever the U.S. economy throws its way.There's also a level of cost transparency with Sirius XM that won't be found with other radio operators. No matter how many subscribers Sirius XM adds over time, its transmission and equipment costs aren't going to vary much, if at all.Lastly, there's an undeniable value proposition with Sirius XM. Shares are valued at just 12 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 34% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.Sony GroupThe other stock-split stock with all the necessary catalysts to absolutely crush Nvidia in the return department over the next three years is Japan-based consumer electronics powerhouse Sony Group (NYSE: SONY).On May 14, the company's board announced plans to conduct a 5-for-1 forward-stock split. For the company's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), the record date for this split is Sept. 30, with an effective date of Oct. 8. In other words, Sony's stock is still roughly two-and-a-half months away from becoming nominally cheaper.Sony is probably best-known for its gaming prowess, even though sales of its flagship PlayStation 5 have tapered a bit since its release in late 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The good news is that its gaming segment has two catalysts to look forward to through 2027.For starters, subscription revenue tied to PlayStation Plus has been climbing. PlayStation Plus is a multi-tiered service that gives subscribers the ability to game with their friends, and save their gaming data in the cloud. It's a high-margin service that's likely to keep subscribers loyal to the Sony brand.To add to this point, Sony's next-generation console is liable to come to market sometime between late 2026 and early 2028. Since next-gen console sales have historically been a key revenue driver for Sony, it wouldn't be a surprise to see shares reacting positively well before the debut of a new console.Beyond gaming, Sony Group is one of the top suppliers of image sensors used in smartphones. Wireless companies upgrading their networks to support 5G speeds have fueled a steady device replacement cycle that's lifted sales for the company's Imaging and Sensing Solutions (I&SS) segment. I&SS segment sales are forecast to grow by 15% this year.Sony Group's board also believes the company's shares are trading at a discount. On the same day its 5-for-1 forward split was announced, the board approved the repurchase of up to 30 million outstanding shares (on a post-split basis). For businesses with steady or growing net income, stock buybacks have a way of lifting earnings per share and making fundamentally sound companies look even more attractive.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Her mission was to help turn Huang\u2019s vision into reality.\nThe central \u201cmountain\u201d in NVIDIA\u2019s Voyager building, part of the Santa Clara campus.\nSince then, Marko has built NVIDIA\u2019s design, planning and space management teams, and together they\u2019ve set out to create a cohesive, timeless and functional workplace design across the company\u2019s global offices, with custom nuances based on each location.\nData about how employees are using a space drives design decisions. With the rise of flexible work, Marko and team are focused on making sure NVIDIA\u2019s spaces reflect new ways of working and facilitate collaboration. Their design guidelines are agile, constantly evolving to meet changing needs \u2014 and paralleling the way NVIDIANs approach their work.\n\u201cNVIDIA treats its employees with so much respect, and we carry out that guiding principle to provide great workplaces,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to create the canvas for NVIDIANs to do the best work of their lives.\u201d\n\u201cValleys\u201d on both sides of the central \u201cmountain\u201d separate communal space from conference rooms and workspace in Voyager.\nWith an architect father who designed airports and Canadian embassies all over the world, Marko lived in Nepal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and her home country of Canada before moving to the U.S. She brings a global perspective to her work and is passionate about unifying NVIDIA\u2019s brand experience across its offices worldwide.\nMarko is especially proud of the custom-built, 750,000-square-foot Voyager building that supports more than 3,000 employees at the company\u2019s Santa Clara campus. Offices like this are the result of Huang\u2019s vision and many cross-functional teams\u2019 collaboration to bring the building and workspace to life.\n\u201cI love what I do and feel that if you always try to do what\u2019s best for the greater good, success will come,\u201d she said. \u201cMy proudest moments are the achievements that we\u2019ve accomplished as a team.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\nNVIDIANs meet in the company\u2019s new Discovery campus in Bangalore, India.\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded NVDA from Buy to Neutral.\nIn another development, European Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager has reportedly highlighted a significant \u201cbottleneck\u201d in the Nvidia AI chips supply.\nDespite the concern, regulators have not yet decided on any specific actions to address the issue. Vestager stated that they are still in the preliminary stages of investigation, asking questions but not yet taking regulatory action, reported Bloomberg.\nNvidia has become a focal point for regulators due to its significant role in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The company\u2019s GPUs are essential for data centers, making them highly sought after by cloud computing providers.\nNvidia\u2019s H100 processing units have secured the company over 80% market share, outpacing competitors Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\t\t\n\n\nAlso Read: Is Nvidia Defying US Export Controls? What\u2019s Going On?\nVestager mentioned that while secondary markets for AI chips could promote innovation and fair competition, companies with a dominant market position might face future restrictions.\n\u201cIf you have that kind of dominant position in the marketplace, there are things that you cannot do that a small company can do,\u201d she remarked, which the report highlighted.\nDemand for the H100 is so high that some customers face a six-month wait to receive it. Nvidia has since released even more advanced versions, including the H200 and Blackwell B100 and B200, which are crucial for companies in the AI race.\nNvidia stock gained over 202% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\t\t\n\n\nNVIDIA Stock Prediction 2024\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Nvidia, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For NVIDIA, the 200-day moving average sits at $72.97, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $127.21. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\nPrice Action: NVDA shares are trading lower by 0.83% at $127.21 at last check Friday.\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\n\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nRead Next:\n\nChina Files 6X More Generative AI Patents Than US Despite Nvidia Chip Export Ban: UN Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAMD NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro (AMD) Jumps 4% as Its Gaming GPUs Capture 45% Market Share in JapanTipRanks 15h \n\n\n\nSA Asks: Will Intel be broken up?Seeking Alpha 1d \n\n\n\nHow Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stayed One Step Ahead in the AI Race\u00a0TipRanks 1d \n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Ultrasound systems, CT scan systems, all kinds of instruments \u2014 they\u2019re always going to be a device, plus a whole bunch of AIs,\" Huang added. \"The value that you\u2019ll create, the opportunities you\u2019ll create are going to be incredible. So I think this is going to be one of the world\u2019s great future industries; it\u2019s going to be a technology industry, and we\u2019re here to serve you.\u201d   Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS Pandemic forced healthcare 'into the virtual' The COVID-19 pandemic laid a backdrop for companies like Nvidia to push forward and create value in the healthcare sector. \u201cI see [the pandemic] as the catapulting of healthcare into the virtual and digital transformative spheres, if you will, because it happened very quickly and with very little to no choice,\" Mutaz Shegewi, senior research director and digital strategist at IDC, told Yahoo Finance. \"Companies like Nvidia and others, Microsoft, and Oracle and whatnot, have a lot to contribute in propelling that journey forward, and that\u2019s what I think we\u2019re seeing.\u201d  Nvidia works closely with businesses like Johnson & Johnson MedTech (JNJ) and Microsoft (MSFT), and its clientele utilizes over a billion dollars in Nvidia GPU computing annually. \u201cThere's no one vendor that can do it all, and I think the ecosystem is very important in terms of wanting to leverage different strengths of the vendors that are out there,\" Shegewi added. \u201c[Nvidia] is democratizing the access, so it's both a technological play and there's a democratization of access to the tools through their software platforms and their partnerships.\u201d  Nvidia recently partnered with Hippocratic AI, a company developing generative AI healthcare agents that offer a range of services from pre-op care to assisted living care. These agents conduct conversations independent of healthcare providers \u2014 in other words, between only the AI agent and the patient. Hippocratic AI claims that \"no other technology has the potential to have this level of global impact on health.\"   Story Continues Because these agents are being designed to conduct patient interactions, their ability to emulate human tendencies is key to their success. That's where Nvidia comes in.\u201cVoice-based digital agents powered by generative AI can usher in an age of abundance in healthcare, but only if the technology responds to patients as a human would,\u201d Kimberly Powell, vice president of Healthcare at Nvidia, stated in a March press release. \u201cThis type of engagement will require continued innovation and close collaboration with companies, such as Hippocratic AI, developing cutting-edge solutions.\u201dCurrently in the midst of its \"rigorous testing program,\" Hippocratic AI has already seen the importance of minimizing latency.  Hippocratic AI is currently conducting a testing program for its generative AI agents.  The company found that each half-second increase in interference speed caused a 5%-10% increase in patients' ability to connect with the AI agents emotionally. Nvidia's technology helps them meet this need for speed, according to Hippocratic AI's co-founder and CEO Munjal Shah.\u201cWith generative AI, patient interactions can be seamless, personalized, and conversational \u2014 but in order to have the desired impact, the speed of inference has to be incredibly fast,\" Shah stated in the press release. \u201cWith the latest advances in LLM inference, speech synthesis, and voice recognition software, Nvidia\u2019s technology stack is critical to achieving this speed and fluidity. We\u2019re working with Nvidia to continue refining our technology and amplify the impact of our work of mitigating staffing shortages while enhancing access, equity, and patient outcomes.\u201dHippocratic AI declined requests from Yahoo Finance to discuss the technology further.Jennifer Eaton, the research director for value-based healthcare IT transformation strategies at IDC, told Yahoo Finance that she was impressed by the AI agent's ability to replicate a human-to-human interaction and personalize care recommendations.\"Organizations like Hippocratic AI are offering a solution that, if done correctly, can have a heavy downstream impact related to ... accessibility to a consistently accurate, positive, and personalized experience for patients,\" Eaton said. \"To me, that's really powerful.\" Nvidia, for its part, is aiming to provide the underlying computing power for what IDC's Shegewi called an \"ecosystem\" of healthcare providers creating similar services.Jeff Cribbs, vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner Healthcare, told Yahoo Finance that Nvidia's position enables the hardware juggernaut to serve the growing market of AI in healthcare.\u201cThe nice thing about Nvidia\u2019s position is that the compute and inference needs are going to be there regardless of who does the work,\" Cribbs said. \"And so their strategy is quite resilient in the sense that if we can make our inference and training as accessible as possible, it doesn't matter which one of those organizations does the building. And that is an advantage that the other sort of folks in that value chain don't have.\u201dMaya is an intern at Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock marketRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

These models often require enormous computational resources and sophisticated infrastructure to handle the vast amounts of data and complex algorithms involved. Without a structured framework, the process can become prohibitively time-consuming, costly, and complex. Enterprises struggle with managing distributed training workloads, efficient resource utilization, and model accuracy and performance. This is where the NVIDIA NeMo Framework comes into play. In this post, we present a step-by-step guide to run distributed training workloads on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster.\nNVIDIA NeMo Framework\nNVIDIA NeMo is an end-to-end cloud-centered framework for training and deploying generative AI models with billions and trillions of parameters at scale. The NVIDIA NeMo Framework provides a comprehensive set of tools, scripts, and recipes to support each stage of the LLM journey, from data preparation to training and deployment. It offers a variety of customization techniques and is optimized for at-scale inference of models for both language and image applications, using multi-GPU and multi-node configurations. NVIDIA NeMo simplifies generative AI model development, making it more cost-effective and efficient for enterprises. By providing end-to-end pipelines, advanced parallelism techniques, memory-saving strategies, and distributed checkpointing, NVIDIA NeMo makes sure AI model training is streamlined, scalable, and high-performing.\nThe following are benefits of using NVIDIA NeMo for distributed training:\n\nEnd-to-end pipelines for different stages such as data preparation, training, and more, which allows for a plug-and-play approach for your custom data\nParallelism techniques, including the following: \n         \nData parallelism\nTensor parallelism\nPipeline parallelism\nSequence parallelism\nExpert parallelism\nContext parallelism\n \nMemory saving techniques, including the following: \n         \nSelective activation recompute\nCPU offloading (activation, weights)\nAttention, including Flash Attention (FA 1/2, FA-cuDNN), Grouped Query Attention, Multi-Query Attention, and Sliding Window Attention\nDistributed optimizers, including Torch FSDP, Distributed Optimizer (zero-1)\n \nData loaders for different architectures\nDistributed checkpointing\n\nSolution overview\nYou can deploy and manage NVIDIA NeMo using either Slurm or Kubernetes orchestration platforms. Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it straightforward to run Kubernetes clusters on AWS. It manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane, and it provides compute node auto scaling and lifecycle management support to help you run highly available container applications.\nAmazon EKS is an ideal platform for running distributed training workloads due to its robust integrations with AWS services and performance features. It seamlessly integrates with Amazon FSx for Lustre, a high-throughput file system, enabling fast data access and management using persistent volume claims with the FSx CSI driver. Amazon EKS also integrates with Amazon CloudWatch for comprehensive logging and monitoring, providing insights into cluster performance and resource utilization. It supports Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for scalable and durable data storage and management, providing accessibility for large datasets. Enhanced network performance is achieved with Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), which offers low-latency, high-throughput connectivity between nodes. These features collectively make Amazon EKS a powerful and efficient choice for optimizing AI and machine learning (ML) training workflows.\nThe following diagram shows the solution architecture.\n\nIn this post, we present the steps to run distributed training workloads on an EKS cluster. The high-level steps are as follows:\n\nSet up an EFA enabled 2-node 24xlarge cluster.\nSet up an FSx for Lustre file system so you can have a shared data repository for storing training dataset and model checkpoints.\nSet up an environment for NVIDIA NeMo.\nModify the NVIDIA NeMo Kubernetes manifests to prepare a dataset and train a model.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou need to be able to launch a CPU-based Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that you\u2019ll use to create the EKS cluster. When your instance is up and running, SSH into your EC2 instance and install the following CLIs:\n\nThe latest version of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)\nkubectl\neksctl\nhelm\n\nThese steps may change if you are on a non-Linux platform. Consult the preceding documentation for installing the CLIs on other platforms accordingly. We also require that you have a capacity reservation with p4de.24xlarge instances and have the capacityReservationID.\nLaunch an EKS cluster\nECR p4de.24xlarge instances have the NVIDIA A100 80GB instances, which are highly popular for distributed training generative AI workloads. For more information, refer to Amazon EC2 Instance Types. In this section, we show how to create an EKS cluster with an On-Demand Capacity Reservation for p4de.24xlarge instances.\n\nWe provide the cluster creation config in p4de-cluster-config.yaml. See the following code:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/awsome-distributed-training.git\ncd awsome-distributed-training/3.test_cases/2.nemo-launcher/EKS\n\neksctl create cluster -f p4de-cluster-config.yaml\n\n\nThe following are key points to note when creating this cluster:\n\nMake sure the kubectl version and the specified Region are correct.\nUpdate the capacityReservationID field and make sure to specify the availabilityZones within the managedNodeGroups section, which should be the same Availability Zone ID in which your capacity lives.\nThis configuration will create two managed node groups: one for the system nodes using c5.2xlarge instances and another for running distributed training on p4de.24xlarge instances. Managed node groups will use Amazon EKS optimized AMIs. If you want to provide a custom AMI, you can create a self-managed node group and specify a custom AMI. To find the AMI ID, refer to Retrieving Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux AMI IDs. For more details about the Amazon EKS optimized AMI, see the GitHub repo.\nMake sure efaEnabled is set to true. You can use the same config for creating a cluster with other node groups. For a list of EFA supported instance types, see Supported instance types.\nAnother popular instance for generative AI distributed training workloads is the p5.48xlarge instance with the NVIDIA H100 80 GB GPU. To add a P5 node group to an existing EKS cluster, refer to AWS CLI scripts for EKS management.\n\n\nAfter the cluster is created, you can enable kubectl to communicate with your cluster by adding a new context to the kubectl config file: \n         \naws eks update-kubeconfig --region region-code --name my-cluster\n \nYou can confirm communication with your cluster by running the following command: \n         \nkubectl get svc\nNAME\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 TYPE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CLUSTER-IP\u00a0\u00a0 EXTERNAL-IP\u00a0\u00a0 PORT(S)\u00a0\u00a0 AGE\nkubernetes\u00a0\u00a0 ClusterIP\u00a0\u00a0 10.100.0.1\u00a0\u00a0 <none>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 443/TCP\u00a0\u00a0 28h\n \n\nNext, you can install the AWS EFA Kubernetes Device Plugin. EFA is a network interface for EC2 instances that enhances the performance of inter-node communications, which is critical for distributed training workloads that involve GPUs. This plugin allows Kubernetes to recognize and utilize the EFA device, facilitating high-throughput, low-latency networking necessary for efficient distributed training and deep learning applications.\n\nInstall the plugin with the following code:\n\n\nhelm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts\n\nhelm install efa eks/aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin -n kube-system\n\nThe NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes enables GPU support within your EKS cluster by exposing the GPUs to the Kubernetes API server through the kubelet. It advertises the available GPU resources, allowing Kubernetes to schedule and manage GPU-accelerated workloads.\n\nInstall the plugin with the following code: \n         \nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.14.3/nvidia-device-plugin.yml\n\nkubectl apply -f nvidia-device-plugin.yml\n \nRun the following command to verify all the pods: \n         \nkubectl get pods --all-namespaces\n \nYou can run kubectl get nodes to verify the nodes.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the EKS node viewer tool to view nodes, their costs, and their status in your cluster. After it\u2019s installed, enter eks-node-viewer to get the following view.\n\nThe node viewer displays the IP addresses of our two p4de.24xlarge compute nodes.\n\nWe can choose one of these private IP DNS names to further examine and describe the node as follows:\n\n\nkubectl describe node ip-192-168-165-37.us-west-2.compute.internal\n\nThe preceding command describes a lot of detail of the node. To make sure EFA is installed correctly, make sure you see details as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nFor p4 nodes, you will see vpc.amazonaws.com/efa:4 and for p5.48xlarge nodes, you should see vpc.amazonaws.com/efa:32.\nIf EFA is enabled in the node group, make sure that a security group is attached to the nodes that allows a rule to allow all outgoing traffic originating from the same security group. This is required for EFA to work. For instructions, see Get started with EFA and MPI. This security group is intended for testing purposes only. For your production environments, we recommend that you create an inbound SSH rule that allows traffic only from the IP address from which you are connecting, such as the IP address of your computer, or a range of IP addresses in your local network.\nCreate an FSx for Lustre file system\nFor distributed training applications, typically hundreds of GPU instances are used, with each node containing multiple GPUs. It is crucial that all nodes can access a shared file system to train on the same dataset efficiently. For this purpose, a high-performance file system with high throughput and low latency is essential. We recommend using the FSx for Lustre file system for large-scale distributed training, because it meets these requirements and provides seamless data access for all nodes involved in the training process.\nTo have a FSx for Lustre file system mounted on your EKS cluster, complete the following steps:\n\nUse the following scripts to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and attach the FSx policy: \n         \nexport FSX_POLICY_NAME=fsx-csi\n\nwget https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks/blob/main/Container-Root/eks/deployment/csi/fsx/fsx-policy.json\nexport FSX_POLICY_DOC=file://fsx-policy.json\n\n# From EC2 Auto Scaling Group\nexport EKS_INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME=(eks-1ec6fc6b-1a19-d65d-66ac-293ff0a20eb9 )\n\nPOLICY_ARN=$(aws iam create-policy --policy-name ${FSX_POLICY_NAME} --policy-document $FSX_POLICY_DOC --query \"Policy.Arn\" --output text)\n\nINSTANCE_PROFILE=$(aws iam list-instance-profiles --query InstanceProfiles[?InstanceProfileName==\"'${EKS_INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME}'\"].{InstanceProfileName:InstanceProfileName} --output text)\n\nROLE_NAME=$(aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name ${INSTANCE_PROFILE} --query InstanceProfile.Roles[0].RoleName --output text)\n\n# Attach FSx Policy to role ${ROLE_NAME} ...\"\naws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn ${POLICY_ARN} --role-name ${ROLE_NAME}\n\n \nUse the following script to create a security group that allows EKS nodes to access the file system: \n         \n# From EC2 console\nexport MY_REGION=us-west-2\n# FSX_SUBNET_ID should be same ID the compute nodes are present in. You can get this from the EKS console \nexport FSX_SUBNET_ID=subnet-0edecd850cff2cfad\n# From EC2 Auto Scaling Group\nexport FSX_SECURITY_GROUP_NAME=eks-fsx-sg\n\n# Get VPC_ID from EKS console\nexport VPC_ID=vpc-04411d49af198a6ea\n\n# Create security group\nexport SECURITY_GROUP_ID=$(aws ec2 create-security-group --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} --region ${MY_REGION} --group-name ${FSX_SECURITY_GROUP_NAME} --description \"FSx for Lustre Security Group\" --query \"GroupId\" --output text)\n\nexport SUBNET_CIDR=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets --region ${MY_REGION} --query Subnets[?SubnetId==\"'${FSX_SUBNET_ID}'\"].{CIDR:CidrBlock} --output text)\n\n# Ingress rule\naws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --region ${MY_REGION} --group-id ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} --protocol tcp --port 988 --cidr ${SUBNET_CIDR}\n\n \nCreate a 1.2 TB Persistent_2 FSx for Lustre file system from the FSx for Lustre console in the same Availability Zone as your compute instances (FSX_SUBNET_ID), VPC of Amazon EKS (VPC_ID), and the security group you created (SECURITY_GROUP_ID).\nAfter the file system is created, note the file system ID, DNS name, and mount name from the file system details page.\n\n\nBefore mounting the file system, you need to install the FSx CSI driver that allows EKS clusters to manage the lifecycle of FSx for Lustre file systems.\n\nInstall the FSx CSI driver as follows: \n         \necho \"Installing FSx CSI driver ...\"\nkubectl apply -k \"github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-fsx-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=master\"\n\necho \"FSx pods in kube-system namespace ...\"\nkubectl -n kube-system get pods | grep fsx\n\n \nNext, to mount the file system, provide scripts in the fsx-storage-class.yaml, fsx-pv.yaml and fsx-pvc.yaml files: \n         \n# Storage Class\nkubectl apply -f fsx-storage-class.yaml\nkubectl get sc\n\n# Persistent Volume\nkubectl apply -f fsx-pv.yaml\n\n# Persistent Volume Claim\nkubectl apply -f fsx-pvc.yaml\n\n \n\nYou can check to make sure that the volumes are in Bound state.\n\nSet up the environment for NVIDIA NeMo\nFor this post, we use the NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes, but if you need to install the GPU Operator, you can do so as follows:\n\nhelm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia\nhelm repo update\nhelm install --wait --generate-name -n gpu-operator --create-namespace nvidia/gpu-operator\n\n\nTo enable distributed training, we use the KubeFlow Training Operator, which is essential for managing and scheduling ML training jobs in a Kubernetes environment. This operator simplifies the process of running distributed training jobs by automating the deployment and scaling of the necessary components. See the following code:\n\n# Deploy Kubeflow training operator\n\nkubectl apply -k \"github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/manifests/overlays/standalone?ref=v1.7.0\"\n\n# From https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks/blob/main/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/training-operator/deploy.sh\n\n# Configure RBAC resources\n\nkubectl apply -f ./clusterrole-hpa-access.yaml\n\nkubectl apply -f ./clusterrolebinding-training-operator-hpa-access.yaml\n\n\nAdditionally, we use the KubeFlow MPI Operator for preprocessing training data in parallel. The MPI Operator facilitates running Message Passing Interface (MPI) jobs, which are crucial for parallelizing the preprocessing tasks across multiple nodes, thereby speeding up the training process. See the following code:\n\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/v0.4.0/deploy/v2beta1/mpi-operator.yaml\n\n# From https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks/blob/main/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/mpi-operator/clusterrole-mpi-operator.yaml\n# Add lease permissions fot mpi-operator cluster role\nkubectl apply -f ./clusterrole-mpi-operator.yaml\n\n\nThe NVIDIA NeMo Framework is available publicly in the image nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.01.framework. We provide an AWS optimized Dockerfile for use with P4 and P5 instances. We recommend the following library versions for optimal performance:\n\nENV EFA_INSTALLER_VERSION=1.30.0\nENV AWS_OFI_NCCL_VERSION=1.8.1-aws\nENV NCCL_VERSION=2.19.4-1\n\n\nYou can build and push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as follows:\n\n## AWS\nexport AWS_REGION=us-west-2\nexport ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)\n\n## Docker Image\nexport REGISTRY=${ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/\nexport IMAGE=nemo-aws\nexport TAG=\":24.01.framework\"\n\ndocker build -t ${REGISTRY}${IMAGE}${TAG} -f 0.Dockerfile .\n\necho \"Logging in to $REGISTRY ...\"\naws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $REGISTRY\n\n# Create registry if it does not exist\nREGISTRY_COUNT=$(aws ecr describe-repositories | grep ${IMAGE} | wc -l)\nif [ \"$REGISTRY_COUNT\" == \"0\" ]; then\n        echo \"\"\n        echo \"Creating repository ${IMAGE} ...\"\n        aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ${IMAGE}\nfi\n\n# Push image\ndocker image push ${REGISTRY}${IMAGE}${TAG}\n\n\nThe NVIDIA NeMo Framework requires users to provide config files with job and model information. You can copy the launcher scripts from the container as follows:\n\n# Run container\ndocker run -it ${REPOSITORY}${IMAGE}${TAG} bash\n\n# Copy files\ndocker cp -a <container-id>: /opt/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher/ <Path-to-save-launcher-scripts>\n\n\nIn a Slurm cluster implementation, the launcher scripts, data, and results folder could reside in the file system that both the head node (node from where jobs are submitted) and compute nodes access. But in this Amazon EKS implementation, the node that you used to create the EKS cluster doesn\u2019t have access to EKS file system. To get around this, you can put the launcher scripts in the head node and the results and data folder in the file system that the compute nodes have access to.\nRun NVIDIA NeMo on an EKS cluster\nWe\u2019re now ready to set up NVIDIA NeMo Kubernetes manifests for data preparation and model training. For more information about running it on premises, see Running NeMo Framework on Kubernetes. There are some modifications to be done for it to run on Amazon EKS, as shown in the following steps. We provide the launcher scripts in the GitHub repo.\n\nModify the launcher_scripts/conf/cluster/k8s.yaml file as follows. The subPath field is the path where FSx for Lustre is mounted, which is /fsx-shared in this case. \n         \nshm_size: 512Gi  # Amount of system memory to allocate in Pods. Should end in \"Gi\" for gigabytes.\nvolumes:\n  persistentVolumeClaim:\n    # This claim should be created before running\n    claimName: fsx-pvc\n    subPath: fsx-shared  # path is mirrored into pod (no leading slash b/c relative to root)\n\n# NOTE: These args will soon be deprecated\nnfs_server: null  # Hostname or IP address for the NFS server where data is stored.\nnfs_path: null  # Path to store data in the NFS server.\nib_resource_name: null  # Specify the resource name for IB devices according to kubernetes, such as \"nvidia.com/hostdev\" for Mellanox IB adapters. Can also be a list, but must be same length as ib_count\nib_count: null  # Specify the number of IB devices to include per node in each pod. Can also be a list, but must be same length as ib_resource_name\nib_network_annotation: \"\"  # Specify the networks as comma separated values\ndns_policy: null  # Specify a dnsPolicy to use in all pods, if necessary\n\n \nInstall the required Python packages; this is required so that NeMo Launcher can submit jobs to the Kubernetes cluster:\n\n\nsudo apt install python3-pip\n\npip install -r <Path-to- NeMo-Megatron-Launcher>/requirements.txt\n\nNext, we copy the following folders from the container to the /fsx-shared/data folder:\n\nNeMo-Megatron-Launcher/launcher_scripts/data/bpe\nNeMo-Megatron-Launcher/launcher_scripts/data/nsfw\n\n\nTo copy files from EKS pods, you can start a pod just for this purpose. Create a file fsx-share-test.yaml as follows: \n         \napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: fsx-share-test\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: fsx-share-test\n    image: ubuntu\n    command: [\"/bin/bash\"]\n    args: [\"-c\", \"while true; do echo  \\\"hello from FSx\\\" - $(date -u) >> /fsx-shared/test.txt; sleep 120; done\"]\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: fsx-pv\n      mountPath: /fsx-shared\n  volumes:\n  - name: fsx-pv\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: fsx-pvc\n\n \nRun this pod and copy the files: \n         \nkubectl apply -f fsx-share-test.yaml\n\nkubectl cp <Path-to- NeMo-Megatron-Launcher>/launcher_scripts/data/bpe fsx-share-test: /fsx-shared/data/\n\nkubectl cp <Path-to- NeMo-Megatron-Launcher>/launcher_scripts/data/nsfw fsx-share-test: /fsx-shared/data/\n\n \n\nA few files need to be updated for data preparation for it to work with the EKS cluster.\n\nModify the launcher_scripts/conf/config.yaml file: \n         \nFor cluster, use k8s.\nFor training, use gpt3/126m.\nFor stages, this should be just data_preparation and no other stages.\nFor launcher_scripts_path, use the path to the NeMo Megatron launch scripts, which should end with /launcher_scripts.\nFor data_dir, use /fsx-shared/data (the location to store and read the data).\nFor base_results_dir, use /fsx-shared/results (the location to store the results, checkpoints, and logs).\nFor container, use ${REPOSITORY}${IMAGE}${TAG}\n \nModify the conf/data_preparation/gpt3/download_gpt3_pile.yaml file: \n         \nSet node_array_size to 2.\nSet file_numbers to \u201c0-5\u201d. With five files, it should be around 350 GB of data\n \nModify the nemo_launcher/core/k8s_templates/data_preparation/data-prep.yaml file: \n         \nIf you get the error that mpirun is not found, add the full path to the executable /opt/amazon/openmpi/bin/mpirun.\nAdd /fsx-shared in the container volume mount path.\nAdd the volume:\n \n\n\nvolumes:\n          - name: fsx-pv\n            persistentVolumeClaim:\n              claimName: fsx-pvc\n\n\n\nLaunch the data preparation job: python3 main.py\n\nThis script creates a Helm chart for the selected stage (in this case, data_preparation) and runs the Helm chart automatically. Refer to Run NeMo Framework on Kubernetes for an explanation of the data preparation process. Make sure python3 is installed.\n\nYou can monitor your job status and logs using three commands: helm list, kubectl get pods, and kubectl logs --follow). \nWhen the job is finished, you can remove the Helm chart: helm uninstall download-gpt3-pile\n\nYou can see the downloaded the data in the /fsx-shared folder by running in one of the pods as kubectl exec -it nlp-worker-0 bash.\n\nTraining\nNow that our data preparation is complete, we\u2019re ready to train our model with the created dataset. Complete the following steps:\n\nModify a parameter in the conf/config.yaml file: \n         \nSet stages to training and no other stages.\n \nModify parameters in conf/training/gpt3/126m.yaml: \n         \nSet num_nodes to 2.\nSet devices to 1.\nOn line 18, change use_distributed_sampler: False to replace_sampler_ddp: False.\n \n\nOptionally, if you want to use a mock dataset instead of real dataset for testing purposes, you can modify the data section as follows. You are essentially changing data_impl: mmap to data_impl: mock and assigning an empty list to data_prefix.\n\ndata:\n  data_impl: mock\n  splits_string: \"99990,8,2\"\n  seq_length: 2048\n  skip_warmup: True\n  num_workers: 2\n  dataloader_type: single # cyclic\n  reset_position_ids: False # Reset position ids after end-of-document token\n  reset_attention_mask: False # Reset attention mask after end-of-document token\n  eod_mask_loss: False # Mask loss for the end of document tokens\n  index_mapping_dir: null\n  data_prefix: [] # Should be weight path weight path... for a blended dataset\n\n# You can just comment the default \u201cdata_prefix\u201d values like below.\n# - ${data_dir}/my-gpt3_00_text_document\n# - .0333\n\n\n\nModify the parameters in the nemo_launcher/core/k8s_templates/training/training.yaml file:\nRun python3 main.py to start training and you should see the training pods by running kubectl get pods as follows: \n         \nNAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nnlp-training-worker-0   1/1     Running   0          168m\nnlp-training-worker-1   1/1     Running   0          168m\n\n \n\nIn addition to monitoring your job using helm list, kubectl get pods, and kubectl logs \u2013follow, you can also SSH into your pod with kubectl exec and use nvidia-smi to check GPU status.\n\nWhen the job is finished, you can delete the helm chart: helm uninstall gpt3-126m\n\nModel checkpoints are saved at /fsx-shared/results/checkpoints along with other training logs and TensorBoard events. By default, checkpoints are saved at every 2,000 steps. You can modify the conf/training/gpt3/126m.yaml file to make changes in the training setup.\nTroubleshooting deployment failures\nIf deployment fails due to incorrect setup or configuration, complete the following debug steps:\n\nFind the error message by running kubectl logs --follow PODNAME and kubectl describe pod PODNAME.\nStop any running jobs by removing the Helm chart. This can be done by running helm uninstall CHARTNAME.\n\nPods should be spun down after removing the Helm chart.\n\nYou can double-check by running kubectl get pods.\nIf pods are not spun down, you can manually stop them by running kubectl delete PODNAME.\n\nBased on the error message, you may find errors from:\n\nUnready nodes.\nMissing Operators or CRDs. In this case, make sure your kubectl get pods -A output looks like that shown earlier. If errors exist, try reinstalling Operators and CRDs.\nNeMo Framework scripts or Kubernetes manifests. This is more likely a bug or wrong setup on the NeMo side. Errors can vary.\n\nClean up\nIt\u2019s important to spin down resources after model training in order to avoid costs associated with running idle instances. To clean up our setup, we must delete the FSx for Lustre file system before deleting the cluster because it\u2019s associated with a subnet in the cluster\u2019s VPC.\n\nTo delete the file system integration with the EKS cluster, run the following command: \n         \nkubectl delete -f ./fsx-storage-class.yaml\n \n\nNot only will this delete the persistent volume, it will also delete the EFS file system and all the data on the file system will be lost.\n\nWhen Step 1 is complete, delete the cluster by using the following script: \n         \neksctl delete cluster -f p4de-cluster-config.yaml\n \n\nThis will delete all the existing pods, remove the cluster, and delete the VPC you created in the beginning.\nConclusion\nIn this post, we demonstrated how to train generative AI models at scale using the NeMo Framework within an EKS cluster. We covered the challenges of training LLMs and how NeMo\u2019s comprehensive tools and optimizations address these challenges, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. With NeMo, you can manage and scale distributed training workloads effectively. This post works with P4de instances. Another popular instance for generative AI distributed training workloads is the p5.48xlarge instance with the NVIDIA H100 80 GB GPU. To add a P5 node group to an existing EKS cluster, refer to AWS CLI scripts for EKS management.\nTo help you get started, we have published a GitHub repository that provides step-by-step instructions for creating an EKS cluster with P4de instances, mounting an FSx for Lustre file system, and running distributed training workloads with NeMo. This guide empowers you to harness the full potential of NeMo and Amazon EKS for your AI model training needs.\n\nAbout the authors\nAnkur Srivastava\u00a0is a Sr. Solutions Architect in the ML Frameworks Team.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade. What Happened: James Anderson, an early investor in companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), expressed his bullish outlook on Nvidia\u2019s future potential, reported the Financial Times on Sunday. He suggested that the chipmaker\u2019s market cap could potentially surpass the combined value of the current S&P 500.  Don't Miss: America's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.  Anderson\u2019s optimism stems from Nvidia\u2019s role in the burgeoning demand for AI chips, which are crucial for training and running advanced generative AI models. This demand has propelled Nvidia\u2019s shares to soar by 168% since the beginning of the year, pushing its market value above $3 trillion. \"The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions. This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" Anderson said. For context, Anderson\u2019s prediction of Nvidia hitting $50 trillion market capitalization would be nearly twice as much as the U.S.\u2019s current gross domestic product (GDP), which stands at $27.36 trillion, or nearly thrice as much as China\u2019s GDP of $17.79 trillion, according to data from the World Bank.  Despite this remarkable growth, Anderson views Nvidia\u2019s potential as even greater, provided that artificial intelligence continues to deliver for customers and Nvidia maintains its lead in the industry. See Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Anderson, who now runs a $650 million fund at Lingotto Investment Management, believes that Nvidia\u2019s \u201cpersistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\u201d He also acknowledged that the path to this potential valuation would be volatile, with possible drawdowns of 35-40%. However, he expressed confidence in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stating that the company is at the forefront of solving serious problems in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and drug discovery.   Story Continues Anderson projected that the actual growth in demand for data center AI chips was currently around 60% annually. Looking forward over the next decade, he estimated that sustained 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, could lead to earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 per share.Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.Assuming a 5% free cash flow yield, this analysis suggests that Nvidia shares could potentially be valued at $20,000 in 10 years, implying a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned a probability of 10-15% to achieve this scenario, according to the report.Why It Matters: The prediction from Anderson comes amid a broader context of excitement and caution in the market. The U.S. stock market has experienced a significant rally, largely driven by the promise of AI. This surge has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with the S&P 500 index hitting new highs and the Nasdaq Composite index rising by 70% since the end of 2022.See Also: This Income Stock Has Outperformed The S&P 500 For Over A DecadeHowever, not everyone is optimistic. Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, has pointed out \u201cwarning flags\u201d in the market, suggesting that Nvidia might be in \u201cbubble-ish territory\u201d and hinting at a potential market pullback.Even Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has acknowledged Nvidia\u2019s exceptional performance but forecasts \u201cshort-term indigestion\u201d for the company\u2019s business as customers reassess their AI strategies.Despite these concerns, some analysts remain bullish. Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, has a price target of $200 on Nvidia stock, citing the company\u2019s pivotal role in the AI space.Anderson gained prominence during his nearly four-decade tenure at Baillie Gifford. He oversaw its flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which initially invested in Nvidia in 2016. His leadership played a pivotal role in transforming the Edinburgh-based private partnership into an unexpected standout in the tech investment sector.Read Next:Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead. \"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP originally appeared on Benzinga.com\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Indeed, the HBM3 chips have been approved by Nvidia for use in its processors for the first time ever.\nFor now, the chips will be used within Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing unit (GPU), specifically its Chinese-market data center GPU called the H20. Interesting, the H20 has been developed specifically for China, while \u201cin compliance with U.S. export controls.\u201d\nIt was previously unclear whether Nvidia would end up using Samsung\u2019s HBM3 chips in its other artificial intelligence (AI) centric processors, or if there are additional protocols necessary for that to happen.\nSamsung\u2019s HBM3 chips have gained approval at a good time for the industry. Indeed, Nvidia and other chipmakers have struggled to keep up with the surging demand for generative AI-optimized GPUs.\nAlong with Samsung, there are actually only two other primary producers of HBM \u2014 SK Hynix and Micron (NASDAQ:MU). With limited inventory of HBM3 in circulation, Nvidia would like Samsung to quickly \u201cclear its standards so that it can diversify its supplier base.\u201d\nNvidia is in some sense positioning itself to compete with Sk Hynix, the lead producer of HBM3. In fact, SK Hynix is already working to increase its production of denser, more advanced HBM3E memory and taper off its production of HBM3.\nThere is some speculation that Samsung could begin supplying Nvidia with its HBM3 as early as next month. \nWhat Does This Mean for NVDA Stock?\nNVDA stock is in the red today after a fairly disappointing series of Big Tech earnings. Indeed, both Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are the culprits behind today\u2019s downswing after they each failed to impress investors with their respective second-quarter earnings results.\nStill, Nvidia remains king of Wall Street. The stock is up more than 135% year-to-date as one of the biggest winners of the AI craze this year. Analyst upgrades on NVDA stock continue to pile up as the chipmaker positions itself for a big close to the year.\nInvestors are currently eagerly awaiting Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report, which is estimated to arrive on Aug. 28.\nOn the date of publication, Shrey Dua held LONG positions in NVDA and GOOG.

Indeed, a new congressional trading form filed by the congresswoman shows she purchased shares in two chipmakers last month, including the likes of Nvidia and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nPelosi purchased 10,000 shares of Nvidia, worth between $1 million and $5 million. At the same time, the California representative purchased 20 call options with an $800 strike price on Broadcom, which expire on June 20, 2025. The value of this stake is estimated between $1 million and $5 million.\nPelosi also sold some stocks. Indeed, the form shows Pelosi dumped about 2,500 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), worth between $250,000 and $500,000. In addition, Pelosi sold 2,000 shares of Visa (NYSE:V), worth between $500,000 and $1 million. \nPelosi Earns Millions From NVDA Stock\nPelosi\u2019s picks shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise to those keeping track. \nThis isn\u2019t the first time Pelosi has invested in Nvidia. She is rather well-known for profiting big from Nvidia in the past. Over the years, Pelosi has repeatedly invested in the semiconductor giant. As of May, Pelosi and her investor husband have profited almost $4 million from Nvidia call options.\nReasonably so, Nvidia is one of the biggest winners in the stock market this year. The chipmaker has passed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. NVDA stock is up 154% this year on outstanding earnings numbers.\nBroadcom is also performing excellent this year, in the green 52% year-to-date.\nIt hasn\u2019t been all peaches and cream for Pelosi however. The congresswoman has faced criticism for allegedly profiting off potential inside information that presents itself due to the nature of her high-profile position. Specifically, the former House Speaker traded Nvidia shares while the CHIPS and Science Act was in the middle of discussion on the house floor.\nStill, Pelosi has never been formally reprimanded for her or her husband\u2019s investments and remains one of the most profitable public elected officials on record regarding stock trading.\nOn the date of publication, Shrey Dua held a LONG position in NVDA.

Nancy Pelosi made several notable stock trades during July 2024.\nPelosi purchased more shares of Nvidia (NVDA) as the tech leader trended downward.\nThe former House Speaker also offloaded shares of multiple other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSource:  DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nDoes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have a significant catalyst approaching? Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) seems to think so. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives recently doubled down on NVDA stock. According to data from Quiver Quantitative, she purchased 10,000 shares on July 26 totaling a value ranging between $1 million and $5 million.\nWell-known for her trading habits, Pelosi appears to be bullish on artificial intelligence (AI), but only on some companies in the space. She also recently offloaded some of her Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) holdings as the company faces cloud computing challenges and high trading volatility.\nPelosi Is Betting Big on NVDA Stock\nThe former House Speaker is such a prolific investor that \u201cNancy Pelosi stocks\u201d has become its own category among news outlets. Most recently, Pelosi has been focused on AI.\nEarlier this summer, Pelosi increased her NVDA stock holdings while also purchasing Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Specifically, she bought \u201c20 call options with a strike price of $800 that expire on June 20, 2025.\u201d Around the same time, Pelosi offloaded 2,500 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock as well.\nAfter several days of struggling, NVDA stock is back in the green today. This is most likely due more to positive market momentum than news of Pelosi\u2019s trade. But that doesn\u2019t mean investors should disregard this development.\nPelosi isn\u2019t the only politician who has bought Nvidia this month, either. Quiver Quantitative\u2019s dashboard also shows that Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Morgan McGarvey (D-KY) have purchased shares in July 2024.\nAccording to Quiver Quantitative, Pelosi has made 170 trades to date with 65% of her activity centering around the information technology sector. While she has been active in the market since 1987, she did more trading in 2021 than in any other recent year. The platform estimates that NVDA stock comprises only 2% of her portfolio, despite multiple purchases. \nWhy It Matters\nNVDA stock has certainly struggled lately, falling 5% over the past month. But Pelosi doesn\u2019t seem at all deterred by this, clearly seeing Nvidia\u2019s declines as an opportunity to acquire discounted shares before they rise again. Many financial experts share this perspective. Out of 41 Wall Street analysts on TipRanks, 37 rate NVDA as a buy.\nThere\u2019s plenty of reason for this type of optimism, too. As InvestorPlace contributor Dmytro Spilka notes:\n\n\u201cNvidia has retained a close focus on machine learning and, in particular, its deep learning subset. The firm has developed\u00a0its own AI platform\u00a0for developers with GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks to help create digital neural networks for businesses without prior GPU programming.\u201d\n\nAll this suggests that Nvidia is already back on track toward growth after a temporary downturn. Pelosi and other politicians have only made it clear that they believe NVDA stock has significant growth potential.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient\u00a0held a LONG position in NVDA.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\nSamuel O\u2019Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

While screens have become bigger and support higher resolutions, nearly all video is only 1080p quality or lower.\nUpscalers can help sharpen streamed video and, powered by AI on the NVIDIA RTX platform, significantly enhance image quality and detail.\nWhat Is an Upscaler?\nThe larger file size of videos makes it harder to compress and transmit compared to images or text. Platforms like Netflix, Vimeo and YouTube work around this limitation by encoding video \u2014 the process of compressing the raw source of a video into a smaller container format.\nThe encoder first analyzes the video to decide what information it can remove to make it fit a target resolution and frame rate. If the target bitrate is insufficient, the video quality decreases, resulting in a loss of detail and sharpness and the presence of encoding artifacts. The smaller the file, the easier it is to share on the internet \u2014 but the worse it looks.\nTypically, software on the viewer\u2019s device will upscale the video file to fit the display\u2019s native resolution. However, these upscalers are fairly simplistic, merely multiplying pixels to meet the desired resolution. They can help sharpen the outlines of objects and scenes, but the final video typically carries encoding artifacts and sometimes looks over-sharpened and unnatural.\nAI Know a Better Way\nThe NVIDIA RTX platform uses AI to easily de-artifact and upscale videos.\nEasily de-artifact and upscale videos with RTX.\nThe process of AI upscaling involves analyzing images and motion vectors to generate new details not present in the original video. Instead of merely multiplying pixels, it recognizes the patterns of the image and enhances them to provide greater detail and video quality.\nImages must be first de-artifacted before any processing begins. Artifacts \u2014 or unwanted distortions and anomalies that appear in video and image files \u2014 occur due to overcompression or data loss during transmission and storage.\nNVIDIA AI networks can de-artifact images, helping remove blocky areas sometimes seen in streamed video. Without this first step, AI upscalers might end up enhancing the artifacted image itself instead of the desired content.\nSuper-Sized Video\nJust like putting on a pair of prescription glasses can instantly snap the world into focus, RTX Video Super Resolution, one of NVIDIA\u2019s latest innovations in AI-enhanced video technology, gives users a clearer picture into the world of streamed video.\nClick the image to see the differences between bicubic upscaling (left) and RTX Video Super Resolution (right).\nAvailable on GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPUs and RTX professional GPUs, it uses AI running on dedicated Tensor Cores to remove block compression artifacts and upscale lower-resolution content up to 4K, matching the user\u2019s native display resolution.\nRTX Video Super Resolution can be used to enhance all video watched on browsers. By combining de-artifacting with AI upscaling techniques, it can make even low-bitrate Twitch streams look stunningly clear. RTX Video Super Resolution is also supported in popular video apps like VLC so users can apply the same upscaling process to their offline videos.\nCreators can soon use RTX Video Super Resolution in editing apps like Black Magic\u2019s Davinci Resolve, making it easier than ever to upscale lower-quality video files to 4K resolution, as well as convert standard-dynamic range source files into high-dynamic range (HDR).\nSay Hi to High-Dynamic Range\nRTX Video now also supports AI HDR. HDR video supports a wider range of colors, lending greater detail especially to the darker and lighter areas of images. The problem is that there isn\u2019t that much HDR content online yet.\n\nEnter RTX Video HDR \u2014 by simply turning on the feature, the AI network will turn any standard or low-dynamic-range content into HDR, performing the correct tone mapping so the image still looks natural and retains its original colors.\nAI Across the Board\nRTX Video is just the latest implementation of AI upscaling powered by NVIDIA RTX.\nMembers of the GeForce NOW cloud streaming service can play their favorite PC games on nearly any device. GeForce RTX servers located all over the world first render the game video content, encode it and then stream it to the player\u2019s local device \u2014 just like streaming video from other content providers.\nMembers on older NVIDIA GPU-powered devices can still use AI-enhanced upscaling to improve gameplay quality. This means they can enjoy the best of both worlds \u2014 gameplay rendered on servers powered by RTX 4080-class GPUs in the cloud and AI-enhanced streaming quality. Get more information on enabling AI-enhanced upscaling on GeForce NOW.\nThe NVIDIA SHIELD TV takes this one step further, processing AI neural networks directly on its NVIDIA Tegra system-on-a-chip to upscale 1080p-quality or lower content from nearly any streaming platform to a display\u2019s native resolution. That means users can improve the video quality of content streamed from Netflix, Prime Video, Max, Disney+ and more at the push of a remote button.\n\nSHIELD TV is currently available for up to $30 off in North America and \u00a330 or 35\u20ac off in Europe as part of Amazon\u2019s Prime Day event running July 16-17. For Prime members in Europe, eligible SHIELD TV purchases also include one month of the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership for free, enabling GeForce RTX 4080-class PC gameplay streamed directly to the living room.\n\nAI has enabled unprecedented improvements in video quality, helping set a new standard in streaming experiences.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

Trump comments hurt chip stocks.  Little tech advances and big tech drops.  Illustration by TradingViewTrump comments on potential tougher stance against Taiwan spooks investors, causing a massive stampede out of megacap tech and chip shares. Nvidia NVDA is turning into a rollercoaster stock getting notorious for outsize swings and whipsaw trading. The chip maker plunged 6.7% on Wednesday after jittery traders reeled out of the semiconductor sector on comments by Donald Trump who said that Taiwan \u2014 the world\u2019s leading spot for chip manufacturing \u2014 should pay for its own defense. In addition, the Biden administration vowed to pursue new US export restrictions to China.  The stampede out of Nvidia erased more than $200 billion from its market cap, reminding investors just how dangerously volatile this beast of a public company is. Not long ago \u2014 at the end of June \u2014 Nvidia rattled markets with more than $500 billion washed out in a three-session stretch. Despite Wednesday\u2019s slide showing how overstretched the rally is, shares of Nvidia are riding on nearly 150% in gains since the start of the year.  Outside the chip realm, Nvidia has been caught in a wider selloff that\u2019s gripped the megacap tech sector. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks washed out about $500 billion in yesterday\u2019s dump. Last Wednesday, the same elite club took a big hit that knocked \u200b\u200bmore than $600 billion of their overall valuation. The rotation out of big tech stocks and into smaller \u2014 should we say little tech? \u2014 companies has been a painful one.

These GPUs are used extensively in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing, especially in the data centers. Moore estimates sales of both products will remain solid in both Taiwan and China.\nMoore raised his price target to $144 per share from $116 while maintaining an \u201coverweight\u201d rating. This represents roughly 16% upside from NVDA stock\u2019s current $124 price tag.\nMoore also raised its earning expectations for the company, estimating Nvidia will earn $3.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.53 per share on an adjusted basis.

In contrast, we propose the company\u2019s best-in-class artificial intelligence compatible processors demonstrate Nvidia\u2019s value. It\u2019s the products \u2014 not the perceptions \u2014 that define the company, so we\u2019re assigning Nvidia stock\u00a0a highly confident \u201cA\u201d grade today.\nThe demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI-ready chips is strong and constant. Even the skeptics can\u2019t deny this. Worry warts always find excuses to panic-sell. It\u2019s unfortunate, but don\u2019t let the doubters affect your perception of Nvidia\u2019s value to shareholders.\nNvidia Stock Pulls Back a Little Bit. Are You Worried?\nThe critics will pounce on any opportunity to scare people, it seems. Nvidia stock pulled back from $140 not long ago, and the skeptics are suddenly coming out of the woodwork.\nWe\u2019re seeing stories about finding an \u201cantidote to\u201d Nvidia (as if the company is poisonous) and the \u201cNvidia spell\u201d being \u201cbroken.\u201d One commentator declared that \u201cNvidia has had a whiplash-inducing few months.\u201d\nCertainly not. Nvidia stock went up consistently from mid-April to mid-June. Then it pulled back a little bit. This is normal. It\u2019s not unusual for institutional investors to take profits after a big rally.\nSensible investors should actually be encouraged when they witness the critics come out of hiding. They should be glad to hear the calls for a \u201ctech reckoning.\u201d \nThey ought to celebrate when they see Interactive Brokers strategist Steve Sosnick\u2019s arguing, \u201cJust because the risks have proved unfounded before doesn\u2019t mean that they have disappeared.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a pretty good summation of the bears\u2019 argument against Nvidia now. They were wrong about Nvidia\u2019s perceived risks in the past, and they probably lost money, but maybe their perma-pessimism be vindicated at some point.\nConveniently Disregarding Nvidia\u2019s Growth\nLet\u2019s get back to reality for a moment. Nvidia enacted a 10-for-1 forward share split, making the company\u2019s stock more affordable. Furthermore, Nvidia increased its dividend distributions by 150%.\nThose are positive signs for the company. Most importantly, the demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI-compatible products is intense. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia\u2019s Data Center segment revenue grew by a jaw-dropping 427% year over year.\nGiven this growth rate, one might reasonably wonder whether Nvidia\u00a0stock might actually return to its pre-split price of around $1,200. We shouldn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves, as the stock still needs to return to its prior peak of around $140.\nStill, very long-term Nvidia investors can have big goals and, in the meantime, reinvest their dividend distributions. Along the way, there will be commentators seeking to plant doubts in your mind.\nFor instance, Bokeh Capital Partners founder Kim Forrest posited, \u201c[M]aybe some chip designer will come up with an even better way to be useful in the AI ecosystem.\u201d \nSure, that\u2019s possible. We could brainstorm and come up with hypothetical \u201cmaybe\u201d scenarios all day long. Does this actually add up to a compelling bearish argument against Nvidia stock, though?\nNvidia Stock: Don\u2019t Fight the Facts\nThere\u2019s an old saying: Don\u2019t fight the tape. To that, we\u2019d like to suggest another principle: Don\u2019t fight the facts. Nvidia is, in fact, a fast-growing, dividend-paying company with top-quality, in-demand products.\nConsequently, Nvidia stock truly is a gift that keeps on giving despite the critics\u2019 constant objections.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 0.5% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 1.3%, as investors awaited key earnings from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and AMD (AMD). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%.  Stocks are in the midst of a potentially momentous week featuring the Fed's interest-rate decision, the July jobs report, and results from four of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps. All will be crucial for investors wondering whether the recent stock pullback is over, as they weigh expectations for rate cuts against concerns that Big Tech names have lost their AI-driven mojo. Semiconductor stocks lagged on Tuesday, with shares of Nvidia dropping 7% at the closing bell. Eyes are now on Microsoft's quarterly report due after trading ends, which will set the stage for results from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) in the following days. Wall Street is watching closely for any sign that massive AI investments are starting to pay off. That question is in focus after July's volatile ride for stocks underlined the risks of the AI trade, as investors rotated out of Big Tech and into small caps. Coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX) will report after the market close, as will chip giant AMD.  Despite the AI jitters, a notable theme has emerged this earnings season \u2014 a willingness by investors to support companies that post weak results but outline a turn in their business coming soon.

Policymakers are expected to bring no change in borrowing costs on Wednesday, but to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. After encouraging June inflation data, the market debate now centers on the timing and number of cuts this year.  LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 11 updates   Wed, July 31, 2024 at 4:02 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks lose ground ahead of Fed policy decision and Big Tech earnings  Just ahead of a pivotal Fed policy meeting and a clutch of Big Tech quarterly reports, US stocks fell, dragged by a drop of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA).The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.5% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 1.3%, as investors awaited key earnings from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and AMD (AMD). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%.  Wed, July 31, 2024 at 3:30 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  All eyes on the Fed The big day is almost here, or at least the big day before the big day.Wednesday's Fed policy meeting may be the last huddle before officials decide to lower interest rates. But like in meetings past, nuanced comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely only signal where things are headed rather than offer a direct roadmap.The stakes are high for Fed officials, who now must consider both sides of their dual mandate.\"The Fed is playing a balancing act: perfectly time rate cuts to cultivate a soft landing without reigniting inflation pressures,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Indeed, the uncertainty around the last mile of progress for stubborn and sticky inflation undoubtedly complicates the Fed\u2019s decision making.\"Policymakers are expected to keep rates unchanged at the end of their July meeting, but Wednesday's message is likely to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. After encouraging June inflation data, the market debate now centers on the timing and number of cuts this year.  Wed, July 31, 2024 at 3:00 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Meta to report earnings with ad sales, AI spending top of mind Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (META) reports its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, and the company\u2019s AI spending and advertising business performance are set to take center stage.AI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech\u2019s investments in the technology, reports Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley. During its prior quarter, Meta CFO Susan Li raised the company\u2019s full-year total expense estimate from between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion.While Meta\u2019s advertising revenue looks set for strong performance, that doesn\u2019t mean that every aspect of the company\u2019s earnings report will be positive. Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer tech companies will need to plow money into AI before they see some kind of revenue payoff.Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta\u2019s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What\u2019s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.   Wed, July 31, 2024 at 2:24 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Meta to pay $1.4B settlement with Texas in facial recognition lawsuit  Meta has agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle a lawsuit with Texas over allegations that the company violated state law by using the biometric data of its users without their consent.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the settlement is the largest secured by a single state. And it follows an agreement in 2021, when the company previously known as Facebook paid $650 million over similar allegations in Illinois.Meta said in a statement: \u201cWe are pleased to resolve this matter, and look forward to exploring future opportunities to deepen our business investments in Texas, including potentially developing data centers.\u201dThe lawsuit stemmed from Facebook's face recognition system, which previously had a default setting that would recognize users, but was later changed to ask people if they wanted to use the feature.Shares of Meta fell less than 1% Tuesday amid a broader pullback among technology stocks. The company is set to report earnings on Wednesday.  Wed, July 31, 2024 at 1:30 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks trending in afternoon trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Tuesday.Nvidia (NVDA): The AI darling dragged down semiconductor stocks and led the losses in the tech sector as shares sank as 6% Tuesday afternoon.

Wed, July 31, 2024 at 12:45 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks sink in afternoon trading  The tech slump continued into the afternoon session Tuesday as many of the biggest players lost ground and dragged the rest of the market with them.Ahead of Big Tech earnings this week and a pivotal Fed policy meeting that will conclude on Wednesday, two major gauges were in the red.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), with less exposure to the tech downers, rose about 0.3%.   Wed, July 31, 2024 at 12:00 AM GMT+8 Ines Ferr\u00e9  The US national debt just surpassed another milestone: $35 trillion Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: The US national debt topped a psychologically important milestone of $35 trillion in recent days and has risen by $1 trillion since January \u2014 mounting by nearly $5 billion every day so far in 2025.This latest barrier was formally pierced last Friday. That's when a daily Treasury Department tabulation, which was then compiled and released late Monday, showed a gross debt level of $35.001278 trillion.\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk noted in a post on X in one quick response to the news.America\u2019s red ink has now jumped by more than 75% during the Trump and Biden administrations, and yet the issue has been relegated to the back burner during the 2024 campaign season.Read more here.

And it might not even be the biggest part.\u00a0\nCertainly, its chips are far more powerful than anything Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have produced so far. With each new iteration, Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) build on and significantly advance the capabilities of the previous generation.\nIt has powered Nvidia\u2019s stock to new heights. Shares have tripled over the past year, grown nearly sixfold over the last three years and NVDA stock stands more than 3,200% above where it was five years ago. Yet compute power can\u2019t fully explain the chipmaker\u2019s dominance.\u00a0\nThe High Cost of Technological Superiority \nNvidia\u2019s newest Grace Blackwell Superchips are pricey. While the entry level GB100 version will cost an estimated $35,000 to $40,000 each, the premium GB200 model will go for as much as $70,000 each.\u00a0\nTo put that in perspective, a Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) rack-scale AI server will come with a whopping 72 Blackwell superchips embedded in them. That means a single server could have as much as $5 million worth of Nvidia chips inside. According to Institutional Real Estate, the average full-scale data center has around 100,000 servers running.\nIt is clear Nvidia\u2019s technology will be cost prohibitive for all but the biggest hyperscalers, which is why there is room for the lower-priced offerings for AMD and Intel. Yet many will consider paying the price because of the real secret behind Nvidia\u2019s offerings: its CUDA software platform.\nThe Secret Sauce to Nvidia\u2019s Dominance\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a programming language that allows developers to write applications for GPUs. Because of its seamless integration with Nvidia\u2019s chips, it allowed engineers and scientists to program its GPUs \u201cto solve mathematically-intensive problems that were previously cost prohibitive.\u201d\nToday, CUDA runs on all of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and has evolved into hundreds of software libraries, software development kits (SDK) and application programming interfaces (API). The software stack makes it easy to handle the intensive workloads demanded by AI, large language model training and inference, data analytics and scientific computing.\nThere is no comparable offering by any other chipmaker, though Advanced Micro Devices comes closest with its ROCm platform. In fact, AMD realizes that if it wants to truly compete against Nvidia and gain a significant share of the chip market, it will need to further advance its software stack to make it as seamless as CUDA.\nStanding on the Shoulders of Giants\nIt is why Nvidia is the dominant player in the space. Its chips are without question technological marvels but without CUDA backing them, low-cost players like AMD and Intel would be able to easily strip share away.\u00a0\nEach new chip advances their capabilities. The A100 was originally the workhorse of rendering sophisticated 3D graphics in games and even was used for mining Bitcoin (BTC-USD) because it was so powerful. It quickly became apparent those qualities also made it perfect for processing the complex algorithms artificial intelligence demanded.\u00a0\nAs AI exploded, the A100 was soon followed by the H100 chip, which was packed with 80 billion transistors. Nvidia described the H100 as delivering \u201cup to 9x faster AI training and up to 30x faster AI inference speedups on large language models\u201d than its predecessor.\u00a0\nThe H200 was an incremental improvement on the H100 but offered twice the memory capacity and doubled its inference performance. It also accelerated data transfer rates and reduced bottlenecks in complex computations.\nNvidia\u2019s Grace Blackwell Superchips go even further. They allow organizations to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25 times lower cost and energy consumption. And where the H100 had 80 billion transistors, the Blackwell architecture crams in 208 billion transistors.\nThe Superchip will support double the compute and model sizes and its next generation NVLink offers high-speed communication between as many as 576 GPUs.\nLong Live the King\nThere is simply no reason for Nvidia to lose its market dominance in AI. The real factor that will determine just how far Nvidia and Nvidia stock can go will be whether the market can afford these technological advances.\nAs I said, there is room for competitors to move in and AMD has the best shot at doing so. But it will need to confront head on Nvidia\u2019s secret weapon. That may be harder than making more advanced AI chips.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That said, as many investors are well aware, NVDA stock is about 20% below its recent all-time high. Some of this pullback is due to concern around the company\u2019s valuation and its forward growth prospects. However, an analyst from Raymond James just put forward another reason for caution around the mega-cap chip giant.\nRaymond James\u2019 Javed Mirza said in a note to clients that he believes a \u201cmechanical sell signal\u201d has been breached for NVDA stock. This signal is based on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, that uses price trends to suggest entry and exit points.\nConcerns Swirl Around NVDA Stock Technical Indicators\nNow, many buy-and-hold investors may not be familiar with technical indicators, as they often choose to focus on fundamentals and current events. \nFor traders, signals such as the MACD can impact short-term moves in a stock price. Mirza also told clients that the NVDA stock price had broken below its 50-day moving average and that trading volume suggested selling pressure. He wrote: \n\u201c\u2026. these three early technical negatives suggest an intermediate-term (1-3 month) corrective phase is attempting to take hold.\u201d \nWhile I am by no means an expert in technical analysis myself, I think most investors can certainly see that Nvidia\u2019s momentum has slowed. If that\u2019s the case, perhaps buying shares now below their highs is the right move.\nMore broadly, until something breaks in the world of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, this is a stock to own for the long term. Whether that\u2019s at better prices or not depends upon one\u2019s investing time horizon.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.Technology, Semiconductor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2024/07/raymond-james-just-issued-a-major-warning-on-nvidia-nvda-stock/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

Companies did so despite YouTube\u2019s rules against harvesting materials from the platform without permission.Our investigation found that subtitles from 173,536 YouTube videos, siphoned from more than 48,000 channels, were used by Silicon Valley heavyweights, including Anthropic, Nvidia, Apple, and Salesforce.The dataset, called YouTube Subtitles, contains video transcripts from educational and online learning channels like Khan Academy, MIT, and Harvard. The Wall Street Journal, NPR, and the BBC also had their videos used to train AI, as did The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.Proof News also found material from YouTube megastars, including MrBeast (289\u00a0million subscribers, two videos taken for training), Marques Brownlee (19\u00a0million subscribers, seven videos taken), Jacksepticeye (nearly 31\u00a0million subscribers, 377\u00a0videos taken), and PewDiePie (111\u00a0million subscribers, 337\u00a0videos taken). Some of the material used to train AI also promoted conspiracies such as the \u201cflat-earth theory.\u201dProof News created a tool to search for creators in the YouTube AI training dataset.\u201cNo one came to me and said, \u2018We would like to use this,\u2019\u201d said David Pakman, host of The David Pakman Show, a left-leaning politics channel with more than 2 million subscribers and more than 2 billion views. Nearly 160 of his videos were swept up into the YouTube Subtitles training dataset.Four people work full time on Pakman\u2019s enterprise, which posts multiple videos each day in addition to producing a podcast, TikTok videos, and material for other platforms. If AI companies are paid, Pakman said, he should be compensated for the use of his data. He pointed out that some media companies have recently penned agreements to be paid for use of their work to train AI.\u201cThis is my livelihood, and I put time, resources, money, and staff time into creating this content,\u201d Pakman said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no shortage of work.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s theft,\u201d said Dave Wiskus, the CEO of Nebula, a streaming service partially owned by its creators, some of whom have had their work taken from YouTube to train AI.Wiskus said it\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to use creators\u2019 work without their consent, especially since studios may use \u201cgenerative AI to replace as many of the artists along the way as they can.\u201d\u201cWill this be used to exploit and harm artists? Yes, absolutely,\u201d Wiskus said.Representatives at EleutherAI, the creators of the dataset, did not respond to requests for comment on Proof\u2019s findings, including allegations that videos were used without permission. The company\u2019s website states its overall goal is to lower the barriers to AI development to those outside the gilded walls of Big Tech, and it has historically provided \u201caccess to cutting\u2011edge AI technologies by training and releasing models.\u201dYouTube Subtitles does not include video imagery but consists of plain text of videos\u2019 subtitles, often along with translations into languages including Japanese, German, and Arabic.According to a research paper published by EleutherAI, the dataset is part of a compilation the nonprofit released called the Pile. The developers of the Pile included material from not just YouTube but also the European Parliament, English Wikipedia, and a trove of Enron Corporation employees\u2019 emails that was released as part of a federal investigation into the firm.Most of the Pile\u2019s datasets are accessible and open for anyone on the internet with enough space and computing power to access them. Academics and other developers outside of Big Tech made use of the dataset, but they weren\u2019t the only ones.Apple, Nvidia, and Salesforce\u2014companies valued in the hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars\u2014describe in their research papers and posts how they used the Pile to train AI. Documents also show Apple used the Pile to train OpenELM, a high-profile model released in April, weeks before the company revealed it will add new AI capabilities to iPhones and MacBooks. Bloomberg and Databricks also trained models on the Pile, the companies\u2019 publications indicate.So too did Anthropic, a leading AI maker that garnered a $4\u00a0billion investment from Amazon and promotes its focus on \u201cAI safety.\u201d\u201cThe Pile includes a very small subset of YouTube subtitles,\u201d Jennifer Martinez, a spokesperson for Anthropic, said in a statement confirming use of the Pile in Anthropic\u2019s generative AI assistant Claude. \u201cYouTube\u2019s terms cover direct use of its platform, which is distinct from use of the Pile dataset. On the point about potential violations of YouTube\u2019s terms of service, we\u2019d have to refer you to the Pile authors.\u201dSalesforce also confirmed use of the Pile to build an AI model for \u201cacademic and research purposes.\u201d Caiming Xiong, the vice president of AI research at the company, emphasized in a statement that the dataset was \u201cpublicly available.\u201dSalesforce later released that same AI model for public use in 2022, and it has since been downloaded at least 86,000 times, according to its Hugging Face page. In their research paper, Salesforce developers flagged that the Pile also contained profanity as well as \u201cbiases against gender and certain religious groups\u201d and warned that could lead to \u201cvulnerabilities and safety concerns.\u201d Proof News found thousands of examples of profanity in YouTube Subtitles as well as instances of racial and gender slurs. Salesforce\u2019s representative did not respond to questions about safety concerns.A representative for Nvidia declined to comment. Apple, Databricks, and Bloomberg representatives did not respond to requests for comment.The YouTube Data \u201cGold Mine\u201dAI companies compete against each other, in part by procuring higher-quality data, said Jai Vipra, an AI policy researcher and CyberBRICS fellow at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas Law School, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It\u2019s one of the reasons companies keep sources of data close to the vest.Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that Google, which owns YouTube, tapped videos on the platform for text to train its models. In response, a spokesperson told the paper its use was permitted under agreements with YouTube creators.The Times\u2019 investigation also found OpenAI used YouTube videos without authorization. Company representatives neither confirmed nor denied the paper\u2019s findings.OpenAI executives have repeatedly declined to publicly answer questions about whether it used YouTube videos to train its AI product Sora, which creates videos from text prompts. Earlier this year, a reporter with The Wall Street Journal put the question to Mira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer.\u201cI\u2019m actually not sure about that,\u201d Murati replied.YouTube Subtitles and other types of speech to text data are potentially a \u201cgold mine,\u201d Vipra said, because they can help train models to replicate how people talk and converse.\u201cIt's still the sheer principle of it,\u201d said Dave Farina, the host of Professor Dave Explains, whose channel showcasing chemistry and other science tutorials has 3\u00a0million subscribers and had 140\u00a0videos lifted for YouTube Subtitles.\u201cIf you\u2019re profiting off of work that I\u2019ve done [to build a product] that will put me out of work or people like me out of work, then there needs to be a conversation on the table about compensation or some kind of regulation,\u201d he said.YouTube Subtitles, which was published in 2020, also contains subtitles from more than 12,000 videos that have since been deleted from YouTube. In at least one case, the creator deleted their entire online presence, yet that work has been incorporated into an unknown number of AI models.Proof News attempted to reach the owners of channels named in this story. Many did not respond to requests for comment. Of the creators we spoke to, none were aware that their information had been taken, much less of how it was used.Among those surprised: the producers of Crash Course (nearly 16\u00a0million subscribers, 871\u00a0videos taken) and SciShow (8\u00a0million subscribers, 228 videos taken), which are pillars of brothers\u2019 Hank and John Green\u2019s educational video empire.\u201cWe are frustrated to learn that our thoughtfully produced educational content has been used in this way without our consent,\u201d Julie Walsh Smith, the CEO of the shows\u2019 production company, Complexly, said in a statement.YouTube Subtitles isn\u2019t the first set of AI training data to trouble creative industries.Proof News contributor Alex Reisner obtained a copy of Books3, another Pile dataset, and last year published a piece in The Atlantic reporting his finding that more than 180,000 books, including those written by Margaret Atwood, Michael Pollan, and Zadie Smith, had been lifted. Many authors have since sued AI companies for the unauthorized use of their work and alleged copyright violations. Similar cases have since snowballed, and the platform hosting Books3 has taken it down.In response to the suits, defendants such as Meta, OpenAI, and Bloomberg have argued that their actions constitute fair use. A case against EleutherAI, which originally scraped the books and made them public, was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.Litigation in remaining cases remains in the early stages, leaving the questions surrounding permission and payment unresolved. The Pile has since been removed from its official download site, but it\u2019s still available on file-sharing services.\u201cTechnology companies have run roughshod,\u201d said Amy Keller, a consumer protection attorney and partner at the firm DiCello Levitt who has brought lawsuits on behalf of creatives whose work was allegedly scooped up by AI firms without their consent.\u201cPeople are concerned about the fact that they didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s really problematic.\u201dParroting a ParrotMany creators feel uncertain about the path ahead.Full-time YouTubers patrol for unauthorized use of their work, regularly filing takedown notices, and some worry it\u2019s only a matter of time before AI can generate content similar to what they make\u2014if not produce outright copycats.Pakman, the creator of The David Pakman Show, saw the power of AI recently while scrolling on TikTok. He came across a video that was labeled as a Tucker Carlson clip, but when Pakman watched it, he was taken aback. It sounded like Carlson but was, word for word, what Pakman had said on his YouTube show, down to the cadence. He was equally alarmed that only one of the video\u2019s commenters seemed to recognize that it was fake\u2014a voice clone of Carlson reading Pakman\u2019s script.\u201cThis is going to be a problem,\u201d Pakman said in a YouTube video he made about the fake. \u201cYou can do this essentially with anybody.\u201dEleutherAI cofounder Sid Black wrote on GitHub that he created YouTube Subtitles by using a script. That script downloads the subtitles from YouTube\u2019s API in the same way a YouTube viewer\u2019s browser downloads them when watching a video. According to documentation on GitHub, Black used 495 search terms to cull videos, including \u201cfunny vloggers,\u201d \u201cEinstein,\u201d \u201cblack protestant,\u201d \u201cProtective Social Services,\u201d \u201cinfowars,\u201d \u201cquantum chromodynamics,\u201d \u201cBen Shapiro,\u201d \u201cUighurs,\u201d \u201cfruitarian,\u201d \u201ccake recipe,\u201d \u201dNazca lines,\u201d and \u201cflat earth.\u201dThough YouTube\u2019s terms of service prohibit accessing its videos by \u201cautomated means,\u201d more than 2,000 GitHub users have bookmarked or endorsed the code.\u201cThere are many ways in which YouTube could prevent this module from working if that was what they are after,\u201d wrote machine learning engineer Jonas Depoix in a discussion on GitHub, where he published the code Black used to access YouTube subtitles. \u201cThis hasn't happened so far.\u201dIn an email to Proof News, Depoix said he hasn\u2019t used the code since he wrote it as a university student for a project several years ago and was surprised people found it useful. He declined to answer questions about YouTube\u2019s rules.Google spokesperson Jack Malon said in an email response to a request for comment that the company has taken \u201caction over the years to prevent abusive, unauthorized scraping.\u201d He did not respond to questions about other companies\u2019 use of the material as training data.Among the videos used by AI companies are 146 from Einstein Parrot, a channel with nearly 150,000 subscribers. The African grey\u2019s caretaker, Marcia, who didn\u2019t want to use her last name for fear of endangering the famous bird\u2019s safety, said at first she thought it was funny to learn AI models had ingested words of a mimicking parrot.\u201cWho would want to use a parrot\u2019s voice?\u201d Marcia said. \u201cBut then, I know that he speaks very well. He speaks in my voice. So he\u2019s parroting me, and then AI is parroting the parrot.\u201dOnce ingested by AI, data cannot be unlearned. Marcia was troubled by all the unknown ways in which her bird\u2019s information could be used, including creating a digital duplicate parrot and, she worried, making it curse.\u201cWe\u2019re treading on uncharted territory,\u201d Marcia said.You Might Also Like \u2026In your inbox: Get Plaintext\u2014Steven Levy's long view on techMusk takeover: No, 150-year-olds aren\u2019t collecting benefitsBig Story: Are you lonely?

Or so says one veteran tech investor. \"I'm saying like it [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above or listen here).  To put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.25 trillion or so currently. Jackson reasoned the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report in August or November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips. That would align with what Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance on demand trends back in late May. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.96 -2.57 (-2.15%)  As of 3:02:33 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA AMD   Advanced Chart    If Nvidia's earnings reports come in as he expects, Jackson thinks investors will be open to paying a much higher price-to-earnings (PE) multiple to own its stock. That's a bold statement, seeing as Nvidia already trades on a forward PE of about 50 times, per Yahoo Finance data, almost two times the broader market multiple. Added Jackson, \"I don't know if it's going to be August [earnings], I don't know if it's going to be November [earnings], but I think there is going be this euphoric reaction. And if so, the stock goes back to 65x forward earnings and you're there at like $250 per share.\"  Nvidia shares trade at $131 as of this writing, up more than 170% year to date. To be sure, it has been another year of milestones for Nvidia. On June 18, its market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Before that, Huang took the wraps off his powerful Blackwell chips and proclaimed the company is building AI factories. Nvidia has since lost the most-valuable-company crown to Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (second place), but detractors on the Street are few and far between. \"Positive takeaways for Nvidia include: 1) despite the impending launch of Blackwell in the second half of 2024, we are not seeing any signs of a demand pause as demand for H100 remains robust, as we continue to see rush orders; and 2) the interest and demand in GB200 is greater than we initially had sized as the majority of the mix is expected to be NVL72 vs. NVL36,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note this week. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)   Follow    View Quote Details    382.76 -5.94 (-1.53%)  As of 3:02:27 PM EDT. Market Open.   MSFT AAPL   Advanced Chart    A few non-Nvidia permabulls have started to appear, however. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded his rating on Nvidia last week to Neutral, citing valuation concerns.   Story Continues Ferragu said he sees \"limited further upside\" based on conversations with contacts in the supply chain. The bull case on Nvidia may not emerge beyond 2025, putting expectations at risk, Ferragu explained.Meanwhile, Nvidia's success story is attracting hungry competitors \u2014 and that may stand in the way of the chip juggernaut, warned Goldman Sachs asset manager Brook Dane.\"There's very little likelihood that there isn't competition out there [for Nvidia],\" he said.Find more episodes of Opening Bid on our video hub.

This comes after Nvidia acquired two other startups with the explicit purpose of expanding the capabilities of its DGX Cloud service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has bought a startup that helps AI developers find the most cost-effective GPU compute across cloud service providers, making it the AI chip giant\u2019s fourth acquisition this year.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson confirmed to CRN on Tuesday that it acquired Brev.dev, a San Francisco-based startup that provides an AI and machine learning development platform for building, training and deploying models on CPU- and GPU-based cloud instances.\n[Related: Analysis: As Nvidia Takes AI Victory Lap, AMD Doubles The Trouble For Intel]\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\u201cBrev\u2019s goal is to build the easiest way for AI/ML developers to use a GPU,\u201d the startup said in a LinkedIn post this week. \u201cTeaming up with Nvidia means being able to deliver on that mission by pairing the most powerful hardware with the industry -eading software.\u201d\nOutlined on its website, Brev.dev lists Nvidia, Intel and Amazon Web Services as official partners and says its platform serves as a \u201csingle interface between AWS, [Google Cloud Platform], Fluidstack and other GPU clouds.\u201d This, according to the startup, allows developers to find instances based on costs and availability.\nWhile Nvidia has provided GPUs to cloud service providers for more than a decade, the company in recent years has sought to make a larger business around cloud infrastructure\u2014a hot spot for AI development\u2014through a growing portfolio of software and services.\nMost notably, the company last year launched DGX Cloud, a service that runs on top of cloud service providers like AWS and gives enterprises quick access to the tools, support and GPU-powered infrastructure they need to create and run generative AI applications. The starting price for the service is $19,699 a month with a one-year commitment for a single A100-based node.\nTwo of the acquisition deals Nvidia made earlier this year were explicitly done to build out the capabilities of its DGX Cloud service.\nIn late April, the company announced it had reached a deal to acquire Israel-based AI infrastructure management startup Run:ai. The startup provides Kubernetes-based workload management and orchestration software, which Nvidia said it plans to use to drive its DGX Cloud business and enhance the capabilities of DGX and HGX server customers.\nMultiple\u00a0reports\u00a0said the Run:ai deal was valued at around $700 million.\nEarlier this month, Nvidia acquired Shoreline.io, a Redwood City, Calif.-based startup founded by a former AWS executive that provides software for automatically fixing issues in data center infrastructure. The deal was confirmed by the startup, and one of its investors said Shoreline\u2019s team was joining the DGX Cloud unit. The deal was reportedly valued at about $100 million.\nThe other acquisition Nvidia made this year was another Israeli startup called Deci, which makes software that can speed up the inference of AI models while retaining accuracy on any hardware. The deal was reportedly valued at approximately $300 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

[+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has seen a 120% plus rally this year. With a $2.8 trillion market cap, Nvidia\u2019s valuation is in the vicinity of tech titans Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Nvidia has a lot going for it as companies are looking to shift their sizable installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing using graphics processing units or GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. The stock currently trades at about $113 per share or roughly 41x forward earnings. While this multiple may seem high, it is not unreasonable given Nvidia\u2019s recent growth. Nvidia\u2019s financial performance has been solid, and the company is on track to grow revenues by almost double this year, reaching approximately $120 billion, with earnings per share poised to double. However, there are significant questions about the underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem, as most of Nvidia\u2019s customers remain loss-making.\n\n\nSetting up AI systems and training large language models is an expensive affair. This raises concerns about how the massive investments companies are making in artificial intelligence infrastructure will ultimately pay off. To provide context, venture capital firm Sequoia recently estimated that the AI industry spent approximately $50 billion on Nvidia chips to train advanced AI models over the last year. Considering other ancillary investments such as buildings and power generation, it is probably safe to assume that the total amount required to set up AI data systems could be about double this figure or about $100 billion spent over the last year. However, the VC firm estimates that these investments generated a mere $3 billion in revenue.\n\nAlthough this is still early days for the AI industry, we have yet to see many AI services, besides ChatGPT, that have a reasonably large base of paying customers. For instance, customers readily pay $10 or more per month for music or video streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix, but we have yet to see AI services that offer similar utility to a broad customer base. In fact, OpenAI itself could incur losses amounting to $5 billion in 2024, according to a report in The Information, meaning that the company will have to raise even more funds beyond the seven rounds of funding that raised over $11 billion.\n\n\nConsidering that markets project Nvidia\u2019s revenues to grow to almost $160 billion in FY\u201926, with the bulk of this growth coming from AI-focused GPUs, it remains to be seen whether the revenues of its end customers will grow in tandem to justify their big spending. While AI appears to be a generational opportunity in the computing space, it will take time for clarity to emerge regarding the use cases and what customers will be willing to pay for these services. If Nvidia\u2019s customers can\u2019t make money, how can Nvidia sustain its high growth rates and thick margins? Investments into AI data centers at this juncture appear to be driven, in part, by panic or the fear of missing out on the next big thing in tech, rather than by careful consideration of potential returns. As a result, customers may begin seeking cheaper alternatives for chipsets beyond Nvidia\u2019s offerings, which typically cost over $25,000 each. This could also open the door for other chipmakers, such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Although Nvidia\u2019s chips are currently superior in terms of overall performance, with the company also using proprietary software and programming languages to better lock in customers, increased competition may render Nvidia\u2019s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable. For perspective, Nvidia posted net margins of 57% in Q1.\n\nNVDA stock has seen extremely strong gains of 785% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $115 now, vs. an increase of about 45% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in NVDA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that NVDA underperformed the S&P in 2022.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nIn fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including AAPL, MSFT, and ORCL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\n\nWe value Nvidia stock at $89 per share, which is approximately 21% below the current market price.

The study, published recently in Nature, was led by Nobel laureate Giorgio Parisi and is seen as a step in understanding and harnessing the capabilities of quantum computing for complex optimization problems.\nQuantum Annealing and Its Promise\nQuantum annealing is a specialized quantum computing method designed to solve optimization problems that are challenging for conventional computers. Unlike classical computers that process information using binary digits (0s and 1s), quantum computers utilize quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist simultaneously in multiple states, enabling quantum computers to process information in fundamentally new ways.\nQuantum annealers, a specific type of quantum computer, excel at finding the minimum energy state of a system, which corresponds to the optimal solution of an encoded problem. These systems can be particularly effective for solving certain types of optimization problems, though they are not universally applicable.\nThe Study and its Significance\nThe research, titled \u201cThe Quantum Transition of the Two-Dimensional Ising Spin Glass,\u201d focuses on a critical problem in computational physics: understanding the phase transition of Ising spin glass, according to a NVIDIA blog post. Ising spin glass is a disordered magnetic material in a two-dimensional plane, where the properties of magnetic particles can change abruptly.\nTo conduct their research, Parisi\u2019s team utilized an impressive array of computing resources, including 2 million GPU computing hours at the Leonardo facility (Cineca, Bologna, Italy), nearly 160,000 GPU computing hours on the Meluxina-GPU cluster in Luxembourg, and 10,000 GPU hours from the Spanish Supercomputing Network. They also accessed the Dariah cluster in Lecce, Italy.\nThese state-of-the-art GPU-powered systems allowed the researchers to simulate the behavior of quantum annealers, providing critical insights into how these systems operate and how they can be optimized for solving complex problems.\nUnderstanding Quantum Annealers\nQuantum annealers, such as those developed by D-Wave, function by gradually decreasing a magnetic field applied to a set of magnetically susceptible particles, according to the post. When the field is strong enough, it aligns the magnetic orientation of these particles, similar to how iron filings align near a magnet. If the field strength is varied slowly, the particles arrange themselves in a manner that minimizes the system\u2019s energy, solving the encoded problem.\nThis process is particularly relevant for spin glasses, complex and disordered magnetic systems where finding the minimum-energy configuration equates to solving the optimization problem. The study provides insights into how the properties of spin glasses change during quantum annealing, helping develop better algorithms for tackling these complex problems.\nImplications for Quantum Computing And Real-World Uses\nThe findings suggest GPU-powered simulations can serve a critical role in advancing quantum computing. By using NVIDIA GPUs to simulate quantum annealing, researchers can better understand the behavior of these systems and identify the most promising paths forward. \nThis approach mimics how nature handles complexity and disorder, paving the way for quantum annealing to address real-world problems in fields like logistics, cryptography, vehicle routing, portfolio optimization and protein folding.\nUnlike gate-model quantum computers, which use a sequence of quantum gates to perform computations, quantum annealers allow a quantum system to evolve freely over time, according to the post. While not a universal computer, quantum annealers have distinct advantages for specific optimization problems, and, researchers believe, offer potential quantum speedups for critical applications.\nIn addition to Parisi, the team included: Massimo Bernaschi, Isidoro Gonz\u00e1lez-Adalid Pemart\u00edn and V\u00edctor Mart\u00edn-Mayor.\nAccording to the post, the research was first presented at NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2024 technology conference.\nFor more detailed information, readers can access the full paper and explore NVIDIA\u2019s ongoing work in quantum computing on their blog.\n\n\n\n\nD-WaveGiorgio ParisiNVIDIAquantum annealing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Swayne \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a several-decades long background in journalism and communications, Matt Swayne has worked as a science communicator for an R1 university for more than 12 years, specializing in translating high tech and deep tech for the general audience.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Founder and Principal Analyst,\nCambrian-AI Research LLCFollow AuthorJul 23, 2024, 07:00pm EDTShareSaveCommentNvidia has fleshed out a complete software stack to ease custom model development and deployment for enterprises. Is this AI Nervana? And can AMD and Intel compete with this?\n\nIn order for enterprises to adopt AI, its got to become a lot easier and more affordable. Nvidia has (re-) launched AI Foundry to help Enterprises adapt and adopt AI to meet their business needs without having to start from scratch. And without having to spend gazillions of dollars.\n\n\nThe timing is spot-on as investors grow nervous that it may be hard for enterprises to make a good return on their AI investments. And without Enterprise adoption, AI will fail and we will be back to an AI Winter. To counter that narrative, Nvidia is expected to share Enterprise ROI stories during its next earnings call. And the new AI Foundry coupled with NIMs could become the standard path forward for most companies. While many components of this story are indeed open source, they only run on Nvidia GPUs. I know of no other chip company with anything even close to NIMs or the AI Foundry.\n\nWhat is the AI Foundry?\nThe Nvidia AI Foundry is a combination of software, models, and expert services to help Enterprises not only get started, but complete their AI journey. Will this put Nvidia on a collision course with its ecosystem consulting partners such as IBM and Accenture? Accenture has been using the Nvidia AI Foundry to revamp its internal enterprise functions, and has now taken what they have learned and created the Accenture AI Refinery to help its clients do the same. Deloitte is on a similar path.\n\nThe custom model creation workflow.NVidia\nAccording to Nvidia\u2019s blog on the Foundry, \u201cJust as TSMC manufactures chips designed by other companies, NVIDIA AI Foundry provides the infrastructure and tools for other companies to develop and customize AI models \u2014 using DGX Cloud, foundation models, NVIDIA NeMo software, NVIDIA expertise, as well as ecosystem tools and support.\u201d\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nWhen initially rolled out back in late 2023, Nvidia Foundry was focussed on Microsoft Azure hosted AI. Since then, Nvidia has recruited dozens of partners to help deliver the platform, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud as well as scores of generative AI companies, model builders, integrators and OEMs.\nThe ecosystem for Nvidia AI Foundry has exploded with new partners,Nvidia\n\n\nThe NVIDIA AI foundry service pulls together three elements needed to customize a model for a specific data set or company \u2014 a collection of NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, NVIDIA NeMo framework and tools, and NVIDIA DGX Cloud AI supercomputing services \u2014 giving enterprises an end-to-end solution for creating custom generative AI models.\nBut you thought thats what RAG was for, right? Yes, Retrieval Augmented Generation can do a great job of adding company-specific data to an LLM. But Nvidia said that the Foundry can produce a customized model that is fully ten points more accurate than a simple RAG augmentation. Ten points can make the difference between a great model and one that may be thrown on the trash heap.\nAnd NIMs\nNIMs provide the building blocks needed to greatly simplify and expand the domains that the Foundry can build on. Nvidia shared over 50 NIMs they have already created for various domains. Recall that a NIM is a containerized inference processing micro-service that the Nvidia NIM Factory has built, and that an Enterprise AI License provides access to the ever-growing NIM Library on ai.nvidia.com.Nvidia NIMs are multiplying rapidly and cover most of the major modes of data and AI.Nvidia\nThe Foundry launch was timed to coincide with Meta\u2019s release of Llama 3.1 405B, which is the first open model that can rival the top AI models from OpenAI, Google, and others, when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and now with multilingual translation. Meta believes the latest generation of Llama will ignite new applications and modeling paradigms, including synthetic data generation to enable the improvement and training of smaller models, as well as model distillation. Nvidia Foundry also supports the NVIDIA Nemotron, CodeGemma by Google DeepMind, CodeLlama, Gemma by Google DeepMind, Mistral, Mixtral, Phi-3, StarCoder2 and others.\nAnd true to form, Nvidia shows that it can increased performance of models like Llama 3.1 with optimized NIMs. Inferencing solutions like NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM improve efficiency for Llama 3.1 models to minimize latency and maximize throughput, enabling enterprises to generate tokens faster while reducing total cost of running the models in production.For Llama 3.1 from Meta, NIMs deliver higher performance on the same hardware, Nvidia\nNvidia also released today four new NeMo Retriever NIM microservices to enable enterprises to scale to \u201cagentic AI\u201d workflows \u2014 where AI applications operate accurately with minimal intervention or supervision \u2014 while delivering the highest accuracy retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. These new NeMo Retriever embedding and reranking NIM microservices are now generally available:\n\n\nNV-EmbedQA-E5-v5, a popular community base embedding model optimized for text question-answering retrieval\nNV-EmbedQA-Mistral7B-v2, a popular multilingual community base model fine-tuned for text embedding for high-accuracy question answering\nSnowflake-Arctic-Embed-L, an optimized community model, and\nNV-RerankQA-Mistral4B-v3, a popular community base model fine-tuned for text reranking for high-accuracy question answering.\n\n\n\u201cNeMo Retriever provides the best of both worlds. By casting a wide net of data to be retrieved with an embedding NIM, then using a reranking NIM to trim the results for relevancy, developers tapping NeMo Retriever can build a pipeline that ensures the most helpful, accurate results for their enterprise,\u201d Nvidia explained in their blog.\nA NIM Example: A Healthcare Chatbot\nPerhaps an example would help. Suppose you want to build a digital assistant to help patients with personalized information. Nvidia showed how they can combine 3 agents and 9 NIMs to build an assistant application. This is pretty close to Nervana and way beyond anything that the competition can offer.A collection of NIMs can be used to create a healthcare digital assistant.Nvidia\nConclusions\nWhile the competition continues to improve the performance and connectivity of their accelerators, Nvidia is building the software that enables AI adoption. I know of no competitor to NIMs, nor a competitor to Foundry. And of course, nobody has introduced a competitor to Transformer Engine nor TensorRT-LLM, both of which can deliver 2-4 times the performance of a GPU without these features.\nAs enterprises work to adapt and adopt custom models for their business and applications, Nvidia is providing an easy on ramp to become an AI-enabled enterprise.\nAs for pricing, while NIM is included in the Enterprise AI license for each GPU, Foundry is priced based on a specific customer situation and is not included in Enterprise AI.\nHere\u2019s more detail on the Foundry:NVIDIA BlogHow NVIDIA AI Foundry Lets Enterprises Forge Custom Generative AI Models\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Disclosures: This article expresses the author's opinions andshould not be taken as advice to purchase from or invest in the companies mentioned.

Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene.Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom \u2013 and so far, it\u2019s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?This year\u2019s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech.I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement.\u201cWe thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],\u201d she told me. \u201cBut with AI, we are throwing the dice again\u201d.She believes she\u2019s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in.That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It\u2019s a confidential event, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI.A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. \u201cMost stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,\u201d it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup\u2019s \u201cAI winners basket\u201d had fallen in value in 2024.Life comes at you fast indeed.Getty ImagesAnne Boden says that AI has completely shaken up the tech sector\u201cGiven how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,\u201d warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.\u201cJust like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.\u201dIn 2023 you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI.My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches.\u201cI spend a lot of time saying \u2018\u2026 but that\u2019s not AI\u2019,\u201d he tells me.It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.Speaking to the FT, Citi\u2019s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, \u201cjust saying AI 15 times isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore\u201d.In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that\u2019s just plain weird.And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now \u2013 early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,\u201d says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar.\u201cBusinesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill \u2013 the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.\u201dTech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,\u201d he says.But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon.\u201cEveryone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,\u201d he adds.\u201cAll the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.\u201dGetty ImagesChatGPT is the AI app that has really caught the public's attention There\u2019s another reason why the AI bubble might pop. It\u2019s got nothing to do with the quality of the products or their market value. It\u2019s whether the planet itself can afford it.A study published last year predicted that the AI industry could consume the same amount of energy of a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 if growth continues at its current rate.I interviewed Prof Kate Crawford from the University of Southern California for the BBC\u2019s Tech Life podcast, and she told me that worrying about the amount of electricity, energy and water required to power AI kept her awake at night. Dr Sasha Luccioni from the machine-learning firm Hugging Face is also concerned.\u201cThere\u2019s simply not enough renewable energy to power AI right now \u2013 most of that bubble is fuelled by oil and gas,\u201d she says.The hope is that the tech could be used to identify sustainability solutions, like for example the secret of nuclear fusion, the way in which the sun gets its energy. But that hasn\u2019t happened yet, and in the meantime, \u201cAI systems put a huge strain on energy grids that are already under immense strain,\u201d adds Dr Luccioni.With so much uncertainty, few should bet against another shake-up among the world's richest firms. But currently, Apple has a fight on its hands to catch up with Microsoft and Nvidia in the AI race.Read more about AIWhat is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?How mobile phone networks are embracing AICould brain-like computers be a 'competition killer'?'We are creating new crops five-times faster'International BusinessArtificial intelligenceNvidiaAppleMicrosoftRelatedThe Matrix film producer files for bankruptcy12 hrs agoBusinessSubsea fibre cables can 'listen out' for sabotage18 hrs agoTechnologyDisasters spur investment in flood and fire risk tech19 hrs agoMore12 hrs agoJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cryHerbie Hancock on 80 years of playing the piano and being this year's recipient of the Polar Music Prize.12 hrs agoCulture1 day agoMarket alters application rules after AI complaintsThe Alternative Market in Leeds will ask potential vendors to declare and describe any use of AI.1 day agoEngland2 days agoAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schoolsAllison Gardner says schools should be commended for using artificial intelligence in teaching.2 days agoStoke & Staffordshire4 days agoAlphonso the robot waiter delighting cafe visitorsThe robot is able to help serve and interact with customers, and has already caused a stir.4 days agoSuffolk4 days agoApple encrypted data row hearing begins in secretThe BBC - along with civil liberties groups and some US politicians - argue the case should be heard in public.4 days agoTechnologyBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

Everyone wants to invest in artificial intelligence, but there are several ways to do so. Which one is the most suitable at the moment? Today, I'm joined by Rahul Bhushan, Global Head of Index at ARK Invest Europe.\nRahul, Nvidia (NVDA) recently became the most valuable company in the world. Its impressive rally has pushed many investors towards the theme of AI. But now, you at ARK Invest, think it's time to start showing some caution. Can you explain why?\nRahul Bhushan: Yeah. First of all, thanks Valerio for having us on. The first thing is, we've gone through, and we might still be going through a massive, unprecedented AI CapEx cycle. And so, here's some context. The combined CapEx of Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Meta (GOOGL) is set to skyrocket this year by around 70% versus last year. So, we're going to hit anticipated $152 billion from $87 billion last year. So that's nearly a doubling and as a percentage of sales, that's going from about 13% to almost 20% of sales as combined CapEx. So, if you look at the trajectory there, these figures are \u2013 they're pretty mind blowing. We had $52 billion in 2020; we had $65 billion in 2021; we had $86 billion in 2022; $87 billion in 2023; and then $152 billion. So nearly double anticipated for the end of this year.\nAnd so, all of this investment has benefited and continues to benefit Nvidia. Especially if you go back just a year ago, we actually had a GPU shortage, and that GPU supply shortage, as you know, has eased. But what it's meant is that companies like Microsoft and others spent massively on hoarding and over-capacity and stockpiling, which has contributed to Nvidia\u2019s revenue. But GPU computing, we know, is rapidly becoming a commodity. Many people have been saying that. And this is creating a price drop and depreciation in current generation chips. So, we're now eagerly awaiting next generation chips like Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell, which is going to succeed the Hopper series, and which is going to have significant advancements, particularly in things like ray tracing capabilities. So, while Nvidia\u2019s advancements may continue, the broader AI and AI chips ecosystem, you can think of memory chips, for example, which are more standardised, may not deliver the same revenue expectations. And this, we believe, warrants a more cautious approach, let alone all of the things that have happened over the last seven days.\nVB: Right. And so, in the light of this, where do you see the best opportunities within the AI universe right now?\u00a0\nRB: So, we believe that investors should be shifting their attention to software, AI software. And AI software, I think the best way to characterise it is we believe it represents wave two, so to speak, of the AI opportunity, if you assume that wave one was chips, aka, Nvidia and SMCI (SMCI). And wave two is exciting because it's less obvious, at least not fully obvious to everybody yet, which means that we've been able to be highly opportunistic in our buying of companies. And so, the way to think about wave two is to visualise the full AI stack.\nAnd Frank Downing, who is our director of research for AI, he laid this out recently quite brilliantly. There's basically three layers, right? So, you've got infrastructure as a service, which is the foundational hardware and compute for AI development and deployment. So, these are your companies like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. And so, these are the infrastructure providers that make hardware widely available and accessible, using service contracts. Then you've got number two, platform and infrastructure software companies. So, these are the tools and systems that developers use to build, deploy, and maintain AI applications. And finally, you've got SaaS, so software-as-a-service. So, these are the companies that deliver applications over the internet. So, an example would be Salesforce (CRM) or HubSpot (HUBS).\nSo, for clarity, SaaS applications are built and maintained by developers who use tools from the platform and infrastructure software category, so the category number two. The key distinction between platform and infrastructure software companies and SaaS is whether the tool is used to build or secure an application, or if it is the application itself in the case of SaaS. So, our research suggests that the segment that is growing the fastest is the second segment. So, the platform and infrastructure software category, and as the cost of AI development falls, there's a greater incentive to build more customised AI applications. And this is often happening at the expense of companies in the third category, the SaaS category. And signs of this are already apparent. Majority of stocks in our AI and robotics ETF really fall in this second category.\nVB: That's very interesting. So finally, to be even more concrete, can you name three companies, three stocks, that could replicate Nvidia\u2019s success in the coming years and briefly explain why?\nRB: Sure. So, the first stock we'd highlight is Palantir (PLTR). It's a much talked about name today, certainly, given how strongly it's performed over the course of this year already. But essentially, what Palantir does is they help organisations make sense of large amounts of data. They provide the tools that analyse the corporate data to uncover patterns, to uncover trends, to deliver new insights that inform better decision-making using that, leveraging that data. So, we're pretty confident that AI is going to be a game changer for Palantir.\nPalantir Technologies\u00a0(PLTR)\n\u2022 Morningstar Rating:\u00a0\u2605\u2022 Fair Value Estimate: $6.00\u2022\u00a0Economic Moat: Narrow\nThe second company I'd highlight is Teradyne (TER). So, Teradyne makes machines that test electronic equipment and robots. These are robots that typically are robots that are helping automate manufacturing in some ways. It's a well-known name, but we believe it's an underappreciated name, certainly in the last 18 months where all of the attention has been on seven magnificent companies. And Teradyne, essentially \u2013 the way you can think about Teradyne is they ensure that robots are working correctly. And so, if we're right, what we're going to see with this company is a massive improvement in the precision, efficacy, and efficiency of their testing, so leading to fewer errors, downtime, and ultimately, these robots can become more productive. So, it's going to create greater productivity for Teradyne customers, which is going to accrue a lot of value back to Teradyne, we believe.\nTeradyne\u00a0(TER)\n\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating:\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $135.00\u2022\u00a0Economic Moat: Wide\nAnd number three \u2013 and this one is perhaps a little more obvious and certainly been heavily talked about this year \u2013 is Meta. AI is already enhancing Meta's ability to deliver personalised content and improve their ad targeting. We use Meta ad targeting as a company. You can already see that the quality of their targeting is improving, and you already see it in the numbers for Meta. They gave up that big ambition focused on the Metaverse, and they are going full steam ahead down this AI opportunity. And it's already unlocked new revenue, and it's continuing to unlock new revenue. And we believe there's still much more upside. So those are my three picks.\nMeta Platforms\u00a0(META)\n\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $400.00\u2022\u00a0Economic Moat: Narrow\nBaselli: Very interesting.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings.

Most Read from Bloomberg Kamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels Singapore Couples Are Marrying Earlier to Buy Homes, Leading Some to Regret Singapore Is Making Life Tougher for Global Talent Stocks Up as Jobs Spur Calls for September Fed Cut: Markets Wrap Biden\u2019s Fourth of July Shrouded by Pressure to Drop 2024 Bid   The French agency would be the world\u2019s first to take such a step, Reuters said, citing unidentified people with direct knowledge of the matter. The charge sheet \u2014 or statement of objections \u2014 would follow a raid of Nvidia offices last year. Nvidia has drawn the attention of regulators since becoming the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence spending boom. Its chips \u2014 known as graphics processing units, or GPUs \u2014 are prized by data center operators for their ability to crunch the massive amount of information required to develop AI models. The French antitrust agency declined to comment to Bloomberg, as did Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia. Nvidia shares slipped as much as 3.8% on Monday in New York before mostly recovering. They have more than doubled this year, pushing the company\u2019s valuation above $3 trillion. In September, French antitrust enforcers raided the offices of a business suspected of engaging in \u201canticompetitive practices in the graphics cards sector.\u201d They didn\u2019t identify the company as Nvidia at the time, but the chipmaker has since acknowledged that France and other entities are examining its business practices.  Officials in the US, European Union, China and the UK are also scrutinizing its operations, Nvidia said in a filing in February. \u201cOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide,\u201d the chipmaker said at the time. French antitrust watchdogs have been interviewing market players on Nvidia\u2019s key role in AI processors, its pricing policy, the shortage of chips and the impact on prices. The office raid was aimed at gleaning more information on potential abuses of dominance. Fines for breaching France\u2019s antitrust law can be as high as 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. The agency lists a \u20ac1.24 billion ($1.33 billion) fine from 2020 as its largest since 2011. Of that, \u20ac1.1 billion was imposed on Apple Inc., while the rest was levied against two distributors. In Brussels, the European Commission has been informally gathering views on whether Nvidia may have also run afoul of its own antitrust rules, but it has yet to launch a formal probe into anticompetitive conduct.   Story Continues In November, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Nvidia\u2019s dominance was causing \u201cgrowing inequalities\u201d between countries and stifling fair competition. He said that 92% of GPUs are from Nvidia.\u201cIf you want to have fair competition, you need to have many private companies and not one single company having the possibility of selling all the devices,\u201d Le Maire said.--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins and Alan Katz.(Updates with more on raid starting in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America \u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

On Wednesday, their momentum came to a screeching halt. The three stocks slid for reasons ranging from investor concern over export restrictions to a broader rotation out of tech stocks.  One headwind that emerged was the potential for tighter restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to China. Bloomberg reported the Biden administration is considering implementing a more severe curb involving controls on foreign-manufactured products that use even the smallest amount of American technology.   Chip related stocks fell on Wednesday amid major geopolitical headwinds.   Current restrictions have already impacted US-based companies\u2019 ability to sell to China. Nvidia sales to China decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. ASML stock saw the steepest decline on Wednesday, falling more than 12%. Shares of the Netherlands-based chip equipment maker were also pressured following its third quarter guidance. While ASML beat its second quarter top- and bottom-line expectations, its revenue forecast for the current quarter came in shy of the consensus analyst estimate. The company also said it expects quarterly gross margin in the range of 50% to 51% versus Wall Street expectations of 51.1%.   Exterior view of one of the buildings in the ASML complex in Veldhoven, Netherlands, Monday, Jan. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS Also dragging down chip stocks were comments from former president Donald Trump, who said Taiwan \"should pay\" the US for protection against any aggression from China. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview published on Tuesday. He also said Taiwan took \"about 100%\" of the US chip business. Trump's comments sent shares of chip manufacturing and design giant TSMC plummeting more than 7% on Wednesday.  Many chipmakers, including Nvidia, depend on Taiwan for manufacturing. The island located east of China is a major semiconductor hub with roughly 92% of the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaking capacity, according to the US International Trade Commission. It's worth noting shares of semiconductor companies Intel (INTC) and GlobalFoundries (GFS) were up during the session. Both companies are seen beneficiaries of the Biden administration's push to onshore chip production to the US.

The rotation out technology began last week after the latest inflation print gave investors more optimism that the Federal Reserve would start cutting rates in September.

chemistry calculations by 80x and catalyzes a new wave of breakthrough applications across industries \nPALO ALTO, Calif., July 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SandboxAQ announced today a groundbreaking advancement that pushes the limits of computational chemistry, impacting fields such as biopharma, chemicals, materials science and other industries. Collaborating with NVIDIA, SandboxAQ leverages Large Quantitative Models (LQMs) and the NVIDIA CUDA-accelerated Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. This allows scientists to perform highly accurate Quantitative AI simulations of real-life systems with exacting accuracy, going beyond what Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI models can currently do.\nCombining the CUDA-DMRG algorithm, the NVIDIA Quantum platform, and NVIDIA accelerated computing speeds up these highly accurate calculations more than 80x, compared with traditional 128-core CPU computations. At the same time, it more than doubles the sizes of computable catalysts and enzyme active sites calculated by the system. SandboxAQ researchers use these computational results to train AI networks to optimize for the desired treatment or catalyst as outlined in the preprint available at https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2.\n\"Advanced computing is opening new frontiers in scientific research. Our use of NVIDIA technology has allowed us to address some of the most challenging problems in chemistry,\" said Dr. Martin Ganahl, senior staff scientist at SandboxAQ. \"We are not only advancing our understanding of material science and chemistry, but also paving the way for the next wave of innovations in drug discovery and catalysis to tackle currently-untreatable conditions and find safer and cheaper ways to synthesize molecules and materials.\"\n\"AI supercomputing is helping to solve critical problems in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries,\" said Tim Costa, director of high-performance and quantum computing at NVIDIA. \"SandboxAQ's use of the NVIDIA Quantum platform is facilitating simulations at an unprecedented scale, enabling scientists to rethink what's possible in computational chemistry.\"\n\"This work with NVIDIA underscores SandboxAQ's commitment to pushing the envelope of scientific discovery and technological innovation,\" said Jim Breyer, Founder and CEO of Breyer Capital and an early investor in SandboxAQ. \"Unlocking the secrets of new compounds and catalysts makes possible a new era of LQM breakthroughs in various industries that take us beyond LLMs. This has significant implications for improving quality of life and driving economic growth.\"\nLast year, SandboxAQ announced AI collaborations with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), NOVONIX, and Riboscience. In 2024, Flagship Pioneering, SPARK NS, and other organizations signed on to further their innovation pipelines.\nApplications for LQMs range from biopharma to agriculture to advanced materials. In biopharma for example, the enzyme Cytochrome P450s plays a central role in human drug metabolism and is central to understanding drug toxicity. CUDA-DMRG can help solve the long-standing problem of accurately modeling cytochromes' catalytic activity and provide a game-changing angle for computational toxicity prediction, allowing computational simulation to de-risk clinical trials before they happen.\nTraining large AI models with proprietary, generated data to unlock breakthroughs in the physical world is the heart of a new wave of Quantitative AI. LQMs can make accurate predictions about the world because they are grounded in exact, physics-based data. While LLMs are limited to the data available on the Internet or other existing sources, SandboxAQ's LQMs can access an unlimited supply of training data generated by physics-based Quantitative AI simulations.\nAbout SandboxAQSandboxAQ is a B2B company delivering AI solutions that address some of the world's greatest challenges. The company's Large Quantitative Models (LQMs) deliver critical advances in life sciences, financial services, navigation, cyber and other sectors.

The internships offer great benefits, last for at least 12 weeks and are available year-round. They\u2019re an ideal way for students interested in a full-time role at NVIDIA to kick-start their journeys, make an impact through meaningful projects and learn from some of the world\u2019s top tech talent.\nSince joining NVIDIA in 2010, Nguyen has grown with the company \u2014 she began coordinating operations for university recruiting before becoming a campus recruiter, and now leads the campus management, sourcing and diversity recruiting teams.\n\nHer team is the front line tasked with attracting and hiring NVIDIA\u2019s early-career talent. While most of NVIDIA\u2019s interns are graduate students, NVIDIA offers programs that support students throughout their university careers. For example, the Ignite program recruits university freshmen and sophomores from historically underrepresented communities, and traditional internships are offered for undergraduate upperclassmen, graduate and Ph.D. students.\nThriving in fast-paced and ever-changing environments, Nguyen has always raised her hand for new projects and challenges.\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to so many mentors across the company who have empowered me with opportunities to showcase what I can do,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my job. We\u2019re bringing in the future of NVIDIA \u2014 people who will positively impact the future of our world.\u201d\n\nHere are Nguyen\u2019s top tips about how to prepare for an internship at NVIDIA:\nWhat are you looking for in an NVIDIA intern?\nAside from having the relevant technical skills, I look for students who are able to showcase communication, problem-solving and reasoning in alignment with NVIDIA\u2019s innovative mindset. We look for people who can show how they\u2019ve been able to practically apply their skills \u2014 whether it\u2019s via extracurriculars, volunteering or coursework.\nHow can intern candidates stand out?\nI\u2019m always impressed by students who have a deeper understanding of our company\u2019s mission and impact, or have firsthand experience using NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\nMake sure you truly understand the breadth of NVIDIA\u2019s work and how our technology impacts the world. Knowing what makes you passionate about working here makes you a stronger candidate.\nHow should students interested in interning at NVIDIA get started?\nStart at our University Recruiting Careers page to search for open positions.\nFocus is key \u2014 go for the two or three roles you\u2019re passionate about and in which you\u2019d make the most impact, instead of applying to 50 that look okay. Look out for opportunities posted on our Careers page starting in the fall.\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Credit: Aethero\n\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Cosmic Shielding Corp. is supporting the upcoming launch of a radiation-hardened edge computer from San Francisco startup Aethero.The computer, scheduled to fly July 10 on the SpaceX Falcon-9 Transporter-11 rideshare from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, includes Nvida\u2019s Jetson Orin NX graphics processing unit.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the fastest AI-capable chip in space,\u201d Yanni\u00a0Barghouty, CSC co-founder and CEO, told SpaceNews.Atlanta-based CSC, founded in 2021, began testing its 3D-printed nanocomposite metal material, called Plasteel, on a 2023 Axiom Space mission to the International Space Station. Additional CSC Plasteel and radiation detectors were sent into low-Earth orbit in March on a Quantum Space satellite.The upcoming flight will demonstrate CSC\u2019s ability to protect a commercial-off-the-shelf \u201cflight computer using extremely vulnerable components,\u201d Barghouty said.Lead Time, Cost and AvailabilityIf the demonstration is successful, it may help convince space companies to forgo radiation-hardened components designed for spaceflight.\u201cBeing able to tap into that terrestrial semiconductor industry supply chain would do wonders for lead times and availability,\u201d Barghouty said. \u201cThen, being able to use these COTS systems safely is huge for cost.\u201dThe powerful GPUs offer advantages for Earth-observation and high-throughput-communications satellites as well as space-based data centers and in-space servicing, assembly, manufacturing, Barghouty said. CSC began working with Aethero in March. After using CSC\u2019s proprietary technology to enclose Aethero\u2019s NxN edge computing module for the upcoming flight, the companies talked about jointly offering a new line of computers, Barghouty said.\u201cCosmic Shielding is the only company we\u2019ve seen to offer shielding that makes it possible for advanced state-of-the-art processors to operate in deep space for long-term missions,\u201d Edward Ge, Aethero CEO and co-founder, said in a statement. \u201cEnabling spacecraft to perform computationally heavy tasks will be a major bottleneck if we ever want to be a multi-planetary species.\u201d\n\nRelated\n \n\nTagged: Aethero,\u00a0Cosmic Shielding Corporation,\u00a0edge processing,\u00a0Transporter-11 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDebra Werner\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDebra Werner is a correspondent for SpaceNews based in San Francisco.\n\nDebra earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications from the University of California, Berkeley, and a master\u2019s degree in Journalism from Northwestern University.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report from Morgan Stanley cited by United Daily News, Nvidia and its partners will charge roughly $2 million to $3 million per AI server cabinet equipped with Nvidia's upcoming\u00a0Blackwell GPUs. The industry will need tens of thousands of AI servers in 2025, and their aggregate cost will exceed $200 billion.So far, Nvidia has introduced two 'reference' AI server cabinets based on its Blackwell architecture: the NVL36, equipped with 36 B200 GPUs, which is expected to cost from $2 million ($1.8 million, according to previous reports), and the NVL72, with 72 B200 GPUs, which is projected to start at $3 million.NVL36 and NVL72 server cabinets (or PODs) will be available not only from Nvidia itself as well as its traditional partners, such as Foxconn, the world's largest supplier of AI servers, Quanta, and Wistron but also from newcomers, such as Asus. Assuming that Nvidia's partner TSMC can produce enough B100 and B200 GPUs using its 4nm-class lithography process technology and packaged using its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) technology, availability from newcomers should ease the tight supply of actual Blackwell-based machines.Based on the UDN report citing Morgan Stanley, Nvidia anticipates shipping between 60,000 and 70,000 B200 server cabinets, each priced between $2 million and $3 million next year. It translates to an estimated annual revenue of at least $210 billion from these machines, which means that companies like AWS and Microsoft will spend even more. It brings us to math by Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn, who believes that the AI industry has to earn around\u00a0$600 billion to pay off machines and data centers.Demand for AI servers is setting records and will not slow down any time soon, which will benefit both makers of AI servers and developers of AI GPUs. Despite the influx of competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are set to remain the de facto standard for training and many inference workloads, which benefits the company.Based on talks with industry sources, the same Morgan Stanley report revealed that international giants such as Amazon Web Services, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will all adopt Nvidia's Blackwell GPU for AI servers. As a result, demand is now projected to exceed expectations, so Nvidia is prompted to increase its orders with TSMC by approximately 25%, the report claims.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (6)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

This approach encourages models that generalize well to any question about e-commerce, proving the model\u2019s capability to handle real-world scenarios effectively.\nDespite these constraints, Team NVIDIA\u2019s innovative approach outperformed all competitors by using Qwen2-72B, a just-released LLM with 72 billion parameters, fine-tuned on eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, and employing QLoRA, a technique for fine-tuning models with datasets.\nAbout the KDD Cup 2024\nThe KDD Cup, organized by the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, or ACM SIGKDD, is a prestigious annual competition that promotes research and development in the field.\nThis year\u2019s challenge, hosted by Amazon, focused on mimicking the complexities of online shopping with the goal of making it a more intuitive and satisfying experience using large language models. Organizers utilized the test dataset ShopBench \u2014 a benchmark that replicates the massive challenge for online shopping with 57 tasks and about 20,000 questions derived from real-world Amazon shopping data \u2014 to evaluate participants\u2019 models.\nThe ShopBench benchmark focused on four key shopping skills, along with a fifth \u201call-in-one\u201d challenge:\n\nShopping Concept Understanding: Decoding complex shopping concepts and terminologies.\nShopping Knowledge Reasoning: Making informed decisions with shopping knowledge.\nUser Behavior Alignment: Understanding dynamic customer behavior.\nMultilingual Abilities: Shopping across languages.\nAll-Around: Solving all tasks from the previous tracks in a unified solution.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Winning Solution\nNVIDIA\u2019s winning solution involved creating a single model for each track.\nThe team fine-tuned the just-released Qwen2-72B model using eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs for approximately 24 hours. The GPUs provided fast and efficient processing, significantly reducing the time required for fine-tuning.\n\nFirst, the team generated training datasets based on the provided examples and synthesized additional data using Llama 3 70B hosted on build.nvidia.com.\nNext, they employed QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), a training process using the data created in step one. QLoRA modifies a smaller subset of the model\u2019s weights, allowing efficient training and fine-tuning.\nThe model was then quantized \u2014 making it smaller and able to run on a system with a smaller hard drive and less memory \u2014 with AWQ 4-bit and used the vLLM inference library to predict the test datasets on four NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs within the time constraints.\nThis approach secured the top spot in each individual track and the overall first place in the competition\u2014a clean sweep for NVIDIA for the second year in a row.\nThe team plans to submit a detailed paper on its solution next month and plans to present its findings at KDD 2024 in Barcelona.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Data Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Image credit: Shutterstock/Michael Vi.\n\n\nSince last year, NVIDIA has generated shockwaves in many industries \u2013 with healthcare being no exception.\nBoasting a market cap of $2.92trn, the tech powerhouse is one of the most valuable companies in the world \u2013 and even briefly occupied the global top spot last month. Shares in NVIDIA\u2014 up about 785% since the start of 2023\u2014 paint the rise of the company and the emergence of AI.\nGo deeper with GlobalDataReportsGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Powerplay: What\u2019s in the Bi...

Where are the biggest opportunities in this sector?\nDavid Ruau [DR]: I would rephrase the premise of the question. I would instead say that healthcare made in-roads into AI for treating patients, inventing new drugs, and developing new technologies in medical devices. There is a massive amount of data generated in healthcare, and that naturally led to the need to have an accelerated computing platform. And yes, NVIDIA has been ideally placed to fulfil this particular market segment because of our graphics processing unit (GPU) capabilities. The GPU, being a processing unit that allows parallel processing of data on a massive scale, is a game-changing approach. It is not that we pushed into the healthcare domain for AI, it was an emerging market, and we grew with it.\nDavid Ruau, EMEA business development lead, healthcare and life sciences.\nA good use case for us has been digital radiology and medical imaging. Medical imaging has been one of the very first sectors of the healthcare market that we addressed, and we made very strong partnerships in this space. AI has been very important for image processing. Applications for digital radiology popped up and became much more mainstream\u2014being able to process images such as the segmentation of organs and bones. That\u2019s what our partners have developed. And yes, they needed a computing platform which was fit for purpose, and that was by NVIDIA.\nRB: NVIDIA has partnerships with big pharma such as Amgen and Genentech. Do you think the majority of drugs arriving to market in the future will be designed by AI?\nDR: The classic question! A drug is never designed by one single software. If readers should take away one thing from this interview, it\u2019s that it takes a large group of individuals, skills, and know-how to deliver a drug to patients. It\u2019s not only a story about algorithms. We can\u2019t just generate a prompt (\u201cthe greatest prompt in history!\u201d) and ask it to create a new drug for a particular disease and have it go and do everything: target ID, design, animal testing, toxicity, and submission to the FDA. At least for now, it does not work like that.\nAI provides tools and increases our capacity to process data. So instead of searching and reading every single paper, you can ask an AI agent to summarise a lot of them. It helps humans make sense of such a vast volume of information and literature. But designing new drugs is a really complex endeavour. AI agents can help in some tasks but are not the only tool.\nAI is speeding up the drug development process by simplifying some steps to allow better choices. But it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution. \u00a0\nRB: Where do you see regulation with AI heading, and will it facilitate or hamper its long-term use in healthcare?\nDR: At NVIDIA, we pay very careful attention to this particular topic. We think it\u2019s a healthy debate to have within the society. People do wonder, what is going on with a particular technology. And it\u2019s part of the process to demystify it. The progress made by these AI agents is quite surprising and it\u2019s normal that people who are not close to the subject \u2013 which is in a way, the vast majority of us \u2013 wonder about the consequences. The debate around the regulation of AI is helping to demystify the topics. A regulation coming into place is the conclusion of reflection from the society, and that is a very healthy thing.\nIt will help the adoption of AI, and help guide us in the right direction. And this happens whether a company likes it or not. We need this reflection to be able to progress in our research to create the best algorithm for the job.\nRB: A recent survey showed that the majority of US employees have concerns about AI. How close is healthcare, at the level of medical staff, to accepting AI?\nDR: We spend quite a lot of energy in this space [of demystification]. There are already quite a few companies developing tools to simplify the workload and reduce the burden on the medical staff. One example is Hippocratic AI \u2013 a company we highlighted at our last GTC conference. Hippocratic AI is a virtual interface, powered by a large language model, which helps patients to adhere to their therapeutic regimen. Not only does it alleviate the burden of needing medical staff to do that, but it also helps people to be treated at home.\nVirtual assistants are not a new concept, but finally, we are beginning to see them being implemented in real life; for example in AI applications for taking medical notes and saving time for doctors, and it can go even further nowadays. We also see some innovation along those lines with AI agents that are used as \u2018copilots\u2019 for a medical doctor, the latter still being the one in charge.\nRB: How will AI in healthcare look in 2050?\nDR: Nobody can predict anything with certainty, but I think AI will be in every application we use. It will be the new type of \u2018transaction\u2019. Jensen Huang [NVIDIA\u2019s CEO] described this concept in his keynote this year at GTC. It is a new commodity. AI engines are basically producing tokens, interpreting what you say, and answering questions. It can be applied to many domains of data coming in and information coming out, and that\u2019s basically what we describe as AI factories.\nResearch is progressing, and the future is looking very bright for this technology in healthcare. It will be pervasive, both in the daily lives of patients and in new drug research such as NVIDIA\u2019s BioNeMo [a generative AI platform for drug discovery]. It comes back to what I said at the start, AI expands our available toolbox. \u00a0\nThe future will be based on the present, and the present is going in this particular direction at the moment. [AI factories] are powering all the tools that we use every day. It\u2019s a new \u201ciPhone\u201d moment for AI, and it\u2019s not only benefiting NVIDIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our daily news round-up!\nGive your business an edge with our leading

but the approach has seen limited success outside of the cryptomining industry.The sector is hopeful that increasing thermal design points (TDP) will cause traditional data center businesses to reevaluate the technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 3M\n\n\n\nThe hire would \"apply their expertise in chemistry and materials science and to help develop mechanical/thermal and electrical immersion cooled designs for Nvidia's next-generation GPU and DGX products,\" the listing states.The role would involve developing \"meticulous testing procedures for evaluating the performance and compatibility of cooling fluids and wetted materials in data center environments,\" and \"mitigation strategies to address any issues identified during testing.\"Among the factors expected to be tracked are \"chemical leaching from components into the fluid, component degradation, fluid degradation, heat transfer efficiency, corrosion resistance, and environmental impact.\"The hire is expected to have experience with single phase and two phase immersion cooling systems.Nvidia is separately developing a modular data center with a cooling system that combines direct-to-chip, pumped two-phase and single-phase immersion in a rack manifold with built-in pumps and a liquid-vapor separator, as part of the DOE's Coolerchips program.\"The design cools chips with a two-phase cold plate, while the rest of the server components with lower power density will be submerged inside a hermetically sealed immersion sled with the servers cooled using green refrigerants for the two-phase cooling and dielectric fluid for the immersion,\" the project notes state. \"The two-phase porous metal cold plate will achieve a thermal resistance as low as 0.0025\u00b0C/W.\"Nvidia was awarded $5 million in 2023 to work on the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Cooling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing AI Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\nModine scores $180m contract from new AI data center customer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nLiquid cooling as a catalyst for sustainable operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Workforce & Skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Dec 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormer T-Mobile CEO John Legere joins Paradise Mobile board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSecuring operational continuity -

Now, the beverage company, through its partnership with WPP Open X, is beginning to scale its global campaigns with generative AI from NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA NIM microservices.\n\u201cWith NVIDIA, we can personalize and customize Coke and meals imagery across 100-plus markets, delivering on hyperlocal relevance with speed and at global scale,\u201d said Samir Bhutada, global vice president of StudioX Digital Transformation at The Coca-Cola Company.\nCoca-Cola has been working with WPP to develop digital twin tools and roll out Prod X \u2014 a custom production studio experience created specifically for the beverage maker to use globally.\nWPP announced today at SIGGRAPH that The Coca-Cola Company will be an early adopter for integrating the new NVIDIA NIM microservices for Universal Scene Description (aka OpenUSD) into its Prod X roadmap. OpenUSD is a 3D framework that enables interoperability between software tools and data types for building virtual worlds. NIM inference microservices provide models as optimized containers.\nThe USD Search NIM allows WPP to tap into a large archive of models to create on-brand assets, and the USD Code NIM can be used to assemble them into scenes.\nThese NIM microservices will enable Prod X users to create 3D advertising assets that contain culturally relevant elements on a global scale, using prompt engineering to quickly make adjustments to AI-generated images so that brands can better target their products at local markets.\n\nTapping Into NVIDIA NIM Microservices to Deploy Generative AI\u00a0\nWPP said that the NVIDIA NIM microservices will have a lasting impact on the 3D engineering and art world.\nThe USD Search NIM can make WPP\u2019s massive visual asset libraries quickly available via written prompts. The USD Code NIM allows developers to enter prompts and get Python code to create novel 3D worlds.\n\u201cThe beauty of the solution is that it compresses multiple phases of the production process into a single interface and process,\u201d said Perry Nightingale, senior vice president of creative AI at WPP, of the new NIM microservices. \u201cIt empowers artists to get more out of the technology and create better work.\u201d\nRedefining Content Production With Production Studio\nWPP recently announced the release of Production Studio on WPP Open, the company\u2019s intelligent marketing operating system powered by AI. Co-developed with its production company, Hogarth, Production Studio taps into the Omniverse development platform and OpenUSD for its generative AI-enabled product configurator workflows.\nProduction Studio can streamline and automate multilingual text, image and video creation, simplifying content creation for advertisers and marketers, and directly addresses the challenges advertisers continue to face in producing brand-compliant and product-accurate content at scale.\n\u201cOur groundbreaking research with NVIDIA Omniverse for the past few years, and the research and development associated with having built our own core USD pipeline and decades of experience in 3D workflows, is what made it possible for us to stand up a tailored experience like this for The Coca-Cola Company,\u201d said Priti Mhatre, managing director for strategic consulting and AI at Hogarth.\nSIGGRAPH attendees can hear more about WPP\u2019s efforts by joining the company\u2019s session on \u201cRobotics, Generative AI, and OpenUSD: How WPP Is Building the Future of Creativity.\u201d\nNVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang will also be featured at the event in fireside chats with Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and WIRED Senior Writer Lauren Goode.

This blog is part 1 of a 2-part series.\nAmazon EKS is a managed service for running Kubernetes workloads on AWS. We can use EKS to orchestrate NVIDIA NIM (plural: NIMs) pods across multiple nodes, because it automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key tasks. EKS also integrates with AWS networking, security, and infrastructure \u2013 leveraging all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure. You can find all the details in the EKS documentation.\nTo follow along, you can find the code in our awsome-inference GitHub repository. This repo contains reference architectures and test cases for inference on AWS. The examples cover a variety of models, use-cases, and frameworks for inference optimization.\nIntroducing NVIDIA NIM\nNVIDIA NIM (or just NIM for the rest of this post) is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise, available on the AWS Marketplace. NIM is a set of easy-to-use microservices designed for secure, reliable deployment of high-performance AI model inference supporting the next generation of world-class generative AI applications. NIM offers developers a number of benefits including ease of use, performance at scale, and security. For more information on NIM, check out the NIM Documentation or Getting Started pages.\nEase of use\nNIM speeds up time-to-market with pre-built, cloud-native containerized microservices that are continuously maintained to deliver optimized inference on NVIDIA GPU accelerated instances.\nPerformance and scale\nNIM can improve the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by providing low latency, high throughput inference for AI applications, that scales on EKS depending upon the number of incoming requests. We\u2019ll cover NIM performance and benchmarking in-depth in a future blog post. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the performance advantage of NIM now, you can check out NVIDIA\u2019s blog with Hugging Face.\nSecurity\nBy hosting NIM on EKS, you can leverage enterprise-grade software with dedicated feature branches, security patching, rigorous validation processes, and enterprise support, including access to NVIDIA AI experts. This way, you can maintain security, and control, of your generative AI applications.\nTo learn more about hosting on AWS, check out Amazon EC2 Accelerated Computing Instances, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon EKS. You can also explore the latest community-built AI models optimized and accelerated by NVIDIA NIM on NVIDIA AI.\nThis post focuses on Amazon EKS, and walks you through deploying the Llama3-8B NIM on a single node of Amazon EC2 G5 instances. The g5.48xlarge instance is powered by 8 x NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs. To learn more about g5 EC2 instances, check out Amazon EC2 G5 Instances.\nYou can also use a smaller g5 instance (for example, the g5.12xlarge). The default profile of the Llama3-8B NIM is fp16, which means it takes up 16GB of GPU memory just for the model. If you want to follow along, we recommend having at least 24 GB of GPU memory so you can fully leverage the optimization benefits provided by NVIDIA NIM. To learn more about NIM profiles, check out the Deploying the NIM section in this post.\nSteps to deploy the Llama3-8B NIM onto a single g5.48xlarge instance\nArchitecture: What you will be deploying\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 This is the architecture diagram of what you will be provisioning during this 2-part-blog series. During this blog, we will provision EKS Resources (the Control Plane VPC is automatically provisioned in AWS\u2019 account, and is fully managed), including the pods and worker node groups (g5.48xlarge in this blog). Additionally, we will also provision the Data Plane VPC and associated resources \u2013 Subnets (Public & Private), NAT Gateways, and the Internet Gateway. In part 2, we will cover Autoscaling (for both the cluster and pods) and Load Balancing (Ingress of type Application Load Balancer).\n\nSince this post focuses on the Llama3-8B model in fp16, we won\u2019t need multiple instances provisioned to accommodate it (since the model fits on one GPU). We\u2019ll talk about the shared file system (Amazon EFS) in a future post \u2013 when we talk about larger model NIMs.\nDeploying into your AWS account\nPrerequisites\nBefore you proceed, please ensure you have the NVIDIA AI Enterprise License (NVAIE) to access the NIMs. To learn more about how you can get access, go to build.nvidia.com and provide your corporate email address.\nTo get started, clone the awsome-inference GitHub Repository:\ngit clone https://GitHub.com/aws-samples/awsome-inference.git\nMake sure that the following packages are installed:\n\naws cli\neksctl\nkubectl\ndocker\nhelm\n\nYou can find shell scripts to install each one of these packages in the aws-do-eks repository in the directory aws-do-eks/Container-Root/eks/ops/setup/:\n\n./install-aws-cli.sh\n./install-eksctl.sh\n./install-kubectl.sh\n./install-docker.sh\n./install-helm.sh\n\nAlternatively, you may choose to install the packages manually. You can find instructions for this in the README file on the GitHub repo.\nSet up your NGC Personal API Key, so that you are ready to download the NIM Docker Images. Once you have that set up, export it as a command-line variable:\n\nexport NGC_CLI_API_KEY=\u201dkey from ngc\u201d\n\nThe NGC Personal API Key is required for using the NGC Service through the Docker client \u2013 or via the NGC CLI. To learn more about the NGC Service, please check out the NGC catalog.\nLastly, run aws configure to authenticate with AWS. The examples on GitHub \u2013 and in this post \u2013 use the region us-east-2 to provision resources. Feel free to change this, as required. Make sure you consistently use the same region throughout the deployment process.\nSetting up your VPC and EKS cluster\nYou can find all the resources for this sub-section in the sub-directory:\ncd 1.infrastructure/\nIn this directory, you\u2019ll find the files needed to get a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and an EKS cluster, set up in your own environment.\nTo set up your VPC, go to the directory:\ncd 0_setup_vpc/\nIn this directory, you\u2019ll find vpc-cf-example.yaml, which is an AWS CloudFormation template for deploying a VPC with a pair of public and private subnets, spread across two Availability Zones (AZ). It also includes an Internet gateway, a default route on the public subnets, a pair of NAT gateways (one in each AZ), and default routes for them in the private subnets. For more information on this CloudFormation template, check out AWS CloudFormation VPC Template.\nTo deploy the VPC Stack, please download the VPC Template (called vpc-cf-example.yaml), and navigate to the CloudFormation console. Once there, hit Create Stack. Under step 1, hit Choose an existing template, and Upload a template file. You can leave the rest of the steps as defaults.\nNote: The instructions described below walk you through setting up an EKS Cluster only if you do not use Capacity Blocks for ML. If you wish to use Capacity Blocks for ML, please follow the instructions in the Capacity Blocks section of the awsome-inference/1.infrastructure README to set up the EKS Cluster and self-managed node groups.\nNext, to set up your EKS Cluster, navigate back to the 1.infrastructure/ and then go to the 1_setup_cluster/ directory:\ncd 1_setup_cluster/\nThis sub-directory contains YAML cluster configurations, templates, and examples to aid you setting up clusters for inference. Within this directory, you should find nims-cluster-config-example.yaml.\nThis cluster configuration is an example configuration that you can use to spin up a managed EKS cluster of p5.48xlarge instances that you have reserved via the On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR). You can use this example configuration as-is, or with modifications to set up your EKS cluster.\nWe\u2019ve commented out the capacityReservation field in this example configuration. If you want to use an ODCR, please uncomment lines 63-65 on the configuration file and fill in your own details that map to your ODCR.\n# Uncomment the lines below (capacityReservation) if you use an ODCR\n# capacityReservation:\n#   capacityReservationTarget:\n#     capacityReservationID: \"cr-0ce6be6d411d2f43f\"\n\nNext are some of the parameters that you may need to change in the nims-cluster-config-example.yaml file:\n\n$PLACEHOLDER_VPC_ID\n$PLACEHOLDER_SUBNET_PRIVATE_1\n$PLACEHOLDER_SUBNET_PRIVATE_2\n$PLACEHOLDER_SUBNET_PUBLIC_1\n$PLACEHOLDER_SUBNET_PUBLIC_2\n$INSTANCE_TYPE\n$PUBLIC_KEYPAIR_NAME\n$SECURITY_GROUP_IDS\n\nParameters 1-5 can be found using your CLI:\naws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <YOUR_VPC_STACK_NAME>\nParameters 7 and 8 have to be changed if you\u2019d like ssh access to your worker nodes. For the rest of this post, we\u2019ll set parameter 5 ($INSTANCE_TYPE) to g5.48xlarge. If you\u2019d like to make any other changes, just consult README for 1.infrastructure.\nDeploying the NIM\nBefore deploying the NIM, it is important to understand the different profiles available for this. With each NIM, NVIDIA releases different profiles that you can choose based on what infrastructure you wish to run on, or what you wish to test.\nThis profile is chosen by default based on your infrastructure. You can customize the infrastructure you run your NIM on with EKS \u2013 for example, you can specify how many GPUs are available per pod with the following lines in your manifest, and a NIM profile that is optimized for 1 GPU is automatically chosen.\nresources:\n  limits:\n    nvidia.com/gpu: 1\n\nAlternatively, you may choose to specify a profile, if multiple profiles are available. For example, you can choose an fp8 profile that lets you use an fp8-quantized version of the base model.\nTo learn more about the NIM profiles available for you to use, follow these steps:\n\nEnsure you have your EKS cluster up and running (following the steps described in the section above), and that you have your NIM pod(s) deployed.\nOnce your EKS cluster and pods are up and running, to execute into the pod, run:\n\nkubectl exec -it <pod name> -- cat /etc/nim/config/model_manifest.yaml\n\nIf you want to use a specific profile, you can specify the profile\u2019s SHA value in the yaml file like this:\n\n...\n# @param env [array] Adds arbitrary environment variables to the main container\n env: \n - name: NIM_MODEL_PROFILE\n   value: 30b562864b5b1e3b236f7b6d6a0998efbed491e4917323d04590f715aa9897dc\"\n... \n\nNow that you have your infrastructure set up, you can start provisioning pods to host your NIM(s).\nNavigate to the nims-inference directory:\ncd 2.projects/nims-inference\nOnce there, you should see a helm example in the nim-deploy directory. This directory is cloned from NVIDIA\u2019s nim-deploy repository.\nBefore running the helm command below, please ensure that you\u2019ve set the NGC CLI API key as described in the \u201cPrerequisites\u201d section.\nTo get your NIM up and running without any configuration changes, you may run:\ncd nim-deploy/helm\nhelm install my-nim nim-llm/ --set model.ngcAPIKey=$NGC_CLI_API_KEY --set persistence.enabled=true\n\nThis helm install command uses the default values.yaml file. You also have the option to use custom values helm files. More on this in the README on NVIDIA\u2019S nim-deploy repository.\nIf you run into any issues here, refer to the Troubleshooting section later in this post.\nOnce you deploy the pod, running kubectl get pods should show something like:\nmy-nim-0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1/1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Running\u00a0\u00a0 0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10s\nTo test whether you can query the NIM pod, try port forwarding like this:\nkubectl port-forward service/my-nim-nim-llm 8000:8000\nThen, in another terminal, run:\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n'http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"content\": \"You are a polite and respectful chatbot helping people plan a vacation.\",\n      \"role\": \"system\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"content\": \"What should I do for a 4 day vacation in Spain?\",\n      \"role\": \"user\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"model\": \"meta/llama3-8b-instruct\",\n  \"max_tokens\": 16,\n  \"top_p\": 1,\n  \"n\": 1,\n  \"stream\": false,\n  \"stop\": \"\\n\",\n  \"frequency_penalty\": 0.0\n}'\n\nThis should return something like:\n{\"id\":\"cmpl-228f8ceabea1479caff6142c33478f3b\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"created\":1720470045,\"model\":\"meta/llama3-8b-instruct\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Spain is a wonderful destination! With four days, you can definitely get a taste\"},\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"stop_reason\":null}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":42,\"total_tokens\":58,\"completion_tokens\":16}}\nAnd: Congrats! You now have a NIM pod up and running on a single g5.48xlarge instance. You can also now stop the port forward service.\nTroubleshooting\nThe most common issues we\u2019ve seen relate to Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (PVC). This is because, by default, the helm charts provided don\u2019t install the ebs-csi controllers for you. If you find yourself blocked by PVC errors, try this:\n\nCheck all pods with kubectl get pods -A\nGet the logs of the aws-node-xxxx pod and check the three containers (with the -c flag): \n         \naws-node\naws-eks-nodeagent\naws-vpc-cni-init\n \nCheck the status of your PVCs with the kubectl get pvc -A If the PVC controller isn\u2019t installed \u2013 or if you see an error here \u2013 run the steps below.\nInstall the PVC controller using:\n\nkubectl apply -k \"GitHub.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.27\"\n\nOnce you\u2019ve run this, you should have the EBS CSI controller installed on your cluster, and you should be able to deploy your pod without any errors. Redeploy (using helm install) your configuration after making these changes.\n\nBenchmarking\nThe GitHub repository also contains some example code to get you started with collecting performance metrics against your deployed NIM. To do this, we use the NVIDIA genai-perf tool. genai-perf is a command-line benchmarking tool for measuring inference metrics of models served through an inference server.\nSome of the metrics provided by this tool are: output token throughput, time to first token, inter token latency, and request throughput. For more on the tool, check out the GenAI-Perf Documentation.\nOnce you\u2019ve tested your NIM, you can set up a service of type ClusterIP to expose a port on your container.\nkubectl apply -f nim-deploy/helm/nim-llm/nodeport.yaml\nWe have a sample benchmarking script under benchmark/benchmark_concurrency.sh, that will run benchmarking with multiple concurrencies:\ncd benchmark/\n./benchmark_concurrency.sh\n\nYou can then copy the benchmarking data from the genai-perf pod to your local:\nkubectl cp <POD_NAME>:/workspace/benchmarks <YOUR_LOCAL_PATH>\nOnce done, you should terminate the benchmark deployment:\n./terminate_benchmark.sh\nYou can directly change any of the flags used by genai-perf tool in the genai-perf.yaml manifest found in the same benchmark/ directory, too.\nThis process saves a .csv and .json file onto your local system. These files contain the benchmarking metrics we mentioned. Alternatively, you can check which pod has prefix genai-perf, and run:\nkubectl logs <pod-name>\nThis is what an example output will look like:\n\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Screenshot of an example log of running the genai-perf tool. You may safely ignore any ERROR messages that you see in these logs, and the cut off values too \u2013 the benchmarking scripts on the awsome-inference GitHub Repository get you the relevant CSV and JSON files that contain the complete benchmarking numbers.\n\nWe\u2019ll focus on benchmarking metrics in depth in a future blog post. For now, we hope this post provided you with enough to get started benchmarking your NIM deployments.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nNow you\u2019re able to have the Llama3-8B NIM deployed on a single g5.48xlarge instance using EKS as an orchestrator. In a future blog post, we will focus on:\n\nScaling your NIM with EKS\nLoad Balancing across NIM pods with EKS\nBenchmarking: Which instance should you run on? How many NIM pods can you fit per GPU? What scale can you take this to?\nUsing other NIMs.\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we\u2019ve shown you how to leverage Amazon EKS to orchestrate the deployment of pods containing NVIDIA NIMs, to enable quick-to-setup and optimized large-scale Large Language Model (LLM) inference on AWS G5 instances.\nNVIDIA NIM can empower researchers and developers to run optimized inference in their applications, and Amazon EKS can help with the orchestration. Together, these scale NIM easily and efficiently to thousands of GPUs, resulting in accelerated time-to-market for cutting edge AI applications.\nTo learn more about deploying NVIDIA NIM and the associated infrastructure, refer to AWS Samples.

Now it's an AI giant with 70% to 95% of the market share for AI chips, and the brains of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It's also the best-performing stock with the highest return in the past 25 years.Why did Nvidia invest in AI chips over 10 years ago, ahead of the competition? CEO Jensen Huang and board member Mark Stevens, Nvidia's two largest individual shareholders, talked to Sequoia Capital partner Roelof Botha to explain what Botha called \"one of the most remarkable business pivots in history.\"Nvidia's original product was 3D graphics cards for PC games, but company leaders noticed by the mid-2000s that the PC market was hitting a growth limit.Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Turned Down a Merger Offer in the Company's Early Days, According to Insiders. Here's Why.\"We felt we were always gonna be boxed into the PC gaming market and always knocking heads with Intel if we didn't develop a brand new market that nobody else was in,\" Stevens explained.\n\n\n\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia. Photographer: Lionel Ng/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThat need for a new market intersected with a product Nvidia already had on hand: its graphics processor unit, or GPU, which could be used to power tasks outside of gaming. Researchers at universities across the world began exploring the graphics cards, eventually building advanced computers with them.Related: Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia? Former Morgan Stanley Strategist Says 'Buy High, Sell Higher.'\n\n\nHuang recalled meeting a quantum chemist in Taiwan who showed him a closet with a \"giant array\" of Nvidia's GPUs on its shelves; house fans were rotating to keep the system cool.\"He said, 'I built my own personal supercomputer.' And he said to me that because of our work\u2026 he's able to do his work in his lifetime,\" Huang said.Other researchers, like Meta AI chief Yann LeCun in New York, began reaching out to Nvidia about the computing power of its chips. Nvidia began considering the AI market when AI had yet to enter the mainstream and was a \"zero billion dollar market\" or a market that had yet to materialize.\"There was no guarantee that AI would ever really emerge because, keep in mind, AI had had many stops and starts over the last 40 years,\" Stevens said. \"I mean, AI has been around as a computer science concept for decades. But it had never really taken off as a huge market opportunity.\"\n\n\nRelated: Nvidia Is 'Slowly Becoming the IBM of the AI Era,' According to the Leader of a $2 Billion AI StartupHuang and other company leaders still believed in AI and decided to invest billions in the tech in the 2010s.\"This was a giant pivot for our company,\" Huang said. \"The company's focus was steered away from its core business.\"Huang highlighted the extra cost, talent, and skills Nvidia had to account for with the pivot, as it affected the entire company. It took 10 to 15 years of effort, but that business decision led to Nvidia powering the AI revolution with an early ChatGPT partnership.\n\n\n\"Every CEO's job is supposed to look around corners,\" Huang said. \"You want to be the person who believes the company can achieve more than the company believes it can.\"Related: How to Be a Billionaire By 25, According to a College Dropout Turned CEO Worth $1.6 Billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWavy Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWavy Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherin Shibu\nEntrepreneur Staff\nNews Reporter\n\n\n\n      Sherin Shibu is a business news reporter at Entrepreneur.com.

The generator attempts to create realistic, lifelike imagery, while the discriminator tries to tell the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s generated. As its neural networks keep challenging each other, GANs get better and better at making realistic-looking samples.\nGANs excel at understanding complex data patterns and creating high-quality results. They\u2019re used in applications including image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation and image-to-image translation.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GauGAN, named after post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, is an AI demo for photorealistic image generation. Built by NVIDIA Research, it directly led to the development of the NVIDIA Canvas app \u2014 and can be experienced for free through the NVIDIA AI Playground.\nGauGAN has been wildly popular since it debuted at NVIDIA GTC in 2019 \u2014 used by art teachers, creative agencies, museums and millions more online.\nGiving Sketch to Scenery a Gogh\nPowered by GauGAN and local NVIDIA RTX GPUs, NVIDIA Canvas uses AI to turn simple brushstrokes into realistic landscapes, displaying results in real time.\nUsers can start by sketching simple lines and shapes with a palette of real-world elements like grass or clouds \u2014- referred to in the app as \u201cmaterials.\u201d\n\nThe AI model then generates the enhanced image on the other half of the screen in real time. For example, a few triangular shapes sketched using the \u201cmountain\u201d material will appear as a stunning, photorealistic range. Or users can select the \u201ccloud\u201d material and with a few mouse clicks transform environments from sunny to overcast.\nThe creative possibilities are endless \u2014 sketch a pond, and other elements in the image, like trees and rocks, will reflect in the water. Change the material from snow to grass, and the scene shifts from a cozy winter setting to a tropical paradise.\nCanvas offers nine different styles, each with 10 variations and 20 materials to play with.\nCanvas features a Panorama mode that enables artists to create 360-degree images for use in 3D apps. YouTuber Greenskull AI demonstrated Panorama mode by painting an ocean cove, before then importing it into Unreal Engine 5.\n\nDownload the NVIDIA Canvas app to get started.\nConsider exploring NVIDIA Broadcast, another AI-powered content creation app that transforms any room into a home studio. Broadcast is free for RTX GPU owners.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

It uses Italy\u2019s Leonardo supercomputer, accelerated with nearly 14,000 NVIDIA GPUs, as an example of a system advancing work in fields from automobile design and drug discovery to weather forecasting.\nEnergy-efficiency gains over time for the most efficient supercomputer on the TOP500 list. Source: TOP500.org\nWhy Accelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing\nAccelerated computing uses the parallel processing of NVIDIA GPUs to do more work in less time. As a result, it consumes less energy than general-purpose servers that employ CPUs built to handle one task at a time.\nThat\u2019s why accelerated computing is sustainable computing.\nAccelerated systems use parallel processing on GPUs to do more work in less time, consuming less energy than CPUs.\nThe gains are even greater when accelerated systems apply AI, an inherently parallel form of computing that\u2019s the most transformative technology of our time.\n\u201cWhen it comes to frontier applications like machine learning or deep learning, the performance of GPUs is an order of magnitude better than that of CPUs,\u201d the report said.\nBy transitioning from CPU-only operations to GPU-accelerated systems, HPC and AI workloads can save over 40 terawatt-hours of energy annually, equivalent to the electricity needs of nearly 5 million U.S. homes.\nNVIDIA offers a combination of GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs tailored to maximize energy efficiency with accelerated computing.\nUser Experiences With Accelerated AI\nUsers worldwide are documenting energy-efficiency gains with AI and accelerated computing.\nIn financial services, Murex \u2014 a Paris-based company with a trading and risk-management platform used daily by more than 60,000 people \u2014 tested the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip. On its workloads, the CPU-GPU combo delivered a 4x reduction in energy consumption and a 7x reduction in time to completion compared with CPU-only systems (see chart below).\n\u201cOn risk calculations, Grace is not only the fastest processor, but also far more power-efficient, making green IT a reality in the trading world,\u201d said Pierre Spatz, head of quantitative research at Murex.\nThe Grace Hopper GPU gave Murex a 4x reduction in energy consumption and a 7x performance improvement compared to CPU-based systems.\nIn manufacturing, Taiwan-based Wistron built a digital copy of a room where NVIDIA DGX systems undergo thermal stress tests to improve operations at the site. It used NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for industrial digitization, with a surrogate model, a version of AI that emulates simulations.\nThe digital twin, linked to thousands of networked sensors, enabled Wistron to increase the facility\u2019s overall energy efficiency by up to 10%. That amounts to reducing electricity consumption by 120,000 kWh per year and carbon emissions by a whopping 60,000 kilograms.\nUp to 80% Fewer Carbon Emissions\nThe RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark can reduce the carbon footprint for data analytics, a widely used form of machine learning, by as much as 80% while delivering 5x average speedups and 4x reductions in computing costs, according to a recent benchmark.\nThousands of companies \u2014 about 80% of the Fortune 500 \u2014 use Apache Spark to analyze their growing mountains of data. Companies using NVIDIA\u2019s Spark accelerator include Adobe, AT&T and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\n\nIn healthcare, Insilico Medicine discovered and put into phase 2 clinical trials a drug candidate for a relatively rare respiratory disease, thanks to its NVIDIA-powered AI platform.\nUsing traditional methods, the work would have cost more than $400 million and taken up to six years. But with generative AI, Insilico hit the milestone for one-tenth of the cost in one-third of the time.\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone not only for us, but for everyone in the field of AI-accelerated drug discovery,\u201d said Alex Zhavoronkov, CEO of Insilico Medicine.\nThis is just a sampler of results that users of accelerated computing and AI are pursuing at companies such as Amgen, BMW, Foxconn, PayPal and many more.\nSpeeding Science With Accelerated AI\u00a0\nIn basic research, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s lead facility for open science, measured results on a server with four NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs compared with dual-socket x86 CPU servers across four of its key high-performance computing and AI applications.\nResearchers found that the apps, when accelerated with the NVIDIA A100 GPUs, saw energy efficiency rise 5x on average (see below). One application, for weather forecasting, logged gains of nearly 10x.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy reported energy efficiency gains of 5x on average using NVIDIA GPUs\nScientists and researchers worldwide depend on AI and accelerated computing to achieve high performance and efficiency.\nIn a recent ranking of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient supercomputers, known as the Green500, NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top six spots, and 40 of the top 50.\nUnderestimated Energy Savings\nThe many gains across industries and science are sometimes overlooked in forecasts that extrapolate only the energy consumption of training the largest AI models. That misses the benefits from most of an AI model\u2019s life when it\u2019s consuming relatively little energy, delivering the kinds of efficiencies users described above.\nIn an analysis citing dozens of sources, a recent study debunked as misleading and inflated projections based on training models.\n\u201cJust as the early predictions about the energy footprints of e-commerce and video streaming ultimately proved to be exaggerated, so too will those estimates about AI likely be wrong,\u201d said the report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington-based think tank.\nThe report notes as much as 90% of the cost \u2014 and all the efficiency gains \u2014 of running an AI model are in deploying it in applications after it\u2019s trained.\n\u201cGiven the enormous opportunities to use AI to benefit the economy and society \u2014 including transitioning to a low-carbon future \u2014 it is imperative that policymakers and the media do a better job of vetting the claims they entertain about AI\u2019s environmental impact,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, who described his findings in a recent podcast.\nOthers Cite AI\u2019s Energy Benefits\nPolicy analysts from the R Street Institute, also in Washington, D.C., agreed.\n\u201cRather than a pause, policymakers need to help realize the potential for gains from AI,\u201d the group wrote in a 1,200-word article.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and the rise of AI hold great promise for the future, with significant societal benefits in terms of economic growth and social welfare,\u201d it said, citing demonstrated benefits of AI in drug discovery, banking, stock trading and insurance.\nAI can make the electric grid, manufacturing and transportation sectors more efficient, it added.\nAI Supports Sustainability Efforts\nThe reports also cited the potential of accelerated AI to fight climate change and promote sustainability.\n\u201cAI can enhance the accuracy of weather modeling to improve public safety as well as generate more accurate predictions of crop yields. The power of AI can also contribute to \u2026 developing more precise climate models,\u201d R Street said.\nThe Lisbon report added that AI plays \u201ca crucial role in the innovation needed to address climate change\u201d for work such as discovering more efficient battery materials.\nHow AI Can Help the Environment\nITIF called on governments to adopt AI as a tool in efforts to decarbonize their operations.\nPublic and private organizations are already applying NVIDIA AI to protect coral reefs, improve tracking of wildfires and extreme weather, and enhance sustainable agriculture.\nFor its part, NVIDIA is working with hundreds of startups employing AI to address climate issues. NVIDIA also announced plans for Earth-2, expected to be the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to climate science.\nEnhancing Energy Efficiency Across the Stack\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has worked on energy efficiency across all its products \u2014 GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, networks, systems and software, as well as platforms such as Omniverse.\nIn AI, the brunt of an AI model\u2019s life is in inference, delivering insights that help users achieve new efficiencies. The NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip has demonstrated 25x energy efficiency over the prior NVIDIA Hopper GPU generation in AI inference.\nOver the last eight years, NVIDIA GPUs have advanced a whopping 45,000x in their energy efficiency running large language models (see chart below).\nLLM inference energy consumption plummeted 45,000x in eight years, thanks to advances in NVIDIA GPUs.\nRecent innovations in software include TensorRT-LLM. It can help GPUs reduce 3x the energy consumption of LLM inference.\nHere\u2019s an eye-popping stat: If the efficiency of cars improved as much as NVIDIA has advanced the efficiency of AI on its accelerated computing platform, cars would get 280,000 miles per gallon. That means you could drive to the moon on less than a gallon of gas.\nThe analysis applies to the fuel efficiency of cars NVIDIA\u2019s whopping 10,000x efficiency gain in AI training and inference from 2016 to 2025 (see chart below).\nHow the big AI efficiency leap from the NVIDIA P100 GPU to the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell compares to car fuel-efficiency gains.\nDriving Data Center Efficiency\nNVIDIA delivers many optimizations through system-level innovations. For example, NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs can reduce power consumption up to 30% by offloading essential data center networking and infrastructure functions from less efficient CPUs.\nIf network infrastructure operations transitioned to DPUs, data center operators could achieve 30% of energy savings per server\nLast year, NVIDIA received a $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy \u2014 the largest of 15 grants from a pool of more than 100 applications \u2014 to design a new liquid-cooling technology for data centers. It will run 20% more efficiently than today\u2019s air-cooled approaches and has a smaller carbon footprint.\nThese are just some of the ways NVIDIA contributes to the energy efficiency of data centers.\nSupercomputers make energy efficiency gains with NVIDIA hardware, software and networking.\nData centers are among the most efficient users of energy and one of the largest consumers of renewable energy.\nThe ITIF report notes that between 2010 and 2018, global data centers experienced a 550% increase in compute instances and a 2,400% increase in storage capacity, but only a 6% increase in energy use, thanks to improvements across hardware and software.\nNVIDIA continues to drive energy efficiency for accelerated AI, helping users in science, government and industry accelerate their journeys toward sustainable computing.\nTry NVIDIA\u2019s energy-efficiency calculator to find ways to improve energy efficiency.

It lets creators quickly prototype 3D assets and generate 360 HDRi backgrounds that light scenes, using just text or image prompts.\nGetty Images, a premier visual content creator and marketplace, turbocharged its Generative AI by Getty Images service so it creates images twice as fast, improves output quality, brings advanced controls and enables fine-tuning.\nThe services are built with NVIDIA\u2019s visual AI foundry using NVIDIA Edify, a multimodal generative AI architecture. The AI models are then optimized and packaged for maximum performance with NVIDIA NIM, a set of accelerated microservices for AI inference.\nEdify enables service providers to train responsible generative models on their licensed data and scale them quickly with NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the cloud-first way to get the best of NVIDIA AI.\nGenerative AI Speeds 3D Modeling\nAvailable now for enterprises in commercial beta, Shutterstock\u2019s service lets designers and artists quickly create 3D objects that help them prototype or populate virtual environments. For example, tapping generative AI, they can quickly create the silverware and plates on a dining room table so they can focus on designing the characters around it.\nThe 3D assets the service generates are ready to edit using digital content creation tools, and available in a variety of popular file formats. Their clean geometry and layout gives artists an advanced starting point for adding their own flair.\n\nAn example of a 3D mesh from Shutterstock Generative 3D.\nThe AI model first delivers a preview of a single asset in as little as 10 seconds. If users like it, the preview can be turned into a higher-quality 3D asset, complete with physically based rendering materials like concrete, wood or leather.\nAt this year\u2019s SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference, designers will see just how fast they can make their ideas come to life.\nShutterstock will demo a workflow in Blender that lets artists generate objects directly within their 3D environment. In the Shutterstock booth at SIGGRAPH, HP will show 3D prints and physical prototypes of the kinds of assets attendees can design on the show floor using Generative 3D.\nShutterstock is also working with global marketing and communications services company WPP to bring ideas to life with Edify 3D generation for virtual production (see video below).\n\nExplore Generative 3D by Shutterstock on the company\u2019s website, or test-drive the application programming interface (API) at build.nvidia.com.\nVirtual Lighting Gets Real\nLighting a virtual scene with accurate reflections can be a complicated task. Creatives need to operate expensive 360-degree camera rigs and go on set to create backgrounds from scratch, or search vast libraries for something that approximates what they want.\nWith Shutterstock\u2019s Generative 3D service, users can now simply describe the exact environment they need in text or with an image, and out comes a high-dynamic-range panoramic image, aka 360 HDRi, in brilliant 16K resolution. (See video below.)\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_HDRi_SD_30fps_fast.mp4\nWant that beautiful new sports car shown in a desert, a tropical beach or maybe on a winding mountain road? With generative AI, designers can shift gears fast.\nThree companies plan to integrate Shutterstock\u2019s 360 HDRi APIs directly into their workflows \u2014 WPP, CGI studio Katana and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, developer of the 3DEXCITE applications for creating high-end visualizations and 3D content for virtual worlds.\nExamples from Generative AI by Getty Images.\nGreat Images Get a Custom Fit\nGenerative AI by Getty Images has upgraded to a more powerful Edify AI model with a portfolio of new features that let artists control image composition and style.\nWant a red beach ball floating above that perfect shot of a coral reef in Fiji? Getty Images\u2019 service can get it done in a snap.\nThe new model is twice as fast, boosts image quality and prompt accuracy, and lets users control camera settings like the depth of field or focal length of a shot. Users can generate four images in about six seconds and scale them up to 4K resolution.\nAn example of the camera controls in Generative AI by Getty Images.\nIn addition, the commercially safe foundational model now serves as the basis for a fine-tuning capability that lets companies customize the AI with their own data. That lets them generate images tailored to the creative style of their specific brands.\nNew controls in the service support the use of a sketch or depth map to guide the composition or structure of an image.\nCreatives at Omnicom, a global leader in marketing and sales solutions, are using Getty Images\u2019 service to streamline advertising workflows and safely create on-brand content. The collaboration with Getty Images is part of Omnicom\u2019s strategy to infuse generative AI into every facet of its business, helping teams move from ideas to outcomes faster.\nGenerative AI by Getty Images is available through the Getty Images and iStock websites, and via an API.\nFor more about NVIDIA\u2019s offerings, read about the AI foundry for visual generative AI built on NVIDIA DGX Cloud, and try it on ai.nvidia.com.\nTo get the big picture, listen to NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in two fireside chats at SIGGRAPH.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | Customer Stories | DGX Cloud | Events | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NIM | SIGGRAPH 2024 | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, the technology can also help them more effectively navigate the physical world.\nNVIDIA announced at SIGGRAPH generative physical AI advancements including the NVIDIA Metropolis reference workflow for building interactive visual AI agents and new NVIDIA NIM microservices that will help developers train physical machines and improve how they handle complex tasks.\nThese include three fVDB NIM microservices that support NVIDIA\u2019s new deep learning framework for 3D worlds, as well as the USD Code, USD Search and USD Validate NIM microservices for working with Universal Scene Description (aka OpenUSD).\nThe NVIDIA OpenUSD NIM microservices work together with the world\u2019s first generative AI models for OpenUSD development \u2014 also developed by NVIDIA \u2014 to enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workflows and broaden the possibilities of 3D worlds.\nNVIDIA NIM Microservices Transform Physical AI Landscapes\nPhysical AI uses advanced simulations and learning methods to help robots and other industrial automation more effectively perceive, reason and navigate their surroundings. The technology is transforming industries like manufacturing and healthcare, and advancing smart spaces with robots, factory and warehouse technologies, surgical AI agents and cars that can operate more autonomously and precisely.\nNVIDIA offers a broad range of NIM microservices customized for specific models and industry domains. NVIDIA\u2019s suite of NIM microservices tailored for physical AI supports capabilities for speech and translation, vision and intelligence, and realistic animation and behavior.\nTurning Visual AI Agents Into Visionaries With NVIDIA NIM\nVisual AI agents use computer vision capabilities to perceive and interact with the physical world and perform reasoning tasks.\nHighly perceptive and interactive visual AI agents are powered by a new class of generative AI models called vision language models (VLMs), which bridge digital perception and real-world interaction in physical AI workloads to enable enhanced decision-making, accuracy, interactivity and performance. With VLMs, developers can build vision AI agents that can more effectively handle challenging tasks, even in complex environments.\nGenerative AI-powered visual AI agents are rapidly being deployed across hospitals, factories, warehouses, retail stores, airports, traffic intersections and more.\nTo help physical AI developers more easily build high-performing, custom visual AI agents, NVIDIA offers NIM microservices and reference workflows for physical AI. The NVIDIA Metropolis reference workflow provides a simple, structured approach for customizing, building and deploying visual AI agents, as detailed in the blog.\nNVIDIA NIM Helps K2K Make Palermo More Efficient, Safe and Secure\nCity traffic managers in Palermo, Italy, deployed visual AI agents using NVIDIA NIM to uncover physical insights that help them better manage roadways.\nK2K, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, is leading the effort, integrating NVIDIA NIM microservices and VLMs into AI agents that analyze the city\u2019s live traffic cameras in real time. City officials can ask the agents questions in natural language and receive fast, accurate insights on street activity and suggestions on how to improve the city\u2019s operations, like adjusting traffic light timing.\n\nLeading global electronics giants Foxconn and Pegatron have adopted physical AI, NIM microservices and Metropolis reference workflows to more efficiently design and run their massive manufacturing operations.\nThe companies are building virtual factories in simulation to save significant time and costs. They\u2019re also running more thorough tests and refinements for their physical AI \u2014 including AI multi-camera and visual AI agents \u2014 in digital twins before real-world deployment, improving worker safety and leading to operational efficiencies.\nBridging the Simulation-to-Reality Gap With Synthetic Data Generation\nMany AI-driven businesses are now adopting a \u201csimulation-first\u201d approach for generative physical AI projects involving real-world industrial automation.\nManufacturing, factory logistics and robotics companies need to manage intricate human-worker interactions, advanced facilities and expensive equipment. NVIDIA physical AI software, tools and platforms \u2014 including physical AI and VLM NIM microservices, reference workflows and fVDB \u2014 can help them streamline the highly complex engineering required to create digital representations or virtual environments that accurately mimic real-world conditions.\nVLMs are seeing widespread adoption across industries because of their ability to generate highly realistic imagery. However, these models can be challenging to train because of the immense volume of data required to create an accurate physical AI model.\nSynthetic data generated from digital twins using computer simulations offers a powerful alternative to real-world datasets, which can be expensive \u2014 and sometimes impossible \u2014 to acquire for model training, depending on the use case.\nTools like NVIDIA NIM microservices and Omniverse Replicator let developers build generative AI-enabled synthetic data pipelines to accelerate the creation of robust, diverse datasets for training physical AI. This enhances the adaptability and performance of models such as VLMs, enabling them to generalize more effectively across industries and use cases.\nAvailability\nDevelopers can access state-of-the-art, open and NVIDIA-built foundation AI models and NIM microservices at ai.nvidia.com. The Metropolis NIM reference workflow is available in the GitHub repository, and Metropolis VIA microservices are available for download in developer preview.\nOpenUSD NIM microservices are available in preview through the NVIDIA API catalog.\nWatch how accelerated computing and generative AI are transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s fireside chats at SIGGRAPH.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Computer Vision | Digital Twin | Industrial and Manufacturing | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NIM | Omniverse | Physical AI | SIGGRAPH 2024 | Smart Spaces | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Hewlett Packard Enterprise Cray XD system will feature NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking for superior performance and scalability.\nABCI 3.0 is the latest iteration of Japan\u2019s large-scale Open AI Computing Infrastructure designed to advance AI R&D. This collaboration underlines Japan\u2019s commitment to advancing its AI capabilities and fortifying its technological independence.\n\u201cIn August 2018, we launched ABCI, the world\u2019s first large-scale open AI computing infrastructure,\u201d said AIST Executive Officer Yoshio Tanaka. \u201cBuilding on our experience over the past several years managing ABCI, we\u2019re now upgrading to ABCI 3.0. In collaboration with NVIDIA and HPE we aim to develop ABCI 3.0 into a computing infrastructure that will advance further research and development capabilities for generative AI in Japan.\u201d\n\u201cAs generative AI prepares to catalyze global change, it\u2019s crucial to rapidly cultivate research and development capabilities within Japan,\u201d said AIST Solutions Co. Producer and Head of ABCI Operations Hirotaka Ogawa. \u201cI\u2019m confident that this major upgrade of ABCI in our collaboration with NVIDIA and HPE will enhance ABCI\u2019s leadership in domestic industry and academia, propelling Japan towards global competitiveness in AI development and serving as the bedrock for future innovation.\u201d\nThe ABCI 3.0 supercomputer will be housed in Kashiwa at a facility run by Japan\u2019s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.

To meet this demand, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) today announced NVIDIA L40S GPU bare-metal instances available to order and the upcoming availability of a new virtual machine accelerated by a single NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. This new VM expands OCI\u2019s existing H100 portfolio, which includes an NVIDIA HGX H100 8-GPU bare-metal instance.\nPaired with NVIDIA networking and running the NVIDIA software stack, these platforms deliver powerful performance and efficiency, enabling enterprises to advance generative AI.\nNVIDIA L40S Now Available to Order on OCI\nThe NVIDIA L40S is a universal data center GPU designed to deliver breakthrough multi-workload acceleration for generative AI, graphics and video applications. Equipped with fourth-generation Tensor Cores and support for the FP8 data format, the L40S GPU excels in training and fine-tuning small- to mid-size LLMs and in inference across a wide range of generative AI use cases.\nFor example, a single L40S GPU (FP8) can generate up to 1.4x more tokens per second than a single NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU (FP16) for Llama 3 8B with NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM at an input and output sequence length of 128.\nThe L40S GPU also has best-in-class graphics and media acceleration. Its third-generation NVIDIA Ray Tracing Cores (RT Cores) and multiple encode/decode engines make it ideal for advanced visualization and digital twin applications.\nThe L40S GPU delivers up to 3.8x the real-time ray-tracing performance of its predecessor, and supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 for faster rendering and smoother frame rates. This makes the GPU ideal for developing applications on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, enabling real-time, photorealistic 3D simulations and AI-enabled digital twins. With Omniverse on the L40S GPU, enterprises can develop advanced 3D applications and workflows for industrial digitalization that will allow them to design, simulate and optimize products, processes and facilities in real time before going into production.\nOCI will offer the L40S GPU in its BM.GPU.L40S.4 bare-metal compute shape, featuring four NVIDIA L40S GPUs, each with 48GB of GDDR6 memory. This shape includes local NVMe drives with 7.38TB capacity, 4th Generation Intel Xeon CPUs with 112 cores and 1TB of system memory.\nThese shapes eliminate the overhead of any virtualization for high-throughput and latency-sensitive AI or machine learning workloads with OCI\u2019s bare-metal compute architecture. The accelerated compute shape features the NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU for improved server efficiency, offloading data center tasks from CPUs to accelerate networking, storage and security workloads. The use of BlueField-3 DPUs furthers OCI\u2019s strategy of off-box virtualization across its entire fleet.\nOCI Supercluster with NVIDIA L40S enables ultra-high performance with 800Gbps of internode bandwidth and low latency for up to 3,840 GPUs. OCI\u2019s cluster network uses NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NICs over RoCE v2 to support high-throughput and latency-sensitive workloads, including AI training.\n\u201cWe chose OCI AI infrastructure with bare-metal instances and NVIDIA L40S GPUs for 30% more efficient video encoding,\u201d said Sharon Carmel, CEO of Beamr Cloud. \u201cVideos processed with Beamr Cloud on OCI will have up to 50% reduced storage and network bandwidth consumption, speeding up file transfers by 2x and increasing productivity for end users. Beamr will provide OCI customers video AI workflows, preparing them for the future of video.\u201d\nSingle-GPU H100 VMs Coming Soon on OCI\u00a0\nThe VM.GPU.H100.1 compute virtual machine shape, accelerated by a single NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, is coming soon to OCI. This will provide cost-effective, on-demand access for enterprises looking to use the power of NVIDIA H100 GPUs for their generative AI and HPC workloads.\nA single H100 provides a good platform for smaller workloads and LLM inference. For example, one H100 GPU can generate more than 27,000 tokens per second for Llama 3 8B (up to 4x more throughput than a single A100 GPU at FP16 precision) with NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM at an input and output sequence length of 128 and FP8 precision.\nThe VM.GPU.H100.1 shape includes 2\u00d73.4TB of NVMe drive capacity, 13 cores of 4th Gen Intel Xeon processors and 246GB of system memory, making it well-suited for a range of AI tasks.\n\u201cOracle Cloud\u2019s bare-metal compute with NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs, low-latency Supercluster and high-performance storage delivers up to 20% better price-performance for Altair\u2019s computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics solvers,\u201d said Yeshwant Mummaneni, chief engineer of data management analytics at Altair. \u201cWe look forward to leveraging these GPUs with virtual machines for the Altair Unlimited virtual appliance.\u201d\nGH200 Bare-Metal Instances Available for Validation\nOCI has also made available the BM.GPU.GH200 compute shape for customer testing. It features the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip and NVLink-C2C, a high-bandwidth, cache-coherent 900GB/s connection between the NVIDIA Grace CPU and NVIDIA Hopper GPU. This provides over 600GB of accessible memory, enabling up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU.\nOptimized Software for Enterprise AI\u00a0\nEnterprises have a wide variety of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate their AI, HPC and data analytics workloads on OCI. However, maximizing the full potential of these GPU-accelerated compute instances requires an optimized software layer.\nNVIDIA NIM, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform available on the OCI Marketplace, is a set of easy-to-use microservices designed for secure, reliable deployment of high-performance AI model inference to deploy world-class generative AI applications.\nOptimized for NVIDIA GPUs, NIM pre-built containers offer developers improved cost of ownership, faster time to market and security. NIM microservices for popular community models, found on the NVIDIA API Catalog, can be deployed easily on OCI.\nPerformance will continue to improve over time with upcoming GPU-accelerated instances, including NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs.\nOrder the L40S GPU and test the GH200 Superchip by reaching out to OCI.

This flexibility is crucial for businesses looking to stay agile in a rapidly changing market.\nIf an NVIDIA AI Foundry customer needs assistance, NVIDIA AI Enterprise experts are on hand to help. NVIDIA experts can walk customers through each of the steps required to build, fine-tune and deploy their models with proprietary data, ensuring the models tightly align with their business requirements.\nNVIDIA AI Foundry customers have access to a global ecosystem of partners that can provide a full range of support. Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro are among the NVIDIA partners that offer AI Foundry consulting services that encompass design, implementation and management of AI-driven digital transformation projects. Accenture is first to offer its own AI Foundry-based offering for custom model development, the Accenture AI Refinery framework.\nAdditionally, service delivery partners such as Data Monsters, Quantiphi, Slalom and SoftServe help enterprises navigate the complexities of integrating AI into their existing IT landscapes, ensuring that AI applications are scalable, secure and aligned with business objectives.\nCustomers can develop NVIDIA AI Foundry models for production using AIOps and MLOps platforms from NVIDIA partners, including ActiveFence, AutoAlign, Cleanlab, DataDog, Dataiku, Dataloop, DataRobot, Deepchecks, Domino Data Lab, Fiddler AI, Giskard, New Relic, Scale, Tumeryk and Weights & Biases.\nCustomers can output their AI Foundry models as NVIDIA NIM inference microservices \u2014 which include the custom model, optimized engines and a standard API \u2014 to run on their preferred accelerated infrastructure.\nInferencing solutions like NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM deliver improved efficiency for Llama 3.1 models to minimize latency and maximize throughput. This enables enterprises to generate tokens faster while reducing total cost of running the models in production. Enterprise-grade support and security is provided by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.\nNVIDIA NIM and TensorRT-LLM minimize inference latency and maximize throughput for Llama 3.1 models to generate tokens faster.\nThe broad range of deployment options includes NVIDIA-Certified Systems from global server manufacturing partners including Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro, as well as cloud instances from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nAdditionally, Together AI, a leading AI acceleration cloud, today announced it will enable its ecosystem of over 100,000 developers and enterprises to use its NVIDIA GPU-accelerated inference stack to deploy Llama 3.1 endpoints and other open models on DGX Cloud.\n\u201cEvery enterprise running generative AI applications wants a faster user experience, with greater efficiency and lower cost,\u201d said Vipul Ved Prakash, founder and CEO of Together AI. \u201cNow, developers and enterprises using the Together Inference Engine can maximize performance, scalability and security on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\u201d\nNVIDIA NeMo Speeds and Simplifies Custom Model Development\nWith NVIDIA NeMo integrated into AI Foundry, developers have at their fingertips the tools needed to curate data, customize foundation models and evaluate performance. NeMo technologies include:\n\nNeMo Curator is a GPU-accelerated data-curation library that improves generative AI model performance by preparing large-scale, high-quality datasets for pretraining and fine-tuning.\nNeMo Customizer is a high-performance, scalable microservice that simplifies fine-tuning and alignment of LLMs for domain-specific use cases.\nNeMo Evaluator provides automatic assessment of generative AI models across academic and custom benchmarks on any accelerated cloud or data center.\nNeMo Guardrails orchestrates dialog management, supporting accuracy, appropriateness and security in smart applications with large language models to provide safeguards for generative AI applications.\n\nUsing the NeMo platform in NVIDIA AI Foundry, businesses can create custom AI models that are precisely tailored to their needs. This customization allows for better alignment with strategic objectives, improved accuracy in decision-making and enhanced operational efficiency. For instance, companies can develop models that understand industry-specific jargon, comply with regulatory requirements and integrate seamlessly with existing workflows.\n\u201cAs a next step of our partnership, SAP plans to use NVIDIA\u2019s NeMo platform to help businesses to accelerate AI-driven productivity powered by SAP Business AI,\u201d said Philipp Herzig, chief AI officer at SAP.\nEnterprises can deploy their custom AI models in production with NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM inference microservices. These help developers fetch proprietary data to generate knowledgeable responses for their AI applications with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\u201cSafe, trustworthy AI is a non-negotiable for enterprises harnessing generative AI, with retrieval accuracy directly impacting the relevance and quality of generated responses in RAG systems,\u201d said Baris Gultekin, Head of AI, Snowflake. \u201cSnowflake Cortex AI leverages NeMo Retriever, a component of NVIDIA AI Foundry, to further provide enterprises with easy, efficient, and trusted answers using their custom data.\u201d\nCustom Models Drive Competitive Advantage\nOne of the key advantages of NVIDIA AI Foundry is its ability to address the unique challenges faced by enterprises in adopting AI. Generic AI models can fall short of meeting specific business needs and data security requirements. Custom AI models, on the other hand, offer superior flexibility, adaptability and performance, making them ideal for enterprises seeking to gain a competitive edge.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA AI Foundry allows enterprises to boost productivity and innovation.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | DGX Cloud | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  NVIDIA announced at SIGGRAPH fVDB, a new deep-learning framework for generating AI-ready virtual representations of the real world.\nfVDB is built on top of OpenVDB, the industry-standard library for simulating and rendering sparse volumetric data such as water, fire, smoke and clouds.\nGenerative physical AI, such as autonomous vehicles and robots that inhabit the real world, need to have \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d \u2014 the ability to understand and operate in 3D space.\nCapturing the large scale and super-fine details of the world around us is essential. But converting reality into a virtual representation to train AI is hard.\nRaw data for real-world environments can be collected through many different techniques, like neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and lidar. fVDB translates this data into massive, AI-ready environments rendered in real time.\n\nBuilding on a decade of innovation in the OpenVDB standard, the introduction of fVDB at SIGGRAPH represents a significant leap forward in how industries can benefit from digital twins of the real world.\nReality-scale virtual environments are used for training autonomous agents. City-scale 3D models are captured by drones for climate science and disaster planning. Today, 3D generative AI is even used to plan urban spaces and smart cities.\nfVDB enables industries to tap into spatial intelligence on a larger scale and with higher resolution than ever before, making physical AI even smarter.\nThe framework builds NVIDIA-accelerated AI operators on top of NanoVDB, a GPU-accelerated data structure for efficient 3D simulations. These operators include convolution, pooling, attention and meshing, all of which are designed for high-performance 3D deep learning applications.\nAI operators allow businesses to build complex neural networks for spatial intelligence, like large-scale point cloud reconstruction and 3D generative modeling.\nfVDB is the result of a long-running effort by NVIDIA\u2019s research team and is already used to support NVIDIA Research, NVIDIA DRIVE and NVIDIA Omniverse projects that require high-fidelity models of large, complex real-world spaces.\nKey Advantages of fVDB\n\nLarger: 4x larger spatial scale than prior frameworks\nFaster: 3.5x faster than prior frameworks\nInteroperable: Businesses can fully tap into massive real-world datasets. fVDB reads VDB datasets into full-sized 3D environments. AI-ready and real-time rendered for building physical AI with spatial intelligence.\nMore powerful: 10x more operators than prior frameworks. fVDB simplifies processes by combining functionalities that previously required multiple deep-learning libraries.\n\nfVDB will soon be available as NVIDIA NIM inference microservices. A trio of the microservices will enable businesses to incorporate fVDB into OpenUSD workflows, generating AI-ready OpenUSD geometry in NVIDIA Omniverse, a development platform for industrial digitalization and generative physical AI applications. They are:\n\nfVDB Mesh Generation NIM \u2014 Generates digital 3D environments of the real world\nfVDB NeRF-XL NIM \u2014 Generates large-scale NeRFs in OpenUSD using Omniverse Cloud APIs\nfVDB Physics Super-Res NIM \u2014 Performs super-resolution to generate an OpenUSD-based, high-resolution physics simulation\n\nOver the past decade, OpenVDB, housed at the Academy Software Foundation, has earned multiple Academy Awards as a core technology used throughout the visual-effects industry. It has since grown beyond entertainment to industrial and scientific uses, like industrial design and robotics.\nNVIDIA continues to enhance the open-source OpenVDB library. Four years ago, the company introduced NanoVDB, which added GPU support to OpenVDB. This delivered an order-of-magnitude speed-up, enabling faster performance and easier development, and opening the door to real-time simulation and rendering.\nTwo years ago, NVIDIA introduced NeuralVDB, which builds machine learning on top of NanoVDB to compress the memory footprint of VDB volumes up to 100x, allowing creators, developers and researchers to interact with extremely large and complex datasets.\nfVDB builds AI operators on top of NanoVDB to unlock spatial intelligence at the scale of reality. Apply to the early-access program for the fVDB PyTorch extension. fVDB will also be available as part of the OpenVDB GitHub repository.\nDive deeper into fVDB in this technical blog and watch how accelerated computing and generative AI are transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation and growth in NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s two fireside chats at SIGGRAPH.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | SIGGRAPH 2024 | Simulation and Design | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Evans and Levinson highlighted how Zoox pioneered the concept of a robotaxi purpose-built for ride-hailing and created groundbreaking innovations along the way, using NVIDIA technology.\n\u201cThe world has never seen a robotics company like this before,\u201d said Huang. \u201cZoox started out solely as a sustainable robotics company that delivers robots into the world as a fleet.\u201d\nSince 2014, Zoox has been on a mission to create fully autonomous, bidirectional vehicles purpose-built for ride-hailing services. This sets it apart in an industry largely focused on retrofitting existing cars with self-driving technology.\n\nA decade later, the company is operating its robotaxi, powered by NVIDIA GPUs, on public roads.\nComputing at the Core\nZoox robotaxis are, at their core, supercomputers on wheels. They\u2019re built on multiple NVIDIA GPUs dedicated to processing the enormous amounts of data generated in real time by their sensors.\nThe sensor array includes cameras, lidar, radar, long-wave infrared sensors and microphones. The onboard computing system rapidly processes the raw sensor data collected and fuses it to provide a coherent understanding of the vehicle\u2019s surroundings.\nThe processed data then flows through a perception engine and prediction module to planning and control systems, enabling the vehicle to navigate complex urban environments safely.\nNVIDIA GPUs deliver the immense computing power required for the Zoox robotaxis\u2019 autonomous capabilities and continuous learning from new experiences.\nUsing Simulation as a Virtual Proving Ground\nKey to Zoox\u2019s AV development process is its extensive use of simulation. The company uses NVIDIA GPUs and software tools to run a wide array of simulations, testing its autonomous systems in virtual environments before real-world deployment.\nThese simulations range from synthetic scenarios to replays of real-world scenarios created using data collected from test vehicles. Zoox uses retrofitted Toyota Highlanders equipped with the same sensor and compute packages as its robotaxis to gather driving data and validate its autonomous technology.\nThis data is then fed back into simulation environments, where it can be used to create countless variations and replays of scenarios and agent interactions.\nZoox also uses what it calls \u201cadversarial simulations,\u201d carefully crafted scenarios designed to test the limits of the autonomous systems and uncover potential edge cases.\nThe company\u2019s comprehensive approach to simulation allows it to rapidly iterate and improve its autonomous driving software, bolstering AV safety and performance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using NVIDIA hardware since the very start,\u201d said Levinson. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of our simulator, and we rely on NVIDIA GPUs in the vehicle to process everything around us in real time.\u201d\nA Neat Way to Seat\nZoox\u2019s robotaxi, with its unique bidirectional design and carriage-style seating, is optimized for autonomous operation and passenger comfort, eliminating traditional concepts of a car\u2019s \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback\u201d and providing equal comfort and safety for all occupants.\n\u201cI came to visit you when you were zero years old, and the vision was compelling,\u201d Huang said, reflecting on Zoox\u2019s evolution over the years. \u201cThe challenge was incredible. The technology, the talent \u2014 it is all world-class.\u201d\nUsing NVIDIA GPUs and tools, Zoox is poised to redefine urban mobility, pioneering a future of safe, efficient and sustainable autonomous transportation for all.\nFrom Testing Miles to Market Projections\nAs the AV industry gains momentum, recent projections highlight the potential for explosive growth in the robotaxi market. Guidehouse Insights forecasts over 5 million robotaxi deployments by 2030, with numbers expected to surge to almost 34 million by 2035.\nThe regulatory landscape reflects this progress, with 38 companies currently holding valid permits to test AVs with safety drivers in California. Zoox is currently one of only six companies permitted to test AVs without safety drivers in the state.\nAs the industry advances, Zoox has created a next-generation robotaxi by combining cutting-edge onboard computing with extensive simulation and development.\nIn the image at top, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang stands with Zoox CEO Aicha Evans and Zoox cofounder and CTO Jesse Levinson in front of a Zoox robotaxi.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Robotics \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

New NVIDIA NeMo Retriever Microservices Boost LLM Accuracy and Throughput\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEnterprises can unlock the value of business data with production-ready NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for retrieval-augmented generation, integrated in Cohesity, DataStax, NetApp and Snowflake platforms.\t\t\t\n\n\nJuly 23, 2024 by Erik Pounds \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Generative AI applications have little, or sometimes negative, value without accuracy \u2014 and accuracy is rooted in data.\nTo help developers efficiently fetch the best proprietary data to generate knowledgeable responses for their AI applications, NVIDIA today announced four new NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM inference microservices.\nCombined with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for the Llama 3.1 model collection, also announced today, NeMo Retriever NIM microservices enable enterprises to scale to agentic AI workflows \u2014 where AI applications operate accurately with minimal intervention or supervision \u2014 while delivering the highest accuracy retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG.\nNeMo Retriever allows organizations to seamlessly connect custom models to diverse business data and deliver highly accurate responses for AI applications using RAG. In essence, the production-ready microservices enable highly accurate information retrieval for building highly accurate AI applications.\nFor example, NeMo Retriever can boost model accuracy and throughput for developers creating AI agents and customer service chatbots, analyzing security vulnerabilities or extracting insights from complex supply chain information.\nNIM inference microservices enable high-performance, easy-to-use, enterprise-grade inferencing. And with NeMo Retriever NIM microservices, developers can benefit from all of this \u2014 superpowered by their data.\nThese new NeMo Retriever embedding and reranking NIM microservices are now generally available:\n\nNV-EmbedQA-E5-v5, a popular community base embedding model optimized for text question-answering retrieval\nNV-EmbedQA-Mistral7B-v2, a popular multilingual community base model fine-tuned for text embedding for high-accuracy question answering\nSnowflake-Arctic-Embed-L, an optimized community model, and\nNV-RerankQA-Mistral4B-v3, a popular community base model fine-tuned for text reranking for high-accuracy question answering.\n\nThey join the collection of NIM microservices easily accessible through the NVIDIA API catalog.\nEmbedding and Reranking Models\nNeMo Retriever NIM microservices comprise two model types \u2014 embedding and reranking \u2014 with open and commercial offerings that ensure transparency and reliability.\nExample RAG pipeline using NVIDIA NIM microservices for Llama 3.1 and NeMo Retriever embedding and reranking NIM microservices for a customer service AI chatbot application.\nAn embedding model transforms diverse data \u2014 such as text, images, charts and video \u2014 into numerical vectors, stored in a vector database, while capturing their meaning and nuance. Embedding models are fast and computationally less expensive than traditional large language models, or LLMs.\nA reranking model ingests data and a query, then scores the data according to its relevance to the query. Such models offer significant accuracy improvements while being computationally complex and slower than embedding models.\nNeMo Retriever provides the best of both worlds. By casting a wide net of data to be retrieved with an embedding NIM, then using a reranking NIM to trim the results for relevancy, developers tapping NeMo Retriever can build a pipeline that ensures the most helpful, accurate results for their enterprise.\nWith NeMo Retriever, developers get access to state-of-the-art open, commercial models for building text Q&A retrieval pipelines that provide the highest accuracy. When compared with alternate models, NeMo Retriever NIM microservices provided 30% fewer inaccurate answers for enterprise question answering.\nComparison of NeMo Retriever embedding NIM and embedding plus reranking NIM microservices performance versus lexical search and an alternative embedder.\nTop Use Cases\nFrom RAG and AI agent solutions to data-driven analytics and more, NeMo Retriever powers a wide range of AI applications.\nThe microservices can be used to build intelligent chatbots that provide accurate, context-aware responses. They can help analyze vast amounts of data to identify security vulnerabilities. They can assist in extracting insights from complex supply chain information. And they can boost AI-enabled retail shopping advisors that offer natural, personalized shopping experiences, among other tasks.\nNVIDIA AI workflows for these use cases provide an easy, supported starting point for developing generative AI-powered technologies.\nDozens of NVIDIA data platform partners are working with NeMo Retriever NIM microservices to boost their AI models\u2019 accuracy and throughput.\nDataStax has integrated NeMo Retriever embedding NIM microservices in its Astra DB and Hyper-Converged platforms, enabling the company to bring accurate, generative AI-enhanced RAG capabilities to customers with faster time to market.\nCohesity will integrate NVIDIA NeMo Retriever microservices with its AI product, Cohesity Gaia, to help customers put their data to work to power insightful, transformative generative AI applications through RAG.\nKinetica will use NVIDIA NeMo Retriever to develop LLM agents that can interact with complex networks in natural language to respond more quickly to outages or breaches \u2014 turning insights into immediate action.\nNetApp is collaborating with NVIDIA to connect NeMo Retriever microservices to exabytes of data on its intelligent data infrastructure. Every NetApp ONTAP customer will be able to seamlessly \u201ctalk to their data\u201d to access proprietary business insights without having to compromise the security or privacy of their data.\nNVIDIA global system integrator partners including Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, LTTS, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, as well as service delivery partners Data Monsters, EXLService (Ireland) Limited, Latentview, Quantiphi, Slalom, SoftServe and Tredence, are developing services to help enterprises add NeMo Retriever NIM microservices into their AI pipelines.\nUse With Other NIM Microservices\nNeMo Retriever NIM microservices can be used with NVIDIA Riva NIM microservices, which\u00a0 supercharge speech AI applications across industries \u2014 enhancing customer service and enlivening digital humans.\nNew models that will soon be available as Riva NIM microservices include: FastPitch and HiFi-GAN for text-to-speech applications; Megatron for multilingual neural machine translation; and the record-breaking NVIDIA Parakeet family of models for automatic speech recognition.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices can be used all together or separately, offering developers a modular approach to building AI applications. In addition, the microservices can be integrated with community models, NVIDIA models or users\u2019 custom models \u2014 in the cloud, on premises or in hybrid environments \u2014 providing developers with further flexibility.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices are available at ai.nvidia.com. Enterprises can deploy AI applications in production with NIM through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nNIM microservices can run on customers\u2019 preferred accelerated infrastructure, including cloud instances from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, as well as NVIDIA-Certified Systems from global server manufacturing partners including Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nNVIDIA Developer Program members will soon be able to access NIM for free for research, development and testing on their preferred infrastructure.\nLearn more about the latest in generative AI and accelerated computing by joining NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, running July 28-Aug. 1 in Denver.\u00a0\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Data Science | NVIDIA NeMo | Open Source | Riva \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  NVIDIA is taking an array of advancements in rendering, simulation and generative AI to SIGGRAPH 2024, the premier computer graphics conference, which will take place July 28 \u2013 Aug. 1 in Denver.\nMore than 20 papers from NVIDIA Research introduce innovations advancing synthetic data generators and inverse rendering tools that can help train next-generation models. NVIDIA\u2019s AI research is making simulation better by boosting image quality and unlocking new ways to create 3D representations of real or imagined worlds.\nThe papers focus on diffusion models for visual generative AI, physics-based simulation and increasingly realistic AI-powered rendering. They include two technical Best Paper Award winners and collaborations with universities across the U.S., Canada, China, Israel and Japan as well as researchers at companies including Adobe and Roblox.\nThese initiatives will help create tools that developers and businesses can use to generate complex virtual objects, characters and environments. Synthetic data generation can then be harnessed to tell powerful visual stories, aid scientists\u2019 understanding of natural phenomena or assist in simulation-based training of robots and autonomous vehicles.\n\nDiffusion Models Improve Texture Painting, Text-to-Image Generation\nDiffusion models, a popular tool for transforming text prompts into images, can help artists, designers and other creators rapidly generate visuals for storyboards or production, reducing the time it takes to bring ideas to life.\nTwo NVIDIA-authored papers are advancing the capabilities of these generative AI models.\nConsiStory, a collaboration between researchers at NVIDIA and Tel Aviv University, makes it easier to generate multiple images with a consistent main character \u2014 an essential capability for storytelling use cases such as illustrating a comic strip or developing a storyboard. The researchers\u2019 approach introduces a technique called subject-driven shared attention, which reduces the time it takes to generate consistent imagery from 13 minutes to around 30 seconds.\nConsiStory is capable of generating a series of images featuring the same character.\nNVIDIA researchers last year won the Best in Show award at SIGGRAPH\u2019s Real-Time Live event for AI models that turn text or image prompts into custom textured materials. This year, they\u2019re presenting a paper that applies 2D generative diffusion models to interactive texture painting on 3D meshes, enabling artists to paint in real time with complex textures based on any reference image.\n\nKick-Starting Developments in Physics-Based Simulation\nGraphics researchers are narrowing the gap between physical objects and their virtual representations with physics-based simulation \u2014 a range of techniques to make digital objects and characters move the same way they would in the real world.\nSeveral NVIDIA Research papers feature breakthroughs in the field, including SuperPADL, a project that tackles the challenge of simulating complex human motions based on text prompts\u00a0(see video at top).\nUsing a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning, the researchers demonstrated how the SuperPADL framework can be trained to reproduce the motion of more than 5,000 skills \u2014 and can run in real time on a consumer-grade NVIDIA GPU.\nAnother NVIDIA paper features a neural physics method that applies AI to learn how objects \u2014 whether represented as a 3D mesh, a NeRF or a solid object generated by a text-to-3D model \u2014 would behave as they are moved in an environment.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Simplicits.mp4\n\u00a0\nA paper written in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University researchers develops a new kind of renderer \u2014 one that, instead of modeling physical light, can perform thermal analysis, electrostatics and fluid mechanics. Named one of five best papers at SIGGRAPH, the method is easy to parallelize and doesn\u2019t require cumbersome model cleanup, offering new opportunities for speeding up engineering design cycles.\n\nIn the example above, the renderer performs a thermal analysis of the Mars Curiosity rover, where keeping temperatures within a specific range is critical to mission success.\u00a0\nAdditional simulation papers introduce a more efficient technique for modeling hair strands and a pipeline that accelerates fluid simulation by 10x.\nRaising the Bar for Rendering Realism, Diffraction Simulation\nAnother set of NVIDIA-authored papers present new techniques to model visible light up to 25x faster and simulate diffraction effects \u2014 such as those used in radar simulation for training self-driving cars \u2014 up to 1,000x faster.\nA paper by NVIDIA and University of Waterloo researchers tackles free-space diffraction, an optical phenomenon where light spreads out or bends around the edges of objects. The team\u2019s method can integrate with path-tracing workflows to increase the efficiency of simulating diffraction in complex scenes, offering up to 1,000x acceleration. Beyond rendering visible light, the model could also be used to simulate the longer wavelengths of radar, sound or radio waves.\nSimulation of cellular signal coverage in a city.\nPath tracing samples numerous paths \u2014 multi-bounce light rays traveling through a scene \u2014 to create a photorealistic picture. Two SIGGRAPH papers improve sampling quality for ReSTIR, a path-tracing algorithm first introduced by NVIDIA and Dartmouth College researchers at SIGGRAPH 2020 that has been key to bringing path tracing to games and other real-time rendering products.\nOne of these papers, a collaboration with the University of Utah, shares a new way to reuse calculated paths that increases effective sample count by up to 25x, significantly boosting image quality. The other improves sample quality by randomly mutating a subset of the light\u2019s path. This helps denoising algorithms perform better, producing fewer visual artifacts in the final render.\nFrom L to R: Compare the visual quality of previous sampling, the 25x improvement and a reference image. Model courtesy Blender Studio.\nTeaching AI to Think in 3D\nNVIDIA researchers are also showcasing multipurpose AI tools for 3D representations and design at SIGGRAPH.\nOne paper introduces fVDB, a GPU-optimized framework for 3D deep learning that matches the scale of the real world. The fVDB framework provides AI infrastructure for the large spatial scale and high resolution of city-scale 3D models and NeRFs, and segmentation and reconstruction of large-scale point clouds.\n\nA Best Technical Paper award winner written in collaboration with Dartmouth College researchers introduces a theory for representing how 3D objects interact with light. The theory unifies a diverse spectrum of appearances into a single model.\nAnd a collaboration with University of Tokyo, University of Toronto and Adobe Research introduces an algorithm that generates smooth, space-filling curves on 3D meshes in real time. While previous methods took hours, this framework runs in seconds and offers users a high degree of control over the output to enable interactive design.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Space-Filling-Curves.mp4\nNVIDIA at SIGGRAPH \n\nLearn more about NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH. Special events include a fireside chat between NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, as well as a fireside chat with Huang and Lauren Goode, senior writer at WIRED, on the impact of robotics and AI in industrial digitalization.\u00a0\nNVIDIA researchers will also present OpenUSD Day by NVIDIA, a full-day event showcasing how developers and industry leaders are adopting and evolving OpenUSD to build AI-enabled 3D pipelines.\nNVIDIA Research has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.

And the GeForce RTX 4090, the world\u2019s fastest consumer graphics card, hits nearly 190 FPS.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, performance increases by an average of 2.3X, enabling nearly all GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs to surpass 100 frames per second, and the GeForce RTX 4090, hits 238 frames per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at 1920x1080, a 2.1X average performance boost enables every GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU to surpass 135 frames per second, and the GeForce RTX 4090 hits 287 frames per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure your frame rates are similarly high, and your experience is otherwise excellent, download and install our brand new GeForce Game Ready Driver, which includes support for Dungeonborne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, Featuring DLSS 3 & Reflex\nFrom games studio A44, makers of Ashen, comes Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, an explosive Souls-lite, where Gods and guns collide in a battle for the future of humanity. The Door to the Great Below has been opened unleashing the Gods and their armies of the Dead. The lands of Kian are besieged, the city of Dawn is on the brink of destruction. Step into the boots of Nor Vanek, an elite member of the Coalition army, joined by Enki, a mysterious fox-like companion, in their quest for vengeance against the Gods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the well-received, widely downloaded Steam Next Fest demo, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn launches July 18th, and PC players with a GeForce RTX GPU can activate DLSS 3 and Reflex the second they start playing to get the definitive PC experience. Additionally, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn\u00a0 leveraged NVIDIA\u2019s Audio2Face to create facial animation and lip syncing from audio, which was further refined in industry-standard apps, dramatically reducing the development time and resources required to animate the game\u2019s facial expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays\nOur newest Game Ready Driver also adds support for 14 G-SYNC Compatible displays that deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother and more enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer\nModel\nHDR\nSize\nPanel Type\nResolution\nVRR Range\n\n\nAcer\nX32X\nYes\n32\nOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-240Hz\n\n\nAOC\nAG276QZD2\nYes\n27\nOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-240Hz\n\n\nASUS\nXG27ACG\nYes\n27\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-180Hz\n\n\nASUS\nPG27AQDP\nYes\n27\nOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-480Hz\n\n\nLG\n27GS93QE\nYes\n27\nOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-240Hz\n\n\nLG\n39GS96QB\nYes\n39\nOLED\n3440x1440 (WQHD)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n48-240Hz\n\n\nLG\n27GS75QN\nYes\n27\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-180Hz\n\n\nLG\n32GS75QN\nYes\n32\nIPS\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-180Hz\n\n\nLG\n27GP95RP\nYes\n27\nNano IPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n48-144Hz\n\n\nLG\n27GP95U\nYes\n27\nNano IPS\n3840x2160 (4K)\n48-144Hz\n\n\nLG\n27GS65F\nYes\n27\nIPS\n1920x1080 (FHD)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n48-180Hz\n\n\nLG\n24GS65F\nYes\n24\nIPS\n1920x1080 (FHD)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n48-180Hz\n\n\nPhilips\n27M2N3200L\nYes\n27\nIPS\n1920x1080 (FHD)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n48-180Hz\n\n\nPhilips\n27M2N8500\nYes\n27\nOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n48-360Hz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese newly-validated monitors give gamers even more choice when searching for a great gaming display.

The live demo highlighted how generative AI can act as an assistant to artists by accelerating ideation and generating custom secondary assets that would otherwise have been sourced from a repository.\nBy drastically decreasing ideation time, these AI technologies will empower 3D artists to be more productive and creative \u2014 giving them the tools to explore concepts faster and expedite parts of their workflows. They could, for example, generate the background assets or 360 HDRi environments that the scene needs in minutes, instead of spending hours finding or creating them.\nFrom Idea to 3D Scene in Three Minutes\nCreating a full 3D scene is a complex, time-consuming task. Artists must support their hero asset with plenty of background objects to create a rich scene, then find an appropriate background and an environment map to light it. Due to time constraints, they\u2019ve often had to make a trade-off between rapid results and creative exploration.\nWith the support of AI agents, creative teams can achieve both goals: quickly bring concepts to life and continue iterating to achieve the right look.\nIn the Real-Time Live demo, the researchers used an AI agent to instruct an NVIDIA Edify-powered model to generate dozens of 3D assets, including cacti, rocks and the skull of a bull \u2014 with previews produced in just seconds.\nThey next directed the agent to harness other models to create potential backgrounds and a layout of how the objects would be placed in the scene \u2014 and showcased how the agent could adapt to last-minute changes in creative direction by quickly swapping the rocks for gold nuggets.\nWith a design plan in place, they prompted the agent to create full-quality assets and render the scene as a photorealistic image in NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer, an app for virtual world-building.\n\nNVIDIA Edify Accelerates Environment Generation\u00a0\nNVIDIA Edify models can help creators focus on hero assets while accelerating the creation of background environments and objects using AI-powered scene generation tools. The Real-Time Live demo showcased two Edify models:\u00a0\n\nEdify 3D generates ready-to-edit 3D meshes from text or image prompts. Within seconds, the model can generate previews, including rotating animations of each object, to help creators rapidly prototype before committing to a specific design.\nEdify 360 HDRi uses text or image prompts to generate up to 16K high-dynamic range images (HDRi) of nature landscapes, which can be used as backgrounds and to light scenes.\n\nDuring the demo, the researchers also showcased an AI agent powered by a large language model, and USD Layout, an AI model that generates scene layouts using OpenUSD, a platform for 3D workflows.\nAt SIGGRAPH, NVIDIA also announced that two leading creative content companies are giving designers and artists new ways to boost productivity with generative AI using tools powered by NVIDIA Edify.\nShutterstock has launched in commercial beta its Generative 3D service, which lets creators quickly prototype and generate 3D assets using text or image prompts. Its 360 HDRi generator based on Edify also entered early access.\nGetty Images updated its Generative AI by Getty Images service with the latest version of NVIDIA Edify. Users can now create images twice as fast, with improved output quality and prompt adherence, and advanced controls and fine-tuning.\nHarnessing Universal Scene Description in NVIDIA Omniverse\nThe 3D objects, environment maps and layouts generated using Edify models are structured with USD, a standard format for describing and composing 3D worlds. This compatibility allows artists to immediately import Edify-powered creations into Omniverse USD Composer.\nWithin Composer, they can use popular digital content creation tools to further modify the scene by, for example, changing the position of objects, modifying their appearance or adjusting lighting.\nReal-Time Live is one of the most anticipated events at SIGGRAPH, featuring about a dozen real-time applications including generative AI, virtual reality and live performance capture technology.

Additionally, they accessed the Dariah cluster, in Lecce, Italy.\nThey used these state-of-the-art resources to simulate the behavior of a certain kind of quantum computing system known as a quantum annealer.\nQuantum computers fundamentally rethink how information is computed to enable entirely new solutions.\n\nUnlike classical computers, which process information in binary \u2014 0s and 1s \u2014 quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can allow information to be processed in entirely new ways.\nQuantum annealers are a special type of quantum computer that, though not universally useful, may have advantages for solving certain types of optimization problems.\nThe paper, \u201cThe Quantum Transition of the Two-Dimensional Ising Spin Glass,\u201d represents a significant step in understanding the phase transition \u2014 a change in the properties of a quantum system \u2014 of Ising spin glass, a disordered magnetic material in a two-dimensional plane, a critical problem in computational physics.\nThe paper addresses the problem of how the properties of magnetic particles arranged in a two-dimensional plane can abruptly change their behavior.\nThe study also shows how GPU-powered systems play a key role in developing approaches to quantum computing.\nGPU-accelerated simulations allow researchers to understand the complex systems\u2019 behavior in developing quantum computers, illuminating the most promising paths forward.\nQuantum annealers, like the systems developed by the pioneering quantum computing company D-Wave, operate by methodically decreasing a magnetic field that is applied to a set of magnetically susceptible particles.\nWhen strong enough, the applied field will act to align the magnetic orientation of the particles \u2014 similar to how iron filings will uniformly stand to attention near a bar magnet.\nIf the strength of the field is varied slowly enough, the magnetic particles will arrange themselves to minimize the energy of the final arrangement.\nFinding this stable, minimum-energy state is crucial in a particularly complex and disordered magnetic system known as a spin glass since quantum annealers can encode certain kinds of problems into the spin glass\u2019s minimum-energy configuration.\nFinding the stable arrangement of the spin glass then solves the problem.\nUnderstanding these systems helps scientists develop better algorithms for solving difficult problems by mimicking how nature deals with complexity and disorder.\nThat\u2019s crucial for advancing quantum annealing and its applications in solving extremely difficult computational problems that currently have no known efficient solution \u2014 problems that are pervasive in fields ranging from logistics to cryptography.\nUnlike gate-model quantum computers, which operate by applying a sequence of quantum gates, quantum annealers allow a quantum system to evolve freely in time.\nThis is not a universal computer \u2014 a device capable of performing any computation given sufficient time and resources \u2014 but may have advantages for solving particular sets of optimization problems in application areas such as vehicle routing, portfolio optimization and protein folding.\nThrough extensive simulations performed on NVIDIA GPUs, the researchers learned how key parameters of the spin glasses making up quantum annealers change during their operation, allowing a better understanding of how to use these systems to achieve a quantum speedup on important problems.\nMuch of the work for this groundbreaking paper was first presented at NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2024 technology conference.

Discover hidden truths behind ancient legends and unveil secrets of a glorious past, enhanced with NVIDIA DLSS AI-powered graphics and full ray tracing, using the power of the GeForce RTX 40 Series to deliver an unparalleled PC experience. And gain the upper hand in epic battles with enhanced control responsiveness courtesy of NVIDIA Reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn partnership with Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science, we\u2019re today introducing a new Black Myth: Wukong GeForce RTX 40 Series Bundle. While supplies last, buyers of eligible products from select retailers and etailers, including GeForce RTX 4090, 4080 SUPER, 4080, 4070 Ti SUPER, 4070 Ti, 4070 SUPER and 4070 graphics cards and desktop PCs, and laptops with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, or RTX 4070 Laptop GPU, will receive a Steam copy of the game to play when released on August 20th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find eligible GPUs, desktops and laptops at numerous system builders and retailers worldwide. Head to the Black Myth: Wukong bundle homepage to see the complete list of participating partners in your country.\nOnce you\u2019ve bought any qualifying product, you\u2019ll receive email instructions on how to redeem your bundle, and just a few clicks later you\u2019ll add Black Myth: Wukong to your Steam account.\nAdditionally, bundle buyers will also receive the Trailblazer\u2019s Scarlet Gourd, a unique visual customization for your healing flask, which you\u2019ll receive at the Keeper\u2019s Shrine respawn point during the early stages of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong Is Loaded With RTX Technology\nBlack Myth: Wukong is an Unreal Engine 5 game that leverages the latest\u00a0 technologies to create one of the most detailed and visually stunning games seen to date.\nAs part of our collaboration with Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong on PC is further enhanced with cutting-edge features that take performance and image quality to the next level on GeForce RTX 40 Series systems.\nFull ray tracing is a demanding but highly accurate way to render light and its effect on a scene. Also known as Path Tracing, this advanced ray tracing technique is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, full ray tracing in real-time video games was impossible.\nIn Black Myth: Wukong full ray tracing increases the fidelity and quality of lighting, reflections and shadows. Reflections on water reflect all surrounding detail. Water caustics add further realism, accurately rendering the refraction and reflection of light. Fully ray-traced Global Illumination ensures lighting indoors and outdoors is pixel perfect, darkening areas where light is occluded or doesn\u2019t reach, and realistically illuminating the world by bouncing light. And in concert with the lighting system, contact hardening and softening fully ray traced shadows are cast everywhere, rendering the smallest of shadows from leaves and pebbles, and those from geometry-rich buildings, the main character, and the gigantic bosses that must be overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure ray-traced effects look their absolute best, and performance is super fast at the highest resolutions, Black Myth: Wukong takes full advantage of NVIDIA DLSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, GeForce gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex in Black Myth: Wukong. This game changing technology reduces system latency on GeForce graphics cards and laptops so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable.\nSince its debut in September 2020, NVIDIA Reflex has reduced system latency in over 100 games, and over 90% of GeForce gamers have enabled Reflex. 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters feature Reflex support, along with critically acclaimed co-op and single-player games. In 2023 alone, GeForce gamers played over 10 billion hours of their favorite titles with increased responsiveness thanks to Reflex\u2019s innovative system latency reducing technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong Launches August 20th: Get The Ultimate Experience With The GeForce RTX 40 Series\nThanks to the addition of incredible AI-powered RTX technologies, and the power of GeForce RTX, PC players with GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs or laptops will receive the ultimate PC Black Myth: Wukong experience.\nIf you don\u2019t already own a PC capable of playing Black Myth: Wukong at its very best, now\u2019s the perfect time to upgrade thanks to our new Black Myth: Wukong GeForce RTX 40 Series bundle. Upgrade today so you don\u2019t miss out on this immersive, eagerly anticipated action RPG.\nCheck back soon for the latest Black Myth: Wukong news.

In addition, new USD connectors to robotics and industrial simulation data formats and developer tools let users stream massive, fully NVIDIA RTX\u2122 ray-traced datasets to Apple Vision Pro.\n\u201cThe generative AI boom for heavy industries is here,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. \u201cUntil recently, digital worlds have been primarily used by creative industries; now, with the enhancements and accessibility NVIDIA NIM microservices are bringing to OpenUSD, industries of all kinds can build physically based virtual worlds and digital twins to drive innovation while preparing for the next wave of AI: robotics.\u201d\nGenerative AI Comes to USD With NVIDIA NIM\r\nThe world\u2019s first generative AI models for OpenUSD development, developed by NVIDIA, will be available as NVIDIA NIM microservices. The models enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workflows, broadening the possibilities in 3D worlds and helping speed the adoption of USD across a new range of industrial sectors, like manufacturing, automotive and robotics.\nThe microservices available in preview are:\n\nUSD Code NIM microservice \u2014 answers general knowledge OpenUSD questions and automatically generates OpenUSD-Python code based on text prompts that can then be inputted into an OpenUSD viewing app, such as usdview from Pixar, or an NVIDIA Omniverse Kit-based application to visualize the corresponding 3D data.\nUSD Search NIM microservice \u2014 enables developers to search through massive libraries of OpenUSD, 3D and image data using natural language or image inputs.\nUSD Validate NIM microservice \u2014 checks the compatibility of uploaded files against OpenUSD release versions and generates a fully RTX-rendered, path-traced image, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces.\n\nNewly announced microservices that will be available soon are:\n\nUSD Layout NIM microservice \u2014 enables users to assemble OpenUSD-based scenes from a series of text prompts based on spatial intelligence.\nUSD SmartMaterial NIM microservice \u2014 predicts and applies a realistic material to a computer-aided design object.\nfVDB Mesh Generation NIM microservice \u2014 generates an OpenUSD-based mesh, rendered by Omniverse Cloud APIs, from point-cloud data.\nfVDB Physics Super-Res NIM microservice \u2014 performs AI super resolution on a frame or sequence of frames to generate an OpenUSD-based, high-resolution physics simulation.\nfVDB NeRF-XL NIM microservice \u2014 generates large-scale neural radiance fields in OpenUSD using Omniverse Cloud APIs.\n\nFoxconn, a global manufacturing leader with more than 170 factories worldwide, is already benefiting from NVIDIA\u2019s computing platform, using NIM microservices and Omniverse to create a digital twin of a factory under development.\n\u201cDigital twins will help us accelerate the next wave of industrial manufacturing and autonomous machines,\u201d said Zhe Shi, chief digital officer and head of the Smart Manufacturing platform at Foxconn. \u201cNVIDIA Omniverse and the new NIM microservices will democratize the ability to develop digital twins and help our teams build physically based virtual factories faster than ever.\u201d\nWPP, a world leader in marketing and communications services company, is an early adopter of USD Search and USD Code NIM microservices, implementing them in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline, built on NVIDIA Omniverse, for customers such as The Coca-Cola Company.\n\u201cThe beauty of the innovation is how compatible it is with the way we work, and that it leverages open standards \u2014 accelerating not only future work, but allowing us to continue to build on and extend the usefulness of all our previous investments in standards like OpenUSD,\u201d said Stephan Pretorius, chief technology officer at WPP. \u201cUsing NVIDIA NIM microservices with NVIDIA Omniverse has made it possible for us to launch innovative new production tools with companies like The Coca-Cola Company at unprecedented speed.\u201d\nUSD Connectors Bring Generative AI to More Industries\r\nA series of new USD connectors for robotics data formats and streaming to Apple Vision Pro opens the portals of OpenUSD interoperability and advanced authoring to more industries.\nNVIDIA and Siemens, a global leader in industrial automation and software, are extending their collaboration to facilitate more industrial workloads using OpenUSD. Siemens will integrate OpenUSD pipelines with its Simcenter portfolio of simulation technologies to support evidence-based decision-making and collaboration among key stakeholders.\nThis integration enables high-fidelity, real-time, photorealistic visualization of complex simulation data, providing deeper insights into a product\u2019s performance within its real-world operating environment. The work will build on Siemens\u2019 efforts to incorporate Omniverse into its Teamcenter Product Lifecycle Management portfolio.\nNVIDIA also released a connector from Unified Robotics Description Format to OpenUSD, letting roboticists seamlessly bring their robot data across applications, including for design, simulation and reinforcement learning.\nTo further advance OpenUSD ecosystem expansion, NVIDIA announced the OpenUSD Exchange software development kit, enabling developers to build their own robust OpenUSD data connectors.\nNew developer tools and APIs to stream large-scale OpenUSD scenes from an application built on the Omniverse platform to Apple Vision Pro via the NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network are now available in early access.\n\u201cOpenUSD is revolutionizing the way we create and interact with 3D content,\u201d said Steve May, chief technology officer of Pixar and chairman of the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD). \u201cNow, with these new services and APIs for OpenUSD built by NVIDIA, we expect to see accelerated growth and adoption of USD, paving the way for new users and industries to more easily engage with our ecosystem.\u201d\nOpenUSD Ecosystem Momentum\r\nLast year, NVIDIA cofounded the AOUSD along with Pixar, Adobe, Apple and Autodesk. Through AOUSD, NVIDIA and other collaborators have announced a new OpenUSD release, progress on an OpenUSD core specification and new members.\nAvailability\r\nThe USD Search, USD Code and USD Validate NIM microservices are available in preview on the NVIDIA API catalog. The OpenUSD to URDF connector is now available with NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122.\nDevelopers can get started integrating generative AI into OpenUSD workflows with new Omniverse developer tools and a reference workflow for building a generative AI-enabled synthetic data pipeline with OpenUSD.\nLearn more about the latest in generative AI and accelerated computing by tuning in to NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s fireside chats at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, running through Aug. 1 in Denver.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, features, and availability of NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, including NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA NIM microservices, NVIDIA RTX, USD Code NIM, USD Search NIM, USD Validate NIM, NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs, USD Layout NIM, USD SmartMaterial NIM, fVDB Mesh Generation NIM, fVDB Physics Super-Res NIM, fVDB NeRF-XL NIM and NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network; third parties using or adopting NVIDIA products, technologies and platforms, and the benefits and impacts thereof; our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impacts thereof; with the enhancements and accessibility NVIDIA NIM microservices bringing to OpenUSD, industries of all kinds being able to build physically based virtual worlds and digital twins to drive innovation while preparing for robotics, the next wave of AI; and the impact of OpenUSD are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

NIM microservices are the fastest way to deploy Llama 3.1 models in production and power up to 2.5x higher throughput than running inference without NIM.\nEnterprises can pair Llama 3.1 NIM microservices with new NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM microservices to create state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines for AI copilots, assistants and digital human avatars.\nAccenture Pioneers Custom Llama Supermodels for Enterprises With AI Foundry\r\nGlobal professional services firm Accenture is first to adopt NVIDIA AI Foundry to build custom Llama 3.1 models using the Accenture AI Refinery\u2122 framework, both for its own use as well as for clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications that reflect their culture, languages and industries.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s leading enterprises see how generative AI is transforming every industry and are eager to deploy applications powered by custom models,\u201d said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture. \u201cAccenture has been working with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for our internal AI applications, and now, using NVIDIA AI Foundry, we can help clients quickly create and deploy custom Llama 3.1 models to power transformative AI applications for their own business priorities.\u201d\nNVIDIA AI Foundry provides an end-to-end service for quickly building custom supermodels. It combines NVIDIA software, infrastructure and expertise with open community models, technology and support from the NVIDIA AI ecosystem.\nWith NVIDIA AI Foundry, enterprises can create custom models using Llama 3.1 models and the NVIDIA NeMo platform \u2014 including the NVIDIA Nemotron-4 340B Reward model, ranked first on the Hugging Face RewardBench.\nOnce custom models are created, enterprises can create NVIDIA NIM inference microservices to run them in production using their preferred MLOps and AIOps platforms on their preferred cloud platforms and NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 from global server manufacturers.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise experts and global system integrator partners work with AI Foundry customers to accelerate the entire process, from development to deployment.\nNVIDIA Nemotron Powers Advanced Model Customization\r\nEnterprises that need additional training data for creating a domain-specific model can use Llama 3.1 405B and Nemotron-4 340B together to generate synthetic data to boost model accuracy when creating custom Llama supermodels.\nCustomers that have their own training data can customize Llama 3.1 models with NVIDIA NeMo for domain-adaptive pretraining, or DAPT, to further increase model accuracy.\nNVIDIA and Meta have also teamed to provide a distillation recipe for Llama 3.1 that developers can use to build smaller custom Llama 3.1 models for generative AI applications. This enables enterprises to run Llama-powered AI applications on a broader range of accelerated infrastructure, such as AI workstations and laptops.\nIndustry-Leading Enterprises Supercharge AI With NVIDIA and Llama\r\nCompanies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation and telecommunications are already working with NVIDIA NIM microservices for Llama. Among the first to access the new NIM microservices for Llama 3.1 are Aramco, AT&T and Uber.\nTrained on over 16,000 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and optimized for NVIDIA accelerated computing and software \u2014 in the data center, in the cloud and locally on workstations with NVIDIA RTX\u2122 GPUs or PCs with GeForce RTX GPUs \u2014 the Llama 3.1 collection of multilingual LLMs is a collection of generative AI models in 8B-, 70B- and 405B-parameter sizes.\nNew NeMo Retriever RAG Microservices Boost Accuracy and Performance\r\nUsing new NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM inference microservices for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), organizations can enhance response accuracy when deploying customized Llama supermodels and Llama NIM microservices in production.\nCombined with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for Llama 3.1 405B, NeMo Retriever NIM microservices deliver the highest open and commercial text Q&A retrieval accuracy for RAG pipelines.\nEnterprise Ecosystem Ready to Power Llama 3.1 and NeMo Retriever NIM Deployments\r\nHundreds of NVIDIA NIM partners providing enterprise, data and infrastructure platforms can now integrate the new microservices in their AI solutions to supercharge generative AI for the NVIDIA community of more than 5 million developers and 19,000 startups.\nProduction support for Llama 3.1 NIM and NeMo Retriever NIM microservices is available through NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Members of the NVIDIA Developer Program will soon be able to access NIM microservices for free for research, development and testing on their preferred infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, features, and availability of NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, including NVIDIA AI Foundry, NVIDIA Nemotron models, NVIDIA Nemotron-4 models, NVIDIA DGX Cloud, NVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM microservices, NVIDIA NeMo platform, NVIDIA-Certified Systems, NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, NVIDIA RTX GPUs and GeForce RTX GPUs; third parties\u2019 use or adoption of NVIDIA products, technologies and platforms, and the benefits and impacts thereof; our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impacts thereof; Llama 3.1 opening the floodgates for every enterprise and industry to build state-of-the-art generative AI applications; and NVIDIA AI Foundry being ready to help enterprises build and deploy custom Llama supermodels are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

Robotics, for example, requires advanced AI and photorealistic virtual worlds where AI can be trained before being deployed into next-generation humanoid robots.\nHuang explained that robotics requires three computers: one to train the AI, one to test the AI in a physically accurate simulation, and one within the robot itself.\n\u201cJust about every industry is going to be affected by this, whether it\u2019s scientific computing trying to do a better job predicting the weather with a lot less energy, to augmenting and collaborating with creators to generate images, or generating virtual scenes for industrial visualization,\u201d Huang said. \u201cRobotic self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative AI.\u201d\nLikewise, NVIDIA Omniverse systems \u2014 built around the OpenUSD standard \u2014 will also be key to harnessing generative AI to create assets that the world\u2019s largest brands can use.\nBy pulling from brand assets that live in Omniverse, which can capture brand assets, these systems can capture and replicate carefully curated brand magic.\n\nFinally, all these systems \u2014 visual computing, simulation and large-language models \u2014 will come together to create digital humans who can help people interact with digital systems of all kinds.\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re announcing here this week is the concept of digital agents, digital AIs that will augment every single job in the company,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cAnd so one of the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIn the future, my guess is that it\u2019s going to be human still, but AI in the loop.\u201d\nAll of this, like any new tool, promises to amplify human productivity and creativity. \u201cImagine the stories that you\u2019re going to be able to tell with these tools,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Generative AITags: SIGGRAPH 2024 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Huang credited Zuckerberg and Meta with being leaders in AI, even if only some have noticed until recently.\n\u201cYou guys have done amazing AI work,\u201d Huang said, citing advancements from Meta in computer vision, language models, real-time translation. \u201cWe all use Pytorch, that comes out of Meta.\u201d\n\nThe Importance of Open Source in Advancing AI\n\nZuckerberg highlighted the importance of open source in advancing AI \u2014 with the two business leaders emphasizing the importance of open platforms for innovation. \n\nMeta has rapidly emerged as a leader in AI, putting it to work throughout its businesses \u2014 most notably with Meta AI, which is used across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 and advancing open-source AI throughout the industry, most recently with the release of Llama 3.1.\nThe open-source model represents a significant investment of time and training resources. The largest version of Llama boasts 405 billion parameters and was trained on over 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.\n\u201cOne of the things that drives quality improvements is it used to be that you have a different model for each type of content,\u201d Zuckerberg explained.\n\u201cAs the models get bigger and more general, that gets better and better. So, I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together,\u201d he added.\nZuckerberg sees collaboration as key to more advancements. In a blog post released last week, Zuckerberg wrote that the release of Llama 3.1 promises to be an \u201cinflection point\u201d in adopting open source in AI.\nThese advancements promise more tools to foster engagement, create compelling and personalized content \u2014 such as digital avatars \u2014 and build virtual worlds.\nMore broadly, the advancement of AI across a broad ecosystem promises to supercharge human productivity, for example, by giving every human on earth a digital assistant \u2014 or assistants \u2014 allowing people to live richer lives that they can interact with quickly and fluidly.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m collaborating with WhatsApp,\u201d Huang said. \u201cImagine I\u2019m sitting here typing, and it\u2019s generating the images as I\u2019m going.

Two new AI microservices will allow roboticists to enhance simulation workflows for generative physical AI in NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122, a reference application for robotics simulation built on the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform.\nThe MimicGen NIM microservice generates synthetic motion data based on recorded teleoperated data from spatial computing devices like Apple Vision Pro. The Robocasa NIM microservice generates robot tasks and simulation-ready environments in OpenUSD, a universal framework for developing and collaborating within 3D worlds.\nNVIDIA OSMO, available now, is a cloud-native managed service that allows users to orchestrate and scale complex \u200crobotics development workflows across distributed computing resources, whether on premises or in the cloud.\nOSMO vastly simplifies robot training and simulation workflows, cutting deployment and development cycle times from months to under a week. Users can visualize and manage a range of tasks \u2014 like generating synthetic data, training models, conducting reinforcement learning and implementing software-in-the-loop testing at scale for humanoids, autonomous mobile robots and industrial manipulators.\nAdvancing Data Capture Workflows for Humanoid Robot Developers\r\nTraining foundation models for humanoid robots requires an incredible amount of data. One way of capturing human demonstration data is using teleoperation, but this is becoming an increasingly expensive and lengthy process.\nAn NVIDIA AI- and Omniverse-enabled teleoperation reference workflow, demonstrated at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference, allows researchers and AI developers to generate massive amounts of synthetic motion and perception data from a minimal amount of remotely captured human demonstrations.\nFirst, developers use Apple Vision Pro to capture a small number of teleoperated demonstrations. Then, they simulate the recordings in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and use the MimicGen NIM microservice to generate synthetic datasets from the recordings.\nThe developers train the Project GR00T humanoid foundation model with real and synthetic data, enabling developers to save time and reduce costs. They then use the Robocasa NIM microservice in Isaac Lab, a framework for robot learning, to generate experiences to retrain the robot model. Throughout the workflow, NVIDIA OSMO seamlessly assigns computing jobs to different resources, saving the developers weeks of administrative tasks.\nFourier, a general-purpose robot platform company, sees the benefit of using simulation technology to synthetically generate training data.\n\u201cDeveloping humanoid robots is extremely complex \u2014 requiring an incredible amount of real data, tediously captured from the real world,\u201d said Alex Gu, CEO of Fourier. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s new simulation and generative AI developer tools will help bootstrap and accelerate our model development workflows.\u201d\nExpanding Access to NVIDIA Humanoid Developer Technologies\r\nNVIDIA provides three computing platforms to ease humanoid robotics development: NVIDIA AI supercomputers to train the models; NVIDIA Isaac Sim built on Omniverse, where robots can learn and refine their skills in simulated worlds; and NVIDIA Jetson\u2122 Thor humanoid robot computers to run the models. Developers can access and use all \u2014 or any part of \u2014 the platforms for their specific needs.\nThrough a new NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program, developers can gain early access to the new offerings as well as the latest releases of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, NVIDIA Isaac Lab, Jetson Thor and Project GR00T general-purpose humanoid foundation models.\n1x, Boston Dynamics, ByteDance Research, Field AI, Figure, Fourier, Galbot, LimX Dynamics, Mentee, Neura Robotics, RobotEra and Skild AI are among the first to join the early-access program.\n\u201cBoston Dynamics and NVIDIA have a long history of close collaboration to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in robotics,\u201d said Aaron Saunders, chief technology officer of Boston Dynamics. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to see the fruits of this work accelerating the industry at large, and the early-access program is a fantastic way to access best-in-class technology.\u201d\nAvailability\r\nDevelopers can join the NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program now to get access to NVIDIA OSMO and Isaac Lab, and will soon gain access to NVIDIA NIM microservices.\nLearn more about the latest in generative AI and accelerated computing by tuning in to Huang\u2019s fireside chats at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, running through Aug. 1 in Denver.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, features, and availability of NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, including NVIDIA NIM\u00a0microservices, NVIDIA OSMO, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, NVIDIA Isaac Lab,\u00a0MimicGen\u00a0NIM,\u00a0Robocasa\u00a0NIM, NVIDIA Omniverse, Project GR00T humanoid foundation model, NVIDIA\u00a0Jetson\u00a0Thor and NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program; third parties using or adopting NVIDIA products, technologies and platforms, and the benefits and impacts thereof; our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impacts thereof; the next wave of AI being robotics and one of the most exciting developments being humanoid robots; NVIDIA advancing the entire NVIDIA robotics stack, opening access for worldwide humanoid developers and companies to use the platforms, acceleration libraries and AI models best suited for their needs; and the timing, participants, availability and impact of\u00a0SIGGRAPH\u00a0are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

It revealed plans to debut an even more powerful generation of GPUs later this year, then next year, then the year after and so on. And that doesn\u2019t even touch upon the company\u2019s plans for shipping new CPUs, networking chips and full systems.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company also spent ample time amping up its efforts to enable AI application development and deployment through expanded software and services offerings for data centers, cloud environments, edge devices and PCs.\nAll these efforts have been backed by new partnerships with hundreds of tech vendors, ranging from behemoths like Amazon Web Services and Dell Technologies to smaller companies like Databricks and Snowflake.\nWhat follows are the 10 biggest Nvidia news stories of 2024 so far, which range from three software startup acquisition deals and plans to boost AI PC development, to expanded partnerships with major tech vendors and significant financial milestones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Nvidia Intros New Industrial AI Solutions\nNvidia expanded its portfolio of industrial AI solutions with a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robot learning and a next-generation edge computer, among other things.\nThe foundation model is called Project GR00T, and it\u2019s designed to translate text, video and in-person demonstrations into actions performed by a humanoid robot. \u00ad\u00ad\nTo power such robots, Nvidia announced a new Jetson Thor-based \u201ccomputer that is based on the company\u2019s Thor system-on-chip. The computer features a Blackwell GPU that can provide 800 teraflops of 8-bit floating point AI performance to run multimodal models like GR00T.\nThe company also announced an expansion of its Isaac software platform for robotics. The new elements included Isaac Lab for enabling reinforcement learning, the OSMO compute orchestration service, Isaac Manipulator for enabling dexterity and modular AI capabilities in robotic arms and Isaac Perceptor for enabling multi-camera, 3-D surround-vision capabilities.\nThe new Isaac capabilities are expected to be available in the third quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Nvidia Acquires Three Software Startups\nNvidia acquired three software startups in the first half of 2024 to build out its AI computing business.\nIn late April, the chip designer announced it had reached a deal to acquire Israel-based AI infrastructure management startup Run:ai. The startup provides Kubernetes-based workload management and orchestration software, which Nvidia said it plans to use to drive its DGX Cloud business and enhance the capabilities of DGX and HGX server customers.\nMultiple reports said the Run:ai deal was valued at around $700 million.\nIn May, Nvidia acquired another Israeli startup called Deci, which develops software that can speed up the inference of AI models while retaining accuracy on any hardware. Israeli publication Calcalist said the Deci acquisition was valued at roughly $300 million.\nOn July 3, Nvidia acquired Shoreline.io, a startup founded by a former Amazon Web Services executive that provides software for automatically fixing issues in data center infrastructure. This is according to the startup, which confirmed the deal on its website, and one of its investors, Canvas Ventures, which said Shoreline\u2019s team will join Nvidia\u2019s DGX Cloud business.\nBloomberg first reported on the deal in June and said it was valued at about $100 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Nvidia Reveals Plan To Boost RTX AI PC Development\nAt the Computex 2024 event in Taiwan, Nvidia revealed a plan to enable developers to build AI applications for PCs running on its RTX GPUs with the new Nvidia RTX AI Toolkit.\nAvailable later this month, the toolkit consists of tools and software development kits that allow developers to customize, optimize and deploy generative AI models on RTX AI PCs, a term the company started using for RTX-powered computers\u00a0in January.\n[Read More: 12 Big Nvidia, Intel And AMD Announcements At Computex 2024]\nThe toolkit includes the previously announced Nvidia AI Workbench, a free platform for creating, testing and customizing pretrained generative AI models.\nIt also includes the new Nvidia AI Inference Manager software development kit, which \u201cenables an app to run AI locally or in the cloud, depending on the user\u2019s system configuration or even the current workload,\u201d according to the company.\nBeyond RTX AI Toolkit, Nvidia said its working with Microsoft to give developers easy API access to \u201cGPU-accelerated small language models that enable retrieval-augmented generation capabilities that run on-device as part of Windows Copilot Runtime.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Nvidia Launches Inference Microservices\nNvidia used Computex 2024 to mark the launch of its inference microservices, which are meant to help speed up the development of generative AI applications for data centers and PCs.\nKnown officially as Nvidia NIM, the microservices consist of AI models served in optimized containers that developers can integrate within their applications. These containers can include Nvidia software components such as Nvidia Triton Inference Server and Nvidia TensorRT-LLM to optimize inference workloads on its GPUs.\nThe microservices include more than 40 AI models developed by Nvidia and other companies, such as Databricks DBRX, Google Gemma, Meta Llama 3, Microsoft Phi-3, Mistral Large, Mixtral 8x22B and Snowflake Arctic.\nNvidia said nearly 200 technology partners, including Cloudera, Cohesity and NetApp, \u201care integrating NIM into their platforms to speed generative AI deployments for domain-specific applications.\u201d These apps include things such as copilots, code assistants and digital human avatars.\nThe company also highlighted that NIM is supported by data center infrastructure software providers VMware, Nutanix, Red Hat and Canonical as well as AI tools and MLOPs providers like Amazon SageMaker, Microsoft Azure AI and Domino Data Lab.\nGlobal system integrators and service delivery partners such as Accenture, Deloitte, Quantiphi, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro plan to use NIM to help businesses build and deploy generative AI applications, Nvidia added.\nNIM is available to businesses through the Nvidia AI Enterprise software suite, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year. It\u2019s also available to members of the Nvidia Developer Program, who can \u201caccess NIM for free for research, development and testing on their preferred infrastructure,\u201d the company said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Nvidia Reveals Extended Data Center Road Map\nAt Computex 2024, Nvidia revealed that it plans to release successors to its upcoming Blackwell GPUs in the next two years and launch a second-generation CPU in 2026.\nThe chip designer made the disclosures in an expanded data center road map that provided basic details for next-generation GPUs, CPUs, network switch chips and network interface cards.\n[Read More: Analysis: As Nvidia Takes AI Victory Lap, AMD Doubles The Trouble For Intel]\nThe plan to release a new data center GPU architecture every year is part of a one-year release cadence Nvidia announced last year, representing an acceleration of the company\u2019s previous strategy of releasing new GPUs roughly every two years.\n\u201cOur basic philosophy is very simple: build the entire data center scale, disaggregate it and sell it to you in parts on a one-year rhythm, and we push everything to the technology limits,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in his Computex keynote in early June.\nThe expanded road map is coming less than two months after Nvidia revealed its next-generation Blackwell data center GPU architecture, which is expected to debut later this year. At its GTC event in March, the company said Blackwell will enable up to 30 times greater inference performance and consume 25 times less energy for massive AI models compared to the Hopper architecture, which debuted in 2022 with the H100 GPU.\nIn the road map revealed by Huang during his Computex keynote, the company outlined a plan to follow up Blackwell in 2025 with an updated architecture called Blackwell Ultra, which the CEO said will be \u201cpushed to the limits.\u201d\nIn the same time frame, the company is expected to release an updated version of its Spectrum-X800 Ethernet Switch, called the Spectrum Ultra X800.\nThen in 2026, Nvidia plans to debut an all-new GPU architecture called Rubin, which will use HBM4 memory. This will coincide with several other new chips, including a follow-up to Nvidia\u2019s Arm-based Grace CPU called Vera.\nThe company also plans to release in 2026 the NVLink 6 Switch, which will double chip-to-chip bandwidth to 3600 GBps; the CX9 SuperNIC, which will be capable of 1600 GBps; and the X1600 generation of InfiniBand and Ethernet switches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Competition Grows Against Nvidia\u2019s AI Chip Dominance\nAs Nvidia moves forward with its plan to release increasingly powerful AI chips at a faster release cadence, large and small rivals announced new products in the first half of the year that are meant to whittle away at the GPU giant\u2019s AI computing dominance.\nAt Computex 2024, AMD announced that plans to release a new Instinct data center GPU, the MI325X, later this year with significantly greater high-bandwidth memory than its MI300X chip or Nvidia\u2019s H200, enabling servers to handle larger generative AI models than before.\n[Related: Forrest Norrod On How AMD Is Fighting Nvidia With \u2018Significant\u2019 AI Investments]\nAMD announced the details as part of a newly disclosed plan to release a new data center GPU every year starting with the CDNA 3-based MI325X. In an extended road map, AMD said it will then debut in 2025 the MI350 series, which will use its CDNA 4 architecture to provide increased compute performance and \u201cmemory leadership.\u201d The next generation, the Instinct MI400 series, will use a future iteration of CDNA architecture and arrive in 2026.\nIntel, on the other hand, announced its plan to debut its Gaudi 3 accelerator chip in the third quarter with the support of major vendors like Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Asus and Gigabyte.\nThe company later revealed that Gaudi 3\u2019s eight-chip server platform will have a list price of $125,000, which it said will give Gaudi 3 2.3 times greater performance-per-dollar for inference performance and 90 percent better training throughput than Nvidia\u2019s H100.\nMeanwhile, cloud computing giant Google Cloud announced the general availability of its TPU v5p accelerator chip, which it said can train large language models nearly three times faster than the previous-generation TPU v4.\nThere are also a crop of AI chip startups looking to challenge Nvidia, including Cerebras Systems, which revealed its Wafer Scale Engine 3 chip in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Nvidia Reveals Blackwell GPU Architecture\nNvidia has revealed its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture as the much-hyped successor to the AI chip giant\u2019s Hopper platform, claiming it will enable up to 30 times greater inference performance and consume 25 times less energy for massive AI models.\nAt its first in-person GTC event in nearly five years, the chip designer in March uncovered the first GPU designs to use the Blackwell architecture, which it said comes with \u201csix transformative technologies for accelerated computing\u201d that will \u201chelp unlock breakthroughs\u201d in fields like generative AI and data processing, among others.\n[Read More: Nvidia Reveals Next-Gen Blackwell GPUs, Promised To 'Unlock Breakthroughs' In GenAI]\nThe designs are expected to arrive later this year, but the company gave no further clarification on timing. Cloud service providers expected to provide Blackwell-based instances include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as well as several other players, like Lambda, CoreWeave and IBM Cloud.\nOn the server side, Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to offer a plethora of Blackwell-based systems. Other OEMs supporting the GPUs include ASRock Rack, Asus, Eviden and Gigabyte.\nThe first confirmed designs to use Blackwell include the B100 and the B200 GPUs, the successors to the Hopper-based\u00a0H100\u00a0and\u00a0H200\u00a0for x86-based systems, respectively. The B200 is expected to include greater high-bandwidth memory capacity than the B100.\nThe initial designs also include the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which, on a single package, connects a B200 GPU with the company\u2019s Arm-based, 72-core Grace CPU that has previously been paired with the H200 and H100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Major Tech Vendors Extend Partnerships With Nvidia\nNvidia sought to continue its dominance in the AI computing space by announcing renewed and extended partnerships with major tech vendors in the first half of the year.\nIn the cloud infrastructure market, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and other providers announced plans to launch new services based on Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell GPUs and DGX Cloud platform.\n[Related: Nvidia\u2019s 10 New Cloud AI Products For AWS, Microsoft And Google]\nFor example, AWS said it plans to build Project Ceiba, which the company said will become \u201cone of the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputers,\u201d by using Nvidia\u2019s GB200 NVL72 systems, which are multi-node, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers that contain 36 of the AI chip giant\u2019s upcoming GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips as well as the company\u2019s BlueField-3 DPUs.\nAmong server vendors, Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced a comprehensive generative AI solution portfolio co-branded as \u201cNvidia AI Computing By HPE,\u201d Lenovo announced Lenovo AI Fast Start and other solutions based on Nvidia technologies, Dell Technologies announced the Dell AI Factory with Nvidia end-to-end AI enterprise solution, and Cisco Systems announced the Nvidia-based Cisco Nexus HyperFabric AI cluster. Other OEMs that announced new Nvidia-based solutions include Supermicro, Gigabyte and Asus.\nElsewhere in the IT industry, Nvidia announced new partnerships with Equinix, ServiceNow, SAP, NetApp, Nutanix, IBM, Databricks, Snowflake and many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Nvidia Surpasses Intel In Annual Revenue\nWhen Nvidia reported its fourth-quarter earnings in February, they showed that the company surpassed Intel in total annual revenue for its recently completed fiscal year, mainly thanks to high demand for its GPUs driven by generative AI development.\nThe AI chip giant finished its 2024 fiscal year, which ended Jan. 28, with $60.9 billion in revenue, up 126 percent or more than double from the previous year.\n[Read More: Analysis: How Nvidia Surpassed Intel In Annual Revenue And Won The AI Crown]\nMeanwhile, Intel\u00a0finished its 2023 fiscal year, which ended in December,\u00a0with $54.2 billion in sales, down 14 percent from the previous year.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year finished roughly one month after Intel\u2019s, this is the closest we\u2019ll get to understanding how two industry titans compared in a year when demand for AI solutions propped up the data center and cloud markets in a shaky economy.\nNvidia pulled off this feat because the company had spent years building a comprehensive and integrated stack of chips,\u00a0systems, software and services for accelerated computing\u2014with a major emphasis on data centers, cloud computing and edge computing\u2014then found itself last year at the center of a massive demand cycle due to hype around generative AI.\nIntel, in the meantime, has been far behind Nvidia when it comes to adoption of its accelerator chips by developers, OEMs, cloud service providers, partners and customers that has allowed Nvidia to flourish. As a result, the semiconductor giant has had to rely on its traditional data center products, mainly Xeon server CPUs, to generate a majority of revenue for this business unit, and this area suffered due to lower demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Nvidia Became World\u2019s Most Valuable Company For A Moment\nIn mid-June, Nvidia surpassed Apple and Microsoft in market capitalization, which made it the world\u2019s most valuable company at the time.\nThe chip designer was able to achieve the milestone by hitting a $3.34 trillion market cap on June 18 as its stock price rose more than 3.5 percent.[Read More: Analysis: Embraced By IT World, Nvidia Is Now World\u2019s Most Valuable Company]\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s market cap has sunk below Microsoft\u2019s and Apple\u2019s since then and now stands as the world\u2019s thirst most valuable company, reaching the top was nevertheless a reflection of how central it has become to small and large companies building the future of IT infrastructure.\nWhile Nvidia has long stood out due to continuous advances in its GPUs\u2014which have been key to providing the accelerated performance needed to make generative AI advancements possible\u2014a great deal of its recent success has come from its focus on evolving from a chip designer to what CEO Jensen Huang calls a \u201cfull-stack\u201d computing company.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As we reported at the time, some observers said this wasn't quite as open as it sounded. (We examine this in the Bootnote at the bottom.) For clarity, we are not saying it wasn't a good move: it was then, as former vulture Matt Asay wrote at the time\u2026 and it still is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the company is now announcing is that it's continuing the program and widening support. In 2023 Nvidia added support for newer Turing hardware. Now, the company says in a statement:\n\nFor cutting-edge platforms such as Nvidia Grace Hopper or Nvidia Blackwell, you must use the open source GPU kernel modules. The proprietary drivers are unsupported on these platforms.\nFor newer GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper architectures, Nvidia recommends switching to the open-source GPU kernel modules.\n\nIf you're using\u00a0older GPUs, or a mixture, you have no choice but to continue using the monolithic proprietary drivers. Even if you have one of the modern cards that are supported, you will still need the firmware BLOBs.\nHow different distros handle this\nThis poses a problem for distros that support UEFI Secure Boot, which requires the kernel to be cryptographically signed. Ubuntu includes the drivers and a tool to install them, so it's relatively straightforward and the company documents the process.\nFedora, however, does not include proprietary elements like Nvidia's drivers. They aren't even shown as an option in the GNOME Software app-store. It's a long standing issue, but it may yet go away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a new Change Proposal which will add an option for the user to self-sign the modules. The change is still being discussed, but if it's approved, it may happen as soon as Fedora 41.\nFreeing CUDA from Nvidia\nApart from gamers with high-end cards, another use for Nvidia GPUs is for offloading computation to GPU chips \u2013 which can crunch lots more numbers in parallel than even a modern CPU. The Jolly Green Giant calls this CUDA, which once upon a time stood for compute unified device architecture. The more generic term is GPGPU computing.\nThe problem is that if you target your code at CUDA then it can only run on Nvidia chips using Nvidia's drivers. You can't run CUDA code using the all-FOSS Nouveau driver, for instance.\nAMD has its own equivalent GPGPU software stack called ROCm, which lets you offload number-crunching to AMD GPUs\u2026 but again, if you target your code at ROCm then it won't run on Nvidia. If you want to retain cross-GPU portability, the company has a Hip alternative: the Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability. However, not all functionality is supported \u2013 for instance, inline PTX assembly language won't work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a new, independent contender has entered the match: the SCALE language, from Spectral Compute. The documentation states:\n\nSCALE is a GPGPU programming toolkit that allows CUDA applications to be natively compiled for AMD GPUs.\nSCALE does not require the CUDA program or its build system to be modified.\n\nSCALE does support inline PTX assembly, and the project also offers a comparison with rival technologies, including AMD HIP and the FOSS ZLUDA tools.\n\nAMD predicts future AI PCs will run 30B parameter models at 100 tokens per second\nNvidia loses a cool $500B as market questions AI boom\nGPU-accelerated VMs on Proxmox, XCP-ng? Here's what you need to know\nIntel CEO says sanctions on China squanders opportunity for US chipmakers like Intel\n\nThere are other offerings for non-vendor-specific GPGPU computing. The OpenCL standard has been around since 2008 and reached version 3.0 in 2020. A new rival called UXL is expected later this year.\nNone of this has stopped Nvidia getting to an impressive $3 trillion valuation, though. It seems to us that more competition in this area would be a good thing.\nBootnote: How open is \"open\"?\nThe hoopla about open source drivers does not mean that the entire Nvidia driver stack is now open source. It isn't. The parts that interact with the rest of the Linux OS are, but Nvidia did this by moving the proprietary parts of the code into a multi-megabyte file of \"firmware\", which remains closed-source and secret.\nBack at the time of the release of the 515 driver, the Asahi Linux project lead Hector Martin took a look at how much of the code was now available to study. On his now-deleted Twitter account, he posted:\n\nSo Nvidia \"released\" their kernel driver as open source.\nBy which they mean, they moved most of it to firmware and made the open source driver call into it. There are almost 900 functions implemented in the 34MB firmware, give or take, from what I can see.\nBroadcom vibes\u2026\nFor reference, Apple's GPU firmware is ~400kB. Apple's display controller, which is a similarly insane RPC mess, is ~7MB, but most of it is data tables (~1.5MB is code).\nDon't get me wrong, less blobs in the kernel is great\u2026 but open source their \"driver\" they did not.\nAt least their kernel side code is \"only\" 58MB of source code. AMD still takes the lead, with almost 300MB of autogenerated includes they somehow managed to upstream into the Linux kernel tree\u2026\n\nThese large software black boxes are common practice in recent years, as we covered in 2022: Concern over growing reach of proprietary firmware BLOBs. They are so essential that the Debian project changed its 30-year-old policies and with Debian 12 started including proprietary firmware. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMD looks to undercut Nvidia, win gamers' hearts with RX 9070 series\nThe question is whether we can find them in stock and at MSRP\n\nSystems28 Feb 2025 | 51\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nClosing the digital divide with 5G FWA\nHow wireless can replace fiber for fast, cost-effective broadband deployments\nSponsored Feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCash torrent pouring into Nvidia slows \u2013 despite booming Blackwell adoption\nMay we all have problems like annual revenue growth dropping from 126 to 114 percent\n\nNvidia GTC27 Feb 2025 | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRunning hot?

That figure has since been upgraded to 60,000, with the GB200 NVL36 accounting for 50,000 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Sebastian Moss\n\n\n\nComprising of 36 GB200 super chips, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs, the GB200 NVL36 will have an average sale price of $1.8 million, according to UDN reported industry estimates. Meanwhile, the GB200 NVL72 \u2013 which contains double the hardware of the NVL36 \u2013 will have an estimated price of $3m.Individual B100 GPUs are expected to be priced between $30,000 and $35,000, while the GB200 Superchip has an estimated price of between $60,000 and $70,000.The increased order request is likely to provide a substantial boost to TSMC\u2019s financial outlook for the second half of this year.First unveiled in March 2024, the Blackwell GPU family is set to be available later this year.Manufactured using a custom-built, two-reticle limit 4NP TSMC process with GPU dies connected by 10TBps chip-to-chip link into a single, unified GPU; Blackwell chips have 208 billion transistors, an increase on the 80bn in the Hopper series. It is twice the size of the Hopper.The GPU also includes a second-generation transformer engine and new 4-bit floating point AI inference capabilities. It features a new dedicated engine for reliability, availability, and serviceability, with AI-based preventative maintenance to run diagnostics and forecast reliability issues.Last month it was reported that testing and packaging services firms were scrambling to meet the growing demand for Blackwell GPUs. In addition to being overwhelmed with orders, the testing process for the Blackwell-series is significantly longer than that of the previous Hopper-series.The increased power consumption of the Blackwell chips has also reportedly caused challenges, with the testing companies needing to increase the capacity of their burn-in test chambers from 600W to 1kW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\nEviden and Supermicro partner to offer Nvidia GB200 NVL72 access in new markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe drivers of chip design: AI, efficiency and geopolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Asia Pacific\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Connect |  Investment APAC - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Dec 2024\n\n\n\n\nVodafone Idea awards 4G, 5G backhaul contract to Tejas Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nExploring the real solutions to the sustainability challenge in APAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nB100\n\n\nBlackwell\n\n\nGB200\n\n\nTSMC\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The report cites people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Sebastian Moss\n\n\n\nIf charges are made, they will be less than a year after the Competition Authority raided Nvidia's offices in France.In February 2024, the Authority launched an inquiry into the \"competitive functioning of the generative AI sector\"In a recent report, the Competition Authority noted concern surrounding the sector's dependence on Nvidia's CUDA chip programming software, the cost of Nvidia's GPUs (or its competitors), and recent announcements of Nvidia's investment in cloud service providers such as CoreWeave.The report further noted the risk of chip providers engaging in price fixing, production restrictions, and unfair contract conditions or behaviors, though did not specifically accuse Nvidia.Nvidia's success in the AI boom has been evident in the past few months. In May 2023, the company was valued at $1 trillion. This grew to $2 trillion in February 2024, and $3 trillion in June.Should the French Competition Authority charge Nvidia, it would be the first regulator to do so. If found guilty, Nvidia risks a maximum penalty of 10 percent of its global revenue in fines.Nvidia is also under investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission. In June 2024, an antitrust probe was launched into the company alongside Microsoft and OpenAI regarding the trio's influence on the AI industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nNvidia posts record data center revenue, will provide Spectrum-X for OpenAI's Stargate project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSoftware and hardware co-design: Optimizing next-gen compute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Standards & Regulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of data centers: Navigating energy efficiency policies in the EU and APAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nAdani Group could scrap 5G plans as Indian gov't questions delayed rollout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nLigado sues Inmarsat following bankruptcy ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nAutorit\u00e9 de la concurrence\n\n\nantitrust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Photograph: Sam Yeh/AFP/Getty ImagesNvidia This article is more than 8 months oldAnalysisCan AI boom drive Nvidia to a $4tn valuation despite investor doubt?This article is more than 8 months oldDan Milmo and Alex HernPowerful new chips are on the way but there are questions over whether tech firm\u2019s growth can be sustainedTue 2 Jul 2024 06.00 BSTLast modified on Thu 4 Jul 2024 11.07 BSTShareWhen Jensen Huang spoke at the Nvidia annual general meeting last week, he made no mention of a share price slide.The US chipmaker, buoyed up by its key role in the artificial intelligence boom, had briefly become the world\u2019s most valuable company on 18 June but the crown slipped quickly. Nvidia shed about $550bn (\u00a3434bn) from the $3.4tn (\u00a32.68tn) peak market value it had reached that week, as tech investors, combining profit-taking with doubts about the sustainability of its rocketing growth, applied the brakes.Huang, however, spoke like the CEO of a business that took 30 days this year to go from a valuation of $2tn to $3tn \u2013 and sees $4tn coming into view.He described a forthcoming group of powerful new chips, called Blackwell, as potentially \u201cthe most successful product in our history\u201d and perhaps in the entire history of the computer. He added that the new wave for AI would be automating $50tn of heavy industry, and described what sounded like an endless loop of robotic factories orchestrating robots that \u201cbuild products that are robotic\u201d.Wrapping up, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world.\u201dThese are the kinds of words on which a $4tn valuation, and the AI hype cycle, are built. Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom. Is that enough to propel it to $4tn despite the emergence of investor doubt?View image in fullscreen\u2018We\u2019ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world,\u2019 Jensen Huang has said. Photograph: Chiang Ying-ying/APAlvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, said \u201conly a collapse of the genAI market\u201d would prevent Nvidia from reaching $4tn at some point \u2013 but whether it got there first ahead of tech rivals was another matter. Currently, Microsoft \u2013 another big player in AI \u2013 and Apple are first and second respectively in terms of market size, with Nvidia third.If OpenAI\u2019s next big AI model, GPT-5, and other new models were astonishing, the share price would stay buoyant and could get to $4tn by the end of 2025, said Nguyen. But if they underwhelmed, then the share price could be affected, given its status as a flag-carrier for the technology. A technological breakthrough could result in less computing power being needed to train models, he added, or interest from businesses and consumers in generative AI tools could be less robust than hoped.\u201cThere is a lot that is unknown and out of Nvidia\u2019s control that could impact their path to $4tn,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cSuch as disappointment with new models that come out, model improvements that reduce the computational needs, and weaker than expected demand from enterprises and consumers for genAI products.\u201dPrivate AI research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic \u2013 the entities behind the ChatGPT and Claude chatbots \u2013 aren\u2019t traded on public markets, leaving vast sums of money floating around in investor accounts with no way to access some of the big hitters in the generative AI frenzy.Buying shares in multinationals such as Microsoft or Google is already expensive, and only a fraction of an investment is related to the hot new thing. There could be a vast AI boom but if, for example, Google\u2019s search ads business faltered as a result, then the company wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a net winner.Nvidia, by contrast, is selling spades in a gold rush. Despite years of investment in capacity, it continues to sell its top-end chips faster than it can make them. Huge proportions of the investments in frontier AI research flow straight out of the labs and into Nvidia\u2019s coffers, with companies such as Meta committing billions of dollars of spend to secure hundreds of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs (graphics processing units).chartThat type of chip, the company\u2019s specialty, was once sold to enable gamers to experience crisp and smooth graphics in 3D games \u2013 and through a monumental stroke of good luck, turned out to be exactly what cutting-edge researchers needed to build massive AI systems such as GPT-4 or Claude 3.5.GPUs are able to carry out, at great volume and speed, the complicated calculations that underpin the training and operation of AI tools such as chatbots. So any company wanting to build or operate a generative AI product, such as ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini, needs GPUs. The same goes for deployment of freely available AI models such as Meta\u2019s Llama, which also requires vast amounts of chips as part of its training phase. In the case of systems known as large language models (LLMs), training involves crunching through huge blocks of data. This teaches the LLM to recognise patterns in language and gauge what should be the next word or sentence in response to a chatbot query.Nvidia has never quite cornered the AI chip market, though. Google has always relied on its own chips, which it calls TPUs (for \u201ctensor\u201d, a feature of an AI model), and others want to join it. Meta has developed its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, Amazon offers its Trainium2 chips to companies using AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Intel has produced the Gaudi 3.None of the big rivals compete with Nvidia \u2013 yet \u2013 at the absolute top end. But that\u2019s not the only place where competition is happening. A report from the Information, a tech news site, highlighted the rise of \u201cbatch processing\u201d, offering businesses cheaper access to AI models if they\u2019re OK with waiting for their queries to be run at periods of low demand. That, in turn, allows providers such as OpenAI to buy cheaper, more efficient chips for their datacentres rather than focus all their spending on the fastest possible hardware.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to TechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Groq (not to be confused with Elon Musk\u2019s similarly named Grok AI, the launch of which sparked an ongoing trademark dispute) makes chips which can\u2019t be used to train AI at all \u2013 but which run the resulting models blazingly fast. Not to be outdone, the startup Etched, which has just raised $120m, is building a chip that only runs one type of AI model: a \u201ctransformer\u201d, the T in GPT (generative pre-trained transformer).View image in fullscreenJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said the company was \u2018automating $50tn of heavy industry\u2019. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNvidia doesn\u2019t just need to hold its own in the face of competition, big and small. To hit the next milestone, it needs to thrive. Market fundamentals are out of fashion, but if the company was valued like a traditional, low-growth enterprise, even a $3tn market cap would require it to sell a trillion dollars worth of its top-end GPUs a year, at a 30% profit margin, forever, one expert noted.Even if the AI industry grows enough to justify that, Nvidia\u2019s own profit margin may be harder to defend. The company has the chip designs to hold the lead, but the real bottlenecks in its supply chain are the same as for much of the rest of the industry: at the advanced semiconductor foundries, of the sort operated by Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, America\u2019s Intel, China\u2019s SMIC and precious few others around the world. Notably not on that list is Nvidia itself, which is a customer of TSMC. No matter how advanced Nvidia\u2019s chipsets are, if it needs to eat into the rest of TSMC\u2019s order book to match demand, then the profit will inevitably flow that way too.Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage firm Finalto, said the bear case against Nvidia \u2013 market jargon for a sustained fall in share price \u2013 rested on the argument that once the company worked through its order book, it would go back to less frenetic levels of demand.\u201cAll their customers have been rushing to order the GPUs but they won\u2019t be doing that forever,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cCustomers over-order and then start cancelling. It\u2019s a sweet spot now but it cannot be sustained.\u201d He could see Nvidia getting to $4tn and beyond, but \u201cmaybe not at the current pace\u201d.Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of global economics and thematic research, published a note this week asking if Nvidia was \u201cthe fastest growing large company of all time?\u201d Pointing out that Nvidia went from $2tn to $3tn in 30 days, Reid said conversely, it had taken Warren Buffett 60 years to get Berkshire Hathaway close to $1tn.Nonetheless, in a world of low productivity \u2013 a measure of economic efficiency \u2013 and declining working age populations and rising government debts, the economic promise of AI was welcome, said Reid.\u201cIf AI is the catalyst for a fourth Industrial Revolution, that would be very good news,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf not then markets will ultimately have a big problem.\u201dMore is at stake than winning a race to $4tn. This article was amended on 3 July 2024. An earlier version said that if Nvidia was valued like a traditional, low-growth enterprise, even a $3tn market cap would require it to sell a \u201ctrillion of its top-end GPUs a year\u201d; this should have said a trillion dollars worth of its top-end GPUs a year.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIChatGPTGoogleMetaanalysisShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyNvidia shares slump amid reports US is ramping up antitrust investigation4 Sept 2024Nvidia shares fall on slowing growth and production concerns29 Aug 2024Nvidia rides big tech\u2019s AI investment to beat Wall Street\u2019s sky-high expectations28 Aug 2024Why have the big seven tech companies been hit by AI boom doubts?3 Aug 2024Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia investigated over monopoly laws6 Jun 2024Nvidia: what\u2019s so good about the tech firm\u2019s new AI superchip?19 Mar 2024Why has Nvidia driven stock markets to record highs?23 Feb 2024US orders immediate halt to some AI chip exports to China, says Nvidia25 Oct 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

            "response": "Just four companies are hoarding tens of billions of dollars worth of Nvidia GPU chips - Sherwood NewsMeta\u2019s Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun (Julien De Rosa/AFP via Getty Images)GP-who?Just four companies are hoarding tens of billions of dollars worth of Nvidia GPU chipsEach Nvidia H100 can cost up to $40,000, and one big tech company has 350,000 of them.Jon Keegan7/25/24 1:26PMMeta just announced the release of Llama 3.1, the latest iteration of their open source large language model. The long-awaited, jumbo-sized model has high scores on the same benchmarks that everyone else uses, and the company said it beats OpenAi\u2019s ChatGPT 4o on some tests.\u00a0According to the research paper that accompanies the model release, the 405b parameter version of the model (the largest flavor) was trained using up to 16,000 of Nvidia\u2019s popular H100 GPUs . The Nvidia H100 is one of the most expensive, and most coveted pieces of technology powering the current AI boom. Meta appears to have one of the largest hoards of the powerful GPUs.\u00a0Of course, the list of companies seeking such powerful chips for AI training is long, and likely includes most large technology companies today, but only a few companies have publicly crowed about how many H100s they have.\u00a0\u00a0The H100 is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000 meaning that Meta used up to $640 million worth of hardware to train the model. And that\u2019s just a small slice of the Nvidia hardware Meta has been stockpiling. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 H100s in its AI training infrastructure\u00a0\u2013 which adds up to over $10 billion worth of the specialized Nvidia chips.\u00a0Venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the pricey GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity, according to The Information.\u00a0Tesla has also been collecting H100s. Musk said on an earnings call in April that Tesla wants to have between 35,000 and 85,000 H100s by the end of the year.\u00a0\u00a0But Musk also needs H100s for X and his AI company xAI. This week, Musk boasted on X that xAI\u2019s company\u2019s training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s.\u00a0Source: X @elonmusk https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815325410667749760Musk was recently sued by Tesla shareholders for allegedly re-directing 12,000 of the H100s intended for the car maker\u2019s AI training infrastructure to xAI instead. When asked about this diversion in yesterday\u2019s Tesla Q2 earnings call, Musk said that the GPUs were sent to xAI because \u201cthe Tesla data centers were full. There was no place to actually put them.\u201dThe H100s are in such demand that people are being paid to sneak them into China, to bypass U.S. export controls. You can watch unboxing videos of these graphics cards, and there are even a few for sale on Amazon \u2013\u00a0including one for $34,749.95 (with free delivery).OpenAI hasn\u2019t said how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft\u2019s $10 billion investment in OpenAI. The training cluster reportedly has the power of 120,000 of Nvidia\u2019s previous gen A100 GPUs, and will be spending $5 billion to rent more training clusters from Oracle over the next two years, according to The Information\u2019s report. OpenAI does appear to have a special relationship with Nvidia \u2014 in April, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang \u201chand-delivered\u201d the first cluster of the company\u2019s next generation H200 GPUs to co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.\u00a0Source: X @gbd https://x.com/gdb/status/1783234941842518414Nvidia declined to comment for this story, and Meta, X, OpenAI, Tesla, and Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0More TechSee all TechReddit\u2019s stock briefly pumped yesterday after an old news article resurfaced \u2014 it\u2019s deeply in the red todayAn old Reuters article about a Reddit-Google partnership sent RDDT sharply higher yesterday.David Crowther1hRani MollaElectric Shock3hThe many reasons Tesla\u2019s stock is downDoes it even need an excuse anymore?Jon Keegan3hBaidu gets its own \u201creasoning\u201d AI modelWhile DeepSeek\u2019s fast, cheap, and open-source AI models may be getting all of the world\u2019s attention, Baidu, one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, is competing head-to-head with the smaller startup. This weekend, Baidu released two new models: Ernie 4.5, its updated foundational model, and Ernie X1, a new \u201creasoning\u201d model to compete with DeepSeek\u2019s R1. The company said Ernie 4.5 beat OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 on multiple benchmarks for \u201cjust 1% of the price,\u201d according to a press release. Both models are free for individual users of the \u201cErnie Bot\u201d chatbot.

Rani Molla4hAlphabet agrees to buy Wiz in its biggest acquisition everAlphabet\u2019s deal to buy the cybersecurity startup isn\u2019t just back from the dead; it\u2019s been signed. The $32 billion all-cash acquisition is the search giant\u2019s biggest ever. In a blog post justifying the deal, Google wrote:\u201cBoth cybersecurity and cloud computing are rapidly growing industries with a vast range of solutions. The increased role of AI, and adoption of cloud services, have dramatically changed the security landscape for customers, making cybersecurity increasingly important in defending against emergent risks and protecting national security.\u201dGoogle and Wiz had been in talks for a $23 billion acquisition last summer but the deal fell apart over fears of antitrust scrutiny.

Board member James Murdoch was the latest to do so, selling about $13 million worth of stock on March 10, a day when the stock dropped more than any day in five years. Tesla stock has been tumbling precipitously since CEO Elon Musk started further dividing his attention away from his private-sector leadership roles with the Department of Government Efficiency, and is down nearly 4% premarket.Latest StoriesSherwood Media, LLC produces fresh and unique perspectives on topical financial news and is a fully owned subsidiary of Robinhood Markets, Inc., and any views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of any other Robinhood affiliate, including Robinhood Markets, Inc., Robinhood Financial LLC, Robinhood Securities, LLC, Robinhood Crypto, LLC, or Robinhood Money, LLC.Privacy NoticeDisclosuresTerms and ConditionsEditorial StandardsMastheadYour Privacy ChoicesAdvertising Disclaimers\u00a92025 Sherwood Media, LLC"

How to tell what's under your hood\n     \n    A welcome step toward a more open ecosystem for Linux users and developers, the upcoming R560 driver release also puts Nvidia in a better position to compete with AMD. It's about time.\n     Written by \n            Steven Vaughan-Nichols, Senior Contributing Editor  July 18, 2024 at 2:33 p.m. PT                           MF3d/Getty ImagesFor more years than I care to recall, Linux users have hated NVIDIA, the world's leading Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) company. Why? Because years after all the other companies open-sourced their drivers, NVIDIA refused to do so. Nor would it give the Linux kernel developers the data they needed to build open-source drivers for them. That left Linux users stuck with proprietary, second-rate drivers. Now, NVIDIA has finally opened up its GPU driver code.\u00a0Hate wasn't too strong a word. In a famous interview, a frustrated Linus Torvalds said, \"I'm also happy to very publicly point out that Nvidia has been one of the worst trouble spots we've had with hardware manufacturers, and that is really sad because then Nvidia tries to sell chips - a lot of chips - into the Android Market. Nvidia has been the single worst company we've ever dealt with. [Lifts middle finger] So Nvidia, f**k you.\"Also: Linux kernel 6.10 officially rolls out: Here's what's new and improvedAnd, lest we forget, in 2022, the Lapsus$ ransomware gang threatened to leak Nvidia's GPU files if the company refused \"to COMPLETELY OPEN-SOURCE (and distribute under a foss license) their GPU drivers for Windows, macOS and Linux, from now on and forever.\" This was not your usual ransomware demand.That didn't work, but NVIDIA is transitioning fully towards open-source GPU kernel modules as it closes in on a three-trillion-dollar market cap. This marks a major change in its long-standing -- and frankly wrong-headed -- policy.This transition began in May 2022 with the release of the R515 driver, which included a set of Linux GPU kernel modules as open source with dual GPL and MIT licensing. Initially, this release targeted data center compute GPUs, with GeForce and Workstation GPUs in an alpha state.Over the past two years, NVIDIA has worked diligently to improve these open-source modules, achieving equivalent or better application performance than their closed-source counterparts. The company has also added substantial new capabilities, including:Heterogeneous memory management (HMM) supportConfidential computingSupport for the coherent memory architectures of NVIDIA's Grace platformsThese features won't help much with getting the best possible gaming performance, but they could assist cryptocurrency miners or artificial intelligence (AI) developers.\u00a0Also: How open source attracts some of the world's top innovatorsWith the upcoming R560 driver release, NVIDIA will complete its transition to open-source GPU kernel modules. This move is expected to benefit the Linux community by allowing for better integration with the operating system and enabling more robust community development and support.However, it's important to note that this transition doesn't apply to all NVIDIA GPUs. The open-source modules are mandatory for cutting-edge platforms like NVIDIA Grace Hopper or NVIDIA Blackwell. NVIDIA recommends switching to open-source modules for GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper architectures. Older GPUs from the Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta architectures will continue using the proprietary driver, as they're incompatible with the open-source modules.Need help determining what you've got under your computer's hood? NVIDIA provides a shell script, nvidia-driver-assistant, to help you. Once that's done, you can install the CUDA Toolkit and the appropriate GPU drivers using your Linux distros' package manager.Also: Latest AI training benchmarks show Nvidia has no competitionThis move by NVIDIA is a step towards creating a more open ecosystem for Linux users and developers. It also puts NVIDIA in a better position to compete with AMD, which has long been known for its open-source-friendly approach in the Linux space.While this is a significant development, let me remind you that NVIDIA's transition to open-source is currently limited to the kernel modules. The driver's userspace components remain proprietary, which means that full open-source integration, particularly for gaming applications, may still be some way off.As the tech community digests this news, many hope this could begin a broader shift towards open-source practices at NVIDIA, potentially leading to improved compatibility and performance for Linux users.Open Source    \n\n            The open-source tools that could disrupt the entire IT incident management market\n           \n\n            This Linux distro could let your old laptop 'shine on' after Windows 10's sunset\n           \n\n            6 Linux myths, busted\n           \n\n            5 lightweight Linux distributions with very low system requirements\n              \n\n              The open-source tools that could disrupt the entire IT incident management market\n             \n\n              This Linux distro could let your old laptop 'shine on' after Windows 10's sunset\n             \n\n              6 Linux myths, busted\n             \n\n              5 lightweight Linux distributions with very low system requirements\n             Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n      \n      How Nvidia is helping upskill educators and prep students for the AI age\n      \n      The best gaming PCs you can buy: Expert tested\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool   July 5, 2024 6 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            The past five years have been stunning for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders as the company's market cap has soared by a phenomenal 2,900%, turning an investment of just $100 in the stock half a decade ago into just over $3,000 as of this writing. Nvidia stock's 30x rise in these past five years can be justified by the multiple catalysts that have been driving the company's growth. The exceptionally robust demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that are deployed in personal computers (PCs), data centers, and automotive applications has led to a terrific increase in the company's revenue and earnings during this period.   NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.  Now, it would seem far-fetched to expect Nvidia stock to rise another 30x over the next half-decade considering that it has a market cap of just over $3 trillion right now and is one of the three largest companies in the world. The entire global economy, for comparison, was worth an estimated $105 trillion in 2023. However, considering the catalysts ahead, there is a good chance that shares of Nvidia could continue heading higher over the next five years, even if those gains may not be as astronomical as those of the past five. AI is supercharging Nvidia's growth For Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28, its revenue stood at $60.9 billion, up from $11.7 billion in its fiscal 2019. So, Nvidia's top line has increased fivefold over the last five years. Looking ahead, analysts are forecasting something similar may happen thanks to the massive growth driver that is the artificial intelligence (AI) market.  Mizuho Securities is anticipating Nvidia's data center revenue alone will jump to $280 billion in 2027, which will coincide with the majority of Nvidia's fiscal year 2028. That would be a huge increase over the $47.5 billion data center revenue the company reported in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year and coincided with 11 months of 2023) and the $89 billion revenue it is projected to generate from this market in the current fiscal year 2025. One reason why that forecast may be accurate is that the market for AI chips is expected to reach a whopping $400 billion in annual revenue in 2027 (which would be fiscal 2028 for Nvidia), according to Nvidia's peer AMD. Mizuho's Nvidia revenue estimate for calendar 2027 (fiscal 2028 for Nvidia) suggests that it would be controlling 70% of the AI chip market at that time. Though that would be lower than the 90%-plus share that the company currently commands in this market, it would still be able to deliver a massive bump in revenue considering the potential size of the AI chip market after four fiscal years.   Story Continues What's worth noting here is that even if the AI chip market takes longer than forecast to hit $400 billion in revenue and even if Nvidia's share shrinks to as low as 50%, its data center revenue alone could grow still four-fold in the coming years.These catalysts could give Nvidia an additional boostNvidia has other potential growth drivers that could contribute to the expansion of its top line.For instance, the market for gaming GPUs that are installed in PCs is likely to benefit from an increase in spending on gaming hardware. Statista predicts that the gaming hardware market will generate $161 billion in revenue in 2024, and forecasts that it could grow to $241 billion by 2029. Nvidia should be a big beneficiary of this growth considering that it controlled an impressive 88% of the market for PC graphics cards in the first quarter of 2024.Meanwhile, in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, growing demand for digital twin systems drove revenue in Nvidia's professional visualization business up by 45% year over year to $427 million.Nvidia is scratching the surface of a potentially huge opportunity in the digital twin market. According to a forecast from Mordor Intelligence, that space could generate $126 billion in revenue in 2029. From this year's forecast $26 billion, that would be a compound annual growth rate of 37%. More importantly, Nvidia is building a solid base of customers for its digital twin offerings. This was evident from the remarks made by CFO Colette Kress on the latest earnings conference call:Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse-powered digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Kress added that industrial software developers such as Cadence, Ansys, Dassault, and Siemens are some of the major names that are adopting its digital twin software. As such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's revenue growth over the next five years could match the growth that it has experienced in the past five. In fact, analysts are forecasting that its top line will triple in the space of just three fiscal years (from fiscal 2024 levels of $60.9 billion).  NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts. Assuming Nvidia does hit $184.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2027, its top line would have increased at a compound annual rate of 45%. If the semiconductor giant's growth tapers off in the two that follow years to, let's say 25% a year, its revenue could reach $288 billion after five years. That would be close to a 5x increase in its revenue from fiscal 2024, and would be almost equivalent to the growth clocked by the company in the past five years.Of course, there is a good chance that the company could grow at a faster pace thanks to the catalysts discussed above. That's why investors who haven't bought this growth stock yet can still consider adding Nvidia to their portfolios. The tech giant seems poised for much more upside over the next five years.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Dugan,\n          staff writer at Intelligencer, who covers money and business\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\nPhoto-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Rica Reeb\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re unlikely to know Jacopo Pantaleoni\u2019s name, but you definitely know his work.\u00a0As a computer scientist, Pantaleoni helped develop the graphics systems for James Cameron\u2019s Avatar and write programs for Mental Images, one of the technology companies behind The Matrix. Pantaleoni, whose specialty is turning data into images, went on to spend 15 years at Nvidia developing its flagship product, the graphics processing unit. His work has helped shape the ultrarealistic world of digital images that make up everything from video games to movies to the world of bioinformatics, which is crucial to the study of DNA sequencing. It is also essential for artificial intelligence, serving as the backbone of OpenAI and its competitors.\nBut Pantaleoni, who lives in Germany, quit Nvidia last July,\u00a0just as the artificial-intelligence boom was catapulting the company to the tech world\u2019s upper echelons. He has since become an outspoken critic not only of AI technology but of Nvidia\u2019s role as the engine of that boom. To Pantaleoni, the most worrying consequence of AI technology isn\u2019t the kind of apocalyptic, Matrix-like scenario sometimes floated by Silicon Valley magnates. He worries instead about a more familiar scenario: that a small number of AI companies will hoard an unhealthy amount of power, influence, and information. He has since written a book, The Quickest Revolution: An Insider\u2019s Guide to Sweeping Technological Change, and Its Largest Threats, and is now advising government regulators on how to rein in the technology. I spoke with Pantaleoni in late May about why he\u2019s left Big Tech behind.\n\n\n\nTell me what spurred you to leave Nvidia.It was the realization that the scope of my contributions to society, whether directly or indirectly, was much larger than I thought it would ever be, and the need for a time of reflection and critical thought about that. The bulk of my indirect contributions to society were not necessarily positive. Right now, computing technology is posing several risks to society that are still underestimated \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about existential risks from super-intelligent AI or anything like that.\nYou\u2019re not?\u00a0No. Right now, that\u2019s a known risk. That is being put forward by personalities like Sam Altman to distract from the most urgent issue, which is that [people like Altman] often have very vested interests. The main risk right now is the concentration of power and, consequently, the displacement of jobs. One of the other major things, which I\u2019m exploring in my book, is the increasing cognitive weakening that\u00a0computing technology is pressing on society at scale.\nWe\u2019re giving the bulk of our attention away to algorithms specifically designed to maximize the grabbing and holding of our attention and that mostly appeal to our visual cortex \u2014\u00a0which is what I mostly have contributed to in my lifetime. I did mostly visual computing. And the power of visual computing is actually what allowed companies like Nvidia to succeed.\nTell me about the work you did and how it contributed to the issues you\u2019re so concerned about today. My background is that of an expert in rendering technologies, which produces pictures that look as realistic as possible from three-dimensional datasets models of visual things that do not exist. I started this in the \u201990s for the visual-effects industry. I wrote one of the main rendering engines for Avatar. Before that, I was a visual scientist for Mental Images, which was the company that created the software for The Matrix movies \u2014 that was done before I joined. My career focused mostly on high-performance and high-quality, high-fidelity rendering of computer graphics.\nThat same technology transferred to computer games. That\u2019s how companies like Nvidia were born in the late \u201990s and 2000s \u2014 they started to produce hardware to bring that kind of rendering to the masses for computer games. I worked for Nvidia Research to develop visual computing technologies with a five-year horizon. Back in 2010, we realized \u2014\u00a0I mean, Jensen Huang and people like me who do research \u2014 we realized that the kind of computing power needed for computer graphics was exactly the kind of power needed for tasks like machine learning and artificial intelligence. That was the genius of Jensen Huang. People like me contributed by making our hardware more and more programmable and more and more accessible to the masses.\nAt what point did you start to have reservations about it?I don\u2019t know if reservation is the right word, but I started having a strange feeling about the impact of my work around 2014 or 2015. I saw a drastic shift. I saw that companies like Google and Amazon were becoming much, much bigger customers of that same kind of machinery while developing the massive, parallel computing power for uses that were totally different. They were starting to employ machine learning at scale, essentially for advertising and for driving the attention economy.\nHow did that actually work? What were they doing that was so different?I think that\u2019s actually the secret to the success of Google. They were essentially machine-learning companies, the first companies which profited enormously from the scalability of computer equipment. And they were one of the first companies to overcome the so-called diminishing returns that afflicted all the manufacturing companies from the previous ages. They were actually accelerating returns.\nHow did they do that?Well, if you have a regular manufacturing company and you want to expand, you have to pay more salaries to more human workers. You have to get more goods, more raw materials. In this case, the raw materials of companies like Google were totally free. It\u2019s just the information. And they could simply process this raw material by throwing more and more computer power at it.\nWas it a surprise to you that the technology you were creating was being used this way?It was a surprise. I had dedicated my life to building technology that turned mathematics into art, and to turn computing into an instrument for scientific research \u2014\u00a0for example, DNA sequencing. So to see the usage of this technology would be essentially for advertisement and the attention economy, that was a bit of a disappointment.\nWas there anything that you could do about that over at Nvidia?I don\u2019t think so. Nvidia is not contributing to the attention economy, but it is the engine that powers it. A company like Nvidia cannot say \u201cWe refuse to power this market.\u201d My thought, when I left, was that it is fundamentally impossible to change the outcomes these companies produce from the inside. The only way to fundamentally alter their effects on society is through regulation.\nYou mentioned before that the real end risk is the concentration of power. How do we get from a chatbot that is telling people to put glue in their pizza to the problems you\u2019re concerned with?When you build a tool that everybody on earth ends up using, you are already concentrating power in your hands. These tools automate more and more tasks.\nA lot of news organizations, including New York Magazine\u2019s parent company, are partnering with OpenAI. Do you think that will have the same kind of effect on how the news industry operates?When there\u2019s a single company, or a few companies, that own the tools that essentially produce the news worldwide, that is political power. So these things have to be regulated. There\u2019s no other way around. We are putting ourselves in a dangerous situation and our democracies in a dangerous position.\nDo you still own shares in Nvidia?I do.\nHas the price of Nvidia shares affected your life?It did. Even before this increase of the shares, the skyrocketing of Nvidia\u2019s shares did have an effect on my economic life and on the lives of many colleagues of mine who stayed.\nThat was another aspect that rang some alarm bells in my head. I essentially noticed that I was going from being a well-paid graphics specialist whose work was still niche to being in a new superstar league, populated by the scientists from companies like Google and Nvidia and Amazon, who are now technically among the one percent in terms of wealth.\nDo you feel conflicted about that?I definitely do. I felt that there was a bit of an imbalance between the surging economic wealth and economic value of computer scientists working at these firms and their actual contribution to the world, especially as I was feeling the net effect was not essentially positive.\nYou\u2019re saying that the financial reward you got from your work at Nvidia has outweighed your contribution to society?\u00a0That\u2019s a good framing. I would say that the impact of my work to society was certainly large, but it was not necessarily as positive as I would have wished.\nDo you plan on holding on to the shares of Nvidia you\u2019ve held onto?Not necessarily. Right now, I just see them as part of my savings for my family and it\u2019s not something I necessarily think I will hold onto.\nAre you planning on giving money away?I don\u2019t have that much wealth that I can actually give it away. I didn\u2019t get rich because of Nvidia. I definitely can enjoy a year without working.\nWhat do you see yourself doing now? I pivoted toward becoming a public expert. I provided consulting for regulators. I\u2019ve been invited to speak at conferences. I don\u2019t know if I want to work as an expert in technology again \u2014 possibly, but I will have to find something that really sits well with my my desire to have a positive impact on society.\nWhat\u2019s a tech project that would have a positive impact on society?Anything related to medicine, for example, that tries to use technology in a positive way to solve medical issues and not in an exploitative way. Or to develop calmer technology \u2014 technology that does not try to grab your attention but that is more peripheral, so to speak. Or any kind of technology that would do the opposite of what is being done today with these AI assistants. For example, technology that would inspire children to be more social, or more geared toward learning, to use their intellect to learn to solve problems.\nDo you think people are generally aware of how they\u2019re affected by technology?Right now, there is a great divide. But that is not based on studies. It\u2019s just my own perception of social media and the kind of people who use social media. Many influencers, for example, see social media as their chance in life. And they end up believing that having hundreds of thousands of followers is actually meaningful. In fact, they are all strangers who will not affect their lives in any way, other than through advertisements.\nDo you think that AI technology is going to accelerate that?I think so. It\u2019s being used to maximize attention-grabbing at an even bigger scale and exploiting all the possible information about their users and the preferences of the users. And on the other side, it allows users to generate more content \u2014\u00a0to populate the web with even more distracting information. It makes it more complex to distinguish fact from fiction.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer\u00a0Newsletter\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n          Privacy Policy and\n          Terms of Service apply.\n        \nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nnvidia\n\n\nopenai\n\n\njust asking questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nWhy An Nvidia Engineer Quit at the Start of the AI Boom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Are Visa and Green-Card Holders Being Detained and Deported?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pursuit of the Bitcoin God\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Is Playing a Dangerous Game With the Courts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople With Parents With Money\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Is Designing His Own Recession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Are Visa and Green-Card Holders Being Detained and Deported?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Is Playing a Dangerous Game With the Courts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pursuit of the Bitcoin God\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Will the Declassified JFK Files Be Released Publicly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University Must Choose Between Courage and Cowardice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremembrance\n\nMy Cool Friend Michelle\nMy Cool Friend Michelle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlife after roe\n\nThe Chilling Arrest of a Midwife Under Texas\u2019 Abortion Ban\nThe Chilling Arrest of a Midwife Under Texas\u2019 Abortion Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nself\n\n\u2018My \u201cFacial Dysmorphia\u201d Destroyed My Ability to Be Free\u2019\n\u2018My \u201cFacial Dysmorphia\u201d Destroyed My Ability to Be Free\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSign In to Comment\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FEED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2:23 p.m.\npolitics\n\n\n\n       \n\n\npolitics\nSchumer Goes on Offense: \u2018I Should Be the Leader\u2019\n\nBy Nia Prater\n\nThe Senate minority leader made the rounds on Tuesday, defending his decision to keep the government open.\n\n\n\n\n\n12:25 p.m.\nearly and often\n\n\n\n       \n\n\nearly and often\nCongressional GOP\u2019s Submission to Trump Seems to Have No Limit\n\nBy Ed Kilgore\n\nSilent acceptance of Trump\u2019s power grabs makes him happy and protects Republicans in Congress from accountability for his misdeeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n11:58 a.m.\ntremendous content\n\n\n\n       \n\n\ntremendous content\nTrump Tried to Pull a Nicolas Cage, Steal the Declaration of Independence\n\nBy Margaret Hartmann\n\nTrump asked about using the original document, which is on display at the National Archives, as Oval Office d\u00e9cor.

Many of the verified sellers said they have supplies amounting to dozens of the high-end Nvidia chips each month,\u201d the story reported. \u201cThe flow of Nvidia chips is so steady that most of those sellers take preorders and promise delivery in weeks, the Journal found. Some also sold entire servers \u2014 costing upward of roughly $300,000 \u2014 with each containing eight high-end Nvidia chips.\u201d\nThe WSJ said the system relies on various loopholes in the restrictions, such as filing incomplete paperwork that obscures the fact that the chips are not allowed for export, or that other countries are not enforcing the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US restrictions are policed by the US Commerce Department, which has been criticized for weak enforcement efforts.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBut enforcing these restrictions is difficult and perhaps untenable, said Brian Levine, an Ernst & Young managing partner who used to work for the US Justice Department where he investigated and prosecuted trafficking in counterfeit goods and other intellectual property crimes. He was also a federal representative to the US law enforcement Joint Liaison Group with China.\n\u201cTrafficking in counterfeit goods is also illegal, but who hasn\u2019t seen counterfeit designer handbags being openly sold on a street corner?\u201d Levine said. \u201cThere is really no limit to how much time, energy, and money one can spend on enforcement. The question is really \u2018How much of our limited public resources do we actually want tied up in such an effort?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrina Tsukerman, president of global strategy advisory firm Scarab Rising, echoed a point made in the WSJ article that the situation involves two very different groups. The first is a group of people who are taking advantage of the loopholes \u201cby legal means and are looking to make a quick profit for themselves.\u201d\u00a0The second group are professional smugglers who are bringing in the chips in large quantities.\nThe WSJ report interviewed various chip resellers who had little difficulty getting around US restrictions.\nChinese resale prices for the chips have fallen of late, but are still at a premium compared to standard list price. Nvidia\u2019s A100 chip sells for $22,500 in China, compared to around $10,000 elsewhere, and the higher-end H100 for $32,400 instead of $25,000, the newspaper reported. \u201cSome merchants said they have up to dozens of chips in stock at one time, and preorders of bigger quantities can be delivered in one to two weeks,\u201d it said, noting that the chips are supplied in original wholesale packaging. The report quoted one distributor on how they get around restrictions. \u201cIt does become very hard, but don\u2019t be silly, there is always a way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nNews\n\nNvidia unveils preview of DeepSeek-R1 NIM microservice\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Thor Olavsrud \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t31 Jan 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n3 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nNvidia intros new guardrail microservices for agentic AI\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Thor Olavsrud \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t16 Jan 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n4 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nNvidia unveils generative physical AI platform, agentic AI advances at CES\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Thor Olavsrud \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t06 Jan 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n7 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology Industry\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\nAccenture-Nvidia deal: A first peek into the new world of gen AI-centric strategies\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Evan Schuman \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t02 Oct 2024\t\t\t\t\t\n\n6 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccenture\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNvidia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Evan Schuman                                                            \n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Evan Schuman on X\n\n\nFollow Evan Schuman on LinkedIn\n \n\n\n\nEvan Schuman has covered IT issues for a lot longer than he'll ever admit.

In May 2024, Google revealed its sixth generation of its TPUs, dubbed Trillium, claiming that it has a 4.7x compute boost and is 67 percent more energy efficient than the previous generation.Apple\u2019s engineers noted that Google\u2019s chips could potentially facilitate the creation of even larger, more sophisticated models than those discussed in their paper.Apple's AI offering - called Apple Intelligence - will be available for testing by its beta users this week.Apple has long been a Google Cloud customer and is believed to be the platform's single biggest storage customer. The company is reportedly working with TSMC to develop its own chips.Reuters first reported that Apple was using Google to help train its AI models in June 2024, though the seeming absence of Nvidia chips was only revealed in Apple's latest paper.Nvidia controls around 80 percent of the market for AI chips. The company has seen massive growth over the last year, having reached a $3.34 trillion valuation in June 2024.This followed the company hitting $2 trillion in February 2024, after a $1 trillion valuation in May 2023.Despite this, shares in Nvidia have taken a hit this month, with the company's value dropping by 6.8 percent on July 24 alone. Some of this has been put down to concern about the revenue generated by AI.Earlier this month, a research newsletter from Goldman Sachs warned that, despite large tech companies investing massive amounts in fueling generative AI, they have yet to demonstrate sustainable business models.The investment banking firm estimates that around $1 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure in the next year, but says that even if a 'killer application' emerges, it is unclear if it will generate the financial returns.Google similarly saw a hit to its share value, having dipped by 7.24 percent this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in IT Hardware & Semiconductors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture-proof your datacenter with DDC S-Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan sends officials to Washington to try and head off US chip tariffs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nSoftware and hardware co-design: Optimizing next-gen compute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Cloud & Hyperscale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State of Data and AI in Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\nAWS launches new Outposts rack and server offerings for telcos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nAchieving sustainable data centers through circular design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nApple\n\n\nTrillium\n\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform\n\n\nAI\n\n\nTPU\n\n\nGCP\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!
