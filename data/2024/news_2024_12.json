Vinh, who has an Overweight rating and a $180 price target on the shares, noted that Nvidia has continued to surpass the average expectations of Wall Street analysts. Moreover, the Street keeps raising their estimates for the chip maker, the analyst added.   Why NVDA Stock Lost 10% in One Week   Another reason for Vinh's bullishness on NVDA stock is his positive view of the company's upcoming Blackwell chips. Specifically, the analyst stated that these chips will enable the company to benefit from higher prices and provide its customers with superior AI training capabilities. Also importantly, Vinh expects Nvidia's AI chips to continue to outperform those of its competitors going forward.  Despite the analyst's optimism about the firm's outlook, he did discuss a bear-case scenario for Nvidia.\u00a0 Vinh suggested that Nvidia could lose share to a number of its competitors, including Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD). He noted that Broadcom predicted recently that its revenue from AI chips would quadruple to $60 billion to $90 billion in three years. Additionally, he stated that a number of large companies, including Google (GOOGL), are building their own AI chips. Vinh believes that these concerns are among the reasons for the recent decline of NVDA stock. However, he continues to recommend buying the stock at its current levels, citing the positive outlook for the AI chip market. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By one metric, the company is valued even higher than Nvidia. Concerning the fact that its recent success has come in a very niche market segment, we believe the high valuation is not sustainable and the stock is trading too high.   Analyst Says NVIDIA (NVDA) Likely To \u2018Falter a Little Bit\u2019 in 2025 Amid Focus in Customer AI Chips   Broadcom\u2019s recent surge has come on the back of hyperscalers needing to accelerate their AI training models. Companies like Alphabet and Meta Platforms have utilized Broadcom\u2019s expertise in making custom chips to create their own versions of GPUs, ones that excel at repetitive tasks like large language model training.  Analysts expect Broadcom to hit $80 billion in annual revenue by 2027 (currently just above $50 billion). At its current valuation, the stock is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 14. Analysts also expect Nvidia to make $250 billion in revenue by 2027. This makes Nvidia\u2019s price-to-sales hovering just below 14. By this metric, Broadcom is valued higher than Nvidia! But that\u2019s not all. Investors also need to consider the quality of revenue. Broadcom\u2019s clients that are responsible for its projected growth are a handful of hyperscalers. These hyperscalers not only pay Broadcom to build custom chips but then also have to pay them to develop software. On top of this, they need to train their engineers in collaboration with Broadcom. There is no way any other company other than Big Tech can afford this type of spending. Broadcom has successfully catered to this niche opportunity, but it doesn\u2019t change its fundamental business (which isn\u2019t in very good shape if we exclude the AI impact).  Compare this to Nvidia and you\u2019ll realize why Broadcom isn\u2019t worth the same valuation. Nvidia makes the best GPUs by a long margin. It also sells them better, making it affordable for companies of all sizes. This affordability not only comes from the price but also from software support. Moreover, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins of nearly 80% make its revenue worth a higher multiple in comparison to Broadcom\u2019s gross margins of 63%. If anything, it is Nvidia that is undervalued here, not Broadcom. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. What to Expect From the Stock Market in 2025? On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025.

Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a \"tale of two halves,\" where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps.  Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year.   Story Continues   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Edge Computing Stock to Invest in According to Analysts?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.Our MethodologyTo compile the list of 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years, we applied a consensus approach. We sifted through recent articles to get an aggregated list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Funds: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the leading GPU makers internationally, which is driving the AI revolution. It had previously revolutionized the gaming industry through its technology, now its GPUs are the powerhouse for data centers, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and more.The company has been generating substantial income through its revolutionary technology. Over the past 5 years, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has grown its top line by 62% and bottom line by 92%. During its third quarter of fiscal 2024, it generated $35.1 billion in revenue, indicating 94% year-over-year. While the gaming segment contributed $3.8 billion to the total, data center revenue stood out after growing 112% to contribute $30.8 billion.NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell architecture has been a significant advancement in GPU technology, particularly with its flagship GB200 GPU. The demand for the Blackwell and Hopper platforms has driven substantial revenue growth in the company\u2019s Data Center segment.

It is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years.Ithaka Group\u2019s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Zacks Equity Research   December 25, 2024 4 min read           In This Article:  NVDA            When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).  Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.25, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.25 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 37 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.1% and 6.8% of all recommendations.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.  In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.   Story Continues It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in NVDA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $2.94.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.

Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined\u00a0Catalysts\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market.  Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very \u201cflattish\u201d so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects \u201cSanta Claus\u201d to make an appearance this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bullish Environment for Big Tech\u201d Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined\u00a0Market Domination\u00a0on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties \u201cneed each other\u201d to thrive, suggesting that Musk\u2019s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely.  He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence.   Story Continues Our Methodology\u00a0To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock To Invest In Now?  A semiconductor production line, showing the complex procedures of chip manufacture.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated revenue worth $35.1 billion, up by 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. Most of the demand was propelled by the market\u2019s growing AI needs in hardware especially. The company\u2019s growing demand for its data center services and its Blackwell AI chip has ramped up expectations for the coming year.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been lagging compared to its record close last month. However, despite that analysts remain bullish on the stock, tying great expectations to its growth potential. On November 21, CFRA Research senior equity analyst, Angelo Zino, joined Yahoo Finance where he discussed his thesis on the stock. Zino shared that the stock has enormous cash flow potential, given the demand projections for its Blackwell AI chip and data center services. He also added that the stock has solid financials and will continue to exceed expectations in the coming year. Zino emphasized that investors must not read \u201ctoo much\u201d into the guidance especially because making a complex technology demands time. Overall, analysts are also bullish on NVDA and their median price target of $175 points to an upside of nearly 35%.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Sheryar Siddiq   December 2, 2024 6 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.59%       We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Louis Navellier's other stock picks. Louis Navellier, Chairman and Founder of Navellier & Associates, is a renowned American investor who is celebrated for his skill in navigating the stock market and delivering impressive profits. Leading a firm dedicated to growth investments, Navellier\u2019s strategy is reflected in his high-performing portfolio. His journey began in a college mainframe computer lab in the 1970s. While studying at the now Cal State East Bay, Navellier set out to validate the prevailing belief that beating the market was impossible. His original aim was to create an index product before index investing became mainstream, attempting to replicate the S&P 500. Ironically, his project failed by succeeding. Rather than simply matching the market, his model consistently outperformed it, uncovering inefficiencies that became the cornerstone of his investment philosophy. In 1987, Navellier would go on to establish Navellier & Associates, a fund dedicated to providing customized portfolio strategies aimed at maximizing returns while effectively managing risk for individual investors.  With decades of expertise in translating academic theories into real-world market strategies, Louis Navellier champions a disciplined approach to quantitative analysis for identifying market-beating stocks. His methodology follows a meticulous three-step process: quantitative analysis to pinpoint high-potential opportunities, fundamental analysis to evaluate each candidate's financial health and growth prospects, and portfolio optimization to fine-tune the selection for maximum performance. Throughout his career, Navellier has identified numerous \u201cthousand-percent winners,\u201d from Conair\u2019s dominance in the hair dryer market during the 1980s to NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI chips today. His methodology emphasizes discovering well-managed companies that lead their industries, particularly those with expanding operating margins and steady earnings growth. Navellier's U.S. Outlook In a Market 360 article, Louis Navellier offered insights into the recent presidential election and its potential market implications under a Trump 2.0 administration. He highlighted the critical role manufacturing played in the 2024 election outcome by pointing to the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) report, which revealed a decline in the manufacturing index to 46.5 in October from 47.2 in September, signaling contraction (any reading below 50). The details paint an even grimmer picture: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' payroll report has revised August and September job figures downward by a combined 112,000. As such, manufacturing took a significant hit, with 46,000 jobs lost, partly due to Boeing's ongoing challenges. Here's what Navellier had to say about the report:   Story Continues \"All in all, this payroll report was a statistical mess and will likely need to be revised when we have more information. But it also drove Treasury yields lower and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut key interest rates, since the Fed is now more worried about the job market than inflation.\" According to Navellier, the new administration is expected to drive growth in the manufacturing sector through a combination of measures: implementing tariffs to counter unfair overseas competition, encouraging the Federal Reserve to maintain lower interest rates, and leveraging cheaper energy prices that position the U.S. favorably compared to Europe and Japan. He noted that if these strategies succeed, the U.S. could see a manufacturing boom.On the other hand, Navellier has been one of the biggest heralds of AI and its implications. Currently, many investors remain heavily focused on the \"first generation\" of AI stocks and while Wall Street's AI darling is likely to continue generating returns, Navellier states that it has become yesterday's story. According to the investor, the real opportunity lies in the \"second generation\" of AI stocks; companies poised to harness generative AI to build profitable enterprises and revolutionize existing industries. This next wave will usher in transformational change of a kind that happens only once every 25 years. The companies that adapt to this second wave of AI will soar, delivering years of outperformance. Those that fail to embrace this shift risk falling behind\u2014or even disappearing altogether. Conversely, Navellier believes that AI will also dismantle outdated industries and businesses. The \"Real AI Boom\", as he calls it, will mint new millionaires\u2014and even billionaires\u2014while driving hundreds, if not thousands, of stocks worldwide to collapse.Our MethodologyFor this analysis, we examined Navellier & Associates\u2019 stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm\u2019s stake value in each holding.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Navellier & Associates\u2019 Stake Value: $67.32 millionNumber of Hedge Funds Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a global leader in graphics computing and networking, leverages its GPUs to dominate the gaming and AI markets, contributing to its trillion-dollar valuation.On November 22, Jefferies reaffirmed its Buy rating for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $185. The firm projects sustained demand for NVIDIA's Hopper products through mid-2025, with Blackwell products expected to face supply constraints well into late 2025 and potentially 2026. Insights from the SC24 industry conference further highlighted robust demand for NVIDIA's offerings, consistent with the strong levels observed in 2023.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a record $35.1 billion in total revenue, exceeding expectations, and forecasts $37.5 billion for the next quarter. The upcoming Blackwell chips are also anticipated to significantly drive revenues. Although initial ramp-up costs for Blackwell may temporarily pressure gross margins, the company expects them to stabilize at mid-70% levels in the latter half of the year.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Louis Navellier's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -0.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.  For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share, indicating a change of +61.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +126.2%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.16 indicates a change of +41.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.   Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.72 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +70.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $129.02 billion and $191.84 billion estimates indicate +111.8% and +48.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +93.6%. EPS of $0.81 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.27%. The EPS surprise was +8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amidst all this, its stock has hardly gone anywhere in the last 6 months but is still up 174% this year! We all know that when Nvidia rallies, it rallies like no other stock. So when is the next rally coming? The question isn\u2019t easy to answer. We believe it is much easier to bet on Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects rather than trying to predict its next bull run. It could be the next earnings report, or it could be the emergence of an AI-associated technology that requires even more Nvidia GPUs to run.   Nvidia NVDA Stock   On the flip side, Big Tech could surprise us by reducing its spending. Others may claim there are enough Nvidia GPUs out there and we don\u2019t need more. When the crypto boom of 2021 arrived, everyone wanted to buy GPUs. This skyrocketing demand resulted in a price surge, with chip companies bringing in record revenues. But as soon as the demand died down, all of a sudden there were enough GPUs in the market and consumers had no need to upgrade.  We could have something similar happen with the GPUs now. At some point, AI demand may die down and the existing hardware enough to satisfy the market. When that happens, a 50% correction can\u2019t be ruled out, just like the one that happened in 2022. So what\u2019s the long-term play here then? Here\u2019s what we think. Nvidia has already sold a high number of GPUs. With the Blackwell variant, it will continue to sell more in the near future. Then what? We believe it is similar to how Apple moved on from iPhone. iPhone sales were the driver of Apple\u2019s growth for a long time, just like GPU sales are now driving Nvidia\u2019s growth. Apple pivoted to the services segment once it had enough devices in its ecosystem. Nvidia could do something similar to monetize its existing GPUs. It isn\u2019t too far-fetched to think that Nvidia could venture into the cloud computing business at some point in the future. If Amazon and Google can make their own chips and not buy from Nvidia, Nvidia can build its own cloud so it doesn\u2019t have to rely on cloud service providers to monetize its GPUs. There isn\u2019t any evidence to suggest that this may happen. But if investors are in it for the long run, they won\u2019t be disappointed by Nvidia's management. After Blackwell, there will be more innovation.  Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

As 2024 approaches its end, the stock market has been through it all. The driving theme of the year has been artificial intelligence as investors and media have ardently poured over AI companies' every word during all earnings seasons. Alongside AI, the Federal Reserve has been focused on tailoring its interest rate policy to match the labor market's performance and inflation. Finally, November ends with the result of the 2024 US Presidential Election confirming President-elect Donald Trump's victory.  These three primary stock market drivers have short and long-term implications for equities. AI companies have to ensure that their margins are robust and that the technologies they have invested billions of dollars into can generate profits. The Fed's interest rate decisions will determine liquidity for institutional investors, venture capitalists, and the broader corporate sector. Finally, the incoming administration's policies towards sectors such as energy, banking, and clean energy might shape the macroeconomic environment either to their benefit or encumbrance. Therefore, it's worth seeing what the professionals are saying within this dynamically shifting stock market environment. On this front, investment bank Morgan Stanley has plenty of research floating around. Starting from the bank's head of applied equity team Andrew Slimmon, he believes that the outcome of a Presidential election has rarely impacted the pre-election trend of the flagship S&P stock index. According to Slimmon, if the market has been in an uptrend heading into the election, then it \"has been higher 3 and 6 months later 85% of the time, regardless of the election outcome.\" He adds that the market has been in an uptrend year as well, and looking at history, November and December are typically the two strongest months for the market.  The MS analyst believes that while this two-month period is the strongest in history, historically, it also \"follows the two worst months of the year.\" As September and October have not followed this trend, one key historical factor does not match. However, Slimmon is optimistic, going on to outline that \"November-December will repeat its historic strong performance once we get through the noise surrounding the election.\" Four key reasons are behind this optimism. As per Slimmon, November sees the highest number of corporate buybacks and the most retail funds flow into the market, there will be post-election clarity for firms, and the Fed's interest rate cuts, no matter how small, are always great for the market. The analyst also cycles back to his opinion that pre-election trends continue to persist post-election, and he shares that communications services, utilities, and financials are some sectors that have performed well before the election.   Story Continues Jim Caron, MS' CIO of the Portfolio Solutions Group, shares his take on the remaining unknowns for the stock market now that the election is over. Focusing on the Federal Reserve's path ahead,\u00a0 he shares that the process of managing interest rates is now \"an exercise in risk management\" for the central bank. This is because the Fed has to carefully balance between ensuring that interest rates are in neutral territory as implied by the R* or the rate that ensures the economy is in equilibrium. Right now, Caron believes that the rates are in restrictive territory, and the primary risk that the Fed is managing is the condition of the labor market which \"would be worsened if policy rates were restrictive when it happened.\" This leads Caron to conclude that the Fed might cut rates to range between 4% and 3.7%, and on a more optimistic note, this \"may be the case even if the decline in inflation seems to be stalling perhaps temporarily because if they don't cut rates now, they may not be able to if there are some unfriendly inflation prints ahead.\"What does this careful balance between cutting rates to ensure the labor market remains robust while simultaneously keeping an eye on inflation mean for investors? Well, according to the MS analyst, in the worst-case scenario that the central bank \"switches their policy from cutting to hiking,\" the 10-year bond yields should range between 3.9% and 4.6%. Not only does this mean that \"owning bonds can also be a good hedge against equities,\" believes Caron, but he adds that equities \" should still find support and value from a stable and lower bond yield environment.\" He concludes by outlining that MS' portfolio realignment includes moving \"to increase equity exposure at duration to hedge and moving into levered credit, December carries with its special significance beyond the normal year-end dynamics, it will set the stage for how Fed policy may move markets.\"Finally, before we head to our list of Morgan Stanley's top cyclical stock picks, the bank's key themes for November are also worth noting. On the topic of equities, the bank shares in its November 2024 Beat report that \"Financials offer an attractive risk/reward across both our base-case, soft-landing view and a potential risk scenario where inflation concerns return and lift rates higher.\" Naturally, any market report without mentioning artificial intelligence would be incomplete, and for MS, utility stocks are among the key AI beneficiaries. It outlines that \"utility companies are in the early stages of what will be a multi-year capital expenditure cycle designed to increase their power generation capacity and service new demand.\"Just like Goldman Sachs, MS also believes that there is great potential in the equal-weighted flagship S&P index. Its data shows that when compared to the index's long-term median 12-month forward consensus EPS of roughly 2%, the EPS of the market cap weighted index is 5.9%. This shows that the cap-weighted index is fully valued, but, for the equal-weight index, the consensus forward estimates are 1.5% which hints at undervaluation. The differential leads MS to conclude that \"S&P equal-weighted EPS offer a cleaner comparison and show scope for cyclical EPS upside.\"On the topics of financial stocks and the benefits stemming from artificial intelligence on utilities, MS shares that financial stocks \"offer an attractive risk/reward profile.\" This optimism is driven by the sector's exposure to interest rates. In its data, the bank outlines that when compared to materials, industrial, and energy stocks, as well as the spread between 10-year and 2-year bonds, financial stocks offer as much as a 15-point performance gain over a base of 100 points. It adds that financial stocks also lead cyclical stocks when Citi's US Economy Surprise Index starts to edge higher. As for utilities, the bank shares that positive \"forecasts for the data center buildout have helped catalyze outperformance for utilities relative to other defensive sectors.\"For some financial stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now.Our MethodologyTo make our list of Morgan Stanley's top cyclical stocks, we ranked the bank's recent list of favored cyclical stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2024.Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the GPU designer whose products have taken the artificial intelligence industry, the technology industry, and Wall Street by storm. The firm's shares are up by more than 700% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT as the AI model has convinced investors that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products are at the heart of any innovation in AI. Yet, the firm's reliance on its GPUs also means that any weakness in AI spending or big tech's inability to generate profits from the technology can lead to headwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Given the high demand for its products, big tech is adamant in developing custom AI chips, and the resulting short supply has also introduced smooth availability of the products as another key factor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s hypothesis. Consequently, for the stock to do well, not only does the firm have to keep its margins high, but it also has to ensure that a steady stream of products is available to customers who otherwise might start seeking alternatives to stay ahead in the AI race.Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on Morgan Stanley's list of cyclical stocks that are best for economic recovery. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Cramer Explains Why the AI Leader\u2019s Stock is Still a Buy      Syeda Seirut Javed   December 22, 2024 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.55%          We recently compiled a list of the 7 Stocks that Jim Cramer Recently Discussed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that Jim Cramer has recently discussed. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently addressed how investors can sometimes lose sight of the broader market perspective. He reminded his audience that the key to successful investing is simple: buy good stocks at reasonable prices and sell poor-performing stocks, even at a loss. \u201cSometimes we forget what we are trying to do around here. We\u2019re looking to find good stocks at good prices and buy them. We want to sell bad stocks at any price and kick them out of our portfolio.\u201d  Cramer also touched on the current market environment, noting that we're nearing the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. While some may argue it\u2019s not yet a cutting cycle, Cramer believes it is, regardless of whether it proceeds gradually. He pointed out that there\u2019s another important factor to consider, an environment that is heavily oversold. \u201cWe know that there are inflationary tariffs in the wind, but we don't know their size, their breadth or their impact, but that's why we're already oversold. People saw this coming, they were worried and they took action ahead. They dumped stocks so they wouldn't be long or own as much when the meeting (Fed meeting) occurred.\u201d  READ ALSO: 6 Stocks Jim Cramer Talked About This Week and Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch. As Cramer looked at the market, he expressed his focus on identifying high-quality stocks that have seen significant declines. He noted that, in a market that has already experienced substantial gains, the only place to find true value is among the laggards. Specifically, he pointed to the healthcare sector, where 62 healthcare stocks in the S&P 500 are currently down by an average of 19.7% from their peaks. Cramer acknowledged that some of this decline is tied to real risks within the sector, such as President-elect Trump's focus on addressing middlemen in the drug industry, including pharmacy benefit managers and drug distributors. However, he believes much of the risk has already been priced into these stocks, making them potentially attractive investments at this point. Cramer also drew attention to the medical device and technology sector, where stocks are on average down 17.6% from their highs. \u201cNow the goal is to build a position that starts somewhere well below where it was, simply because it has gone out of style in the current version of the Wall Street fashion show and is being hit with heavy end-of-the-year tax selling\u2026 You know why you do this? Because of the overarching principle behind good investing, buying low so that one day you can sell high, or maybe not sell at all.\u201d    Story Continues   Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks  Our MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 17. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193Cramer discussed that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has recently been unjustifiably torn apart. He explained:\u201cNow, we got some leadership stocks that are being torn apart. The heaviest of which of course is Nvidia. Up 163% for the year, but down 22 points from its recent highest\u2026 What exactly is the matter with Nvidia, down eight out of the last nine days? I think nothing. It remains the leader in the most important space of the entire market. It's riding a wave accurately depicted by a seasoned warrior, Matt Murphy, the CEO of Marvell Technology who said something amazing on this show about the size of the AI opportunity just last night, listen, \u2018We are in an unprecedented AI supercycle for AI as a service, but also for the silicon TAM underneath it. This is unbelievable. I've been doing this for 30 years. I've been through every major one of these cycles, PCs, smartphones, digital cameras, cloud computing, you name it. This one's bigger than all of them.\u2019 Cramer, highlighting the success of companies with custom silicon businesses, added:\u201c\u2026 Investors begin to wonder if these custom silicon companies are going to be such big winners, who are the relative losers? Now, one incredibly knee jerk and wrong answer, as I mentioned at the top of the show, is that Nvidia might be getting displaced. I think that's one reason why the stock's down nearly 15% from its November highs, including a big pullback today. Although it's also because Amazon's making chips that matter too, and Microsoft's making its noises that it won't be so hard to get chips, that there are no shortages. I don't know, every long knife is coming against the stock that, you know, I like the most, which is Nvidia. I think these concerns are totally misplaced. First, as Marvell CEO, Matt Murphy, told us last night, this market's gonna be big enough for a number of winners. Second, while the hyperscalers clearly like the custom chips they're getting from Marvell and Broadcom, these solutions still aren't as powerful as NVIDIA's industry-leading graphics processors units or GPUs, which they can't live without. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides solutions for graphics, compute, and networking. Its GPUs, combined with the power of its proprietary CUDA software platform, have become essential to the infrastructure supporting AI applications. This combination has fueled significant growth for the company as major technology companies race to build increasingly sophisticated AI models.The company's revenue surged by 135% during the first nine months of its fiscal year 2025, reaching $91.2 billion. The growth trajectory of the company has been driven by the continued demand for its cutting-edge technologies, particularly its Hopper architecture, which is gaining traction in the AI space. Additionally, the launch of its Blackwell products is expected to further boost revenue.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) anticipates total revenue of approximately $37.5 billion. This projection reflects both the sustained demand for the Hopper architecture and the ramp-up of Blackwell products. Despite strong demand outpacing supply, its management has expressed confidence in surpassing its previous Blackwell revenue estimate, with visibility into supply chains improving steadily.As the Blackwell architecture continues to ramp up, the company expects its gross margins to moderate to the low 70s. However, when Blackwell is fully scaled, NVIDIA anticipates margins will stabilize in the mid-70s.Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer has recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

While adaptation in the supply chain continues to be an issue, this much-awaited product line is sure to become the flagship of Nvidia's market strategy in the coming years. This is the first Nvidia architecture designed specifically for AI and is expected to form the foundation of Nvidia's business over the next 5 to 6 years.  Nvidia Corporation is the biggest and most influential firm when it comes to graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. The company has been known for technically innovative products, especially the recent GB200 NVL72, which is the most powerful GPU system in the world. This system is based on high-end Blackwell architectural technology, which can deliver up to 30 times better performance than previous-generation systems as it comprises a combination of both GPUs and CPUs.   NVIDIA software   The expected target users of the GB200 are cloud service providers, Tier-2 data centers, and academic research institutions. It can easily become a flagship market device in 2025 with the potential for 80% of all global deployments as Nvidia increases mass production. For now, the biggest buyers include companies like Microsoft, META, and other Big Tech companies. However, as AI becomes mainstream, there is a potential for Nvidia to penetrate markets that are even bigger, especially in military applications and government matters.  There are still some shipments of the Blackwell GPUs scheduled for late 2024. The first shipments will encounter some delays due to supply chain disruptions in AI server systems. Despite the problems, NVIDIA should manage to exceed the market expectations, thanks to the increase in production from the beginning of 2025. The market is reacting negatively to the lack of execution on Nvidia's part, but problems are expected. Nvidia has built an architecture for AI that the rest of the supply chain isn't yet ready for, hence the issues. For Nvidia investors, this shouldn't be cause for concern as it is expected to settle by the time the ramp-up starts. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 18% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What Is NVIDIA Worth? The stock is currently trading at US$137 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 35% compared to our intrinsic value of $101.43. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Can we expect growth from NVIDIA?   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth December 30th 2024   Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.  Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.   Story Continues So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing NVIDIA at this point in time.

Talha Qureshi   December 14, 2024 6 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.58%          We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other computer hardware stocks. What\u2019s Driving the Computer Hardware Industry? According to a report by Research and Markets, the international IT hardware market was valued at $130.86 billion in the current year. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.86% to reach $191.03 billion by 2029. One of the key factors driving the computer hardware industry has been the rise of artificial intelligence in personal computers and notebooks. According to a March 18 report by Canalys, around 48 million AI PCs are expected to be shipped during 2024, representing 18% of the total PC shipments. The report highlights that this is just the beginning of a major market transition, as AI PC shipments are expected to exceed 100 million next year, accounting for more than 40% of all PC shipments.  In a recent statement, Ishan Dutt, Principal Analyst at Canalys emphasized the transformative potential of AI-capable personal computers. He forecasts that the proliferation of AI-accelerating silicon will lead to the shipment of over 150 million AI-capable PCs by the end of 2025. These devices are expected to enhance user experiences significantly through dedicated on-device AI capabilities, which will drive productivity gains and enable personalized device interactions at scale. Additionally, Dutt highlighted that these PCs will offer improved power efficiency, stronger security, and reduced costs associated with executing AI workloads locally rather than relying on cloud services. Moreover, Kieren Jessop, another analyst at Canalys, added that this shift towards AI-capable PCs is likely to result in a 10% to 15% price premium compared to standard PCs without integrated Neural Processing Units (NPUs). By 2025, it is anticipated that over half of PCs priced at $800 or more will feature AI capabilities, projected to exceed 80% by 2028. This trend is expected to significantly increase the overall market value of PC shipments, rising from $225 billion in 2024 to over $270 billion by 2028.

These latest AI PCs have actively helped recover global PC shipments, thereby uplifting the overall computer hardware industry. According to a report by IDC published on October 8, global PC shipments dropped 2.4% during Q3 2024, however, this indicated a recovery as the shipments had dropped by around 14% and 16.5% in Q3 of 2023 and 2022, respectively. According to Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, there is a clear resurgence in demand for PCs among both consumers and commercial buyers. However, this demand is still predominantly focused on entry-level models, spurred by the recovering economy and seasonal back-to-school purchases in North America. The anticipated arrival of AI-enabled PCs, such as Copilot+ models and upcoming offerings from other major hardware companies, is expected to invigorate the premium segment in the near future.

Is NVDA the Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now?  HardwareNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the best computer hardware stock to invest in right now. Previously, the company was known for revolutionizing the gaming market with its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Currently, it is a leader in AI infrastructure with its GPUs powering data centers, autonomous driving, and robots.The company still generates handsome revenue from its Gaming segment. It generated $3.8 billion from the segment during the fiscal third quarter of 2025, up 15% year-over-year. However, its GPU application within the data center industry is the real game changer. Data Center revenues were up 112%, standing at $35.1 billion. The segment revenue even topped management\u2019s expectation of $32.5 billion.That\u2019s not it, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been continuously upgrading its GPU portfolio to cater to the growing need for its products in the AI and data center industry. On March 18, the company unveiled the Blackwell platform marking a significant advancement in AI computing technology. The Blackwell architecture includes the GB200 GPU, which is recognized as one of the most powerful chips available right now. The demand for its Blackwell and Hopper platform led the Data Center revenue growth with its H200 GPU sales increasing to double-digit billions of dollars. Management categorized it as the fastest product ramp-up in its history.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best computer hardware stock to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).  No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.7% in value last week. However, the 184% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Ownership Breakdown December 11th 2024   What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth December 11th 2024   Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.  On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.   Story Continues Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$134b worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned.  However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement.  Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that \"rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing\" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. \"How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don\u2019t even know what quantum is?\" wondered Cramer.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?\u201d he added.   Story Continues As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both \"make money\" on the stock market, it's the pigs that \"get slaughtered.\" He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's \"seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains.\"\u00a0 Yet, it's \"precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don\u2019t want to act like a pig,\" believes the television show host.Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing,\" but adds that \"taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains\" lies at the heart of the market's performance \"for a century.\u201dFinally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. \"Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once,\" he stresses and adds that \"you should never sell all at once,\" either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging \"your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.\u201dOur MethodologyTo compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): Investors Should Be \u2018Very Vigilant\u2019 Amid Rising Competition  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Date of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 08-12-24Performance Since Then: 25.75%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer whose shares have gained more than 700% since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August:\"Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?\" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Broadcom is up 18% since then while Nvidia is down 12%. The market thinks custom chips are the future. Companies like Alphabet and META are building their own chips for AI, something Broadcom specializes in. Some analysts believe this is the future of chip manufacturing and poses a real threat to Nvidia, which mostly makes its own versions of GPUs, thus concentrating its focus on improving its own tech.   The Next Nvidia: Will Sky-High Expectations Impact Broadcom (AVGO) Stock in the Future?   These analysts are worried that Broadcom\u2019s performance in the recent quarter means trouble for Nvidia. We believe that is not the case. Broadcom works in the custom chips segment, making chips for companies on demand. When companies order GPUs from Broadcom, these companies have to arrange the networking equipment, software, and labor themselves. These GPUs are so complicated and advanced that only a handful of big companies can afford to deploy these GPUs.  Compare that to Nvidia which not only provides the networking equipment through Mellanox but also offers its own software and programming language called CUDA. Moreover, most of the AI industry experts today are trained in CUDA. This means Nvidia is the go-to choice for most companies, except a select few with deep pockets. This also means Broadcom\u2019s business is not as scalable as Nvidia\u2019s. Broadcom will continue to serve Big Tech, but smaller businesses cannot afford custom chips. As a result, Broadcom is unable to penetrate the same market that Nvidia does. We\u2019re bullish on Nvidia because of this unique economic moat that the chipmaker enjoys. There is one argument in Broadcom\u2019s favor that investors need to keep an eye on though. If only Big Tech can afford custom chips, is responsible for a big chunk of all AI spending, and the spending is predicted to cross $1 trillion in the coming years,\u00a0 it means Broadcom does indeed stand to gain at Nvidia\u2019s expense. However, we already covered two unique growth drivers for Nvidia (NVDA) previously. There is no denying the fact that Broadcom enjoys a good position in the industry at this point, but it doesn\u2019t in any way dent Nvidia\u2019s long-term bull thesis.  Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he\u2019s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. \u201cIn the last six to eight weeks, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what\u2019s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you\u2019re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.\u201d  To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. \u201cSo think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that\u2019s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.\u201d  READ ALSO\u00a07 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): Investors Should Be \u2018Very Vigilant\u2019 Amid Rising Competition   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. \u201cI think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off\u2014or rather, all gloves are off\u2014in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you\u2019re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at\u00a0The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn\u2019t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?\u201d    Story Continues Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in December. Jared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via \u201cdiplomacy.\u201d \u201cIf you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn\u2019t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can\u2019t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There\u2019s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.\u201d  Answering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That\u2019s not enough, that\u2019s not enough time. So, you know, the US is going to continue to lead in the space, but it\u2019s not going to be able to lead on its own.\u201d  READ ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are getting investors\u2019 attention on the back of latest news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Dean of Valuation Aswath Damodaran on Nvidia (NVDA): \u2018It\u2019s Going to be Painful\u2019   Pixabay/Public Domain Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, recently talked about Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a program on CNBC and said:   Story Continues \u201cInvestors are also increasingly focused on the guidance that Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is offering, and the negative reaction, I think, is coming from the sobering of that guidance. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), I believe, is trying to bring investors down for a soft landing, lowering expectations. However, it\u2019s going to be painful. Every earnings report, you\u2019re likely to see more of this phenomenon play out\u2014where they beat the numbers but the stock price still goes down.\u201d Damodaran explained exactly why he believes Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is overvalued.\u201cI think at this price, if you\u2019re buying, you\u2019re expecting the product and service market to be much bigger than people anticipate. You need to be clear that this is what you\u2019re basing your purchase on. Even if you assume Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market\u2014which I believe they currently have\u2014and their ability to maintain these sky-high margins, you still can\u2019t justify a $144 valuation without something additional happening. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re betting on Nvidia finding and dominating another market, and that\u2019s a tough call.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in December. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. As 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven\u2019t been so lucky.  As an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks\u00a03rd\u00a0on our list of\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks\u00a0while the second ranks\u00a012th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world\u2019s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period. So why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company.  However, while the GPU maker hasn\u2019t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm\u2019s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn\u2019t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion. But an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock\u2019s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren\u2019t impressed and they weren\u2019t optimistic about the firm\u2019s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO\u2019s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention.   Story Continues The start of December has also seen another interesting, albeit long-term, development for the semiconductor industry. The semiconductors, or chips, that currently power our computers and phones rely on classical computing which uses bits for computing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, expands the processing power significantly over classical computing by relying on qubits instead. In December, Google revealed its Willow quantum computing chip which it claims is capable of processing a problem that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. More importantly, Google claimed to have manufactured the chip itself \u2013\u00a0 a development that broadens the number of companies capable of manufacturing advanced processors.The announcement injected fresh life into quantum computing stocks which have gained as much as 281% since Willow was revealed. This is despite the fact that no semiconductor foundry is capable of manufacturing quantum computing chips at scale. And why would they? After all, the use cases for quantum computers are limited as well, as opposed to the billions of chips used in personal computing applications.For his part, Cramer isn\u2019t a fan of quantum computing either. Commenting on the negative share price movements following the Federal Reserve\u2019s well-televised conference earlier this month, he likened the sentiment in quantum computing to a hype bubble. The market won\u2019t recover quickly according to Cramer as \u201crampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing\u201d pushed stocks higher than their fundamentals would justify. Further commenting on the industry, he stated:\u201cHow are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don\u2019t even know what quantum is? It\u2019s a nonfungible token, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?\u201d Our MethodologyTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about semiconductor stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Jim Cramer's Take on NVIDIA (NVDA): The King of AI GPUs Under Pressure  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Date of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 8-20-24Performance Since Then: 7.73%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world\u2019s leading AI GPU designer. Since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT, the firm\u2019s shares have gained more than 700%. Yet, since their July peak, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares have added just 1.62% as investors wait to see how its Blackwell GPUs perform and whether any rivals pop up. The stock has also been hit with speculation of rivals stealing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s AI GPU market share due to supply constraints and high prices. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock dipped by 3% in December after Broadcom shared that it can earn as much as $90 billion in AI revenue by 2027. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about the firm in August:\u201cI almost feel like you can guess it\u2014it\u2019s Nvidia. It\u2019s the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia\u2019s drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, \u201cLook, Nvidia is almost too important. There\u2019s too much pressure on Nvidia\u2014can it sustain it? I don\u2019t want Nvidia to be Samson. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. A December 30 report by CNBC discussed the rapid adoption of generative AI by businesses, its potential to significantly impact global GDP, and the varying perspectives of leaders on its future. As per the report, generative AI has evolved from a novelty to a key tool for businesses, with nearly two-thirds of organizations using it for tasks like customer service automation and data analysis. While its growth could potentially boost global GDP by $7 trillion in the next decade, opinions among business leaders vary. Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates view AI as transformative, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs.  However, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella caution that further advancements will be slower, requiring deep innovation. Meanwhile, concerns about AI's ethical risks, highlighted by Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, suggest the technology could have unintended consequences, despite its growing importance in industries like defense. READ ALSO: 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn't Miss. Open-Source AI from China Takes on Major U.S. Models with Fractional Costs CNBC\u2019s TechCheck anchor, Deirdre Bosa reported on December 30 that DeepSeek, an open-source AI model developed by a Chinese research lab, has emerged as a serious competitor to leading models like GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.1. Despite using lower-cost H800 chips, which are less powerful versions of the H100, DeepSeek outperformed these models in key benchmarks and was built for just $5.5 million, a fraction of the cost of other frontier models that require hundreds of millions or even billions to develop.  This signals a shift toward more commoditized AI models, where progress relies less on building new infrastructure and more on optimizing existing models. The development raises concerns for investors in major U.S. tech companies, as it challenges the long-standing dominance of firms like OpenAI. Additionally, the success of DeepSeek highlights the potential advantage of open-source models, suggesting that nations like China, without access to the latest chips or massive investments, could still compete effectively in the AI race, Bosa mentioned. The implications of this development, particularly for the U.S.-led AI dominance and global geopolitical dynamics are expected to unfold further in 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) focuses on AI-powered solutions, providing platforms for data centers, autonomous driving, robotics, and cloud computing.Nvidia has finalized its $700 million acquisition of Israeli AI firm Run:ai after receiving unconditional approval from the European Commission earlier this month, Reuters reported. The deal, announced in April, underwent antitrust scrutiny over concerns about competition in the AI and GPU markets. While Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI GPU market, regulators found no significant competitive risks. Run:ai, which plans to make its software open-source to expand across the AI ecosystem, remains under review by the U.S. Department of Justice for antitrust considerations.Overall, NVDA ranks first on our list of AI news that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

MU has cautioned about low demand for its memory chips, lowering the guidance for the upcoming quarter. If Micron sees a low demand for memory chips, where does that put AI chipmakers?   Custom AI Chips Marvell   To understand the relationship between Micron's memory chips and AI GPU makers, let\u2019s first see where they fit in a data center. Micron makes DRAM and NAND storage devices, both of which are crucial in data storage in a data center. With the emergence of AI, the demand for these has gone up, in addition to the demand for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). But this demand isn\u2019t broad-based. It is mainly concentrated in AI applications. The demand in other segments like PC, smartphones, and other consumer devices has been down and is what\u2019s weighing down the stock. This demand is responsible for over 50% of their revenue, so the stock plunge makes sense.  Let\u2019s now see how Micron\u2019s troubles impact Nvidia. Nvidia isn\u2019t a memory manufacturer itself and designs the GPUs that go into data centers. If there is pressure on memory chip demand, it only means Nvidia can get these chips cheaper, thus helping them improve their margins. It also helps Nvidia make their products more affordable, ensuring even small businesses can adopt their tech. This wider adoption eventually strengthens Nvidia\u2019s moat. Broadcom on the other hand is more diverse and therefore doesn\u2019t rely on memory chips as much as Nvidia. However, it still benefits in networking equipment and storage controller segments, where memory chips are an important component. Despite the pessimism surrounding the Micron stock, traders would love to play the volatility until the demand settles in mid-2025. The company is the recipient of CHIPS ACT funding and its Idaho fab could come online within a year and a half. This is the first new memory manufacturing fab built in the US in 20 years. So Micron is bringing manufacturing back to the US and helping the country reduce reliance on foreign players for something as critical as semiconductors.  Micron is 20th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 107 hedge fund portfolios held MU at the end of the third quarter which was 120 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. As 2024 heads to a close, investors are now focused on the state of the economy, its influence on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle, and the potential offered by the technology industry. They beckon 2025 with a rather historic run on the stock market that has seen several high-growth technology stocks flourish despite the fact that until September, interest rates in the US were at a two-decade high level.  Driving the bullishness behind technology stocks is artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that relies on high-end GPUs to run advanced mathematical techniques and infer new conclusions from existing data sets has been the focus of Wall Street and big technology companies. So far, most of the AI-related stock gains have been limited to the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite graphics processing unit (GPU) company whose stock is up by more than\u00a0700%\u00a0since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT. However, the gains have to broaden out to other stocks for the AI wave to continue. This broadening is dependent on the use of AI increasing among businesses and consumers. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo has some insights to share. In its report titled \u2018Generative AI \u2014 Potential pitfalls, challenges, and risks the bank outlines that while AI \u201chas the potential to be broadly transformative,\u201d there are several \u201coutstanding questions and concerns that need to be addressed before it is widely accepted on a larger scale.\u201d Quoting its \u2018The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,\u2019 the bank points out that from 2012 to 2023, the number of AI incidents has jumped more than tenfold from sitting at roughly 10 to ~122. These incidents cover the ethical misuse of AI such as the wrong detection of criminals stemming from facial recognition systems.  WF\u00a0points\u00a0out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI\u2019s wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more \u201cnuanced\u201d impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation \u2014 as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.\u201d   Story Continues To help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT\u2019s estimates show that \u201c60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago.\u201d As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.Two additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P\u2019s utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index\u2019s 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that \u201cthere will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,\u201d adding that \u201cit may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines.\u201d WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they \u201cdiminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.\u201dGiven the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another\u00a0report. Titled \u2018Generative AI transforming data center landscape\u201d it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.However, other sectors, such as \u201ccabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators\u201d are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that \u201cthe server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.\u201dWhile semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest \u201cthat approximately 35% \u2013 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors).\u201d Additionally, \u201c40% \u2013 45% and 15% \u2013 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,\u201d according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of \u201cincreased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.\u201dFor some materials stocks and a primer on how they are reliant on the broader economic activity, you can check out\u00a010 Best Materials Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Our MethodologyTo make our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank\u2019s recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).  Why is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Top Wells Fargo\u2019s Tech Stock to Beat the S&P?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193NTM EPS Estimate: $3.42NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street\u2019s favored AI GPU stock whose shares are up by more than 700% since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT. Consequently, its hypothesis is exclusively dependent on its GPUs. When it comes to these products, not only does NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have to ensure that they offer the best market performance, but it also has to manage its supply and keep costs manageable to manage margins. Therefore, not only does big tech\u2019s GPU spending have to remain robust for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to maintain its share price tailwinds, but in-house AI processors developed by the likes of Amazon and others have to prove to be inferior to the benefits offered by the firm\u2019s chips. The firm also benefits from its CUDA software which allows users to tightly control the performance of NVIDIA GPUs to suit their individual needs. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also trying to capture tertiary AI markets such as those for interconnects, which underscores the criticality of AI and data center spending for its hypothesis.Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 13th on our list of Wells Fargo\u2019s tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. NVDA is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

On December 12, President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, an event rich with symbolism for his pro-business economic agenda and his commitment to revitalize the US economy. During the event, Trump reiterated his promises to lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for companies that manufacture in the US. He also mentioned plans to reduce taxes on capital gains and dividends, a move designed to attract investor support and drive market growth. Addressing the crowd at the NYSE, Trump emphasized the importance of his economic policies in creating jobs and strengthening the economy. He said that the stock market\u2019s performance is the barometer of his economic success and promised that the country\u2019s economy would be very strong under his administration. Investors have responded positively to Trump\u2019s election, with the S&P 500 experiencing gains since his victory. His plans for tax cuts and deregulation have been welcomed by Wall Street and business leaders.  In an interview with Bloomberg on December 13, Mike Wilson, Chief US Equity Strategist at Morgan Stanley, discussed his outlook for the stock market and the economy. Wilson noted that the market has traded well over the past few months due to favorable developments, including a definitive election outcome, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy adjustments, and steady economic growth without a hard landing. He mentioned that Morgan Stanley\u2019s target for the S&P 500 to reach 6,100 by the end of 2024 has been met and revealed the updated projection for the S&P 500, forecasting it to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025. This outlook is based on the base assumption of stable economic growth, softening inflation, and the Fed gradually cutting interest rates. However, Wilson cautioned that there is a potential for inflation to reaccelerate, which could limit the Fed\u2019s ability to cut rates. He acknowledged that financial conditions have loosened significantly, driven by improved market sentiment following the election. Wilson described 2025 as likely to be another volatile year for markets, similar to 2024. He anticipates heightened uncertainty in the first half of the year, with clarity potentially emerging in the second half.  Wilson\u2019s overall view is that the economy is still late-cycle and his team is narrow and focusing on large-cap quality stocks rather than small-caps or low-quality stocks. This approach is based on the belief that in a late-cycle economy with high rates, smaller and lower-quality companies are more vulnerable and less likely to outperform.   Story Continues Favorable developments have brought a sense of optimism to the financial markets. While there are still some risks, like potential inflation, investors are optimistic about the future, especially about large-cap companies.

When the tech sector faced a major downturn in 2022, Tiger Global\u2019s portfolio, which was heavily invested in technology, took a significant hit.

The Federal Reserve created quite a bit of turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday when despite cutting interest rates, it signaled to investors that the journey to low rates was far from over and would take longer than initially expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that \"We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation,\" and used the data observation to project two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the earlier four.  In Squawk on the Street's episode the day after the Fed's rate cut, Cramer called the latest Fed outcome\"a new phase in the process.\" He outlined that the Fed might have missed the mark in being data-dependent. According to him \"Look I think that they are data dependent. But they made a prediction and the prediction was not right. They should have just stayed data-dependent. They could've looked at the long bond and realized, you know wait a second, we're on the wrong track here. And signal that. And they didn't signal it.\" Cramer was pressed about what Chair Powell got wrong, and in response, he shared that it was \"The messaging. Right, because what happened is this that . . .we have a data-dependent Fed, and they chose not to be data-dependant.\" Cramer added that the apparent miss from being data-dependant meant that the Fed's \"message was off. They're not wrong, but all the people who thought that they were gonna be kind and dovish, I mean they were, uh, black dovish.\"  The morning show host also shared his thoughts about the current tussle in Congress related to spending bills and electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk's role in it. \"Look they got a real guy, Musk. Do you want to mess with Musk? I'm not messing with Musk. I tried it once. I was pantsed. You don't want to be pantsed by this man,\" said Cramer. He added \"But I do want to make a point that there are a lot of people who are hopeful that he can do something about that. The $36 trillion that we have.\" According to Cramer, to achieve the cut maybe Musk and his team \"shame people, maybe he shames people who are giveaway guys,\" as he believes that \"he [MUSK] represents this chain of thought in this country that there's hope. That this government can get its act together.\"   Story Continues Cramer's remarks in the morning show weren't the only ones covering the rate cut. Immediately after the cut, in Mad Money, he commented on Chair Powell \"Because he seemed to get caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn't back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today's meltdown.\"Building on the comments, the next day he outlined \"There were some very cogent questions at the press conference about whether, when you study it, after his statement, did they really need a cut? By their own admission? And, I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates. David, this is that same problem that I keep saying which is that, if they had not set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut, and then they kind of like regretted it. And they regretted it because business is so strong, like GDP, inflation is a little bit higher.\" Cramer concluded by stating that he believes the Fed \"got trapped, Jay got trapped.\"As for China, the CNBC host didn't mince any words either. According to him, China has\u00a0 \"done nothing but build up\" its military. Cramer does not trust the Chinese either. Quoting from the former Trump Administration's Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis' book, Cramer shared that where \"the Chinese meet with Obama and they agree to everything and it's really terrific and then they, a day later, they violate everything with the South China Sea.\" Situations like these make him \"think that we've been taken advantage of.\"Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired the day after the Fed's rate cut.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading GPU designer whose shares have been the biggest beneficiary of the AI wave. The firm's GPUs are one-of-a-kind in terms of performance. Their edge has led to surging demand, which has led to rising prices and supply constraints. These problems have generated speculation that perhaps NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s market dominance is under threat from Broadcom and Marvel. However, Cramer doesn't hold this view and wants investors to be prudent when making stock purchases. Here's what he said:\"How about the fact that NVIDIA was up three and a half at 4am and there it is. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

This is one reason why Big Tech has invested heavily in AI infrastructure, even though they aren\u2019t making a meaningful financial return on it yet.  Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The company has seen the demand for its GPUs skyrocket as companies race to acquire the best GPUs to improve their AI workflows. Microsoft is one such company. The biggest investor in OpenAI has spent enormous amounts of money buying Nvidia equipment, so much so that it was responsible for 20% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in the last year. META, the second largest buyer of Nvidia GPUs accounted for less than half of the quantity that Microsoft ordered in the last year.   Why NVDA Stock Lost 10% in One Week   This reliance on Microsoft puts Nvidia at a massive risk. What does it do if MSFT switches to making in-house chips like META and Apple? And what if Microsoft prefers someone else\u2019s GPUs? Microsoft\u2019s response to its reliance on Nvidia is simple to understand. The company may well be working on an in-house chip behind the scenes. But it isn\u2019t doing it with the same urgency as META and Apple. The reason is straightforward. Microsoft builds AI products that its end-users will utilize by accessing its API. It does not matter to the end-user which GPUs Microsoft is using, as long as the performance is the best in the industry.  So if Nvidia stopped being the best GPU company all of a sudden (an unlikely scenario), Microsoft would simply switch to whoever makes the best GPUs. According to Omdia\u2019s estimates, Microsoft bought 96,000 AMD GPUs this year while it purchased a massive 485,000 NVDA GPUs. For Microsoft, the aim is to build the best possible infrastructure and for that, the company will continue to buy from whatever company fulfills its desired specifications. This simplifies Nvidia and Microsoft\u2019s relationship. As long as Nvidia continues to make the best GPUs, Microsoft will continue buying. Nvidia has one aim: to build the best GPUs. It has been doing it till now and as long as its management isn\u2019t distracted by something more flashy than AI, one can reasonably expect the company to continue its lead in AI products and keep its unique economic moat intact. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Nvidia was among the many stocks that took a hit yesterday. This has prompted many to wonder if the resulting dip can be considered a buying opportunity or a falling knife. Paul Meeks, the Co-Chief Investment Officer at Harvest Portfolio Management, believes one can\u2019t be sure, but it could be worth it to pause and reconsider the AI outlook before making a decision.    Meeks cited Micron\u2019s NAND memory segment\u2019s poor performance as the reason for his pessimism. Micron announced its quarterly report yesterday and traders got out after listening to the guidance. The company expects sluggish demand for its chips which go into smartphones, personal computers, and many industrial applications. This proves that demand for semiconductors outside of AI spending, which itself is dominated by the Big Tech, is quite low.  This prompts one to ask a very important question. What happens if AI spending slows down too? Paul Meeks believes at some point in the next year, the market could digest this possibility resulting in a big correction. That\u2019s his reason for being cautious. In other words, Paul isn\u2019t yet sure if this is just a dip. He recommends keeping some cash in the bag in case the correction continues. It might also be worth waiting for the revised spending plans of the Hyperscalers, who are responsible for a good chunk of the AI spending that Nvidia benefits from. For that, investors will have to wait till the end of January when these companies announce their earnings. We believe Paul raises important points about Nvidia's short-term movements and going by the current pessimism surrounding the market, it could be worth staying out for a month or so till the AI spending trend becomes clearer. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

According to a report published by The Information, ByteDance is planning to spend as much as $7 billion on buying Nvidia chips in 2025. The US government is yet to react to this revelation, but there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t be happy with the Chinese firm\u2019s plans.   7 Most Profitable Chinese Stocks To Invest In   Since 2022, the United States has placed export restrictions on many advanced semiconductor chips, including Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell predecessor, the Hopper GPUs. Nvidia has circumvented this ban by creating a variant of the H100 GPU called the H800 GPU. This was essentially a dumbed-down version of the most powerful GPU available at the time. Nvidia achieved this by restricting the bandwidth, resulting in reduced communication speed between the GPUs. This helped them comply with export regulations at the time.  Chinese companies were happy to receive the H800s. However, they also figured out a new way to get access to Nvidia\u2019s latest chips. If they built a data center in any of their neighboring countries and imported the Nvidia chips there, they could circumvent the export ban. That\u2019s what ByteDance plans to do as well. For context, ByteDance is the owner of Doubao, the most-used AI chatbot in China with 51 million users. The company plans to continue its domination and for that, it is willing to go to great lengths to get its hands on Nvidia\u2019s latest GPUs. So what does this mean for Nvidia? We already know that Nvidia\u2019s China revenue has gone down from 25% of the total revenue to 15% over the last few years. But is it just a case of the missing revenue being diverted to other places and the products still ending up in China? After this development, that seems to be the likely case. This would mean that no matter how China and the US settle their trade disputes, China will, one way or the other, get its hands on Nvidia GPUs. As both countries try to hurt each other financially, Nvidia can come out unscated, or even the winner!  Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.  Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  The Model We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast  2025202620272028202920302031203220332034  Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$64.5bUS$94.1bUS$124.3bUS$138.5bUS$147.1bUS$154.0bUS$160.3bUS$166.1bUS$171.6bUS$177.0b Growth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x19Analyst x20Analyst x15Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.68%Est @ 4.06%Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.33%Est @ 3.12%  Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$59.8kUS$80.8kUS$98.8kUS$102.0kUS$100.4kUS$97.4kUS$93.9kUS$90.2kUS$86.3kUS$82.5k  (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$892b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.   Story Continues Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$177b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$3.4tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.4t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$1.6tThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$134, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.  NasdaqGS:NVDA Discounted Cash Flow December 15th 2024  Important AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.290. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NVIDIAStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market. OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio. ThreatNo apparent threats visible for NVDA. Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For NVIDIA, we've put together three pertinent elements you should assess:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NVIDIA   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Like all of us, Jim Cramer is always wondering what's next for the stock market. So far, the year has seen AI continue to dominate the market, accompanied by the Federal Reserve and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Now, with the election over and investors pondering over the incoming administration's tariff policies, like us, Cramer is also focused on the Federal Reserve.  The reason why the Fed and tariffs are related is because the latter can cause inflation to force the former to keep interest rates higher for longer. While it tries to decipher what's ahead for AI, Wall Street is also wondering about the pace, magnitude, and frequency of the Federal Reserve's 2025 interest rate cut cycle. This nervousness is reflected in bond yields touching 4.38% on Friday, and asset manager Apollo Global warning that four key inflation indicators appear to be reaccelerating. As per Apollo, the Core CPI, the Core PCE, the Supercore CPI, and the Supercore CPE have all started to rise again. In Mad Money aired last week, Cramer also had the Fed in mind. Cramer, in his show, commented on the nervousness in the market. The television show host wondered why the stock market wasn't responding to semiconductor stocks doing well. He started out by sharing that \"I hate the endless focus on the Fed. By everybody. Because it detracts you from benefiting from long-term performance for your stock portfolio.\" This is because Cramer believes that \"every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions, causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out.\"  He did add that the economic data shows that there will be dissent at the Federal Reserve when it comes to further reducing interest rates at the upcoming December meeting. Cramer shared that \"while I don't think the data is cool enough to be positive about the prospects of more cuts for now, I also don't want you to make decisions purely on what the Fed does. Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy. And I wish everyone knew that. They don't.\" On the topic of tariffs, Cramer had plenty to share in November. He started out by analyzing the performance of the benchmark S&P index between mid-2017 and the start of 2020. Cramer pointed out that \"this is where we start to get the real tariff action from the first Trump administration.\" He shared that \"Trump imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines among other goods.\" While \"all these helped the industries in question . . .the broader market didn't like that we were triggering a global trade war.\"   Story Continues Cramer pointed out the index's performance between January 22nd and December 24th, 2018 to bolster the view that tariffs weren't great for the stock market. However, before you write them off, consider his remarks. According to Cramer, during this time period, \"the S&P 500 lost 18% of its value. Of course, some of that is because the Fed got much more aggressive about raising interest rates through this period. Taking them up. a 100 basis points that year. But it definitely wasn't just the Fed. You can see from the chart that virtually every time we got more tariffs, the S&P would roll over, every time China retaliated, we'd sell off.\"Yet, according to Cramer, \"once the Fed decided to stop tightening at the very end of 2018, the S&P was finally able to find a floor.\" Following this, the market \"rebounded like crazy\" as part of a \"bullish trading cycle, one that continued until Covid hit in 2020. Long story short, the market couldn't handle the trade war when the Fed was tightening. But as soon as the Fed started easing, all those losses evaporated.\"Using charts from Jessica Inskip, Cramer compared the last intersection of the Fed and Trump tariffs with today's environment. He outlined that the \"Fed is now our friend.\" Why is that so? Well, according to Cramer, as soon as the Fed stopped tightening, the market \"stopped reacting as aggressively to the trade war.\" He shared that Inskip believes that \"something like a trade war can certainly hurt us badly when the market's already trending bearishly. But if we've got a bullish trading cycle like we do right now, then she's not worried as long as we can maintain this cycle.\"So, as Cramer remains cautiously optimistic about the stock market's future, we decided to see how his views about stocks have stood the test of time.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the 15 stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about, we compiled his statements about top tech stocks and ranked them by the date the statements were made.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Date of Cramer's Comments: 10-14-24NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer. It is also the primary beneficiary of the current AI wave because of its product strengths. Cramer simply gave up when discussing getting the timing right for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock. He stated:\u201cNow initially, NVIDIA got clubbed along with the whole market when the yen carry trade imploded. Then it came right back because that was only a temporary problem. Then NVIDIA got smacked down after its quarter, although it didn\u2019t take out the blows from the previous sell-off. It\u2019s been working its way back ever since. As we learned that demand for its next-generation super chip Blackwell is \u2018insane\u2019, that\u2019s a technical term coined by Jensen, by the way. Next thing you know, the stock\u2019s coming all the way back, but back with very few people who sold the stock. And before this, right, I mean they\u2019re long gone and gone at much lower levels because they traded it, they sold it. Again, take this as a reminder that if you trade NVIDIA, you probably won\u2019t be able to sell it high and then get back in low. The ship would\u2019ve left without you. It\u2019s too hard, people, it\u2019s just too hard.\u201d NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock is down 2.8% since Cramer's remarks so perhaps selling then would have been the right decision. Not only have supply issues with its Blackwell GPUs worried investors, but the shares have lost 7.50% in December after Broadcom's stunning announcement of working with three hyperscalers to develop AI GPUs. You check out our coverage of Broadcom in this list for more details, but it appears that Wall Street might be opening up to the idea of alternatives being present to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

Neha Gupta   December 3, 2024 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.59%       We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks. Ken Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors.  Fisher said, \"I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused.\" Besides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors. In the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.

Even though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better. \"Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly,\" Ken Fisher said. Ken Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the \"magnificent seven\" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions.   Story Continues \"If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward\", Fisher said in a video interview.Our MethodologyWe looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024.At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

The company has made a name for itself in the development of some of the most sought-after graphics processing units (GPU). The GPUs are in solid demand owing to their use in powering AI models.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged record revenue of $35.1 billion in its third quarter, a 94% year-over-year increase thanks to strong AI demand. It now expects its fourth-quarter revenue to increase by 70% to $37.5 billion. It also expects the new Blackwell architecture to spur revenue growth in 2025.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doing well in data center chips and gaming graphics cards, controlling 88% of the graphics card market. Strong GPU demand has led to record revenue and earnings, with the stock up 187% this year. NVDA is using its extra revenue to invest in companies like SoundHound and Applied Digital, preparing for the future of AI. It also owns significant stakes in Applied Digital, a growing designer and builder of data centers. The investments are part of NVDA's push to safeguard its future amid the AI revolution.Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks to watch right now. Tom Hancock, GMO U.S. quality ETF portfolio manager, said in a latest program on CNBC that the NASDAQ has become \u201crisky\u201d bet amid a lot of volatility. \u201cIt\u2019s become not really an index; it\u2019s become a single bet. So it it\u2019s a very risky thing to invest in. It\u2019s not what I think you would want from a sort of diversified investor. It\u2019s probably going to give you more volatile returns next year, and I\u2019d a little bit worry that the AI rally has extended itself. So uh those may be uncomfortably volatile returns.\u201d  Hancock said investors should also pay attention to some of the \u201cold economy\u201d stocks. He thinks AI stocks have become a \u201chype trade\u201d and any \u201chiccup\u201d in the economy could result in these stocks crashing. He also urged investors to look for stocks outside the US. Hancock believes AI gains are now set to broaden out to smaller companies that have not received a lot of attention so far.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst: NVIDIA (NVDA) Will Rally Again, Current Pullback Is a \u2018Chance to Get In\u2019   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Nancy Tengler from Laffer Tengler Investments said while talking to Schwab Network in a latest program that the latest pullback in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good chance to pile into the stock as she believes it will rally again: \u201cIf you look at Nvidia\u2019s backlog, uh if you just kind of pay attention to the anecdote like the one that Larry Ellison uh shared where he and Elon were at dinner with with Jen and just kept saying, please take more of our money, um I think if you pay attention to who\u2019s spending and how much they\u2019re spending that the stock will rally again.\u201d  The analyst said she is adding to her NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) position on the latest pullback: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room I think you know recalibration is never a bad thing and it gives some you know those who aren\u2019t in the stock a chance to get in and those of us who own it we just actually added to our position uh I think it was last week or the week before.\u201d    Story Continues Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of top AI stocks to watch right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

According to Google, the new chip allows it to perform an extremely complex mathematical task in just under 5 minutes, when it would have taken the most powerful supercomputer in existence today over 10 septillion years to complete. A septillion is equal to 1 followed by 24 zeros. It\u2019s at a scale a human brain can\u2019t even process. Certainly, an achievement that should change how computers today perform computation.   Why IonQ Inc (IONQ) Skyrocketed?   A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Despite the above progress, Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the hype. They\u2019re the most powerful GPUs in existence today, but surely they should pale in comparison to what Google has achieved. In reality, Nvidia continues to stay relevant because quantum computing isn\u2019t simply about replacing the chip on your laptop. Traditional laptops using CPUs and GPUs continue to be more efficient for general-purpose computing.  So how does Nvidia then benefit from the quantum computing revolution? Here are three ways Nvidia is a beneficiary, no matter who makes the best chips. Quantum computers are extremely expensive to build. It is not possible to build quantum computers just to test if they can perform certain tasks. So a lot of simulation work is needed before something concrete can be built. That\u2019s where Nvidia\u2019s GPU comes in. The more powerful the GPU, the quicker it is to carry out the simulation and reach desired results. Secondly, even when quantum computers do become the norm, they will always accompany traditional computers in a hybrid setting. This hybrid setting will once again require the best computers to support the quantum computers, requiring once again Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, except in a support role. Lastly, just like Nvidia dominates the GPU world thanks to its proprietary software, Nvidia continues to provide support for quantum computing software. The CUDA-Q platform provides developers with the resources to write code that can run on both quantum computers and classic GPUs. Through this software, Nvidia not only helps the development of quantum computing but also solidifies its economic moat by being the right software provider to bridge the gap between traditional and quantum computing. In this way, Nvidia stands to gain a lot from quantum computing even though it doesn\u2019t make quantum computing chips. That\u2019s food for thought for the bears who thought Nvidia had peaked and sold all the GPUs it could sell. There\u2019s more after AI!   Story Continues Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.07%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.05%. The maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's stock has climbed by 3.61% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.93% and outpacing the S&P 500's gain of 1.05%.  The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Nvidia in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.84 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.54%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $37.72 billion, indicating a 70.68% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $2.94 per share and revenue of $129.02 billion, indicating changes of +126.15% and +111.78%, respectively, compared to the previous year. Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.  The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.39% higher within the past month. Nvidia presently features a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Looking at its valuation, Nvidia is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 47.7. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 31.19, so one might conclude that Nvidia is trading at a premium comparatively. One should further note that NVDA currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.39. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. Semiconductor - General stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 3.12 based on yesterday's closing prices. The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 78, placing it within the top 32% of over 250 industries.   Story Continues The strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Make sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about Bitcoin and reminded investors that he has always believed in the cryptocurrency. \u201cI want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do\u2014not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let\u2019s dispel the idea that I\u2019ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.\u201d  Cramer said he likes the idea of Bitcoin being the store of value and said he always recommended investors to allocate 10% of their portfolio to the currency. However, he again urged investors to look to stocks for the rest of their portfolios. \u201cI heard Fed Chief J. Powell talk about how he believes people are buying Bitcoin as a store of value, like gold, because there\u2019s not much transaction done in Bitcoin. I\u2019ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world\u2019s lunacy. But for years now, I\u2019ve also been saying Bitcoin is a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not?  Cramer then mentioned a few stocks that have posted dramatic gains since their IPOs to show investors the power of stock investing. READ ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article, we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he recently talked about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Last month, Jim Cramer talked about the underperformance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) after its quarterly results and countered the bear arguments impacting the stock. Cramer said NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still has no competition and other companies are making their own chips because Nvidia has so much demand that it\u2019s struggling to keep up.   Story Continues \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is struggling in a typical post-earnings miasma. We know that nothing\u2019s wrong\u2014we just saw the numbers; they were terrific. Yet, there\u2019s a growing skepticism that things have peaked, that the rate of growth is slowing, that the bank for the buck is lessening, and that the competition is increasing, especially from Amazon. Of course, we hear this every time. Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cThe fund held an underweight position in\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA\u2019s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA\u2019s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA\u2019s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company\u2019s revenue, which presents added risk.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy for long term growth. Strategist Expects S&P 500 to reach 6,600 Some investors consider 2024 as a transition year, while others debate that this year was just the beginning of the level of volatility awaiting financial markets in 2025. It is not an exaggeration to say that 2024 has been rough for markets given that crucial events like the commencement of an easing cycle followed by the US elections remained a major influence on the overall environment. Amid all these awaited events, the tech sector has not been an investor favorite, however, that may change sooner than we think.  On November 26, Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, joined\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to share his opinion on the stock market, particularly the tech sector. Krishna raised his S&P 500 price target for 2025 to 6,600 and shed light on why he believes such is possible. He shared that the economy is pretty constructive from a macro perspective given that the virtuous cycle between income and employment remains solid. He added that consumer balances are going up and believes that the overall economic conditions of the country have been positive. All these reasons combined explain the price target of 6,600 for the S&P 500. Speaking of the technology sector, Krishna agreed that the \u201cmarket is, on a consistent basis, underestimating the earnings power of tech, especially big tech.\u201d He added that at the same time, the market is also overestimating the earnings power of the other non-tech names in the S&P 500. He shared that the market expected Big Tech to post earnings up by 19% year-over-year and have \u201cflat revisions\u201d in the third quarter. Non-tech stocks on the other hand were marked down by 2%.  However, Krishna revealed that as the earnings period of Q3 2024 comes to a close, Big Tech actually delivered 31% of earnings growth during the quarter. He added that non-tech stocks have moved in the same direction but only incrementally. He explained that, for example, non-tech stocks were originally marked down, but instead, they expanded by 2%, accelerating at a very slow pace. He also emphasized that the rate at which the market expects Big Tech earnings to slow down is in reality much lower than the actual deceleration rate. Overall, Krishna expects the market to converge but highlighted that it may not be as close as we expect it to be, probably not sooner than Q1 2026.   Story Continues While turmoil and uncertainty remain a key element in the market, some stocks are revolutionary enough that they are bound to offer great opportunities in the coming years, if not now. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best stocks to buy for long term growth.Our MethodologyTo come up with the best stocks to buy for long term growth we sifted through multiple rankings on the internet.

Why NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Best Stock to Buy For Long Term Growth?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks fifth on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term growth. NVIDIA is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. The company is also an AI powerhouse and is commonly referred to as the AI Star.There is no doubt about NVIDIA\u2019s position in the technology and AI sector. As part of its recent updates, on October 29, the company revealed Enterprise Reference Architectures that will help the company\u2019s partners and customers build AI factories. More recently, on November 6, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Hugging Face to fuel open-source AI robotics research and development. Aligning with the trend, on November 27, the company launched AI agents in RTX AI to help solve complex problems, an incredible feat in making the technology more accessible.In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated revenue worth $35.1 billion, up by 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. Most of the demand was propelled by the growing AI needs of the market. In addition to that, the demand for Hopper and the much-awaited Blackwell is immense, contributing to NVDA\u2019s influence over the market.Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on our list because of its resources and expertise in scalable AI hardware and software solutions. At the end of Q3 2024, 193 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to buy for long term growth. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

From mounting AI chip demand to its stellar earnings report and spectacular innovations like the Blackwell architecture, the stock\u2019s momentum has been nothing short of exceptional. Nevertheless, things took a turn today when the stock plunged more than 2% after a regulator in China said it was investigating the darling chipmaker over possible violations of the country\u2019s antimonopoly law.   Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Plunged Today   The Chinese government said that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has initiated an investigation into NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) regarding its acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. is a fabless semiconductor company that Nvidia acquired back in 2020. Since both companies have significant operations in China, the acquisition required approval from Chinese antitrust authorities. Conditions on Nvidia and the merged entity's China operations included prohibitions on forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions, and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately.  In particular, China's competition authority had approved the $7 billion takeover on the premise that rivals be notified of new products within 90 days of allowing Nvidia access to them. As such, the probe will investigate whether Nvidia failed to notify Chinese firms of the new Mellanox products within 90 days, as stipulated by SAMR's approval conditions. \u201cIn recent days, due to Nvidia\u2019s suspected violation of China\u2019s anti-monopoly law and the State Administration for Market Regulation\u2019s restrictive conditions around Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox shares \u2026 the State Administration for Market Regulation is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law\u201d.-According to a statement translated by CNBC.  Nevertheless, analysts state that the probe may not likely have much impact. \"It's (the probe) unlikely to have much of an impact on the company, particularly in the near term, because most of Nvidia\u2019s most advanced chips are already restricted from being sold into China\". -Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.  The news comes amidst escalating tensions between China and the US over chip-making capabilities. On December 2nd, the Biden administration announced some final restrictions on exports of semiconductor chips and chip-making equipment to China. The news could also be a response to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s preparations to take office in January as he gears up to slap hefty tariffs on foreign goods.   Story Continues Last week, China's commerce ministry said it would halt shipments of key materials needed for chip production to the US, stating how the measures are in response to US chip export bans.Our research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that are skyrocketing. Wall Street saw a quiet trading session this week amid the lack of major catalysts to perk up the market. Despite an overall thin trading volume, 10 companies managed to outperform and mirror gains of all major indices. To come up with the Top 10 Gainers this week, we focused on stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and how it has performed so far.   Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) opened the week at $136.4 each and ended Tuesday at $140.22 apiece, marking an increase of 2.8 percent during a quiet trading session. Analysts said that investor optimism was fueled by news that the company raised as much as $30 million from the sale of additional clusters to Hive Digital Technologies. According to reports, the purchase was aligned with its goal to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) and enhance its role in the digital transformation landscape.  Nvidia (NVDA) also remains to be the biggest beneficiary in the ongoing AI boom, with more cloud vendors and internet companies continuing to purchase its graphics processing units. Due to advancements in AI, Nvidia has already perked up its annual revenues by 94 percent in the past six quarters, with growth exceeding 200 percent three times in that stretch. Overall, NVDA ranks 9th on our list of stocks that are skyrocketing. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NVDA) the Best Stock for 10 Years?      Maham Fatima   December 31, 2024 6 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.52%          We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other long-term stocks. To select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.  On December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \"barbell\" approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities. In the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain.\u00a0When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.  Pettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm's focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.   Story Continues MethodologyWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): Investors Should Be \u2018Very Vigilant\u2019 Amid Rising Competition  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)10-Year Revenue CAGR: 37.84%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in GPU manufacturing and serves as a key driver of the ongoing AI revolution. While initially known for revolutionizing the gaming industry, its GPUs have now emerged as the force powering data centers, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and a range of other cutting-edge technologies.Its Blackwell architecture represents a leap forward in GPU technology, with the flagship GB200 GPU leading the charge. The strong demand for both the Blackwell and Hopper platforms has been the primary driver of NVIDIA Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth in the data center segment. Sales of the H200 GPU have skyrocketed into the double-digit billions.In Q3 2024, the company achieved a record-breaking $35.1 billion in revenue, marking a 94% year-over-year growth. While the gaming segment contributed $3.8 billion to the overall revenue, the data center segment contributed $30.8 billion following a 112% year-over-year growth. Given its strong market position, innovative technology, and impressive financial performance, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is considered one of the most promising stocks right now.Polen Focus Growth Strategy highlighted NVIDIA Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong performance this quarter, despite significant stock price volatility driven by both positive and negative market sentiment. Here's what the firm said in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

(NVDA) Stock Jumped Yesterday      Angelica Ballesteros   December 21, 2024 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.53%    MSFT   -1.49%       We recently published an article entitled Why These 10 Stocks Jumped Yesterday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that jumped yesterday. Broader indices haven't been performing very well since the Fed's not so surprise revelation about the number of expected cuts in 2025. Nevertheless, several stocks on Thursday posted notable gains.   Analyst Explains What Worries Him About Nvidia (NVDA) Heading Into 2025   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia\u2019s stock price grew by 1.37 percent on Thursday to close at $130.68 apiece following twin news that Microsoft hoarded 485,000 pieces of Nvidia\u2019s flagship \u201cHopper\u201d chips this year, while also clinching a new partnership with Accenture to kickstart the latter\u2019s adoption of Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), one of the hottest new trends in the AI sector.  With demand beating supply of Nvidia\u2019s most advanced graphics processing units, Microsoft\u2019s hoard boosted investor confidence that the company is set to join the race in building the next generation of AI. Microsoft\u2014which poured in a total of $13 billion in OpenAI\u2014has been the most aggressive among the US\u2019 biggest technology companies in building out data center infrastructure, both to run its own AI services and rent out to customers through the Azure cloud computing business. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that jumped yesterday. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. \u00a0 READ ALSO\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock \u00a0 Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news that broke the Internet. Key AI Trends Shaping Business in 2025 As AI continues to evolve, its influence on business will be undeniable, reshaping industries with smarter, more efficient solutions. Companies that embrace these trends will be better equipped to innovate, compete, and thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. According to Oliver Parker Vice President, Global Generative AI Go-To-Market, Google Cloud, artificial intelligence is set to significantly impact businesses in 2025, driving innovation and transforming operations.  Key trends include multimodal AI, which combines text, audio, and visual data for more accurate and contextual analysis; AI agents that simplify complex workflows and support employees; improved enterprise search capabilities allowing users to access data through various media; improved customer experiences with personalized and predictive AI solutions; and stronger security systems powered by AI to detect threats and strengthen defenses. However, this progress also introduces challenges, especially in the realm of AI-driven security threats.

AI Innovation Moves Towards Efficiency and Applications The AI landscape is undergoing a significant shift, with a growing focus on algorithmic innovations and software applications rather than just scaling hardware. As generative AI models mature, startups and smaller companies are emerging as key players, driving efficiency and new use cases in the field. In the discussion on CNBC, Chetan Puttagunta from Benchmark and Deirdre Bosa of CNBC focused on the evolving AI landscape. Chetan highlighted that AI innovation is shifting from large-scale hardware investments to algorithmic advancements, especially at the model layer, with entrepreneurs pushing the frontier in inference and AI applications. He mentioned that recent investment trends are moving toward smaller startups focused on algorithmic breakthroughs, as opposed to just scaling hardware.  Deirdre added that AI\u2019s generative phase is transitioning from pre-training large models to leveraging existing models for real-world applications. This phase is characterized by a focus on software, with smaller companies gaining traction, especially with the rise of open-source models like Llama, allowing new startups to challenge established players. Chetan gives examples like Sierra, which is revolutionizing customer service by automating tasks and improving customer experiences. Both see a significant opportunity for new AI-first startups to disrupt traditional software companies.

We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Under U.S. Commerce Department Investigation for AI Chip Smuggling to China  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) drives AI innovation with solutions for gaming, data centers, and autonomous systems.The Information reported that the U.S. Commerce Department is investigating how Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) advanced AI chips have been smuggled into China, reportedly in violation of export laws. Inquiries were sent to Nvidia, Super Micro Computer, and other partners, including Dell, to trace these activities. Nvidia and Supermicro have initiated audits of customers in Southeast Asia, a region linked to chip smuggling. Reports indicate some individuals involved in the smuggling altered server serial numbers to avoid detection. Despite inspections, five individuals claim to have evaded discovery, and investigations are ongoing.Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of AI news that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Ramish Cheema   December 28, 2024 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.52%        ^GSPC   -1.07%         We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%.  Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was \"somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday.\" However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that \"rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing\" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them.  His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes.   Story Continues However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented:\"How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don\u2019t even know what quantum is? It\u2019s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?\u201d As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as \"they chose not to be data-dependent.\" On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been \"caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn\u2019t back it up.\" Cramer added that he believed \"It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today\u2019s meltdown.\u201dOn the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. \"I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates,\" shared Cramer and added that the Fed \"got trapped, Jay got trapped.\u201dFor 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated:\u201cThere\u2019s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we\u2019re in one of those moments. In 2025, let\u2019s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.\u201d Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): Investors Should Be \u2018Very Vigilant\u2019 Amid Rising Competition  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193Date of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 08-20-24Performance Since Then: 10.19%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading GPU designer. 2024's close has seen investor and street sentiment about the stock concerned about competition that might eat away the market share for the firm's AI GPUs. However, in multiple appearances, Cramer has dismissed these claims and stressed that he views AI chips from firms like Broadcom and Marvel will complement and not compete with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). On a broader level, the firm's hypothesis depends on stable shipments of its AI GPUs and sustained demand for AI products. Here's what Cramer shared in August:\"I almost feel like you can guess it\u2014it's Nvidia. It's the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia's drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, \"Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There's too much pressure on Nvidia\u2014can it sustain it? I don't want Nvidia to be Samson. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO Sylvia Jablonski said in a recent program on Bloomberg that there are trillions of dollars of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to be invested in AI amid demand that is at an all-time high. \u201cThere\u2019s a biggest wealth transfer of our generation happening as we speak. And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they\u2019re allocating their funds to. And, you know, retail has definitely spoken, and institutions have definitely spoken, and they\u2019re looking for that, that fourth industrial revolution allocation.\u201d  Sylvia also talked about the relationship between quantum computing and AI and explained how this technology would improve AI systems: \u201cSo chatbot AI is, you know, kind of version one. Quantum is taking everything to the next level. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly. It will help, you know, essentially health care, cryptography, aerospace and defense, you know, blockchain technology. Anything you can think of will be better, too, with quantum supercomputing power.\u201d  READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\u00a0and\u00a08 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks that are currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst Predicts NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Will Hit $800 By 2030   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Phil Panaro from the Boston Consulting Group said while talking to Schwab Network that he believes Nvidia shares could reach $800 by 2030. \u201cThey reported $35 billion in one quarter, which is three months. They had a total of $27 billion over 12 months last year. That means in three months, they exceeded their entire 2023 earnings by $8 billion. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a stock in the history of the exchange that has driven that much in revenue, while also achieving 50% margins. If you do the math on that $35 billion a quarter, they\u2019re already on a $140 billion annual clip in terms of revenue. In order to achieve the prediction of $800 by 2030, they need to be at $600 billion in revenue. We\u2019re right on target.\u201d    Story Continues Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cThe fund held an underweight position in\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA\u2019s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA\u2019s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA\u2019s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company\u2019s revenue, which presents added risk.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

On Monday, December 9, the Chinese government announced that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had initiated an investigation concerning Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 required approval from Chinese antitrust regulators given their substantial operations in China.  The country\u2019s competition authority approved the $7 billion acquisition on the condition that competitors be informed of any new Mellanox products within 90 days of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) gaining access to them. The current investigation aims to highlight whether Nvidia complied with this requirement or failed to do so.   Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today   South China Morning Post reveals that (AI) chip giant Nvidia could face a fine of up to US$1 billion under Beijing\u2019s antitrust probe. The move, considered retaliation against Washington\u2019s chip restrictions, marks the first time that China\u2019s market regulator has opened the books on a closed deal. As per China\u2019s antitrust law, companies violating antitrust regulations could face fines ranging from 1 to 10 percent of their annual sales from the previous year. However, it does not specify whether this applies to global or China sales. China, including Hong Kong, is Nvidia\u2019s third-largest market by revenue, with sales reaching US$10.3 billion for the financial year ended January 24 (nearly 17 percent of its total revenue). However, it is too early to determine the exact amount of the fine Nvidia could be facing. \u201cNvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honour our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d- Nvidia said in a statement issued in response to the probe.  The leading AI chipmaker slid despite a key sales boost from supplier TSMC. While TSMC's strong sales highlight robust demand for Nvidia's GPUs and AI chips, investor sentiment was likely overshadowed by the ongoing antitrust probe. Nvidia\u2019s continued slide today may also have been due to traders opting to sell an \u201cearlier pop\u201d. Historically, December hasn\u2019t been kind to Nvidia either. According to Benzinga, the semiconductor giant often comes into a temporary bearish phase following its third-quarter earnings report.   Story Continues Nvidia's performance through November is typically strong, creating a favorable environment for year-end profit-taking. This move to secure profits before year-end creates a downward pressure. Nevertheless, December declines like these are likely to be temporary, with the stock likely to rebound in the first quarter, as it has done so previously.Our research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

Candidates must demonstrate expertise in GPU and DPU installation, hardware validation and system optimization for both AI and HPC workloads. The exam also tests proficiency in managing physical layers, configuring MIG, deploying the NVIDIA BlueField operating system, and integrating NVIDIA\u2019s cloud-native stack with Docker and NVIDIA NGC.\nTo prepare for this professional-level certification, candidates are encouraged to attend the AI Infrastructure Professional Workshop. This hands-on training covers critical AI data center technologies, including compute platforms, GPU operations, networking, storage solutions and BlueField DPUs. The workshop is recommended for professionals aiming to elevate their AI infrastructure expertise.\n\nThe NVIDIA-Certified Professional: AI Operations certification is tailored for individuals seeking proficiency in managing and optimizing AI operations. The exam tests expertise in managing AI data centers, including the use of Kubernetes, Slurm, MIG, BCM, NGC containers, storage configuration and DPU services.\nTo prepare for this professional-level certification, candidates are encouraged to attend the AI Operations Professional Workshop, where they will gain hands-on experience in managing AI data centers, including compute platforms, networking, storage and GPU virtualization. The workshop also provides practical experience with NVIDIA AI software and solutions, including NGC containers and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, making it ideal for professionals looking to deepen their AI operations expertise.\nBoth of these professional-level certifications build upon the foundational knowledge covered in the NVIDIA-Certified Associate: AI Infrastructure and Operations certification.\nAdditional NVIDIA certifications include:\n\nNVIDIA-Certified Associate: Generative AI LLMs \u2014 validates skills in using generative AI and large language models\nNVIDIA-Certified Associate: Generative AI Multimodal \u2014 focuses on multimodal AI content creation\n\nSaleh Hassan, an embedded software engineer at Two Six Technologies, successfully completed three NVIDIA certification exams at the NVIDIA AI Summit in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.\n\u201cThe knowledge I gained has definitely made me a better developer when it comes to integrating AI,\u201d said Hassan, who encourages others to pursue certifications as a key milestone for advancing their AI careers.\nSaleh Hassan showing off one of his NVIDIA certifications.\nAll NVIDIA certifications are part of a comprehensive learning path that offers foundational courses, advanced training and hands-on labs to thoroughly prepare candidates for real-world applications.\nThe certifications support individual career growth and organizations can use them to enhance workforce capabilities.\nExplore the options on the NVIDIA Certification portal and sign up for NVIDIA\u2019s monthly newsletter to stay updated on the latest offerings.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | NGC \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\u2019s according to Saxo\u2019s outrageous predictions for the company. Here is what it says:   Saxo Bank's Outrageous 2025 Prediction for Nvidia   Nvidia stock (NVDA) has gained traction ever since the launch of ChatGPT, driving generative AI into the limelight and fueling the unprecedented demand for AI hardware. The stock has surged a remarkable 189% year-to-date, reflecting the company\u2019s significant role in the AI industry and strong financial performance throughout the year.  Its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), initially used for the video games market, now rake in significant revenue from AI customers. Despite some regulatory challenges, the company has been maintaining its trajectory of growth. Most analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Nvidia\u2019s prospects. For instance, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes likens the company\u2019s positioning to that of Apple Inc, highlighting enthusiasm for the Blackwell chips. Similarly, Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler identifies Nvidia as their top large-cap choice in the artificial intelligence accelerator market. However, history has shown that analysts are not always right. According to TipRanks data, at the end of 2023 34 different analysts have published 12-month projections for Nvidia stock, with the average price target of just over $661 per share implying a 33% upside over the next 12 months. At the time NVDA achieved record-breaking revenue of over $18 billion, a 206% year-over-year increase and 34% growth from the previous quarter. However, its valuation metrics presented mixed signals: its P/E ratio of 65 was relatively modest given its growth trajectory. However, its P/S ratio of 28 far exceeded competitors like AMD and Intel, suggesting the stock \"was priced for perfection\". We now know that those predictions were extremely pessimistic as NVDA's stock price nearly tripled in 2024. Our research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks analysts are talking about. Marco Argenti, Chief Information Officer at Goldman Sachs, recently said that in 2025, the world will witness the full potential of AI that has been in development. He used the analogy of a child raised in a library, now ready to step out into the world. \u201cWhat if they, we make them interact with sensory data, with vision data, with, uh, you know, like basically opening that door of the library and making this child walk into the real world? I think this creation of word models, like they\u2019re called generally in the industry, where you combine multimodal information, that is not only text but is also videos, but is also sensory data. It might be temperature, it might be anything you can perceive around you, could actually unlock the next level of capabilities,\u201d Argenti said, according to CNBC.  Despite high hopes, a potential plateau in performance improvements in AI systems, high energy consumption of AI data centers and transparency remain key issues tech companies will continue to grapple with in 2025.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst Says NVIDIA (NVDA) Likely To \u2018Falter a Little Bit\u2019 in 2025 Amid Focus in Customer AI Chips   NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Doug Clinton from Deepwater Asset Management said in a program on CNBC that the focus in the AI industry would shift to custom silicon chips from hyperscalers. \u201cIf you look at just the AI trade relative to the dot trade, people often make parallels. Sometimes they\u2019re useful, and in this case, you look back to the dot era. Cisco, I think, was sort of the poster child. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is our poster child today, and it is generally, I think, a barometer of just how people are thinking about the trade.    Story Continues Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools.Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It\u2019s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%.Then there\u2019s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC\u2019s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon\u2019s new silicon.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of stocks analysts are talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating \u201cmeaningful\u201d free cash flows. \u201cThis cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one\u2019s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let\u2019s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.\u201d  The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems.

With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Analyst Thinks Latest NVIDIA (NVDA) Pullback a \u2018Gift\u2019 For Long-Term Investors - Here\u2019s Why   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Megan Brantley from LikeFolio in a recent program of Schwab Network said the latest pullback in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares is a \u201cgift\u201d for long-term investors. She believes the company is firing on \u201call cylinders.\u201d She did point out some challenges for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the near term: \u201cWe don\u2019t see many signs of weakness here other than a couple of concerns, such as antitrust concerns in China and potentially some production delays. But from a consumer perspective and from a user perspective of its actual technology and GPUs, we see demand continuing to build and grow.\u201d    Story Continues The analyst also talked about Blackwell:\u201cWe see a lot of traction and a lot of speculation about the impact of its Blackwell GPUs, especially in 2025, and so we think that\u2019s a really important segment to watch. Conversations and consumer searches related to that Blackwell series continue to rise year-over-year.\u201d Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cAs of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date.\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and will drive 3.5% global GDP in 2030, IDC predicts.\nYet, some companies and startups are still slow to adopt AI, sticking to experimentation and siloed projects even as the technology advances at a dizzying pace. That\u2019s partly because AI benefits vary by company, use case and level of investment.\nCautious approaches are giving way to optimism. Two-thirds of the respondents to Forrester Research\u2019s 2024 State of AI Survey believe their organizations would require less than 50% return on investments to consider their AI initiatives successful.\nThe next big thing on the horizon is agentic AI, a form of autonomous or \u201creasoning\u201d AI that requires using diverse language models, sophisticated retrieval-augmented generation stacks and advanced data architectures.\nNVIDIA experts in industry verticals already shared their expectations for the year ahead. Now, hear from company experts driving innovation in AI across enterprises, research and the startup ecosystem:\n\nIAN BUCK\nVice President of Hyperscale and HPC\nInference drives the AI charge: As AI models grow in size and complexity, the demand for efficient inference solutions will increase.\nThe rise of generative AI has transformed inference from simple recognition of the query and response to complex information generation \u2014 including summarizing from multiple sources and large language models such as OpenAI o1 and Llama 450B \u2014 which dramatically increases computational demands. Through new hardware innovations, coupled with continuous software improvements, performance will increase and total cost of ownership is expected to shrink by 5x or more.\nAccelerate everything: With GPUs becoming more widely adopted, industries will look to accelerate everything, from planning to production. New architectures will add to that virtuous cycle, delivering cost efficiencies and an order of magnitude higher compute performance with each generation.\nAs nations and businesses race to build AI factories to accelerate even more workloads, expect many to look for platform solutions and reference data center architectures or blueprints that can get a data center up and running in weeks versus months. This will help them solve some of the world\u2019s toughest challenges, including quantum computing and drug discovery.\nQuantum computing \u2014 all trials, no errors: Quantum computing will make significant strides as researchers focus on supercomputing and simulation to solve the greatest challenges to the nascent field: errors.\nQubits, the basic unit of information in quantum computing, are susceptible to noise, becoming unstable after performing only thousands of operations. This prevents today\u2019s quantum hardware from solving useful problems. In 2025, expect to see the quantum computing community move toward challenging, but crucial, quantum error correction techniques. Error correction requires quick, low-latency calculations. Also expect to see quantum hardware that\u2019s physically colocated within supercomputers, supported by specialized infrastructure.\nAI will also play a crucial role in managing these complex quantum systems, optimizing error correction and enhancing overall quantum hardware performance. This convergence of quantum computing, supercomputing and AI into accelerated quantum supercomputers will drive progress in realizing quantum applications for solving complex problems across various fields, including drug discovery, materials development and logistics.\nBRYAN CATANZARO\nVice President of Applied Deep Learning Research\nPutting a face to AI: AI will become more familiar to use, emotionally responsive and marked by greater creativity and diversity. The first generative AI models that drew pictures struggled with simple tasks like drawing teeth. Rapid advances in AI are making image and video outputs much more photorealistic, while AI-generated voices are losing that robotic feel.\nThese advancements will be driven by the refinement of algorithms and datasets and enterprises\u2019 acknowledgment that AI needs a face and a voice to matter to 8 billion people. This will also cause a shift from turn-based AI interactions to more fluid and natural conversations. Interactions with AI will no longer feel like a series of exchanges but instead offer a more engaging and humanlike conversational experience.\nRethinking industry infrastructure and urban planning: Nations and industries will begin examining how AI automates various aspects of the economy to maintain the current standard of living, even as the global population shrinks.\nThese efforts could help with sustainability and climate change. For instance, the agriculture industry will begin investing in autonomous robots that can clean fields and remove pests and weeds mechanically. This will reduce the need for pesticides and herbicides, keeping the planet healthier and freeing up human capital for other meaningful contributions. Expect to see new thinking in urban planning offices to account for autonomous vehicles and improve traffic management.\nLonger term, AI can help find solutions for reducing carbon emissions and storing carbon, an urgent global challenge.\nKARI BRISKI\nVice President of Generative AI Software\nA symphony of agents \u2014 AI orchestrators: Enterprises are set to have a slew of AI agents, which are semiautonomous, trained models that work across internal networks to help with customer service, human resources, data security and more. To maximize these efficiencies, expect to see a rise in AI orchestrators that work across numerous agents to seamlessly route human inquiries and interpret collective results to recommend and take actions for users.\nThese orchestrators will have access to deeper content understanding, multilingual capabilities and fluency with multiple data types, ranging from PDFs to video streams. Powered by self-learning data flywheels, AI orchestrators will continuously refine business-specific insights. For instance, in manufacturing, an AI orchestrator could optimize supply chains by analyzing real-time data and making recommendations on production schedules and supplier negotiations.\nThis evolution in enterprise AI will significantly boost productivity and innovation across industries while becoming more accessible. Knowledge workers will be more productive because they can tap into a personalized team of AI-powered experts. Developers will be able to build these advanced agents using customizable AI blueprints.\nMultistep reasoning amplifies AI insights: AI for years has been good at giving answers to specific questions without having to delve into the context of a given query. With advances in accelerated computing and new model architectures, AI models will tackle increasingly complex problems and respond with greater accuracy and deeper analysis.\nUsing a capability called multistep reasoning, AI systems increase the amount of \u201cthinking time\u201d by breaking down large, complex questions into smaller tasks \u2014 sometimes even running multiple simulations \u2014 to problem-solve from various angles. These models dynamically evaluate each step, ensuring contextually relevant and transparent responses. Multistep reasoning also involves integrating knowledge from various sources to enable AI to make logical connections and synthesize information across different domains.\nThis will likely impact fields ranging from finance and healthcare to scientific research and entertainment. For example, a healthcare model with multistep reasoning could make a number of recommendations for a doctor to consider, depending on the patient\u2019s diagnosis, medications and response to other treatments.\nStart your AI query engine: With enterprises and research organizations sitting on petabytes of data, the challenge is gaining quick access to the data to deliver actionable insights.\nAI query engines will change how businesses mine that data, and company-specific search engines will be able to sift through structured and unstructured data, including text, images and videos, using natural language processing and machine learning to interpret a user\u2019s intent and provide more relevant and comprehensive results.\nThis will lead to more intelligent decision-making processes, improved customer experiences and enhanced productivity across industries. The continuous learning capabilities of AI query engines will create self-improving data flywheels that help\u00a0 applications become increasingly effective.\nCHARLIE BOYLE\nVice President of DGX Platforms\nAgentic AI makes high-performance inference essential for enterprises: The dawn of agentic AI will drive demand for near-instant responses from complex systems of multiple models. This will make high-performance inference just as important as high-performance training infrastructure. IT leaders will need scalable, purpose-built and optimized accelerated computing infrastructure that can keep pace with the demands of agentic AI to deliver the performance required for real-time decision-making.\nEnterprises expand AI factories to process data into intelligence: Enterprise AI factories transform raw data into business intelligence. Next year, enterprises will expand these factories to leverage massive amounts of historical and synthetic data, then generate forecasts and simulations for everything from consumer behavior and supply chain optimization to financial market movements and digital twins of factories and warehouses. AI factories will become a key competitive advantage that helps early adopters anticipate and shape future scenarios, rather than just react to them.\nChill factor \u2014 liquid-cooled AI data centers: As AI workloads continue to drive growth, pioneering organizations will transition to liquid cooling to maximize performance and energy efficiency. Hyperscale cloud providers and large enterprises will lead the way, using liquid cooling in new AI data centers that house hundreds of thousands of AI accelerators, networking and software.\nEnterprises will increasingly choose to deploy AI infrastructure in colocation facilities rather than build their own \u2014 in part to ease the financial burden of designing, deploying and operating intelligence manufacturing at scale. Or, they will rent capacity as needed. These deployments will help enterprises harness the latest infrastructure without needing to install and operate it themselves. This shift will accelerate broader industry adoption of liquid cooling as a mainstream solution for AI data centers.\nGILAD SHAINER\nSenior Vice President of Networking\u00a0\nGoodbye network, hello computing fabric: \u202fThe term \u201cnetworking\u201d in the data center will seem dated as data center architecture transforms into an integrated compute fabric that enables thousands of accelerators to efficiently communicate with one another via scale-up and scale-out communications, spanning miles of cabling and multiple data center facilities.\nThis integrated compute fabric will include NVIDIA NVLink, which enables scale-up communications, as well as scale-out capabilities enabled by intelligent switches, SuperNICs and DPUs. This will help securely move data to and from accelerators and perform calculations on the fly that drastically minimize data movement. Scale-out communication across networks will be crucial to large-scale AI data center deployments \u2014 and key to getting them up and running in weeks versus months or years.\nAs agentic AI workloads grow \u2014 requiring communication across multiple interconnected AI models working together rather than monolithic and localized AI models \u2014 compute fabrics will be essential to delivering real-time generative AI.\nDistributed AI: All data centers will become accelerated as new approaches to Ethernet design emerge that enable hundreds of thousands of GPUs to support a single workload. This will help democratize AI factory rollouts for multi-tenant generative AI clouds and enterprise AI data centers.\nThis breakthrough technology will also enable AI to expand quickly into enterprise platforms and simplify the buildup and management of AI clouds.\nCompanies will build data center resources that are more geographically dispersed \u2014 located hundreds or even thousands of miles apart \u2014 because of power limitations and the need to build closer to renewable energy sources. Scale-out communications will ensure reliable data movement over these long distances.\nLINXI (JIM) FAN\nSenior Research Scientist, AI Agents\nRobotics will evolve more into humanoids: Robots will begin to understand arbitrary language commands. Right now, industry robots must be programmed by hand, and they don\u2019t respond intelligently to unpredictable inputs or languages other than those programmed. Multimodal robot foundation models that incorporate vision, language and arbitrary actions will evolve this \u201cAI brain,\u201d as will agentic AI that allows for greater AI reasoning.\nTo be sure, don\u2019t expect to immediately see intelligent robots in homes, restaurants, service areas and factories. But these use cases may be closer than you think, as governments look for solutions to aging societies and shrinking labor pools. Physical automation is going to happen gradually, in 10 years being as ubiquitous as the iPhone.\nAI agents are all about inferencing: In September, OpenAI announced a new large language model trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. OpenAI o1, dubbed Strawberry, thinks before it answers: It can produce a long internal chain of thought, correcting mistakes and breaking down tricky steps into simple ones, before responding to the user.\n2025 will be the year a lot of computation begins to shift to inference at the edge. Applications will need hundreds of thousands of tokens for a single query, as small language models make one query after another in microseconds before churning out an answer.\nSmall models will be more energy efficient and will become increasingly important for robotics, creating humanoids and robots that can assist humans in everyday jobs and promoting mobile intelligence applications..\nBOB PETTE\nVice President of Enterprise Platforms\nSeeking sustainable scalability: As enterprises prepare to embrace a new generation of semiautonomous AI agents to enhance various business processes, they\u2019ll focus on creating robust infrastructure, governance and human-like capabilities for effective large-scale deployment. At the same time, AI applications will increasingly use local processing power to enable more sophisticated AI features to run directly on workstations, including thin, lightweight laptops and compact form factors, and improve performance while reducing latency for AI-driven tasks.\nValidated reference architectures, which provide guidance on appropriate hardware and software platforms, will become crucial to optimize performance and accelerate AI deployments. These architectures will serve as essential tools for organizations navigating the complex terrain of AI implementation by helping ensure that their investments align with current needs and future technological advancements.\nRevolutionizing construction, engineering and design with AI: Expect to see a rise in generative AI models tailored to the construction, engineering and design industries that will boost efficiency and accelerate innovation.\nIn construction, agentic AI will extract meaning from massive volumes of construction data collected from onsite sensors and cameras, offering insights that lead to more efficient project timelines and budget management.\nAI will evaluate reality capture data (lidar, photogrammetry and radiance fields) 24/7 and derive mission-critical insights on quality, safety and compliance \u2014 resulting in reduced errors and worksite injuries.\nFor engineers, predictive physics based on physics-informed neural networks will accelerate flood prediction, structural engineering and computational fluid dynamics for airflow solutions tailored to individual rooms or floors of a building \u2014 allowing for faster design iteration.\nIn design, retrieval-augmented generation will enable compliance early in the design phase by ensuring that information modeling for designing and constructing buildings complies with local building codes. Diffusion AI models will accelerate conceptual design and site planning by enabling architects and designers to combine keyword prompts and rough sketches to generate richly detailed conceptual images for client presentations. That will free up time to focus on research and design.\nSANJA FIDLER\nVice President of AI Research\nPredicting unpredictability: Expect to see more models that can learn in the everyday world, helping digital humans, robots and even autonomous cars understand chaotic and sometimes unpredictable situations, using very complex skills with little human intervention.\nFrom the research lab to Wall Street, we\u2019re entering a hype cycle similar to the optimism about autonomous driving 5-7 years ago. It took many years for companies like Waymo and Cruise to deliver a system that works \u2014 and it\u2019s still not scalable because the troves of data these companies and others, including Tesla, have collected may be applicable in one region but not another.\nWith models introduced this year, we can now move more quickly \u2014 and with much less capital expense \u2014 to use internet-scale data to understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human and other actions. Edge applications like robots, cars and warehouse machinery will quickly learn coordination, dexterity and other skills in order to navigate, adapt and interact with the real world.\nWill a robot be able to make coffee and eggs in your kitchen, and then clean up after? Not yet. But it may come sooner than you think.\nGetting real: Fidelity and realism is coming to generative AI across the graphics and simulation pipeline, leading to hyperrealistic games, AI-generated movies and digital humans.\nUnlike with traditional graphics, the vast majority of images will come from generated pixels instead of renderings, resulting in more natural motions and appearances. Tools that develop and iterate on contextual behaviors will result in more sophisticated games for a fraction of the cost of today\u2019s AAA titles.\nIndustries adopt generative AI: Nearly every industry is poised to use AI to enhance and improve the way people live and play.\nAgriculture will use AI to optimize the food chain, improving the delivery of food. For example, AI can be used to predict the greenhouse gas emissions from different crops on individual farms. These analyses can help inform design strategies that help reduce greenhouse gas in supply chains. Meanwhile, AI agents in education will personalize learning experiences, speaking in a person\u2019s native language and asking or answering questions based on level of education in a particular subject.\nAs next-generation accelerators enter the marketplace, you\u2019ll also see a lot more efficiency in delivering these generative AI applications. By improving the training and efficiency of the models in testing, businesses and startups will see better and faster returns on investment across those applications.\nANDREW FENG\nVice President of GPU Software\u00a0\nAccelerated data analytics offers insights with no code change: In 2025, accelerated data analytics will become mainstream for organizations grappling with ever-increasing volumes of data.\nBusinesses generate hundreds of petabytes of data annually, and every company is seeking ways to put it to work. To do so, many will adopt accelerated computing for data analytics.\nThe future lies in accelerated data analytics solutions that support \u201cno code change\u201d and \u201cno configuration change,\u201d enabling organizations to combine their existing data analytics applications with accelerated computing with minimum effort. Generative AI-empowered analytics technology will further widen the adoption of accelerated data analytics by empowering users \u2014 even those who don\u2019t have traditional programming knowledge \u2014 to create new data analytics applications.\nThe seamless integration of accelerated computing, facilitated by a simplified developer experience, will help eliminate adoption barriers and allow organizations to harness their unique data for new AI applications and richer business intelligence.\nNADER KHALIL\nDirector of Developer Technology\nThe startup workforce: If you haven\u2019t heard much about prompt engineers or AI personality designers, you will in 2025. As businesses embrace AI to increase productivity, expect to see new categories of essential workers for both startups and enterprises that blend new and existing skills.\nA prompt engineer designs and refines precise text strings that optimize AI training and produce desired outcomes based on the creation, testing and iteration of prompt designs for chatbots and agentic AI. The demand for prompt engineers will extend beyond tech companies to sectors like legal, customer support and publishing. As AI agents proliferate, businesses and startups will increasingly lean in to AI personality designers to enhance agents with unique personalities.\nJust as the rise of computers spawned job titles like computer scientists, data scientists and machine learning engineers, AI will create different types of work, expanding opportunities for people with strong analytical skills and natural language processing abilities.\nUnderstanding employee efficiency: Startups incorporating AI into their practices increasingly will add revenue per employee (RPE) to their lexicon when talking to investors and business partners.\nInstead of a \u201cgrowth at all costs\u201d mentality, AI supplementation of the workforce will allow startup owners to home in on how hiring each new employee helps everyone else in the business generate more revenue. In the world of startups, RPE fits into discussions about the return on investment in AI and the challenges of filling roles in competition against big enterprises and tech companies.\nEditor\u2019s note: The figures on AI solutions spending are from IDC\u2019s \u201cIDC FutureScape: Worldwide Generative Artificial Intelligence 2025 Predictions\u201d report, Doc # US52632924, published in October 2024.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Content streaming and engagement are entering a new dimension with QUEEN, an AI model by NVIDIA Research and the University of Maryland that makes it possible to stream free-viewpoint video, which lets viewers experience a 3D scene from any angle.\nQUEEN could be used to build immersive streaming applications that teach skills like cooking, put sports fans on the field to watch their favorite teams play from any angle, or bring an extra level of depth to video conferencing in the workplace. It could also be used in industrial environments to help teleoperate robots in a warehouse or a manufacturing plant.\nThe model will be presented at NeurIPS, the annual conference for AI research that begins Tuesday, Dec. 10, in Vancouver.\n\u201cTo stream free-viewpoint videos in near real time, we must simultaneously reconstruct and compress the 3D scene,\u201d said Shalini De Mello, director of research and a distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA. \u201cQUEEN balances factors including compression rate, visual quality, encoding time and rendering time to create an optimized pipeline that sets a new standard for visual quality and streamability.\u201d\nReduce, Reuse and Recycle for Efficient Streaming\nFree-viewpoint videos are typically created using video footage captured from different camera angles, like a multicamera film studio setup, a set of security cameras in a warehouse or a system of videoconferencing cameras in an office.\nPrior AI methods for generating free-viewpoint videos either took too much memory for livestreaming or sacrificed visual quality for smaller file sizes. QUEEN balances both to deliver high-quality visuals \u2014 even in dynamic scenes featuring sparks, flames or furry animals \u2014 that can be easily transmitted from a host server to a client\u2019s device. It also renders visuals faster than previous methods, supporting streaming use cases.\nIn most real-world environments, many elements of a scene stay static. In a video, that means a large share of pixels don\u2019t change from one frame to another. To save computation time, QUEEN tracks and reuses renders of these static regions \u2014 focusing instead on reconstructing the content that changes over time.\nUsing an NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU, the researchers evaluated QUEEN\u2019s performance on several benchmarks and found the model outperformed state-of-the-art methods for online free-viewpoint video on a range of metrics. Given 2D videos of the same scene captured from different angles, it typically takes under five seconds of training time to render free-viewpoint videos at around 350 frames per second.\nThis combination of speed and visual quality can support media broadcasts of concerts and sports games by offering immersive virtual reality experiences or instant replays of key moments in a competition.\nIn warehouse settings, robot operators could use QUEEN to better gauge depth when maneuvering physical objects. And in a videoconferencing application \u2014 such as the 3D videoconferencing demo shown at SIGGRAPH and NVIDIA GTC \u2014 it could help presenters demonstrate tasks like cooking or origami while letting viewers pick the visual angle that best supports their learning.\nThe code for QUEEN will soon be released as open source and shared on the project page.\nQUEEN is one of over 50 NVIDIA-authored NeurIPS posters and papers that feature groundbreaking AI research with potential applications in fields including simulation, robotics and healthcare. Among them is a best paper runner-up, titled \u201cGuiding a Diffusion Model With a Bad Version of Itself\u201d \u2014 one of just five papers recognized among the over 4,500 accepted this year.\u00a0\nGenerative Adversarial Nets, the paper that first introduced GAN models, won the NeurIPS 2024 Test of Time Award. Cited more than 85,000 times, the paper was coauthored by Bing Xu, distinguished engineer at NVIDIA.

and Private Mobile Edge Compute (MEC) with NVIDIA AI combine to deliver powerful, real-time AI services at the edge, empowering customers through innovationNEW YORK\u00a0\u2013 Verizon today announced a new solution developed with NVIDIA that enables a wide range of AI applications to run over Verizon\u2019s reliable 5G private network with private Mobile Edge Compute (MEC),\u00a0 demonstrating the transformative power of this innovation to enterprises. Verizon\u2019s 5G Private Network with Enterprise AI solution brings together Verizon\u2019s secure, reliable, low-latency 5G private network and private MEC with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and NVIDIA NIM microservices to deliver powerful, real-time AI services on premises for enterprise customers. Verizon engineers will begin demonstrations of this solution in early 2025.\u201cGenerative AI, with its predictive capabilities, is poised to be a critical component of digital transformation and future business growth in almost all industries,\u201d said Srini Kalapala, Senior Vice President of Technology and Product Development at Verizon. \u201cWe're leveraging our network's unique strengths including private networks and Verizon\u2019s global industry leadership in private MEC, combined with NVIDIA\u2019s AI compute capabilities to enable real-time AI applications that require security, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth. Our ongoing investment in our network infrastructure means we're uniquely positioned to deliver these powerful AI services at scale, driving the digital transformation and fueling the future growth of businesses worldwide.\u201d\u201cEnterprises everywhere are racing to integrate AI solutions that bring new value to their employees, partners and customers, and can also help them operate with extreme efficiency,\u201d said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. \u201cVerizon\u2019s integration of NVIDIA\u2019s full stack AI platform into its new solution for running AI workloads on private 5G networks is a big step forward in helping enterprises of all sizes reach their business objectives faster with AI.\u201dThe new AI powered private 5G platform stack is a Verizon and NVIDIA developed infrastructure designed to be plug & play, helping third-party developers to innovate with speed, while also accommodating future evolutions in AI computing and a variety of AI and connectivity applications. It can support multi-tenancy for multiple use cases or customers, is modular to be able to scale as needed for a bespoke solution for various applications, and can provide these services remotely via portable private network solutions or on a customer\u2019s premise with a permanent private network on site. The stack is being built to handle compute intensive apps including Generative AI Large Language Models and Vision Language Models, Video streaming, broadcast management, Computer Vision (CV), Augmented/Virtual/Extended Reality (AR/VR/XR), Autonomous Mobile Robot/ Automated Guided Vehicle (AMR/AGV), and IoT.Key benefits of the Verizon 5G Private Network with Enterprise AI solution include:Ultra-Low Latency: Verizon's Private 5G Network provides the ultra-low latency required for real-time AI processing at the edge, critical for applications like robotics, and augmented reality.High Bandwidth and Reliability: The dedicated bandwidth and enhanced reliability of a private 5G network ensure optimal performance for data-intensive AI workloads.Enhanced Security and Control: Private 5G networks offer improved security and control over data and applications, essential for businesses with sensitive AI workloads.Scalability and Flexibility: The solution can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different industries and use cases, providing scalability and flexibility for future growth.AI Processing at the Edge: Verizon private network customers can run their AI application workloads and services at the premise edge with Mobile Edge Compute to prevent compute intensive applications from traversing the internet, leading to quick decision making with local processing and inferencing.A PwC Global Artificial Intelligence Study\u00a0reported that 75% of business executives considered AI a business advantage and were either already using it or planning to do so. A McKinsey Global Survey on AI\u00a0indicated that 50% of companies had adopted AI in at least one business function, with 71% planning to expand AI use in the near future. These insights underscore the importance of mobile networks being able to support AI workloads in the future. It is estimated that 5G will power $12 trillion in global economic output by 2035,with AI-enabled devices playing a key role in transforming industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. The need for networks to manage AI workloads has never been greater.\u201cIn today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, staying ahead of the curve is essential for businesses to thrive. That's where Verizon comes in. We don't just offer connectivity; we deliver cutting-edge solutions that empower our customers to anticipate and adapt to change. It's why major industries across the board choose Verizon,\u201d said Kalapala.Verizon was the first to launch Mobile Edge Compute and continues its global leadership in edge computing capabilities. Verizon\u2019s collaboration with NVIDIA to power AI workloads on private 5G networks represents a significant advancement in enterprise AI capabilities. This solution, which the innovation partners expect will be available for demonstrations in February, will enable businesses to deploy powerful AI applications at the edge, driving innovation and efficiency across various sectors.

And support for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\u2019s next update, which adds DLSS 3 Frame Generation.\nTo ensure you receive the definitive experience in each from the second you start playing, download and install our new Game Ready Driver from the Drivers tab of NVIDIA App or GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\u2122, Featuring DLSS 3 & Ray Tracing\nUncover one of history\u2019s greatest mysteries in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\u2122 on December 6th with the game\u2019s Digital Premium Edition Advanced Access launch, followed by its general release on December 9th. Step into the shoes of Indiana Jones and embark on a single-player, narrative-driven journey that spans the globe during the height of the legendary archaeologist\u2019s career. From the hallowed halls of the Vatican and the sunken temples of Sukhothai to the pyramids of Egypt and the snowy peaks of the Himalayas.\nAs part of a partnership with Bethesda Softworks and MachineGames, and in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PC is further enhanced by the addition of DLSS 3 with Frame Generation and Super Resolution, and ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is our award-winning AI rendering technology that increases graphics performance in games and apps using dedicated Tensor Core AI processors on GeForce RTX GPUs. In the hundreds of released games and apps listed here, all GeForce RTX users can enhance their experience with DLSS Super Resolution, which taps into the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.\nFor even faster frame rates, owners of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptops can accelerate performance in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using NVIDIA DLSS 3 with Frame Generation. On average, performance increases by 2X at 4K, with Ray Traced Global Illumination lighting enabled, along with the game\u2019s highest quality Supreme-preset settings.\nOn the GeForce RTX 4090, this performance multiplier enables you to play at over 200 frames per second, for the definitive launch-day Indiana Jones and the Great Circle PC experience. GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER owners can crack Indy\u2019s whip, solve puzzles and battle bad guys at over 170 frames per second, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER owners at over 150 FPS, and GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER users at over 130 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to DLSS 3\u2019s 1.6X average performance multiplier, 2560x1440 and 1920x1080 gamers can play on a wide variety of GeForce RTX 40 Series configurations, using the highest quality Supreme preset, at well over 100 frames per second, delivering a fantastic day-one Indiana Jones and the Great Circle experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 9th, Full Ray Tracing will further upgrade Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PC. Also known as Path Tracing, Full Ray Tracing is a demanding but highly accurate way to render light and its effect on a scene, used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality. Until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, full ray tracing in real-time video games was impossible.\nFollowing the release of the update, shadows, reflections, and global illumination will all be accurately rendered in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using Full Ray Tracing, elevating image quality. And with DLSS 3\u2019s performance multiplier, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers will have the power to enjoy Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\u2019s Full Ray Tracing at the highest detail levels and resolutions.\nUntil December 13th, as part of our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\u2122 GeForce RTX 40 Series Bundle*, get the Digital Premium Edition of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (a $99.99 value) with the purchase of a qualifying GeForce RTX 4090, 4080 SUPER, 4080, 4070 Ti SUPER, 4070 Ti, 4070 SUPER, or 4070 desktop or graphics card, or laptop with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. And as an added bonus, the Digital Premium Edition enables Advanced Access to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on December 6th, three days before the official December 9th release date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find GPUs, desktops, and laptops eligible for the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle GeForce RTX 40 Series Bundle at numerous system builders and retailers worldwide. Head to the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle bundle homepage to see the complete list of participating partners in your country.\nOnce you\u2019ve bought any qualifying product, you\u2019ll receive email instructions on how to redeem your bundle via the NVIDIA app, and just a few clicks later you\u2019ll add Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to your Steam account. And by installing our Game Ready Driver, your new hardware will be ready to rock and roll, delivering the definitive experience in this highly anticipated game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re away from home and your GeForce RTX PC or laptop, or don't have the latest Game Ready hardware, you can stream the Steam and Microsoft Store versions of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from the cloud with NVIDIA GeForce NOW. Members will also be able to enjoy the PC Game Pass version next week.\nUltimate members can play with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3 with Frame Generation and Super Resolution, even on low-end devices.

To max out 120 FPS 4K displays, look to the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, and if you want to go even faster, the GeForce RTX 4090 delivers up to 170 frames per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, a 2X average performance multiplier enables super fast Marvel Rivals gameplay on a variety range of configurations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at 1920x1080, a 1.9X average frame rate boost enables every GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop graphics card to play Marvel Rivals maxed out at over 120 FPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Reflex is a game changing technology that reduces PC latency on GeForce graphics cards and laptops, so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable.\nIn Marvel Rivals, enabling Reflex reduces PC latency by up to 50%, further improving your experience.\nSince its debut in September 2020, NVIDIA Reflex has reduced PC latency in over 130 games, and over 90% of GeForce gamers have enabled Reflex. 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters feature Reflex support, along with critically acclaimed co-op and single-player games. In 2023 alone, GeForce gamers played over 10 billion hours of their favorite titles with increased responsiveness thanks to Reflex\u2019s innovative system latency reducing technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Delta Force, Featuring DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Tracing & Reflex\nThe classic Delta Force first-person shooter franchise has returned to action with the launch of the free-to-play, continually-evolving, 24/7 Delta Force PC Global Open Beta.

Take on local militias and cooperate forces, outwit rival player squads, complete diverse objectives, and extract safely to advance your skill and upgrade Black Site, your field command for Operations games.\nAnd with the purchase of an add-on available at a later date, revisit Delta Force\u2019s Black Hawk Down campaign, rebooted in Unreal Engine 5 with the latest technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the moment the PC Global Open Beta launched yesterday, GeForce RTX gamers have been able to elevate their Delta Force experience with DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces PC latency by up to 54%. These technologies enhance performance, improve responsiveness, and deliver stunning visuals for a definitive day-one experience.\nStarting in January, 2025, Delta Force will gradually roll out DLSS Frame Generation support, providing an even smoother gaming experience. The game\u2019s Black Hawk Down campaign, also launching in January, 2025, will incorporate Ray-Traced Reflections, further enhancing graphical realism for games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Forza Motorsport\u2019s Ray-Traced Global Illumination Update\nOn December 9th, Turn 10\u2019s Forza Motorsport enhances its 500-plus cars and ever-growing number of circuits with Ray-Traced Global Illumination lighting (RTGI). This PC-only upgrade option enhances\u00a0 the game\u2019s existing illumination technology to compute more accurate indirect lighting and occlusion across tracks and cars in real-time, amping up visual fidelity and realism.\nTake a first look in the PC Ray-Traced Global Illumination lighting screenshots below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Traced Global Illumination lighting is a new setting that must be enabled, and is not on by default. To turn on this immersive new setting, set \u201cRaytracing Quality\u201d to \"Full Reflections + RTGI\", and choose a quality level under \u201cRTGI Quality\u201d.\nWhen enabled, Ray-Traced Global Illumination lighting will apply to all gameplay and cinematics, as well as your Homespace and Photo Mode, increasing immersion and image quality during virtually all in-game moments.\nTo maximize performance when enabling RTGI, activate DLSS Super Resolution in the settings menu, or take image quality to the next level with DLAA. This AI-based anti-aliasing mode utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS, but it instead uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Path of Exile 2, Featuring DLSS Super Resolution & Reflex\nGrinding Gear Games\u2019 Path of Exile 2 is their much-anticipated free-to-play action-RPG, building upon the critically acclaimed gameplay of the original 2013 game.

GeForce RTX gamers jumping into the massive ARPG will find day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, which will reduce PC latency by up to 57%, helping keep you alive in Path of Exile 2\u2019s most dangerous dungeons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Settings For New Games\nOne-click optimal settings in GeForce Experience and the NVIDIA app enable you to instantly configure game options for your system\u2019s hardware, giving you smooth, optimized gameplay.

In addition to ongoing efforts to accelerate inference on Apple silicon, we have recently made significant progress in accelerating LLM inference for the NVIDIA GPUs widely used for production applications across the industry.\nEarlier this year, we published and open sourced Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter), a novel approach to speculative decoding that achieves state of the art performance. ReDrafter uses an RNN draft model, and combines beam search with dynamic tree attention to speed up LLM token generation by up to 3.5 tokens per generation step for open source models, surpassing the performance of prior speculative decoding techniques.\nTokens per second speed upFigure 1: Tokens per second speed up using NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM with ReDrafter vs Auto-regression.\nProductionizing ReDrafter to Speed up NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM\nThis research work demonstrated strong results, but its greater impact comes from being applied in production to accelerate LLM inference. To make this advancement production-ready for NVIDIA GPUs, we collaborated with NVIDIA to integrate ReDrafter into the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM inference acceleration framework.\nAlthough TensorRT-LLM supports numerous open source LLMs and the Medusa speculative decoding method, ReDrafter\u2019s beam search and tree attention algorithms rely on operators that had never been used in previous applications. To enable the integration of ReDrafter, NVIDIA added new operators or exposed existing ones, which considerably improved TensorRT-LLM's capability to accommodate sophisticated models and decoding methods. ML developers using NVIDIA GPUs can now easily benefit from ReDrafter\u2019s accelerated token generation for their production LLM applications with TensorRT-LLM.\nIn benchmarking a tens-of-billions parameter production model on NVIDIA GPUs, using the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM inference acceleration framework with ReDrafter, we have seen 2.7x speed-up in generated tokens per second for greedy decoding (see Figure 1). These benchmark results indicate this tech could significantly reduce latency users may experience, while also using fewer GPUs and consuming less power.\nFor additional detail, see this post on the NVIDIA developer blog.\nConclusion\nLLMs are increasingly being used to power production applications, and improving inference efficiency can both impact computational costs and reduce latency for users. With ReDrafter\u2019s novel approach to speculative decoding integrated into the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM framework, developers can now benefit from faster token generation on NVIDIA GPUs for their production LLM applications.\nAcknowledgements\nMany people contributed to this project including: Aonan Zhang, Xuanyu Zhang, Yunfei Cheng, Chong Wang, Yi Wang, Abhishek Udupa, Dhaval Doshi, and our collaborators at NVIDIA.Related readings and updates.Delayed Fusion: Integrating Large Language Models into First-Pass Decoding in End-to-end Speech RecognitionThis paper presents an efficient decoding approach for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) with large language models (LLMs).

And the price is now $249, down from $499.\nAvailable today, it delivers as much as a 1.7x leap in generative AI inference performance, a 70% increase in performance to 67 INT8 TOPS, and a 50% increase in memory bandwidth to 102GB/s compared with its predecessor.\nWhether creating LLM chatbots based on retrieval-augmented generation, building a visual AI agent, or deploying AI-based robots, the Jetson Orin Nano Super is an ideal solution to fetch.\n\nThe Gift That Keeps on Giving\nThe software updates available to the new Jetson Orin Nano Super will also boost generative AI performance for those who already own the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit.\nJetson Orin Nano Super is suited for those interested in developing skills in generative AI, robotics or computer vision. As the AI world is moving from task-specific models into foundation models, it also provides an accessible platform to transform ideas into reality.\nPowerful Performance With Super for Generative AI\nThe enhanced performance of the Jetson Orin Nano Super delivers gains for all popular generative AI models and transformer-based computer vision.\n\nThe developer kit consists of a Jetson Orin Nano 8GB system-on-module (SoM) and a reference carrier board, providing an ideal platform for prototyping edge AI applications.\nThe SoM features an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU with tensor cores and a 6-core Arm CPU, facilitating multiple concurrent AI application pipelines and high-performance inference. It can support up to four cameras, offering higher resolution and frame rates than previous versions.\nExtensive Generative AI Software Ecosystem and Community\nGenerative AI is evolving quickly. The NVIDIA Jetson AI lab offers immediate support for those cutting-edge models from the open-source community and provides easy-to-use tutorials. Developers can also get extensive support from the broader Jetson community and inspiration from projects created by developers.\nJetson runs NVIDIA AI software including NVIDIA Isaac for robotics, NVIDIA Metropolis for vision AI and NVIDIA Holoscan for sensor processing. Development time can be reduced with NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator for synthetic data generation and NVIDIA TAO Toolkit for fine-tuning pretrained AI models from the NGC catalog.\nJetson ecosystem partners offer additional AI and system software, developer tools and custom software development. They can also help with cameras and other sensors, as well as carrier boards and design services for product solutions.\nBoosting Jetson Orin Performance for All With Super Mode\nThe software updates to boost 1.7X generative AI performance will also be available to the Jetson Orin NX and Orin Nano series of systems on modules.\n\nExisting Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit owners can upgrade the JetPack SDK to unlock boosted performance today.\nLearn more about Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: NVIDIA Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The app is accelerated by Nvidia\u2019s StyleGAN2 generative AI technology which helps create the near-perfect, realistic versions of yourself to apply the changing hairstyles to.  Ulta Beauty is a specialty retailer of cosmetics and personal care products. It was the first to combine luxury and drugstore brands, with salon services, all under one roof, creating a unique shopping experience. With more than 42 million members, its Ultimate Rewards program is the most popular in the beauty industry.    Ulta Beauty's main products include cosmetics, like foundations, lipsticks, eyeshadows, and blushes; moisturizers and cleansers for skin care; shampoos and conditioners; perfumes and colognes; nail polishes and tools for manicures and pedicures; and in-store salon services. Ulta Beauty\u2019s cosmetics and skincare products are the main contributors to total revenue with 39% and 24%, respectively. Haircare adds 20%, fragrances generate 11%, and salon services earn approximately 4% of the total revenue.  The company\u2019s end market includes individuals of different ages, genders, and skin tones. Additionally, its collaborations with brands like MAC Cosmetics and Kylie Cosmetics, allow for even more variety of its product offerings. Currently, it only operates in the United States, with approximately 1,400 stores. While there are many apps out there that allow you to test hairstyles, Ulta\u2019s version uses generative AI to improve the experience. It uses Nvidia\u2019s StyleGAN2 generative AI model, which is known for some unique features. It improves on the original StyleGAN, which was prone to errors and inconsistencies when generating some images. It also offers control over the image at a finer grain level, allowing for more precise editing and manipulations. The technology is ideal for creating a digital version of a person\u2019s face and then applying manipulations to it, such as hairstyling like in Ulta\u2019s case. Ulta\u2019s stock has gone nowhere in over two years but has sustained the post-COVID gains rather well. The company hopes it can propel itself to the next bull run with the emergence, integration, and adoption of AI into its products and services. It will be interesting to see the public\u2019s response to this technology, though the ultimate success will be measured when it helps the company sell more products rather than just provide an amazing facility.  Ulta Beauty Inc. is not on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 40 hedge fund portfolios held ULTA at the end of the third quarter which was 46 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of ULTA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as ULTA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Nvidia stock NVDA slipped 1.7% on Monday and fell into a correction as traders were covering their long positions and bucking the upside trend. Since the all-time high of $148.88 a share set on November 7, the chip giant has washed out 11% of its valuation to close yesterday\u2019s session at $132 a pop. By the standard definition, a 10% fall or more is a correction. A bear market comes at a 20% decline or more.  Nvidia has been all the game in town, drawing investors to pump its stock thanks to its first-mover advantage in the AI space. The company is building out and shipping out AI servers worth $30,000 a piece (or more) to a long list of tech highflyers, including the Magnificent Seven. The scorching hot demand has fueled a 170% rise in Nvidia\u2019s shares this year alone and even positioned it briefly as the world\u2019s most expensive company at $3.6 trillion.  But over the past month the hype has fizzled out as investors have taken a step back to reassess things heading into the new year. One of the challenges on the horizon is Nvidia\u2019s ability to ramp up the production of its flagship product, the Blackwell artificial intelligence chip. Sales aren\u2019t guaranteed, either. Competition is heating up as ecommerce and cloud computing giant Amazon is working on a product that will rival Nvidia\u2019s AI chips.

AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology.Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness\u2019 career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum.  Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there\u2019s ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable.AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR\u2019s multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR\u2019s futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility.AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm\u2019s performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. \u201cWe let the machine decide more,\u201d Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition.Our Methodology:Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Position size: $1.96 billionActivity: 5%The last time we covered AQR\u2019s NVDA investment was 6 months ago when AQR had $1.53 billion invested in NVDA stock. Here is what we said:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its dominance in AI technology as NVIDIA delivered impressive performance driven by its AI capabilities that led to a 206% surge in its stock price over the past year. O\u2019Malley sees a $25 billion opportunity in global AI expansion and forecasts NVIDIA\u2019s earnings to rise to $3.62 per share by fiscal 2026. NVIDIA\u2019s recent product innovations, including new AI architectures and advanced chips namely Rubin (R100), and its advanced H100 and Blackwell chips, are expected to fuel further growth. Despite a high current P/E ratio of 71, analysts view NVIDIA\u2019s forward P/E of 35.74, based on 2026 earnings estimates, as attractive given its strong growth prospects and technological leadership in the market.\u201dNothing really changed about NVDA. NVDA shares jumped from $90 at the end of the first quarter to $140 today. AQR\u2019s NVDA position increased by 30% since then. This means as NVDA shares were skyrocketing AQR took some of the profits off the table, but still let its position size grow unlike what it did with some of the other megacap stocks. This means NVDA is really AQR\u2019s #1 megacap stock pick as the quant hedge fund owns 0.07% of NVDA\u2019s outstanding shares.Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant\u2019s investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we will share what the Street has been saying about NVDA stock.Aswath DamodaranAswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, thinks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is overvalued. He explained his stance while talking with CNBC\u00a0journalists and said: \u201cI think at this price, if you\u2019re buying, you\u2019re expecting the product and service market to be much bigger than people anticipate. You need to be clear that this is what you\u2019re basing your purchase on. Even if you assume Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market\u2014which I believe they currently have\u2014and their ability to maintain these sky-high margins, you still can\u2019t justify a $144 valuation without something additional happening. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re betting on Nvidia finding and dominating another market, and that\u2019s a tough call.\u201d   Like Damodaran, investment advisory Trefis Team is of the view that NVDA stock is overpriced while it trades at ~ 48x fiscal 2025 earnings estimates. The firm believes rival chipmaker AMD offers a more attractive entry point at 28 times forward earnings estimates for investors that want to jump on the AI bandwagon.While some think the current price isn\u2019t justified, Denmark-based Saxo Bank thinks Nvidia stock could reach $250 by the end of 2025. That would give it a $7 trillion market cap, according to Chief Macro Strategist John J. Hardy. He thinks that Nvidia is the \u201cprimary shovel-seller in the AI gold rush\u201d\u00a0and sees it accounting for 10% of the global equity market next year.While not as bullish as Hardy, analysts at PhillipCapital also recently raised the price target on NVDA shares to $160 from $155 but downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy. According to PhillipCapital analyst Yik Ban Chong: \u201cHyperscalers are upgrading their AI cloud capabilities to capture cloud service opportunities from Gen AI startups, H200 Hopper sales increased to \u2018double-digit billions,\u2019 the fastest product ramp in the company\u2019s history, NVDA guided that its demand will continue at least until 2H26.\u201d Blackwell just started production in 4Q25, and NVDA expects its revenue to exceed their previous estimate of \u2018several billion dollars.\u2019 NVDA stated earlier that it expects supply-demand equilibrium to be reached in FY26e.\u201d But that\u2019s not all, Chong also took note of the potential implications of higher trade tariffs between the U.S. and China for NVDA stock: \u201cThe escalation of the US-China trade war starting from July 2018 caused NVDA\u2019s stock price to fall more than 50% from its peak in October 2018. If similar tariff policies were to be imposed again, there may be a material impact on NVDA\u2019s share price.\u201d The impact of higher trade tariffs could present challenges for Nvidia, but what about a structural change in AI? Adam Clark, a reporter at Barron\u2019s, shared a unique perspective about a paradigm shift in AI that could impact the business of Wall Street\u2019s AI darling. AI companies are shifting their focus from developing and training large models to inferencing. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are more appropriate for the training part of model development, and Clark reported that inferencing might bring more business to the company\u2019s competitors including AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).Our research director also shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Ghazal Ahmed   December 11, 2024 3 min read        15   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.56%        GOOG   -2.42%         EMJ Capital founder and President Eric Jackson discussed the potential for Alphabet (GOOG)'s new quantum computing chip, Willow, being a potential Bitcoin and Nvidia killer on Making Money. Here is what he thinks about the new chip: As excited as people may have gotten about artificial intelligence in the past year, quantum is just the next level of that interest, Jackson claims. Quantum computing is the next leap in technological advancements, offering more powerful computations, more powerful computers, faster solutions than one can imagine, and problem-solving capabilities beyond the reach of traditional computers.   Is Google's New Quantum Chip A Bitcoin and NVDA Killer?   High angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components. When asked about the potential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin, even though not immediate, Jackson affirms that the threat lies in the encryption. He noted how today\u2019s encryption methods, such as RSA, rely on complex mathematical formulas that are secure against conventional computers. Take Bitcoin, nobody thought they could crack into these things which is what powered its rise to $100,000.  However, quantum holds the theoretical potential to crack into these things. Jackson warns that crypto wallets could be hacked in the future with quantum technology. However, the risk isn\u2019t merely limited to crypto wallets and the billions of bitcoins around the world. Companies, industries, and banks should all be worried about the sensitive data that could be at stake. Couple this with the fact that Google just dropped a chip out of the blue, it merely signifies how quickly quantum technology is accelerating, demanding immediate attention to the security and investment in the quantum industry. Jackson highlighted two names that he likes in the Quantum space: Rigetti (RGTI) and D-Wave (QBTS). Both of these names have witnessed great runs, surging an estimated 300% in the last month. Jackson claims that they are both trying to build chips to be as good as or better than Google, and there's a lot more investment pouring into the space so investors should pay attention to those names. Jackson also highlighted a smaller company called BTQ in the business of what he considers the \u201cpost-quantum Crowdstrike\u201d, with their job being to defend all these crypto wallets and their sensitive data. Despite skepticism, Jackson believes the market is recognizing the immense potential of quantum computing. While it may take time to believe much like the rapid rise of AI, quantum technology is here to stay. Those who invest early could position themselves to benefit from the huge bull run ahead.   Story Continues Alphabet's (GOOGL) quantum chip is still years away from becoming a threat to bitcoin, but quantum computing chips are also a threat to traditional chip companies such as NVIDIA (NVDA) because they are exponentially faster than traditional chips. Alphabet's engineers didn't specifically mention a target date when quantum computers can be used for \"useful\" tasks, but they hinted that it is less than 10 years. NVDA's forward PE multiple is around 35 and NVDA may not have enough time to generate the profits implied by its forward multiple before its AI chips might be rendered obsolete by the new quantum chips.While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA and GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks highlighted in Jim Cramer\u2019s latest calls.Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about Bitcoin and reminded investors that he has always believed in the cryptocurrency. \u201cI want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do\u2014not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let\u2019s dispel the idea that I\u2019ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.\u201d   Cramer said he likes the idea of Bitcoin being the store of value and said he always recommended investors to allocate 10% of their portfolio to the currency. However, he again urged investors to look to stocks for the rest of their portfolios. \u201cI heard Fed Chief J. Powell talk about how he believes people are buying Bitcoin as a store of value, like gold, because there\u2019s not much transaction done in Bitcoin. I\u2019ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world\u2019s lunacy. But for years now, I\u2019ve also been saying Bitcoin is a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels\u2026Sure, you might have been all in on Bitcoin. You know what? Terrific. Me too. But what if I told you there are indeed other ideas hidden in plain sight in the stock market? Ideas that you could have owned with the other 90% of your portfolio that wasn\u2019t Bitcoin.\u201d Cramer then mentioned a few stocks that have posted dramatic gains since their IPOs to show investors the power of stock investing.READ ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other StocksFor this article, we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he recently talked about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193Last month, Jim Cramer talked about the underperformance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) after its quarterly results and countered the bear arguments impacting the stock. Cramer said NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still has no competition and other companies are making their own chips because Nvidia has so much demand that it\u2019s struggling to keep up. \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is struggling in a typical post-earnings miasma. We know that nothing\u2019s wrong\u2014we just saw the numbers; they were terrific. Yet, there\u2019s a growing skepticism that things have peaked, that the rate of growth is slowing, that the bank for the buck is lessening, and that the competition is increasing, especially from Amazon. Of course, we hear this every time. I want to unpack these supposed negatives\u2014not that I know who packed them first. Amazon\u2019s not going to go into the high-end chip business away from Nvidia. It simply needs a regular supply of other chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a shortage because they literally can\u2019t find enough manufacturing capacity to meet the demand, so Amazon makes some of them itself. What matters, though, is that Nvidia welcomes the competition\u2014if you can call it that. Here\u2019s the deal: OK, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still has the best technology by far, in my view. It has no competitors. Amazon remains a huge, and I am told from both sides, happy customer.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter: \u201cThe fund held an underweight position in\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA\u2019s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA\u2019s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA\u2019s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company\u2019s revenue, which presents added risk.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks highlighted in Jim Cramer\u2019s latest calls. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u200230 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

That was more than double the 224,000 chips acquired by Meta (META), Nvidia\u2019s second-leading customer in the U.S.Meanwhile, JPMorgan was upbeat about NVDA stock in a note issued by the bank earlier today. Specifically, NVDA continues to get a lift from high spending on AI accelerators, the bank contended.And tech website TrendForce reported that the chip maker\u2019s GB200 rack could undergo \u201cmass production and peak shipments\u201d in the second or third quarter of 2025.Among the potential users of the product are \u201cTier-2 data centers, national sovereign cloud providers, and academic research institutions\u201d that are involved in high-performance computing and AI, TrendForce reported.The GB200 will use the fifth generation of Nvidia\u2019s NVLink system which allows GPU chips to quickly interface with each other.Also noteworthy is that the production of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell GPU chips is mostly in-line with expectations., according to TrendForce.Despite today\u2019s advance by NVDA stock, the shares are little changed over the last six months.While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Just like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge. Customers so far include NATO and the French post office, the report adds. READ ALSO: 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

The most powerful GPUs in the world will be ready for ramp-up by mid-2025, but then what? Most of the revenue that Blackwell will generate should already be priced in. So why all the excitement? We believe it is not the GPU itself, but the penetration into more markets that will drive Nvidia\u2019s growth. However, no one is talking about the significance of these markets.    Let\u2019s consider military spending as an example. We already know that China and the US are at loggerheads, trying to take a lead in AI. The reason is easy to understand. If one country takes the lead in AI, it is likely to have a superior military, which would then have severe implications for the other. But what if, in pursuit of this superiority, there was an arms race? What if both countries started spending massively to build their own AI-enabled defense systems?  Any sort of arms race will put AI chip makers at the forefront. Military spending has already increased manifolds in the last two years, with the Department of Defence handing out way more AI-related contracts than usual. But despite this increase, the spending is still only a few billion dollars. The Russia-Ukraine war has also proved that autonomy and AI are the future of warfare. Just like the Atomic Bomb changed the rules of global conflicts, it will be an AI arms race that will determine how wars are fought in the next decades. Imagine if every country in the world, every military in the world, and every private defense contractor in the world wants to buy Nvidia\u2019s chips. The resulting spending will be gigantic, and Nvidia should experience astronomical gains from this. Then there is the matter of using AI for governance. Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is working on making government operations leaner. AI and autonomy can do this, which is why Elon Musk is the perfect man for this job. Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform provides the ideal foundation for creating digital twins of government buildings around the country. The US federal government owns over 300,000 buildings across the US. Imagine the improvement in efficiency if they were run by creating digital twins through Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse. The improvement in efficiency will be massive. But most importantly for investors, Nvidia will again receive astronomical returns. While Blackwell takes the limelight, Nvidia investors shouldn\u2019t pay heed to the supply chain issues. The Nvidia growth story is about to kick off its next phase of growth.   Story Continues Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem came from varied backgrounds with different companies, but they shared a few ideas about where computer technology was headed.Huang was a former designer with Advanced Micro Devices Corp. (NASDAQ: AMD), while Malachowsky and Priem were engineers with Sun Microsystems. All three agreed that graphics-based computing was going to be the next big thing and founded the company to push toward this goal.Source: nvidia.comNVIDIA\u2019s founders believed that computers would evolve to become potent gaming and media consumption machines. In 1999, they presented the world with their GPU, a special type of circuit that increased the speed of image rendering on computer systems.Called the GeForce 256, this GPU had the capability of processing 10 million polygons per second. By increasing the graphic manipulation speed, NVIDIA set itself up to be a player in several industries, especially game consoles and computer workstations.Today, NVIDIA technology can be found everywhere. It sells products designed to perform the following tasks:Consumer-oriented graphics processingProfessional design and content creationMobile processingHigh-end image rendering for scientific industriesNVIDIA has also recently become a staple in the exploding AI industry because as deep learning systems grow in strength so will the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs.History of Nvidia StockSource: GoogleNVIDIA Corporation filed its IPO on January 22, 1999, (shortly before the release of its first GPU) with shares priced at $12. The IPO came to market only a few months before the beginning of the dot-com meltdown, which sent many tech stocks plummeting without recovery for several years.By October 2002, NVIDIA shares were trading below $1. But unlike many of its computer-driven competitors, NVIDIA survived the dot-com bubble and continued to grow and innovate.After pushing close to the $1 mark in November 2007, NVIDIA shares were hit again by the Great Recession, and prices receded back to the single digits. After another recovery, the stock traded sideways for a couple of years until the company announced its first-ever dividend in November 2012.Four more years of sideways trading followed until the calendar flipped to 2016 and NVIDIA\u2019s stock exploded. Between February 2016 and February 2017, NVIDIA stock price went from $0.73 per share to $2.54 per share.Nvidia's stock began its upward trajectory in October 2022, experiencing a steady increase in value over the following months.\u00a0By June 2024, Nvidia's stock had reached its all-time high, exceeding $135 per share.\u00a0Future Outlook for NVIDIAThe outlook for NVIDIA is of great interest to Wall Street analysts. They have a 12-month price target of $135, indicating possible growth. However, predictions vary. Some analysts predict a low of $50, while others are more optimistic with a high of $200. This range shows differing views on NVIDIA's market position and growth in sectors such as AI and gaming. For investors, these forecasts present both opportunities and risks. Investing in NVIDIA may offer good returns if the company keeps innovating and growing its market share through 2025. Nonetheless, the wide range of predictions urges caution. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and current market conditions before deciding. Evaluating these stock price predictions is important for anyone wanting to benefit from NVIDIA\u2019s potential growth.Why Should You Buy NVIDIA Stock?NVIDIA Corporation is a leader in the technology sector.

Up until then, hardly anyone had heard of the monumental capabilities that even the first version of ChatGPT boasted. It was the beginning of a revolution that began a race among tech companies to build AI infrastructure.  As all companies rushed to spend enormous amounts of cash on buying AI equipment, nobody asked the question: how did ChatGPT build its platform when AI infrastructure wasn\u2019t even a thing? The answer lies in Nvidia\u2019s Hopper GPU which was released in 2022. Considered one of the most powerful GPUs, the unique selling point of the GPU wasn\u2019t AI. It was just the most advanced GPU Nvidia had built by that time.    In other words, Nvidia still hasn\u2019t released a GPU that was \u2018built for AI\u2019. The upcoming Blackwell architecture will be the first true AI GPU. The company put a lot of resources behind this version, ensuring that it would fulfill the needs of all the major tech companies looking to accelerate the training of their AI models. If the Blackwell GPUs are truly the first AI GPUs, surely the AI spending is only about to begin. Any company that is serious about gaining a lead in developing AI technology will need to be on these GPUs from day one. Big Tech, which is the biggest AI spender by a long shot, simply has no other choice but to buy the new advanced GPUs to stay in the race.  On the flip side, there are issues with scaling the Blackwell GPUs, the likes of which we hear almost every week. It is quite unlike Nvidia to face execution issues when launching a new GPU. But there are good reasons for these problems, if one may call them that. When companies build their data centers, they need a whole lot of equipment in addition to the GPUs to make it run successfully. Blackwell GPUs are so advanced that some companies will need to change their whole data centers to accommodate these. In other words, the supporting equipment that needs to go in a data center to support Blackwell GPUs still isn\u2019t perfect. For example, which liquid cooling racks work best with the GPU? How do data centers without Direct Liquid Cooling deal with these new GPUs? What about the software? There are simply too many questions even for Nvidia to answer. And that\u2019s not a bad problem to have, considering they\u2019re the only company capable of providing this much computing power. Investors worried about Nvidia\u2019s supply chain issues or problems with Blackwell GPUs need not worry. We are in unchartered territories and even Nvidia can be allowed to have some slip-ups. However, Blackwell GPUs are without a doubt the most powerful GPUs in the world. After a quarter or two, companies will have figured it out. Then they\u2019ll need more. That\u2019s where Nvidia can fix its margin issues, bring in monetization, and we have the next bull run!   Story Continues Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

Analysts Are Split on the AI Giant's Next Move         Nauman khan   December 26, 2024 1 min read        4   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.51%       Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) Since the AI boom started mid 2022, NVDA) has been on an unprecedented climb with the share price up 888% to close in on $140 and its market cap up nearly $3 trillion. But as 2025 creeps closer, doubts about Nvidia's ability to maintain this pace of growth and fear of an AI sparked bubble are weighing in.  Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.  But recent analyst forecasts predict Nvidia could reach $200 per share in 2025, but it's not a guarantee. Cantor Fitzgerald and Truist rank among the four most notable ratings for December, forecasting price targets of $200 and $204, respectively. Others, more conservative upgrades came in from Daiwa Securities, which increased its target from $125 to $160 and Morgan Stanley, which increased its target from $166 to $168. Nvidia's future is heavily dependent on both geopolitical risks and economic uncertainties. Headwinds come in the form of heightened inflation concerns and supply chain disruptions from U.S.-China tensions. But analysts also say Nvidia's growth could be capped by a broader slowing of the economy in 2025 as well as concerns over a bubble on the market. Nvidia would need its market cap to climb to $4 trillion for its shares to trade at $164 to hit $200, and for its market cap to keep climbing from that point. Although Nvidia's AI dominance and strong fundamentals make this plausible, obstacles exist that get in the way of such ambitious goals. As the semiconductor giant faces a critical year, investors remain divided: Is there a strong chance that Nvidia's growth story is just starting, or perhaps expectations for 2025 are far too high? Time will only tell if $200 is a milestone or a mirage. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Affan Mir   December 22, 2024 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.51%       We recently compiled a list of the 11 Important AI News and Ratings for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have raised both opportunities and concerns, especially regarding its safety and the ethical implications of its widespread use. Establishing regulatory frameworks for AI is essential to ensure its responsible development, protecting against potential risks while maximizing its positive impact across industries. Experts Urge AI Firms to Improve Safety Efforts The Future of Life Institute released its 2024 AI Safety Index, evaluating the safety practices of leading AI companies including Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, x.AI, and Zhipu AI among others. The review panel, consisting of prominent AI experts, found significant gaps in the companies' risk management and safety strategies, especially regarding their ability to ensure that advanced AI systems remain beneficial and under human control.  Despite some positive steps in certain areas, the panel expressed concern that these companies are not adequately addressing the existential risks associated with AI development. The report highlighted the need for improved accountability, transparency, and safety frameworks, as competitive pressures seem to be overshadowing safety considerations. The index aims to provide the public with insights into AI companies' safety efforts and encourage better practices within the industry.

Navigating the Future of AI with Safety Standards In a CNBC interview, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and MIT professor, emphasized the need for AI safety standards, drawing a parallel to regulated industries like aviation and medicine. He highlighted the current lack of clear plans to ensure AI safety, especially as systems like chatbots and autonomous vehicles become more integrated into real-world applications. Tegmark advocates for policy changes to make AI companies prioritize safety, much like other industries, to prevent potentially dangerous outcomes. While the situation is concerning, he believes that proper regulation could lead to significant benefits.

Why NVDA Stock Lost 10% in One Week  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader in AI-driven solutions, providing advanced technologies for cloud-based computing, automotive systems, and data centers.Nvidia and Apple have collaborated to strengthen large language model (LLM) inferencing using a method called Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter). This approach, based on a recurrent neural network, combines beam search with dynamic tree attention to improve LLM token generation speed by up to 3.5 tokens per step for open-source models. Integrated into Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM, ReDrafter has shown a 2.7x increase in token generation speed during testing on Nvidia GPUs, reducing latency and power consumption. The collaboration aims to enable developers to deploy sophisticated models with improved efficiency and performance.Nvidia said in a blog post:\u201cThis collaboration between NVIDIA and Apple, has made TensorRT-LLM more powerful and more flexible, enabling the LLM community to innovate more sophisticated models and easily deploy them with TensorRT-LLM to achieve unparalleled performance on NVIDIA GPUs. These new features open exciting possibilities, and we eagerly anticipate the next generation of advanced models from the community that leverage TensorRT-LLM capabilities, driving further improvements in LLM workloads.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of important AI news and ratings for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Since Ibiden is a supplier for most of the major semiconductor companies in the US, this gives us some insight into the future AI spending expected from Big Tech.  Ibiden is a global player in the semiconductor and electronics industry and produces package substrates and printed circuit boards (PCBs) for many high-density and high-speed semiconductor applications. The AI boom has catapulted this part of its business to new heights, with companies increasingly inquiring about the firm's future expansion plans. At the moment, Ibiden is setting up a new substrate factory in Gifu, which should start production by the end of 2025. This factory should start operating at 50% capacity by the first quarter of 2026. However, customers are asking questions about the timeline for the remaining capacity coming online.    These customers aren\u2019t any small companies. The main customer here is Nvidia, which wants the company to ramp up its production so it can continue to develop its GPUs. The reason this is important for Nvidia is because it is the only player in the industry that provides GPUs that are many times more powerful than the nearest competitor. Nvidia has a unique problem in that its suppliers are challenged to keep up with the pace of its innovation. More often than not, Nvidia isn\u2019t constrained by its own R&D. Rather, it has to ensure the supporting equipment for its GPUs is ready before it can sell it to customers. Ibiden has a similar role to play in supporting Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. These GPUs release so much heat that substrates need to withstand the high temperatures. So Nvidia can\u2019t just buy these from anyone and has to trust its existing suppliers to come up with the best tech in enough quantities to support its production.  Apart from Nvidia, Intel is also a big customer. It is plausible that the company continues to generate 30% of its revenue from Intel, which at one point accounted for over 70% of the company\u2019s sales. AMD, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are among other notable customers. Ibiden also needs to accommodate custom chip makers like Google, Broadcom, and Marvell among others. What this tells us is that AI spending isn\u2019t slowing down anytime soon. If US companies want a key supplier to increase production capacity, it can only mean they want to continue spending. 2025 could well be the year of AI and with this news coming out of Japan, we can expect many more billions to be poured into AI during the year. We believe Nvidia is again going to be the biggest beneficiary of this spending, even with competition from custom chip makers like Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL).   Story Continues Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

Huang's keynote is slated for Monday, Jan. 6 at 9:30 p.m. ET and will probably be about an hour.\nIt's fitting that Huang is kicking off the 2025 CES. This annual happening is billed as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" and Huang leads what is arguably the most powerful tech company in the world. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technology dominate the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) chip and tech space. Moreover, Nvidia is the second most valuable company in the world by market cap, slightly trailing Apple, and its stock has soared 172% this year through Friday, Dec. 20.\nAt the annual CES, many big tech companies and start-ups launch a wide variety of innovative technology products and unveil futuristic concepts that they aim to someday commercialize. The CES is a trade-only event, but the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which owns the CES, live streams a portion of the conference, and the streams are free to the public.\nWhat can Nvidia investors expect from CES 2025?\n\nA good chance Nvidia's product launches and other announcements will be more exciting than usual\nNvidia and its many partners always launch or announce inventive and sometimes groundbreaking new products and concepts at the CES. However, Nvidia often saves some of its most exciting product launches and announcements for its annual GTC (GPU Technology Conference) events.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there's a good chance that Nvidia will share even more exciting news than usual at the 2025 CES. Huang's kicking off this year's tech extravaganza means that he will have the attention of a huge audience, both live and streamers. The 2024 CES drew over 138,000 attendees -- 40% of them from outside the U.S. -- and featured more than 4,300 exhibitors, according to the CTA. So it seems likely that Huang will particularly want to \"wow\" viewers. \nIs a Nvidia stock breakout coming soon?\nWhile Nvidia stock has performed tremendously this year -- it's up 172% so far in 2024 -- its entire gain was achieved in the first half of the year. On Friday, Dec. 20, Nvidia stock closed at $134.70. That's down from its all-time closing high of $148.87, notched on Nov. 7, and very close to its closing price on June 18 of $135.56.\nNvidia stock got a nice boost from the 2024 CES -- specifically, from the start of the event to the first trading day after the event ended. And if a similar dynamic occurs again in 2025, Nvidia stock will rise during the period from Jan. 6, when Huang opens the event, through Jan. 13, the first trading day after the CES ends. Of course, there are no guarantees.\nThe below chart shows how Nvidia stock and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes performed on the first trading day of the 2024 CES. The Nasdaq is probably the better index for context since it's heavily composed of tech stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan. 8, 2024 was the first full day of CES 2024 and included a team from Nvidia giving a half-hour \"special address\" at 11 a.m. ET. The team introduced Nvidia's latest generative AI innovations for gaming, content creation, laptops, and robotics, including new gaming GPUs and generative AI models. They also announced that several electric-vehicle (EV) makers selected the Nvidia DRIVE platform for automated driving. \n\nData by YCharts.\nThe below chart shows Nvidia stock's performance from the start of CES 2024 through the first trading day after the event ended.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also another upcoming possible positive stimulus for Nvidia stock -- a so-called Santa Claus rally. This term generally refers to the tendency of the stock market to rise slightly during the last five trading days in December and the first two trading days in the following January. For this season, those dates would be Tuesday, Dec. 24 through Friday, Jan. 3, excluding Wednesday, Dec. 25 and Wednesday, Jan. 1 as the U.S. stock market is closed on Christmas and New Year's Day.\nA great stock for the long term\nNaturally, it would be great for investors if Nvidia stock breaks out of its recent trading range soon, thanks to a Santa Claus rally and/or investor enthusiasm about the news from the CES. But it's no matter if this doesn't happen. Nvidia stock is poised to continue to be a long-term winner, as the company is, arguably, the most important company in the AI space -- and the adoption of AI is still in its early innings.\nIf Nvidia stock doesn't break out in January, there's always February. The company is scheduled to release its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 after the market close on Wednesday, Feb. 26. \n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Attiya Zainib   December 3, 2024 6 min read        3   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMD   -0.84%    NVDA   -2.53%       We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors\u2019 Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a \u201cdata wall\u201d or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: \u201cAll it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it\u2019s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI\u2019s Alexander Wang to Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei to Databricks\u2019 Ali Ghodsi weighing in.\u201d  Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: \u201cA foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.\u201d  Read\u00a0Huang\u2019s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: \u201c\u2026..also acknowledge that this alone isn\u2019t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\u2019s Supercomputing Power Overtakes Nvidia - Can Its Stock Performance Too?  electronics-6055226_1280Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 107The Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)-powered El Capitan claimed the top spot in the 64th edition of the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\u201cThe new El Capitan system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, U.S.A., has debuted as the most powerful system on the list with an HPL score of 1.742 EFlop/s,\u201d according to TOP500. \u201cIt has 11,039,616 combined CPU and GPU cores and is based on AMD 4th generation EPYC processors with 24 cores at 1.8GHz and AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators.\u201d The system uses HPE\u2019s (NYSE:HPE) Cray Slingshot 11 network for data transfer and achieves an energy efficiency of 58.89 Gigaflops/watt.\u201cAMD GPU cores overtook NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the first time, boosted by El Capitan which accounted for ~37% of AMD\u2019s total accelerator cores on the list,\u201d said Wells Fargo analysts, led by Aaron Rakers, in a note on the rankings. \u201cAMD\u2019s share of CPU cores hit an all-time high at 29% and systems, while NVIDIA GPUs grew to 184 (ex-China) versus 166 a year ago.\u201d Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0bulls believe the market should stop comparing the company\u2019s chips with Nvidia and focus on its data-center growth and its competitive edge over other players like Intel. Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s strong growth in the data center segment is indeed impressive, driven by Instinct GPU shipments and strong sales of EPYC CPUs.\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0will continue to benefit from organic growth catalysts in this segment despite the competition from Nvidia. According to Goldman Sachs Research, global data center demand could surge by 160% by 2030. In the U.S., data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022. McKinsey estimates that adding the required U.S. capacity will need over $500 billion in infrastructure investment by the decade\u2019s end.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s forward adjusted PEG ratio is about 40% lower than the median for the tech sector (XLK).Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cShares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) lagged the market after the company reported earnings results that, while generally strong, left the market wanting more. The company reported AI revenue of ~$600 million and increased its forward-looking outlook for AI revenue growth, but shares took a breather, as results missed elevated expectations after the stock\u2019s strong performance. Despite the stock\u2019s underperformance during the quarter, the company\u2019s AI story remains very much intact. The growth outlook for the company is supported by better cloud demand, enterprise recovery and continued share gains ahead of the company\u2019s new AI product launch.\u201d Overall, AMD ranks 7th on our list of top AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n\n\n\nWe've tested gaming performance with Nvidia's new 'Nvidia App,' which is installed by default with the driver package, and found that it reduces performance by up to 15% in some games.\n\nUpdate: Nvidia sent us a statement: \"We are aware of a reported performance issue related to Game Filters and are actively looking into it. You can turn off Game Filters from the NVIDIA App Settings > Features > Overlay > Game Filters and Photo Mode, and then relaunch your game.\"\n\nWe have tested this and confirmed that disabling the Game Filters and Photo Mode does indeed work. The problem appears to stem from the filters causing a performance loss, even when they're not being actively used. (With GeForce Experience, if you didn't have any game filters enabled, it didn't affect performance.) So, if you're only after the video capture features or game optimizations offered by the Nvidia App, you can get 'normal' performance by disabling the filters and photo modes.\n\nWhen Nvidia rolled out its 566.14 drivers last month, it officially placed GeForce Experience (GFE) on legacy status. The first time you load GFE with 566.14, it will prompt you to update to the new Nvidia App. You could decline, but there will be no future updates to GFE. With the 566.36 drivers, Nvidia removed GFE completely and there's only the Nvidia App \u2014 or you can run without the extra features it provides and install the drivers only.\n\nIf you don't need the extra software, skipping the Nvidia App avoids such messiness, and it's why many people didn't install GeForce Experience either. We've confirmed reports around the web that the Nvidia App using the default settings can impact gaming performance, dropping framerates by up to 15% in some cases.Test EquipmentTOM'S HARDWARE AMD ZEN 5 PCAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DNvidia RTX 4060ASRock Taichi X670EG.Skill TridentZ5 Neo 2x16GB DDR5-6000 CL28Crucial T700 4TBCooler Master ML280 MirrorCorsair HX1500iWindows 11 24H2If it's not immediately clear, 15% is a massive performance drop caused by a driver or application update. To put it in perspective, the more expensive RTX 4060 Ti is only 18% faster than the base model RTX 4060, according to our GPU benchmarks, running both at 1080p medium settings. Thankfully, the performance decrease isn't universally 15%, but we tested with the 4060 and saw a 2\u201312 percent drop in framerates across the five games that we tested.\n\nWe used the numbers from our recent Intel Arc B580 review, then retested a handful of games after doing a clean driver install, without installing the Nvidia App as part of the package. The Nvidia App was initially running with the default settings (i.e., overlay enabled, but not actively using it).\n\nBelow are our updated testing results. Turning off the game filters but keeping the Nvidia App (and overlay) is in blue, running without the Nvidia App is in green, while the default (Nvidia App with filters and photo mode enabled) is in gray. Here's the rundown of performance.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The overall chart shows that disabling the game filters or running without the Nvidia App results in effectively the same performance \u2014 within margin of error (less than a 1% difference). Using the default settings for the Nvidia App, however, drops performance about 6% at 1080p, and 2.5% at 1440p. The amount of impact varies by game, naturally.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)In all the games we checked, not having the Nvidia App installed improved performance. We sort of expected 1080p medium to show the largest delta, as that's more of a CPU-limited scenario, but the performance hit was mostly independent of the settings and resolutions we tested. Some games showed a smaller hit to performance, others larger, and of course we're only talking about one set of hardware tested. But it's clear there's a problem with performance being reduced by a not-insignificant amount.\n\nSome people have opined that Unreal Engine 5 games are the most affected, but by our numbers, the biggest loser was Assassin's Creed Mirage, which dropped by 9% at 1080p medium, 12% at 1080p ultra, and 6% at 1440p ultra. Stalker 2 lost around 6% as well (ignoring the 1440p ultra result where VRAM is a clear problem), while Black Myth: Wukong 'only' dropped by about 2\u20136 percent. Baldur's Gate 3, a DirectX 11 game, saw a 3\u20134 percent hit, and Flight Simulator 2024 lost 6% at 1080p as well.\n\nIt's a safe bet that the performance loss will vary with different CPUs and GPUs, though without further testing, we can't say precisely how much. At least one user reported up to a 15% performance loss in Black Myth: Wukong when testing an RTX 4080 Super paired with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, so it could be that higher-performance GPUs are even more impacted.\n\nWe reached out to Nvidia for comment, and they got back to us late in the day. As you can read in the update at the top, the root cause appears to be related to the Game Filters and Photo Mode being enabled, whether or not any filters are actually active. Disabling that options fixes the performance loss (if you're not using either feature). Alternatively, if you don't need the extra features the App offers, you can do a clean driver install and skip the Nvidia App for now. We assume there will be a more permanent fix that doesn't require disabling these features with a future driver.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (48)\n\n\n\nJarred WaltonSocial Links NavigationJarred Walton is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on everything GPU.

I'm too lazy to uninstall NVApp on my Windows 10 to test it myself, but disabling overlay and whatever does not have any effect on my framerates whatsoever. This could be something exclusive to Windows 11.\nNeither GFE nor NVApp should have any performance impact when you're not actually using any of it's features (filters, video recording, rtx hdr).\nThis is just a bad clickbaity article - we tested performance problems! (but we actually didn't fully test anything). Not testing Win 10 when half of PC gamers are still using this OS?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.  So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA  NVIDIA's Improving Profits Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$0.76 to US$2.58 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection. It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 16.8 percentage points to 63%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth. The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue History December 20th 2024   While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for NVIDIA? Are NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders? We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.2t company like NVIDIA. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$124b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions! Is NVIDIA Worth Keeping An Eye On? NVIDIA's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, NVIDIA is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for NVIDIA (1 shouldn't be ignored)  you should be aware of.   Story Continues There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%.  While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated \"Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!\" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. \"Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this,\" said Cramer, adding \"So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds.\"  Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, \"I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong.\" Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's \"trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow.\"   Story Continues The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's \"trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in,\" but it's very difficult to \"find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something.\"Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China \"is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out.\" On how the \"media and other coverage says that China is in a depression,\" Cramer has \"to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth.\"One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't \"understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti,\" something he believes is very important since autos \"is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers.\" China is \"getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world,\" Cramer said, adding that \"there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump.\"However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the \"Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into.\"Our MethodologyTo make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Analyst Explains What Worries Him About Nvidia (NVDA) Heading Into 2025  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere:\"And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.61 -2.92 (-2.44%)  As of 3:14:09 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    \u201cAll relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,\u201d Truist Securities\u2019 William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025.  Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker\u2019s stock last week and sent Nvidia\u2019s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company\u2019s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030.  Still, Morgan Stanley said, \u201chistory is certainly on Nvidia's side\u201d when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. \u201cWe think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors.\" It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment.   Story Continues   The logo of Nvidia is seen on a smartphone screen. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)  \u00b7 VCG via Getty ImagesTD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but \"remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate.\"Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit \u2014 the \u201cbrain\u201d of a computer, distinct from Nvidia\u2019s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units \u2014 in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, the new tech is being welcomed by everyone as a smart move by Nvidia to introduce the power of generative AI to the public. This device, which sells at $249, is highly efficient in generating AI programs, aimed to draw developers, students, or hobbyists into the technology.    NVIDIA, based in California, has become one of the prominent companies for graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies over the last few years. The company's recent efforts in developing AI platforms that power generative AI have ballooned the market cap past the $3 trillion mark. Currently, a significant revenue source for NVIDIA is the sale of GPUs and AI software solutions to big industry players like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Consequently, NVIDIA has become one of the leading players in AI.  The Jetson Orin Nano Super is a system-on-module operated by an 8GB desktop board built with an NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPU and a 6-core Arm CPU. This powerful combination of AI shows a 1.7 times boost in the generative AI performance compared with the previous generations. In addition to that, a 70% speed in inference and a 50% increase in memory bandwidth is impressive. The product is ideal for producing LLM chatbots, visual AI agents, and AI-based robot deployment. The robust hardware features are backed by a sizable software package, including NVIDIA's Isaac for robotics, Metropolis for vision AI, and Holoscan for sensor processing. The developers also get to enjoy the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator for synthetic data generation. In short, this innovative kit is an economical yet powerful AI creation platform. It has an increased level of productivity, versatile program support, and a community-based ecosystem that makes it ideal for generative AI, robotics, and computer vision applications. By launching this compact device, Nvidia has given hobbyists a chance to use their knowledge and skills on a smaller scale. Who knows that's where Nvidia's next innovative idea is born!  Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Sheryar Siddiq   December 23, 2024 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.46%       We recently published a list of 12 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts. Tech stocks have definitely grabbed the spotlight in the tech world, especially with the rise of generative AI. But there\u2019s more to the sector that could be worth investors\u2019 attention. Edge computing, for example, is another area within tech that\u2019s primed for significant growth. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, edge computing aims to bring computing power closer to where data is generated instead of relying solely on centralized cloud systems. Sometimes called the \u201cThird Act of the Internet\u201d by the Linux Foundation, edge computing changes the game by moving data storage and processing closer to local network points. This shift is a major step in how we handle and interact with information.  A new forecast from the IDC, global spending on edge computing is projected to hit $228 billion in 2024, reflecting a 14% increase from 2023. This figure covers combined spending by enterprises and service providers on hardware, software, professional services, and provisioned services for edge solutions. The forecast predicts continued strong growth through 2028, with spending expected to approach $378 billion, driven by a robust double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This growth is driven by the increasing demand for localized network infrastructure and computing power, fueled by the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT)\u2014a network of connected devices. As more data is generated at the endpoints, the traditional network structure faces more strain. The rollout of 5G, which offers higher bandwidth and the ability to support more connected devices, is boosting IoT and driving the need for edge computing. At the same time, AI-optimized processors are providing the computing power necessary to expand the use of edge systems. The automotive industry is a great example of how edge computing and AI are driving rapid advancements. As cars increasingly adopt self-driving features, these technologies have become crucial for making real-time decisions and responses.  According to Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market, valued at $10.11 billion in 2023, is expected to grow from $13.66 billion in 2024 to a staggering $181.96 billion by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 38.2%. This rapid expansion is driven by the increasing adoption of edge devices, such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras, as well as computational infrastructure enabling real-time data analysis at the source. Similarly, PwC had predicted that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, rising from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion in 2024. This growth is fueled by the ability of localized data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and deliver storage and computational power closer to end-users.   Story Continues Our MethodologyTo create our list of the top edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts, we reviewed various stock screeners and ETFs, selecting companies based on their upside potential as of December 17. The stocks are ranked by their average upside potential, from lowest to highest, according to price targets. We also included data on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 hedge fund data.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Edge Computing Stock to Invest in According to Analysts?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Average Analyst Upside: 24.36%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a leading innovator in the semiconductor industry, has established itself as a key player in the edge computing landscape. Its edge computing solutions harness the power of NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and AI capabilities to tackle the unique challenges and opportunities of processing data at the network\u2019s edge. NVIDIA\u2019s EGX Edge Computing Platform empowers organizations to deploy, manage, and scale edge computing solutions across distributed infrastructures. This platform combines a unified software stack with hardware infrastructure that can be implemented across various edge devices.Citi recently reaffirmed its positive outlook on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), maintaining a Buy rating and a $175 price target. The firm emphasized the strategic advantage of NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs, particularly their software reprogrammability through CUDA, which enables adaptability to diverse workloads. Citi also noted supply chain developments, predicting that NVIDIA\u2019s allocation of CoWoS foundry capacity will rise to 60% in 2025, up from 56% in 2024, further bolstering its growth trajectory.In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported impressive revenue of $35.1 billion, reflecting a 17% sequential increase and a remarkable 94% year-over-year growth. This surge was primarily driven by robust AI hardware demand, with the company\u2019s data center services and Blackwell AI chip playing a pivotal role. These developments have heightened expectations for continued growth in the coming year.Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $175.55 indicates a potential upside of 25.7%.  The average comprises 42 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $135 to a high of $220, with a standard deviation of $16.81. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 3.3% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 57.5% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. But, for NVDA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside. Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?  They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.   Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NVDAThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NVDA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Valued at a market capitalization of over $3.5 trillion, the semiconductor giant is also one of the largest companies in the world and is at the epicenter of the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend.While several companies are eyeing the highly disruptive market, Nvidia has been quietly building its AI empire since 1999. Remember when the company\u2019s GPUs or graphics processing units were just for gaming? Well, the Big Tech giant has transformed these chips, which now form the backbone of AI, and this innovation is paying off spectacularly.\u00a0According to industry experts, Nvidia\u2019s H100 and A100 chips are the gold standard for AI processing, allowing the company to enjoy a market share larger than 90%. In recent years, Nvidia has left competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC behind.\u00a0In addition to its hardware, Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform allows companies to optimize operations by leveraging AI-driven insights, allowing it to gain traction in sectors such as logistics and manufacturing.\u00a0Saxo Provides Bullish Outlook for Nvidia StockWhile some investors might worry about Nvidia's valuation, consider this: We're still in the early innings of the AI revolution. As AI applications expand across industries, Nvidia's position as the essential \"picks and shovels\" provider of the AI gold rush becomes even more valuable.According to a report from Saxo Bank, Nvidia\u2019s outperformance will continue in 2025 due to robust demand for its revolutionary Blackwell chip. Apparently, this chip has showcased a 25x increase in the performance of AI calculations per unit of energy consumed compared to the H100 generation.\u00a0Saxo explains, \u201cWith the intensifying AI arms race as no giant or even government wants to be left behind, and as AI data centre electricity costs have soared, the insatiable demand for the more powerful and yet less power-hungry Blackwell chips sees Nvidia taking the crown as the most profitable company of all time.\u201dSaxo is extremely bullish on NVDA stock and expects it to trade at more than $250 per share, up from the current price of $136. If Nvidia surpasses the $250 threshold, the chip stock will be valued at a market cap of over $6.2 trillion, making it 2x more valuable than Apple AAPL.\u00a0Is NVDA Stock Overvalued?Nvidia shares have returned 90% in the past 52 weeks and are up 2,227% in the past five years. If we zoom out further, NVDA stock has returned 27,692% in the last decade and a monstrous 70,855% over 20 years. This means that a $1,000 investment in NVDA stock in December 2004 would be worth close to $800,000 today.\u00a0 Given that the AI race is still nascent, Nvidia\u2019s growth story is far from over. Analysts tracking the tech stock expect sales to rise from $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024 to $129 billion in 2025, $195 billion in 2026, and $235 billion in 2027. Comparatively, adjusted earnings per share are forecast to expand from $1.29 per share in 2024 to $2.95 in 2025, $4.43 in 2026 and $5.58 in 2027.\u00a0 Priced at 31x forward earnings, NVDA stock is still reasonably valued, given its growth estimates. Out of the 43 analysts covering NVDA stock, 36 recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d three recommend \u201cModerate Buy\u201d and four recommend \u201cHold.\u201d The average target price for Nvidia stock is $173, indicating upside potential of 25% from current levels.\u00a0 On the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The RTX 5080 is reportedly the second fastest GPU in the RTX 50 lineup, following the RTX 5090, and is going to succeed the current-gen RTX 4080 & RTX 4080 SUPER GPUs.\nNVIDIA's upcoming GeForce RTX 50 series is based on the Blackwell architecture and the RTX 5080 is going to be the second fastest in the series after the flagship RTX 5090 GPU. NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture is used in both data centers and gaming GPUs. The Blackwell GPUs will utilize a new custom 5nm process node, particularly the N5B.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU is expected to take over the Ada-based GeForce RTX 4080 GPU by offering a noticeable performance lead in gaming and general graphical workloads. NVIDIA has been continuing the 80-class cards for generations and they used to be the fastest GPUs in the entire lineup until the Turing-based RTX 30 series GPUs made an entry and since then, we have the 90-class GPUs the fastest in the lineups.\nThe GeForce RTX 5080 - 2nd Fastest In The RTX 50 Lineup\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 is expected to feature the GB203-300-A1 die, which succeeds the AD103-300-A1 on the RTX 4080. It is going to feature the PG144/147-SKU45 PCB and is expected to feature with 84 SMs.\n\nWe currently don't have detailed information on the die except for the base GPU configuration but we do have some leaked specifications for the GPU. We will update this section once we have the info on its GPU die but till now, expect NVIDIA to follow up with the same tier GPU die as used on the previous gens for 80-class cards.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Specifications\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 is reportedly going to feature 10,752 Cuda Cores and 84 SMs, which is an increase of about 10.5% compared to the 9,728 Cuda Cores and 76 SMs present on the RTX 4080. NVIDIA is expected to retain the same memory size on the RTX 5080 but with a newer GDDR7 memory type compared to GDDR6X on the RTX 4080.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU will bring 16 GB of VRAM on a 256-bit bus and is expected to offer the fastest GDDR7 memory speed of up to 32 Gbps, bringing in about 1 TB/s of total memory bandwidth. A 1024 GB/s bandwidth will even put it ahead of the RTX 4090 GPU which offers 1007 GB/s of bandwidth.\n\nGDDR Graphics Memory Evolution:\n\n\n\n GRAPHICS MEMORYGDDR7GDDR6XGDDR6GDDR5X\n\n\n\n\nWorkloadGaming / AIGaming / AIGaming / AIGaming\n\n\nPlatform (Example)GeForce RTX 5090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 Ti\n\n\nDie Capacity (Gb)16-648-328-328-16\n\n\n Number of Placements12?121212\n\n\nGb/s/pin\t28-42.519-2414-1611.4\n\n\nGB/s/placement\t128-14476-9656-6445\n\n\nGB/s/system1536-1728 912-1152672-768547\n\n\nConfiguration (Example)384 IO (12pcs x 32 IO package)?384 IO (12pcs x 32 IO package)384 IO (12pcs x 32 IO package)384 IO (12pcs x 32 IO package)\n\n\nFrame Buffer of Typical System\t24 GB (16 Gb) \n36 GB (24 Gb)24 GB12GB12GB\n\n\nModule Package266 (BGA)180 (BGA)180 (BGA)190 (BGA)\n\n\nAverage Device Power (pJ/bit)TBD7.257.5 8.0\n\n\nTypical IO ChannelPCB (P2P SM)PCB (P2P SM)PCB (P2P SM)PCB (P2P SM)\n\n\n\n\nThe memory speeds are going to be even faster than what the RTX 5090 will bring to the table and is roughly 43% higher bandwidth than the RTX 4080 comes with. There was also a rumor recently, which suggests that the 5080 will have another edition bringing a 24 GB variant, which means 3 GB per module. However, the launch variant will only ship with 16 GB VRAM.\nThat said, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 is also going to bring a higher TBP than the RTX 4080 if 400W, which is 80W higher than the RTX 4080 (320W). The TBP is simply the peak power that the board can utilize and is not to be compared with actual power consumption which when looking at the RTX 40 GPUs has been lower than the actual wattage rating. The RTX 5080 will feature a single 12V-2x6 connector for its power requirements as the connector can deliver up to 600W.\n\n\n\nSpecificationsGeForce RTX 5080GeForce RTX 4080\n\n\n\n\nArchitectureBlackwellAda Lovelace\n\n\nProcess Node4NP(TSMC's 5nm)4N(TSMC's 5nm)\n\n\nGPUGB203-400-A1AD103-300-A1\n\n\nCuda Cores107529728\n\n\nSMTBD76\n\n\nTensor CoresTBD304\n\n\nRT CoresTBD76\n\n\nClock Speed(Base/Boost)TBD2205/2505 MHz\n\n\nVRAM Size and Type16 GB/24 GB GDDR716 GB GDDR6X\n\n\nMemory Speed32 Gbps22.4 Gbps\n\n\nMemory Bus Width256-bit256-bit\n\n\nMemory Bandwidth1024 GB/s716.8 GB/s\n\n\nTBP400W320W\n\n\nPower Connector1x 12V-2x61x 12VHPWR\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5080 -\u00a0 Expected Performance\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 will replace the RTX 4080 and recent rumors suggest that it will offer 10% better performance than the RTX 4090. The RTX 5080 might be better at just Ray Tracing than RTX 4090 as going by the specifications, the RTX 4090 seems to have an edge over the 5080.\nNonetheless, several theories could prove both scenarios and we will need some concrete data to say whether the RTX 5080 is superior to RTX 4090 or not. Compared to the RTX 4080, it's almost guaranteed that the 5080 will be much faster due to an upgrade in specs, which means we can see 60+ fps at 4K resolution in most titles. We should also remember that the RTX 4080 was 20-25% faster than the RTX 3090 and we can expect similar if not better gains from the RTX 5080.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 & 4080 SUPER have been delivering some solid performance in modern titles in both rasterization and ray tracing and we can expect the RTX 5080 to continue its domination at higher resolution, particularly at 4K since it brings a higher memory bandwidth.\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Pricing\nThere aren't any reliable leaks about the RTX 5080 GPU price. Similarly, there isn't any reliable info about the pricing of any other RTX 50 series GPUs, including RTX 5090 and RTX 5070. It's always unwise to talk about pricing before launch since it can change super late and sometimes even after the launch (although that's very rare).\nThe RTX 4080 SUPER was launched at $1000 which was a slight cut versus the original model that retailed for $1199 US. Keeping that in mind, we are most likely looking at a price tag of around $1000 US but it would be great if we can get it anywhere below that since you'll be getting the performance of a 4090-class graphics card which currently retails for around $2000 US at half the price.\nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Segment/Tier Prices\n\n\n\nGraphics Segment20252023-20242022-20232021-20222020-20212019-20202018-20192017-2018\n\n\n\n\nTitan TierGeForce RTX 5090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 4090GeForce RTX 3090 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3090GeForce RTX 3090Titan RTX (Turing)Titan V (Volta)Titan Xp (Pascal)\n\n\nPrice$1999 US$1599 US$1599 US$1999 US\n$1499 US$1499 US$2499 US$2999 US$1199 US\n\n\nUltra Enthusiast TierGeForce RTX 5080GeForce RTX 4080 SUPERGeForce RTX 4080GeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 3080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce RTX 2080 TiGeForce GTX 1080 Ti\n\n\nPrice$999 US$999 US$1199 US$1199 US$1199 US$999 US$999 US$699 US\n\n\nEnthusiast TierGeForce RTX 5070 TiGeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPERGeForce RTX 4070 TiGeForce RTX 3080 12 GBGeForce RTX 3080 10 GBGeForce RTX 2080 SUPERGeForce RTX 2080GeForce GTX 1080\n\n\nPrice$749 US$799 US$799 US$799 US$699 US$699 US$699 US$549 US\n\n\nHigh-End TierGeForce RTX 5070GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 4070GeForce RTX 4070\nGeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16 GBGeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 3070 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3070GeForce RTX 2070 SUPERGeForce RTX 2070GeForce GTX 1070\n\n\nPrice$549 US$599\n$549$599 US\n$499 US$599\n$499$599\n$499$499 US$499 US$379 US\n\n\nMainstream TierGeForce RTX 5060 TiGeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 4060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 4060GeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 3060 Ti\nGeForce RTX 3060 12 GBGeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\nGeForce RTX 2060\nGeForce GTX 1660 Ti\nGeForce GTX 1660 SUPER\nGeForce GTX 1660GeForce GTX 1060GeForce GTX 1060\n\n\nPriceTBD$449\n$299$399 US\n$299 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$329 US$399 US\n$349 US\n$279 US\n$229 US\n$219 US$249 US$249 US\n\n\nEntry TierGeForce RTX 5060RTX 3050 8 GB\nRTX 3050 6 GBRTX 3050RTX 3050GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1650 SUPER\nGTX 1650GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050GTX 1050 Ti\nGTX 1050\n\n\nPriceTBD$229\n$179$249 US$249 US$159 US\n$149 US$159 US\n$149 US$139 US\n$109 US$139 US\n$109 US\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5080 - Release Date & Availability\nNVIDIA finalized the design of the RTX 5080 along with the RTX 5090 in September 2024 but some reliable reports suggest that the RTX 5080 won't be launched this year. NVIDIA is expected to reveal the RTX 5080 along with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5070 in early 2025, most likely at CES, which will be held in January.\n\n\n\nWhich NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 GPU are you looking forward to the most?\n\n\n RTX 5090\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 5080\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 5070\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 5060\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n RTX 5050\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n None\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nView ResultsPoll Options are limited because JavaScript is disabled in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts mentioned\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080\nUSD 999.99\nBuy from Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n96\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nValve\u2019s Promise Comes True With SteamOS 3.7.0 Preview: Offers Support To Non-Steam Deck Handhelds And Plasma 6 For Linux Desktop-Like Experience\n\n\n\n65\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n55\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Reportedly Had Almost 400,000 Units Shipped to North America in January, Making Early Summer Release Date Quite Likely\n\n\n\n37\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1478\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1282\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1139\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.  The 8 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.3% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 5% below. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 6.1% since the latest earnings results. Best Q3: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets. Nvidia reported revenues of $35.08 billion, up 93.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 5.9%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income estimates. \u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.   Nvidia Total Revenue   Nvidia pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street\u2019s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts\u2019 consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 1% since reporting and currently trades at $144.42. Read why we think that Nvidia is one of the best processors and graphics chips stocks, our full report is free.

Market UpdateAs a result of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Budget-builds Official)\n\n\n\n\nI didn't have coming across an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4010 graphics card ahead of the RTX 50-series launch on my bingo card. Yet, here I am about to show you all a GPU that shouldn't exist, one that's extremely low power while packing ray tracing abilities. The best part is apparently only comes in at between $80 and $100, which is remarkable for a card that can keep up with your old PS4.As showcased in a video by one of my favorite YouTubers, Budget-builds official, the \"RTX 4010\" is naturally not an official best graphics card contender. Instead, it's a seemingly modified version of Nvidia's A400 workstation GPU armed with 4GB GDDR6 VRAM and a GA107 chip. It's worth noting that the green team's cheap card can't normally be used for gaming, but that's where things get interesting with this unofficial newcomer.After taking a chance on the RTX 4010 via a Chinese seller for science, Budget-Builds reveals that the modified card actually uses RTX 4090 D drivers to make gaming possible. Both GeForce Experience and applications like GPU-Z recognize it as such, meaning there's nothing stopping you from putting its Ampere GPU to work in games.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI've been using the RTX 5070 to play a bunch of games early, and it might be the console killing GPU I've been waiting for\n\n\n\n\nTired of seeing RTX 5070 Ti out of stock signs? I'd consider this 4K GPU instead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Ordered an NVIDIA RTX4010 from China... - YouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nAs for what the \"RTX 4010\" can actually do for your cheap gaming PC, well, I'm taken back by how capable a GPU like this actually is. Before you get excited about its apparent ray-tracing abilities, just know that they're naturally a bit redundant in a card with these specs. However, performance to me feels pretty much on par with last-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One, which is bananas since this 50W card can power itself solely off your motherboard.Some highlights from Budget-builds' benchmarking bonanza include Red Dead Redemption 2 running at 33fps with 1080p ultra settings enabled, Baldur's Gate 3 managing a 44fps average set at high, and GTA Online maintaining 60fps. That latter result is pretty fantastic since Rockstar's sandbox can normally be taxing when it comes to online multiplayer, but the card is more than up to providing a low-spec PC experience.The real novelty, however, is the RTX 4010 can run Crysis at 80fps with high settings enabled. Yes, that old meme holds less meaning in a world with tricky-to-run outings like Cyberpunk 2077, but it feels like only yesterday that ridiculous rigs were required to run the shooter. Put it this way - if I traveled back in time with both an RTX 4090 and this tiny cheap card in hand and showed a bunch of LAN goers their abilities, I think they'd be more surprised by the latter.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Budget-builds Official)(Image credit: Budget-builds Official)(Image credit: Budget-builds Official)Circling back to ray tracing, and getting Portal RTX up and running did mean dropping way back to 480p low settings. Hardly ideal, but the card hasn't got access to DLSS upscaling, meaning it isn't quite on a level footing with other contemporary cards here. Plus, the RT cores really only exist for non-gaming purposes here, so you're going to still want to look at the RTX 4060 if you want affordable fancy lighting.Sign up to the GamesRadar+ NewsletterWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and moreContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.As for whether you should actually buy an RTX 4010? Every fiber of my being wants to say yes, but this is a modified card from China that comes without a warranty. Therefore, unless you are an enthusiast who doesn't care about consumer risks, or just loves experimenting with smaller builds, I'd perhaps stick to official cards for now. What I will say is that this unofficial budget GPU has me craving more true entry-level options in the generation ahead.Yes, I'm excited for the RTX 5090 and the monstrous abilities it'll likely provide, but if Nvidia can cook up an official version of this \"RTX 4010\" with a Lovelace chip, I'll be ecstatic.Today's best graphics card dealsNvidia RTX 4060 \u00a3275.59ViewSee all pricesAMD Radeon RX 7700 XT \u00a3383.82ViewSee all pricesNvidia RTX 4070 \u00a3665.99ViewSee all pricesAMD Radeon RX 7800 XT \u00a3525ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesSearching for more upgrades?

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I kickstarted my relationship with technology by jamming a Hot Wheels double-decker bus into my parent\u2019s VCR, but we all have to start somewhere. I even somehow managed to become a walking, talking buyer\u2019s guide at my teenage supermarket job, which helped me accept my career fate. So, rather than try to realise my musician dreams, or see out my University degree, I started running my own retro pop culture site and writing about video games and tech for the likes of TechRadar, The Daily Star, and the BBC before eventually ending up with a job covering graphics card shenanigans at PCGamesN. Now, I\u2019m your friendly neighbourhood Hardware Editor at GamesRadar, and it\u2019s my job to make sure you can kick butt in all your favourite games using the best gaming hardware, whether you\u2019re a sucker for handhelds like the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch or a hardcore gaming PC enthusiast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been using the RTX 5070 to play a bunch of games early, and it might be the console killing GPU I've been waiting for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTired of seeing RTX 5070 Ti out of stock signs?

These processors offer 50 percent higher memory bandwidth and up to four times throughput between CPU and GPU with PCIe Gen5, which help boost performance for machine learning (ML) training and inference workloads.\nP5en, with up to 3200 Gbps of third generation of Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFAv3) using Nitro v5, shows up to 35% improvement in latency compared to P5 that uses the previous generation of EFA and Nitro. This helps improve collective communications performance for distributed training workloads such as deep learning, generative AI, real-time data processing, and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.\nHere are the specs for P5en instances:\n\n\n\nInstance size\nvCPUs\nMemory (GiB)\nGPUs (H200)\nNetwork bandwidth (Gbps)\nGPU Peer to peer (GB/s)\nInstance storage (TB)\nEBS bandwidth (Gbps)\n\n\np5en.48xlarge\n192\n2048\n8\n3200 EFA\n900 NVSwitch\n8 x 3.84 NVMe SSD\n100\n\n\n\nOn September 9, we introduced Amazon EC2 P5e instances, powered by 8 NVIDIA H200 GPUs with 1128 GB of high bandwidth GPU memory, 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, 2 TiB of system memory, and 30 TB of local NVMe storage. These instances provide up to 3,200 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth with EFAv2 and support GPUDirect RDMA, enabling lower latency and efficient scale-out performance by bypassing the CPU for internode communication.\nWith P5en instances, you can increase the overall efficiency in a wide range of GPU-accelerated applications by further reducing the inference and network latency. P5en instances increases local storage performance by up to two times and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) bandwidth by up to 25 percent compared with P5 instances, which will further improve inference latency performance for those of you who are using local storage for caching model weights.\nThe transfer of data between CPUs and GPUs can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets or workloads that require frequent data exchanges. With PCIe Gen 5 providing up to four times bandwidth between CPU and GPU compared with P5 and P5e instances, you can further improve latency for model training, fine-tuning, and running inference for complex large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (FMs), and memory-intensive HPC applications such as simulations, pharmaceutical discovery, weather forecasting, and financial modeling.\nGetting started with Amazon EC2 P5en instances You can use EC2 P5en instances available in the US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) AWS Regions through EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, On Demand, and Savings Plan purchase options.\nI want to introduce how to use P5en instances with Capacity Reservation as an option. To reserve your EC2 Capacity Blocks, choose Capacity Reservations on the Amazon EC2 console in the US East (Ohio) AWS Region.\nSelect Purchase Capacity Blocks for ML and then choose your total capacity and specify how long you need the EC2 Capacity Block for p5en.48xlarge instances. The total number of days that you can reserve EC2 Capacity Blocks is 1\u201314, 21, or 28 days. EC2 Capacity Blocks can be purchased up to 8 weeks in advance.\n\nWhen you select Find Capacity Blocks, AWS returns the lowest-priced offering available that meets your specifications in the date range you have specified. After reviewing EC2 Capacity Blocks details, tags, and total price information, choose Purchase.\nNow, your EC2 Capacity Block will be scheduled successfully. The total price of an EC2 Capacity Block is charged up front, and the price does not change after purchase. The payment will be billed to your account within 12 hours after you purchase the EC2 Capacity Blocks. To learn more, visit Capacity Blocks for ML in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.\nTo run instances within your purchased Capacity Block, you can use AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS SDKs.\nHere is a sample AWS CLI command to run 16 P5en instances to maximize EFAv3 benefits. This configuration provides up to 3200 Gbps of EFA networking bandwidth and up to 800 Gbps of IP networking bandwidth with four private IP address:\n$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc12345 \\\n  --instance-type p5en.48xlarge \\\n  --count 16 \\\n  --key-name MyKeyPair \\\n  --instance-market-options MarketType='capacity-block' \\\n  --capacity-reservation-specification CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=cr-a1234567}\n--network-interfaces \"NetworkCardIndex=0,DeviceIndex=0,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=1,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=2,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=3,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=4,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=5,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=6,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=7,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=8,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=9,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=10,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=11,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=12,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=13,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=14,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n\"NetworkCardIndex=15,DeviceIndex=1,Groups=security_group_id,SubnetId=subnet_id,InterfaceType=efa-only\" \\\n...\n\nWhen launching P5en instances, you can use AWS Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMI) to support EC2 P5en instances. DLAMI provides ML practitioners and researchers with the infrastructure and tools to quickly build scalable, secure, distributed ML applications in preconfigured environments.\nYou can run containerized ML applications on P5en instances with AWS Deep Learning Containers using libraries for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).\nFor fast access to large datasets, you can use up to 30 TB of local NVMe SSD storage or virtually unlimited cost-effective storage with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can also use Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems in P5en instances so you can access data at the hundreds of GB/s of throughput and millions of input/output operations per second (IOPS) required for large-scale deep learning and HPC workloads.\nNow available Amazon EC2 P5en instances are available today in the US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) AWS Regions and US East (Atlanta) Local Zone us-east-1-atl-2a through EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, On Demand, and Savings Plan purchase options. For more information, visit the Amazon EC2 pricing page.\nGive Amazon EC2 P5en instances a try in the Amazon EC2 console. To learn more, see Amazon EC2 P5 instance page and send feedback to AWS re:Post for EC2 or through your usual AWS Support contacts.\n\u2014 Channy\nUpdate on Dec 11, 2024 \u2013 Corrected AWS CLI command to run P5en instances. Update on Jan 9, 2025 \u2013 Fixed errata to \u201ccompared with P5 and P5e instances\u201d and \u201cwith four private IP address\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Channy Yun (\uc724\uc11d\ucc2c) \nChanny is a Principal Developer Advocate for AWS cloud.

Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool   December 19, 2024 6 min read        1   In This Article:  NVDA          AVGO          GOOG            When it came to artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in 2024, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reigned supreme. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) will be looking to challenge the chipmaker in 2025. Both stocks have had strong runs in 2024, with Nvidia's stock up over 170% year to date as of this writing and Broadcom up around 107%. Let's consider which semiconductor stock looks like the better buy heading into 2025. AI infrastructure growth Since the start of the AI boom, Nvidia has been the biggest winner. As the maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) the company's chips became the backbone of AI infrastructure. Training large language models (LLMs) and running AI inference take a lot of computing power, and GPUs have proven to be the best chips for these tasks as they are able to perform many calculations at the same time in what is called parallel processing.  Nvidia, meanwhile, became the market leader in GPUs due to its CUDA software platform. The company originally developed the free software to allow developers to program its chips for tasks beyond speeding up the graphics rendering in things like video games, the job for which they were initially created, in order to sell more chips. As a result, CUDA became the program on which developers learned to train GPUs, which is what has helped create the large moat the company sees today. It currently has about a 90% market share in GPUs as a result. The combination of its powerful GPUs and wide moat due to CUDA led the company to see astronomical growth as large tech companies race to develop more powerful AI models. Through the first nine months of its fiscal 2025 ending in January 2025, Nvidia's revenue surged 135% to $91.2 billion, while last quarter its revenue soared 94% to $35.1 billion. With AI models needing exponentially more computing power as they become more advanced, Nvidia's future growth prospects also look promising. In fact, recent iterations of Alphabet's Llama AI model and xAI's Grok model are being trained using up to 10 times as many GPUs as their predecessors. At the same time, Nvidia's hyperscale customers (those that own huge data centers) have indicated they plan to increase their spending on AI infrastructure next year as they see AI as a generational opportunity. For their part, analysts are projecting the company will grow its revenue by just over 50% next year.   Image source: Getty Images.   While Nvidia is dominating the AI chip space, Broadcom is making inroads by helping customers develop custom AI chips. Its application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, are designed specifically for a customer's precise needs and can help with improved performance and\u00a0more efficient power consumption.   Story Continues Alphabet was the first company to use Broadcom's technology and expertise to develop its own custom AI chip. The result is a tensor-processing unit (TPU) called Trillium designed specifically to work within Google's TensorFlow (a software library for AI and machine learning). Alphabet said these TPUs have several features, such as a matrix multiply unit (MXU) and proprietary interconnect topology, that differentiate them from mass-merchant GPUs and make them ideal for accelerating AI training and inference.While there were some reports that Alphabet was looking to just go on its own without Broadcom's help, Broadcom won the design contract for the next generation of Alphabet's TPUs. Meanwhile, the company gained four more custom AI chip customers. Meta Platforms and TikTok owner ByteDance are widely believed to be the company's established customers, while OpenAI and more recently Apple are thought to be recent customer wins.On its latest earnings call, Broadcom said its three largest custom AI chip customers had an addressable market of between $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone and that they were planning on deploying 1 million of its custom AI chips by 2027. Meanwhile, it said its two newer AI chip customers could add to that total. As a reference, it took Alphabet 15 months to have its custom TPUs designed and deployed within its data centers.While the AI opportunity for Broadcom is large, there is a big difference between an addressable market and expected revenue. The company is also involved in a lot of semiconductor and software businesses outside of AI, which aren't growing as quickly. The company grew organic revenue just 11% last quarter when excluding its acquisition of VMware, and analysts are currently looking for the company to increase its revenue by 18% this fiscal year, ending Oct. 31, 2025, and 14% the year after.Valuation and verdictNvidia currently trades at a cheaper valuation than Broadcom with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30 compared to over 33 for Broadcom. Meanwhile, Nvidia is currently growing its revenue much faster, which is expected to continue in 2025. In addition, Nvidia holds about $30 billion in net cash, while Broadcom has $48.3 billion in net debt.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. Broadcom created a lot of hype with its comments on its AI addressable market, which have powered its stock price in December. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock struggled to close out the year. But while Broadcom grabbed the momentum, Nvidia is now the cheaper stock and it's still expected to grow its revenue much more quickly in the near term.Broadcom management has certainly put some doubt in investors' minds when it comes to who will be the big AI chip winner in the coming years. But Broadcom's gains won't necessarily come at Nvidia's expense. GPUs still have more versatility than custom chips and are still considered the standard. However, companies also want an option other than Nvidia to make sure it doesn't become too powerful.I think both stocks have the potential to be winners in 2025, but I prefer Nvidia at this point given its current superior growth and cheaper valuation.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In December 2023, I discussed the reasons shares of Nvidia could double in 2024. These included the robust demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI model training and inference, and the steps being taken by its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), to ramp up supply. In this article, I will look at Nvidia's catalysts for 2025 and check why this high-flying chipmaker could double in value once again in the new year. Solid demand and improving supply are going to be tailwinds The company's latest generation of GPUs built on its Blackwell architecture will be the biggest growth driver in 2025. Management said on its November earnings conference call that these chips are in full production and are being shipped to customers. Blackwell-related revenue for the current quarter should exceed expectations thanks to a strengthening supply chain. The company also said that the demand is well above supply. This bodes well for Nvidia going into the new year since TSMC says it will increase the production capacity of advanced AI chips significantly in 2025.  Market researcher IDC projects that TSMC is on track to double its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity to 660,000 wafers to fulfill demand from Nvidia and other AI chipmakers. Nvidia reportedly cornered 60% of TSMC's CoWoS capacity for 2025, so it should be able to substantially increase the output of its Blackwell processors. In October 2024, Morgan Stanley analysts said that Blackwell GPUs are sold out for the next 12 months (according to a report on the website Tom's Hardware). That waiting time is likely to come down based on TSMC's outlook, allowing Nvidia to satisfy more orders and deliver a big bump in data center revenue. The company is expected to ship between 60,000 to 70,000 Blackwell B200 server systems in 2025, according to Morgan Stanley. Each system is expected to cost between $2 million and $3 million. That suggests its Blackwell systems could help generate somewhere between $120 billion to $210 billion next year, or $165 billion at the midpoint.  Analysts expect Nvidia to hit $195 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026 (which will coincide with 11 months of calendar 2025), an increase of 51% from the current fiscal year's projected revenue of $129 billion. However, the potential revenue from Blackwell sales and the fact that Nvidia will continue to sell its previous-generation Hopper chips indicate that it could easily exceed Wall Street's growth expectations, and that could set the stage for the stock to double.   Story Continues Why this high-flying AI stock may double in 2025Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to increase 50% in the next fiscal year to an average of $4.43 per share, higher than the 12% growth that the S&P 500 index is expected to deliver. Investors should note that this average estimate for Nvidia has headed significantly higher in the past three months, rising from $3.99 per share 90 days ago and $4.03 per share 60 days ago. The high earnings estimate from the various analysts covering Nvidia for next year stands at $6.11.The potential jump in Nvidia's revenue and its impressive pricing power in the AI chip market could allow it to deliver stronger growth than analysts' expectations in 2025. Assuming Nvidia manages to clock $5 per share in earnings next year and trades at 55 times earnings at that time (in line with its trailing earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $275. That would be nearly double the current level.The reason I anticipate Nvidia will maintain its rich valuation after a year is because the market could reward it with a premium multiple thanks to the company's potential of outpacing the S&P 500's earnings growth by a significant margin. As such, investors would do well to continue holding Nvidia in their portfolios -- this AI stock's impressive growth could continue in the new year.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia's AI accelerators have redefined the company and the overall semiconductor industry as customers scramble to capitalize on the power of AI. In contrast, AMD has become known for catching up to its competitors technically, and it is again attempting to do so in the AI accelerator market.  Start Your Mornings Smarter!\u00a0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\u00a0Sign Up For Free \u00bb The future could potentially bode well for both companies. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the global AI chip industry of 29% through 2030. Such growth rates mean a rising tide should lift all major industry players. Nonetheless, the prospects for investors are less clear since both stocks have benefited from considerable AI-driven growth. Still, given where both stocks currently stand, one is likely to fare better for the foreseeable future. The Nvidia AI revolution Nvidia stock has surged since investors discovered that Nvidia's AI accelerators powered ChatGPT's AI platform. This discovery ignited unprecedented demand for its accelerators, so much so that Nvidia could not produce enough of these chips. Consequently, the data center segment that designs these chips has become Nvidia's dominant focus. To stay ahead of competitors, Nvidia continues to innovate and has just begun releasing its latest Blackwell accelerators. They are rumored to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, with the Blackwell superchip rising to as much as $70,000, according to numerous sources. Despite such prices, Nvidia claims between 70% and 95% of the AI accelerator market, according to Mizuho Securities' estimates.  Thus, it will likely not surprise investors that Nvidia reported $91 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 27), a 135% yearly increase. Nvidia's data center segment, which was not even Nvidia's largest revenue source three years ago, accounted for $80 billion, or 87% of overall revenue. The growth has boosted net income even more profoundly, as the $51 billion profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 rose 190%. Unfortunately for investors, Nvidia's stock likely prices in this growth -- and then some. That is not because of the P/E ratio, which is 55. However, even with the growth, investors may hesitate amid Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 31. That is a high level even for a fast-growing stock, particularly with revenue growth in fiscal 2026 expected to slow to 51%. Investors tend to punish stocks whose revenue growth slows, a factor that could bode poorly for Nvidia's stock.   Story Continues How AMD stands out in AIIndeed, Nvidia's struggles could motivate investors to look at its emerging competitor, AMD. AMD began selling its MI300 series of accelerators in response to Nvidia's dominance of that market. Also, amid the need to innovate, it released the MI325X accelerators in October to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell line.It is unclear how much business AMD can draw away from Nvidia. Nonetheless, its price, widely reported to be just under $15,000, is far below the cost of Blackwell. Given the aforementioned CAGR for AI accelerators and Nvidia's struggles to meet demand, AMD may have a competitive niche despite failing to match Nvidia.However, AMD also lags behind Nvidia in terms of financial performance. In the first nine months of 2024, its $18 billion in revenue grew by only 10% compared to the same period in 2023.Moreover, the data center segment is only 48% of revenue. Even though that segment increased its revenue by 107% over the previous year, it continues to lag behind Nvidia. Still, it may also point to more growth potential, assuming data center revenue also becomes the dominant revenue source for AMD.AMD is also much less profitable, though its $1.2 billion net income for the first three quarters of 2024 rose more than sixfold annually. Amid that profit recovery, its 128 P/E ratio likely does not represent its valuation well.Nonetheless, the 9.6 P/S ratio makes it a relative bargain compared to Nvidia, and with revenue growth for 2025 forecast to reach 27%, overall growth is set to accelerate.Nvidia or AMD?AMD stock looks like the better buy under current conditions. Admittedly, Nvidia holds a dominant share of the market, and even if both revenue forecasts hold, Nvidia's estimated 51% revenue growth is significantly faster than the 27% forecast for AMD.However, stocks tend to respond poorly to slowing revenue growth. Even though 51% revenue growth is impressive, it is enough of a slowdown for investors to question Nvidia's 31 P/S ratio.In contrast, AMD's revenue growth should ramp as AI accelerators claim a larger share of AMD's revenue base. With revenue growth rates advancing and the P/S ratio under 10, it is likely the better buy under current conditions.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

And in 2024, there was no better place to be a part of creating those breakthroughs than NVIDIA Research.\nNVIDIA Research is comprised of hundreds of extremely bright people pushing the frontiers of knowledge, not just in AI, but across many areas of technology.\nIn the past year, NVIDIA Research laid the groundwork for future improvements in GPU performance with major research discoveries in circuits, memory architecture and sparse arithmetic. The team\u2019s invention of novel graphics techniques continues to raise the bar for real-time rendering. And we developed new methods for improving the efficiency of AI \u2014 requiring less energy, taking fewer GPU cycles and delivering even better results.\nBut the most exciting developments of the year have been in generative AI.\nWe\u2019re now able to generate, not just images and text, but 3D models, music and sounds. We\u2019re also developing better control over what is generated: to generate realistic humanoid motion and to generate sequences of images with consistent subjects.\nThe application of generative AI to science has resulted in high-resolution weather forecasts that are more accurate than conventional numerical weather models. AI models have given us the ability to accurately predict how blood glucose levels respond to different foods. Embodied generative AI is being used to develop autonomous vehicles and robots.\nAnd that was just this year. What follows is a deeper dive into some of NVIDIA Research\u2019s greatest generative AI work in 2024. Of course, we continue to develop new models and methods for AI, and expect even more exciting results next year.\nConsiStory: AI-Generated Images With Main Character Energy\nConsiStory, a collaboration between researchers at NVIDIA and Tel Aviv University, makes it easier to generate multiple images with a consistent main character \u2014 an essential capability for storytelling use cases such as illustrating a comic strip or developing a storyboard.\nThe researchers\u2019 approach introduced a technique called subject-driven shared attention, which reduces the time it takes to generate consistent imagery from 13 minutes to around 30 seconds.\nRead the ConsiStory paper.\nConsiStory is capable of generating a series of images featuring the same character.\nEdify 3D: Generative AI Enters a New Dimension\nNVIDIA Edify 3D is a foundation model that enables developers and content creators to quickly generate 3D objects that can be used to prototype ideas and populate virtual worlds.\nEdify 3D helps creators quickly ideate, lay out and conceptualize immersive environments with AI-generated assets. Novice and experienced content creators can use text and image prompts to harness the model, which is now part of the NVIDIA Edify multimodal architecture for developing visual generative AI.\nRead the Edify 3D paper and watch the video on YouTube.\nFugatto: Flexible AI Sound Machine for Music, Voices and More\nA team of NVIDIA researchers recently unveiled Fugatto, a foundational generative AI model that can create or transform any mix of music, voices and sounds based on text or audio prompts.\nThe model can, for example, create music snippets based on text prompts, add or remove instruments from existing songs, modify the accent or emotion in a voice recording, or generate completely novel sounds. It could be used by music producers, ad agencies, video game developers or creators of language learning tools.\nRead the Fugatto paper.\n\nGluFormer: AI Predicts Blood Sugar Levels Four Years Out\nResearchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv-based startup Pheno.AI and NVIDIA led the development of GluFormer, an AI model that can predict an individual\u2019s future glucose levels and other health metrics based on past glucose monitoring data.\nThe researchers showed that, after adding dietary intake data into the model, GluFormer can also predict how a person\u2019s glucose levels will respond to specific foods and dietary changes, enabling precision nutrition. The research team validated GluFormer across 15 other datasets and found it generalizes well to predict health outcomes for other groups, including those with prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and obesity.\nRead the GluFormer paper.\nLATTE3D: Enabling Near-Instant Generation, From Text to 3D Shape\u00a0\nAnother 3D generator released by NVIDIA Research this year is LATTE3D, which converts text prompts into 3D representations within a second \u2014 like a speedy, virtual 3D printer. Crafted in a popular format used for standard rendering applications, the generated shapes can be easily served up in virtual environments for developing video games, ad campaigns, design projects or virtual training grounds for robotics.\nRead the LATTE3D paper.\n\nMaskedMimic: Reconstructing Realistic Movement for Humanoid Robots\nTo advance the development of humanoid robots, NVIDIA researchers introduced MaskedMimic, an AI framework that applies inpainting \u2014 the process of reconstructing complete data from an incomplete, or masked, view \u2014 to descriptions of motion.\nGiven partial information, such as a text description of movement, or head and hand position data from a virtual reality headset, MaskedMimic can fill in the blanks to infer full-body motion. It\u2019s become part of NVIDIA Project GR00T, a research initiative to accelerate humanoid robot development.\nRead the MaskedMimic paper.\n\nStormCast: Boosting Weather Prediction, Climate Simulation\u00a0\nIn the field of climate science, NVIDIA Research announced StormCast, a generative AI model for emulating atmospheric dynamics. While other machine learning models trained on global data have a spatial resolution of about 30 kilometers and a temporal resolution of six hours, StormCast achieves a 3-kilometer, hourly scale.\nThe researchers trained StormCast on approximately three-and-a-half years of NOAA climate data from the central U.S. When applied with precipitation radars, StormCast offers forecasts with lead times of up to six hours that are up to 10% more accurate than the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s state-of-the-art 3-kilometer regional weather prediction model.\nRead the StormCast paper, written in collaboration with researchers from Lawrence Berkeley\u00a0National Laboratory and the University of Washington.\nNVIDIA Research Sets Records in AI, Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics\nThrough 2024, models that originated in NVIDIA Research set records across benchmarks for AI training and inference, route optimization, autonomous driving and more.\nNVIDIA cuOpt, an optimization AI microservice used for logistics improvements, has 23 world-record benchmarks. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform demonstrated world-class performance on MLPerf industry benchmarks for AI training and inference.\nIn the field of autonomous vehicles, Hydra-MDP, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework by NVIDIA Research, achieved first place on the End-To-End Driving at Scale track of the Autonomous Grand Challenge at CVPR 2024.\nIn robotics, FoundationPose, a unified foundation model for 6D object pose estimation and tracking, obtained first place on the BOP leaderboard for model-based pose estimation of unseen objects.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Research, which has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Antony reviews and covers the latest PC hardware and laptop technologyFollow AuthorDec 31, 2024, 07:34am ESTShareSaveCommentThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series graphics cards such as the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are expected to be announced in January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which runs Jan 7th-11th and, while performance leaks and concrete specification data are still somewhat scarce, there's still plenty of reliable information about the products that will replace the RTX 4000 and 4000 Super series. Here's what we know so far.\n\nEverything we know about Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 specifications\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series hasn't been officially announced, but specifications have leaked from both partner card manufacturers as well as regular and well-regarded leakers. All RTX 5000 cards will be PCIe 5.0 compatible and use GDDR7 VRAM, but capacity is always a hot topic and here the RTX 5090 gets an 8GB bump to 32GB compared to 24GB for the RTX 4090, but the RTX 5080 stays the same at 16GB - the same as the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super.\n\nNvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics cardAntony Leather\nThe RTX 5070 Ti will maintain the same 16GB as the RTX 4070 Ti Super, but this is a 4GB bump compared to the 4070 Ti and 4070. The RTX 5070 will apparently come with 12GB - the same as the RTX 4070, while the RTX 5060 Ti offers the same options of 16GB and 8GB as the RTX 4060 Ti. At the bottom of the stack, the RTX 5060 maintains the same 8GB as the RTX 4060, which has resulted in some criticism given some current games make use of more than this. We'll have to wait and see what the final specifications are.\n\nMORE FOR YOULying In Wait On The Ground, Russia\u2019s Best Attack Drones Devastate Ukrainian ConvoysNYT \u2018Strands\u2019 Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Monday, March 17th\u2018NYT Mini\u2019 Clues And Answers For Monday, March 17\nForbesNvidia RTX 4070 Super Vs RX 7800 XT: What\u2019s The Best Graphics Card?By Antony Leather\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 pricing\nVery little information has been revealed on the pricing of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series, but what has been rumored and discussed so far may be an indicator of a nasty surprise. Some websites reported pricing for the RTX 5090 to be between $2,000 and $2,500, the RTX 5080 from $1,200 to $1,500 and the RTX 5070 from $599 to $700. These are all significant increases over their predecessors and the fact that AMD has stated it will not be competing with Nvidia's top-end cards may be the reason for this. These figures are only rumors, but this is perhaps going to be the most keenly-awaited bit of news in January.\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 graphics card size\nSeveral images have leaked showing a huge PCB and GPU die with the latter measuring 744mm2 compared to 608mm2 for RTX 4000 GPUs - a significant increase.This could be the RTX 5090 PCBVideocardz\nHowever, several tech commentators have raised concerns about the physical size of the PCB and resulting graphics card including the cooler and if compatibility with current cases might be affected, especially on the small form factor/mini-ITX side.It's already a challenge to fit large modern graphics cards into some cases, but if the RTX 5000 ... [+] series is significantly larger, it could pose problems especially with small form factor systemsAntony Leather\nThe width of the card seems to be the main point of concern, which would definitely impact compatibility, especially as the power connector has also been on the side, further adding to the clearance needed.ForbesNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Review: Best Graphics Card Of 2024?By Antony Leather\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 power connector\nThe 12VPWR 16-pin connector has been in the news quite a bit since it first appeared and never for good reasons. This time it's double trouble as rumors were rife a few months ago claiming that the RTX 5090 had not one but two of them to handle its supposed 600W power draw.Nvidia RTX 4000 GPUs use the 12VPWR 16-pin connector and this seems to be all you'll need to power ... [+] any RTX 5000 card tooAntony Leather\nHowever, more recent information contradicts those rumors, with Videocardz reporting on a comment from Chinese PSU manufacturer Segotep, who stated the RTX 5090 would not use dual power connectors and seemed to imply a standard 600W 12VPWR connector would suffice.ForbesNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super Vs RX 7900 XTX: Which Should You Buy?By Antony Leather\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 availability\nThe naming scheme will remain the same and there are six models launching, although we don't have exact time frames and in the past Nvidia has had a wide window of availability with several months between the initial launch and the final models being released. This was certainly the case with the RTX 4060, which was available many months after the RTX 4090's arrival in October 2022.\nBased on this time scale, with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 being announced in January 2025, reviews for the first launch wave that will likely include the RTX 5090 (or RTX 5080) will follow at the end of January or beginning of February with availability around the same time. With the RTX 4080, it followed a month later, so if this is the case for the RTX 5080, it would be February/March and again based on the previous launch schedule, a month after that the RTX 5070 Ti, followed by the RTX 5070, RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 nearer the middle of 2025.\nI'll be covering the hardware launches in January so follow me here on Forbes using the blue button below, Facebook or YouTube to get the latest news and reviews.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

In brief, it is aware of the issues and is working on fixes, but for now, it recommends a simple workaround. If you are experiencing an Nvidia App performance hit, it suggests that you turn off the 'Game Filters and Photo Mode toggle' in the App's settings.\"We are aware of a reported performance issue related to Game Filters and are actively looking into it,\" an Nvidia rep wrote. \"You can turn off Game Filters from the Nvidia App Settings > Features > Overlay > Game Filters and Photo Mode, and then relaunch your game.\" Nvidia also shared a link to a community post headlined 'Game Filters and Performance in Nvidia App,' repeating this message.That's a pretty simple solution for anyone miffed by their slowed 3D acceleration. Moreover, it is a less drastic solution than uninstalling and rolling back to a previous driver set, for example. Just navigate to the Nvidia App settings pane and hit the single toggle for 'Game Filters and Photo Mode'. After relaunching your game, you should be back in the comfort of the frames per dollar zone you expected when you bought your GeForce.The Nvidia App performance impacts that we measured yesterday were quite significant. In the handful of games we had time to test, to get a grasp of the issue, we saw games dropping average frame rates by up to 15%. That is almost as big a drop as stepping down a graphics card tier in some cases\u2026 Users were therefore understandably irritated by this issue, as it practically made some graphics cards perform as well as one that could be had for $100s cheaper.Nvidia's App rolled out with the 566.14 drivers last month, after an extensive period in beta. It just goes to show that end-users are the best testers, yet things can get awkward when bugs get through the net. Looking through the comments yesterday, quite a lot of you will have dismissed the optional Nvidia App in the same way you swerved the GeForce Experience, and will have felt satisfied to have done so, in this instance. Nevertheless, some will find the Nvidia App install option alongside the driver genuinely useful, particularly its OSD and AV1 120fos recording functions.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (4)\n\n\n\nMark TysonSocial Links NavigationNews EditorMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

I didn't enable the overlay options, but some games showed regressions anyways, and more screen flicker with VRR displays. I almost never roll back drivers. But this one did it.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnnyLucky\n\n\nLast week I upgraded my personal pc that is equipped with an Asus GeForce RTX 3070 Noctua Edition gpu. I saw notices for the new Nvidia App so I downloaded and installed the app. Today, after reading about the suggested fix, I checked the app on my pc. The overlay option was not enabled. I did not disable the overlay option when I installed the app last week. I'm guessing Nvidia must have already disabled the feature.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrussell_john\n\n\nI saw a test of several games and only one was over a 3% difference and the rest were 2-3%\n\nTurn off Game Filters and Photo Mode and problem gone and you can still use the overlay without any performance hit. \n\nSource: Hardware Unboxed\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabufrejoval\n\n\nSurprise, Surprise!\n\nThe app, whose single purpose is to monitor your every move, pinpoint your abilities, failures and successes to... monetize them in one way or another.. actually consumes measurable resources doing so!\n\nSpying is an effort, sometimes a rather significant one. And that shouldn't really be news.\n\nNow, I obviously disabled all those data gathering shenanegans from the onset, but evidently there are games crying out for what used to be Geforce Experience to come and help observing the gamer, because the \"offer\" to record all these significant events keeps popping up, even if I told it to not track me.\n\nThat might just be, because these games want observation support themselves, for their \"pay-to-win\" efforts, or indeed Nvidia is the one who can't keep their fingers out of the cooking jar, even after the PC owner told them so.\n\nAfter it failed to provide any sensible advice when it came to adjusting graphics settings for games, I can only conclude that just like Geforce Experience, which I never let on any system after it asked for a login, the new App should be kept away, because its potential benefits are far outweighed by Nvidia being greedy. In this case your data.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 4 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina will enforce clear flagging of all AI generated content starting from September\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI to fast-track trial to December \u2014 suit aims to stop OpenAI's transition to a for-profit company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Atari parts store still open after 41 years, has spent $100K+ designing new parts \u2014 last original Atari hardware launched 32 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Huawei Kirin X90 chip revealed in state report \u2014 possible server and PC chip set to replace the aging Kunpeng 920 design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoolIT unleashes 4kW single-phase DLC Cold Plate \u2014 Seemingly timed for Nvidia Blackwell Ultra chips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira ransomware can be cracked with sixteen RTX 4090 GPUs in around ten hours \u2014 new counterattack breaks encryption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Credit: Chung-Hao Lee/Shutterstock. \u00b7 Verdict \u00b7 Chung-Hao Lee/Shutterstock.    GlobalData   December 30, 2024 2 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.49%       Nvidia is eyeing robotics as a key growth area amid rising competition in its artificial intelligence (AI) chip business, reported the Financial Times. The US company plans to launch its next generation of compact computer for humanoid robots, Jetson Thor, in early 2025. Speaking to FT, Nvidia vice-president of robotics Deepu Talla said: \u201cThe ChatGPT moment for physical AI and robotics is around the corner.\u201d  Talla added that he believes the robotics market has reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d. Nvidia offers a comprehensive solution, from AI training software to the chips powering robots. Its push into robotics comes as competition intensifies from rival chipmakers such as AMD and cloud giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. These companies are seeking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's semiconductor offerings. Despite this, Nvidia's valuation has surpassed $3tn, driven by strong demand for its AI chips.  In February, Nvidia joined Microsoft and OpenAI in investing in Figure AI, a humanoid robotics company valued at $2.6bn. Robotics remains an emerging niche, with many start-ups facing challenges in scaling, cost reduction, and improving robot accuracy, the publication said. Nvidia's robotics sales currently represent a small portion of its overall revenue. Data centre revenue, which includes Nvidia's AI graphics processing unit chips, accounted for about 88% of its $35.1bn sales in the third quarter.  Talla noted that two technological breakthroughs are propelling the robotics market: generative AI models and training robots using simulated environments. The ability to train robots in virtual environments addresses the \u201cSim-to-Real gap,\u201d ensuring effective real-world operation, he added. Talla said: \u201cIn the past 12 months . . . [this gap] has matured sufficiently that we can now carry out experiments in simulation, combining with generative AI, that we could not do two years ago.\" Talla joined Nvidia in 2013 to work on the \u2018Tegra\u2019 chip for smartphones. The company pivoted to AI and autonomous training, leading to the creation of Jetson, Nvidia's robotic \u2018brain\u2019 modules, in 2014. Nvidia provides tools for robotics development, including software for training models, simulations in its 'Omniverse' platform, and hardware for robots. \"Nvidia targets robotics growth amid rising AI chip competition-report \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.  \u00a0 The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

            "response": "Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang dissects the AI revolution | Goldman Sachs\n\nWhat We DoInsightsOur FirmCareersInvestor RelationsPressroomWorldwideAlumnisearchClient LoginArtificial IntelligenceNvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang dissects the AI revolutionShareshareSuperfast chips are in high demand \u2014 not just by the artificial intelligence industry, but also by companies that work in computer graphics, robotics, autonomous vehicles, or drug discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to see all these amazing applications being created,\u201d says Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia.\nSpeaking to David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, at the Communacopia + Technology conference in San Francisco, Huang explained how computer graphics, for example, rely heavily on AI infrastructure. \u201cWe compute one pixel, and we infer the other 32,\u201d he says in an edition of Goldman Sachs Talks. \u201cComputing one pixel takes a lot of energy. Inferring the other 32 takes very little energy, and you can do it very fast. And the image quality is incredible.\u201d\nGiven this speed and flexibility, this infrastructure more than pays for itself, Huang says, responding to a question from Solomon about returns on investment for customers. By spending on such equipment, \u201cthe computing cost goes up a little bit \u2014 maybe it doubles,\u201d Huang says. \u201cBut you reduce the computing time by a factor of about 20. You get 10x savings.\u201d\nHow Huang sees the data center market\nChips that accelerate computing are everywhere, but there is no such thing as a universal accelerator, Huang says. Instead, every time a chip company enters a new market, it must learn new algorithms. They differ according to purpose; the algorithm for image processing would be different from the algorithm to model fluid dynamics.\n\u201cUsually, some 5-10% of the code represents 99.999% of the run time,\u201d Huang says. \u201cSo if you take that 5% of the code and offloaded it onto an accelerator, then technically you should be able to speed up the application a hundred times.\u201d\nThe promise of this kind of accelerated computing has led to keen investor interest in the data center market, Huang says. He thinks this infrastructure can yet be improved. For one thing, the average data center is \u201csuper-inefficient, because it\u2019s filled with air, and air is a lousy conductor of electricity.\u201d Making data centers\u00a0denser \u2014 eliminating the air, in other words \u2014 will make them cheaper and more energy efficient.\nAnother revolution lies in how data centers now understand not just how to process data but the meaning of the data itself, and how to translate one form of data to another, Huang says: \u201cEnglish to images, images to English, English to proteins, proteins to chemicals.\u201d\nThe chip supply chain needs to be resilient\nThe ecosystem of manufacturers and suppliers to the chip industry is sprawling and complex, and particularly concentrated in Asia. As a result, Nvidia tries to design diversity and redundancy into every aspect of its supply chain.\nCompanies need to have \u201cenough intellectual property\u201d to be able to shift their manufacturing from one \u201cfab\u201d \u2014 or chip-making facility \u2014 to another if they have to, Huang says. \u201cMaybe the process technology won\u2019t be as great, or you won\u2019t get the same level of performance or cost, but you will still be able to provide the supply.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis article is being provided for educational purposes only.

To that end, specialized semiconductors are used to speed up computationally intensive AI tasks. In that semiconductor vertical, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as the industry standard. In fact, the company has between 80% and 95% market share in AI accelerators, according to analysts. But Nvidia shareholders recently got some worrisome news from rival Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Nvidia shareholders just got some bad news from Broadcom Broadcom sells a range of semiconductor products, including combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips in Apple and Samsung smartphones, as well as networking chips in Arista switches. But Wall Street is particularly fascinated by its leadership in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs.) ASICs are chips purpose-built for specific use cases like accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.  Analysts estimate Broadcom has approximately 60% market share in custom AI chips due to its relationships with three hyperscalers, a term that refers to companies with vast data center footprints. While Broadcom has not identified its hyperscale customers, analysts generally believe they are Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. Broadcom estimates revenue from its three existing hyperscale customers will range from $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027, up from $12.2 billion in 2024. In other words, the company anticipates that custom AI chip sales will increase at least 70% annually in the next three years, but perhaps as quickly as 95% annually. That is disappointing for Nvidia shareholders because it means Broadcom will likely gain market share in AI accelerators. In fact, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that ASICs will account for 13% of AI accelerator sales in 2027, up from 11% in 2024. They also think that figure could hit 15% in 2030. But there is more bad news for Nvidia shareholders.  Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Broadcom has selected two new hyperscalers that are likely to be revenue-generating customers by 2027. That means revenue from custom AI chips could actually grow faster than 95% annually in the next few years. Importantly, while Broadcom did not identify the customers, analysts believe they are Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia shareholders still have good reason to be optimistic I mentioned that Broadcom selected two additional hyperscalers as potential customers. CEO Hock Tan himself used that word because Broadcom will not develop ASICs for small companies, nor would small companies have an interest in using custom AI chips.   Story Continues There are two reasons for that. First, designing ASICs is expensive, so the customer must have a data center footprint large enough to warrant the expense. Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar recently told CNBC that each chip costs about $500 million to design, so it would not be financially sensible to work with clients that can only order a few thousand. Instead, orders must be in the range of 250,000 to 500,000 units.Second, custom chips are less flexible because they are designed for specific workloads and lack supporting software development tools. Nvidia offers a robust ecosystem of code libraries and pretrained models that streamline GPU application development. No such tools exist for ASICs. That means deploying custom chips requires a high degree of technical expertise, which means Broadcom's customer base is limited.Additionally, companies that experiment with ASICs may ultimately decide the costs outweigh the benefits. Antoine Chkaiban at New Street Research says only two companies have deployed custom AI silicon at scale: Google and Amazon. So Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its leadership in AI accelerators. Bank of America analysts estimate it will capture 75% market share in 2030, down only slightly from 80% in 2024.Looking ahead, Wall Street thinks Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 34% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That consensus makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look very reasonable. Prospective investors can buy a few shares with confidence, and current shareholders have good reason to optimistic going forward.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The original video can be viewed\u00a0here.\u00a0This year, Apple and Microsoft were joined by a newcomer to the $3 trillion dollar club: computer chip maker Nvidia. The California-based company saw its stock market value soar from $2 trillion to $3 trillion in just over three months, fueled by the insatiable demand for its cutting-edge technology - the hardware and software that make today's artificial intelligence possible. As we first reported in April, we wondered how a company founded in 1993 to improve video game graphics turned into a titan of 21st century AI. So, we went to Silicon Valley to meet Nvidia's 61-year-old co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has no doubt AI is about to change everything.At Nvidia's annual developers conference this past March, the mood wasn't just upbeat ... it was downright giddy. More than 11,000 enthusiasts \u2014 software developers, tech moguls, and happy shareholders \u2014 filed into San Jose's pro hockey arena to kick off a four-day AI extravaganza. They came to see this man: Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia.\u00a0Jensen Huang: Welcome to GTC!\u00a0Bill Whitaker: What was that like for you to walk out on that stage and see that?\n\n\nJensen Huang: You know, Bill, I'm an engineer. I'm not a performer. When I walked out there-- and all of the people going crazy, it took the breath outta me. And so I was the scariest I've ever been. I'm still scared.

Jensen Huang unveiled Nvidia's latest graphics processing unit, or GPU.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nJensen Huang: This is Blackwell.Designed in America, but made in Taiwan like most advanced semiconductors, Blackwell, he says, is the fastest chip ever.\u00a0Jensen Huang: Google is gearing up for Blackwell. The whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell.Nvidia ushered in the AI revolution with its game-changing GPU \u2013 a single chip able to process a myriad of calculations all at once - not sequentially like more standard chips. The GPU is the engine of Nvidia's AI computer, enabling it to rapidly absorb a fire hose of information.\u00a0Jensen Huang: It does quadrillions of calculations a second, it's just insane numbers.\n\n\nBill Whitaker: Is it doing things now that surprise you?Jensen Huang: We're hoping that it does things that surprise us. That's the whole point. In some areas like drug discovery designing better materials that are lighter, stronger. We need artificial intelligence to help us explore the universe in places that we could've never done ourselves.\u00a0Jensen Huang: Let me show you. Here, Bill, look at this.\u00a0Jensen took us around the GTC Convention Hall to show us what AI has made possible in just the past few years.\u00a0Robot: I'm making your drink, now.Some creations were dazzlingJensen Huang: This is a digital twin of the earth. Once it learns how to calculate weather, it can calculate and predict weather 3,000 times faster than a supercomputer, and 1,000 times less energy.\n\n\nBut Nvidia's AI revolution extends far beyond this hall.Pinar Seyhan Demirdag: Blue metallic spaceship, and let's generate something.\u00a0\n\n\nPinar Seyhan Demirdag and Bill Whitaker\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nPinar Seyhan Demirdag is originally from Istanbul, but co-founded Cuebric near Boston. Her AI application uses Nvidia's GPUs to instantly turn a simple text prompt into a virtual movie set for a fraction of the cost of today's backdrops.Bill Whitaker: This isn't something that's already planned and in there?Pinar Seyhan Demirdag: No, we're doing it in real time. It's live.Bill Whitaker: Is Hollywood knocking at your door?Pinar Seyhan Demirdag: We're- we're getting a lot of love.\n\n\nNearby at Generate:Biomedicines, Dr. Alex Snyder, head of research and development, is using Nvidia's technology to create protein-based drugs. She was surprised at first to see they showed promise in the lab.\u00a0Alex Snyder: Initially when I was told about the application of AI to drug development, I sort of rolled my eyes and said yeah, you know, show me the data. And then I looked at the data, and it was very compelling.Dr. Snyder's team asks its AI models to create new proteins to fight specific diseases like cancer and asthma. A new way to defeat the coronavirus demonstrated potential in a clinical trial.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: You're now working with proteins that do not exist in nature? That you're coming up with by way of AI?Alex Snyder: Yes, we are actually generating what we call de novo. Completely new structures that have not existed before.Bill Whitaker: Do you trust it?\u00a0Alex Snyder: As scientists we can't trust. We have to test. We're not putting Frankensteins into people. We're taking what's known and we're really pushing the field, we're pushing the biology to make drugs that look like regular drugs, but function even better.\n\n\nBrett Adcock: This is a technology that will only get better from here.Brett Adcock is CEO of Figure, a Silicon Valley startup with funding from Nvidia. Look at his answer to labor shortages: an Nvidia GPU-driven prototype called Figure 01.\u00a0Brett Adcock: I think what's been really extraordinary is the pace of progress we've made in 21 months.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: From zero to this in 21 months--\n\n\nFigure has developed an Nvidia GPU-driven humanoid robot.\u00a0\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nBrett Adcock: Ze-- zero to this, yeah. We-- we were walking this robot in under a year since I incorporated the company.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: Could you do this without-- NVIDIA's technology?Brett Adcock: We think they're arguably the best in the world at this. I don't know if this would be possible without them.\u00a0\n\n\nFigure 01: I'm here to assist with tasks as requested.We were amazed that Figure 01 is not just walking, but seemed to reason.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: Hand me something healthy.Figure 01: On it.Figure 01 was able to understand I wanted the orange, not the packaged snack.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: Thank you.It's not yet perfected\u2026\u00a0\n\n\nBill Whitaker: You're gonna get it.But the early results are so promising, German automaker BMW plans started testing the robot in its South Carolina factory this year.Brett Adcock: I think there's an opportunity to ship billions of robots in the coming decades onto the planet.Bill Whitaker: Billions? I would think that a lot of workers would look at that as, \"This robot is taking my job.\"Brett Adcock: I think over time, AI and robotics will start doing more and more of what humans can and better.Bill Whitaker: But what about the worker?Jensen Huang: The workers work for companies. And so companies, when they become more productive, earnings increase. I've never seen one company that had earnings increase and not hire more people.\u00a0\n\n\nBill Whitaker: There are some jobs that are going to become obsolete.Jensen Huang: Well, lemme offer it this way. I believe that you still want human in the loop, because we have good judgment, because there are circumstances that the machines are not-- just not going to understand.The futuristic Nvidia campus sits just down the road from its modest birthplace \u2026 this Denny's in San Jose ...Bill Whitaker: Good morning.\u2026where 31 years ago, Nvidia was just an idea.Jensen Huang: My goodness.\n\n\nBill Whitaker and Jensen Huang in a Denny's\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nWhen he was 15, Jensen Huang worked as a dishwasher at Denny's. As a 30-year-old electrical engineer, married with two children, he and two friends, Nvidia co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, envisioned a whole new way of processing video game graphics.\u00a0\n\n\nJensen Huang: And so we came here, right here to this Denny's, sat right back there, and the three of us decided to start the company. Frankly I- I had no idea how to do it. And nor did they. None of us knew how to do anything.\u00a0Their big idea: accelerate the processing power of computers with a new graphics chip. Their initial attempt flopped and nearly bankrupted the company in 1996.\u00a0Jensen Huang: And the genius of the engineers, and Chris, and Curtis, um, we pivoted to the right way of doing things.\u00a0And created their groundbreaking GPU. The chip took video games from this, to this today.Jensen Huang: Completely changed computer graphics-- saved the company-- launched us into-- into the stratosphere.\u00a0Just eight years after Denny's, Nvidia earned a spot in the S&P 500. Jensen then set his sights on developing the software and hardware for a revolutionary, GPU-driven supercomputer, which would take the company far beyond video games. To Wall Street it was a risky bet. To early developers of AI, it was a revelation.Bill Whitaker: Was that luck or was that vision?\n\n\nJensen Huang: That was-- luck founded by vision. We invented this capability and then, one day, the researchers that were-- creating deep learning, discovered this architecture, because this architecture turns out to have been perfect for them.Bill Whitaker: Perfect for AI?Jensen Huang: Perfect for AI.Jensen Huang: This is the first one we've ever shipped.In 2016, Jensen delivered Nvidia's AI supercomputer, the first of its kind, to Elon Musk, then a board member of OpenAI, which used it to create the building blocks of ChatGPT.\u00a0Jensen Huang: How are you?When AI took off\u2026\n\n\nJensen Huang: Hey guys.So did Jensen Huang's reputation.Man: Can we get a picture?Jensen Huang: Yeah, yeah.\u00a0He's now a Silicon Valley celebrity. He told us the boy who immigrated from Taiwan at age 9 could never have conceived of this.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nJensen Huang: It is the most extraordinary thing, Bill, that a normal dishwasher-busboy could grow up to be this. There's no magic-- it's just 61 years of hard work every single day. I don't think there's anything more than that.We met a humble Jensen at Denny's. Back at Nvidia's headquarters in Santa Slara, we saw he can be intense.\n\n\nBill Whitaker: Let me tell you what some of the people who you work with said about you: Demanding. Perfectionist. Not easy to work for. All that sound right?Jensen Huang: Perfectly, yeah. It should be like that. If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn't be easy.Jensen Huang: All right, guys. Keep up the good work.Nvidia has never done better. Investors are bullish \u2013 but last year more than 600 top AI scientists, ethicists, and others signed this statement urging caution, warning of AI's risk to humanity.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: When I talk to you and I hear you speak, part of me goes, \"Gee whiz.\" And the other part of me goes, \"Oh my God. What are we in for?\"\u00a0Jensen Huang: Yeah, yeah.Bill Whitaker: Which one is it?\n\n\nJensen Huang: It's both. It's both. Yeah. You're feeling all the right feelings. I feel both.Bill Whitaker: You feel both?Jensen Huang: Sure. Sure.\u00a0Pinar Seyhan Demirdag: Humanity will have the choice to see themselves inferior to machines or superior to machines.\u00a0Pinar Seyhan Demirdag is an AI optimist, though she named her company Cuebric, an homage to Stanley Kubrick\u2026the director of \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"In that film, Hal, the AI computer goes rogue.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: I think that's what worries people about AI, that we will lose control of it.\u00a0\n\n\nPinar Seyhan Demirdag: Just because a machine can do faster calculations, comparisons, and analytical solution creation, that doesn't make it smarter than you. It simply computates faster. In my world, in my belief, smarts have to do with your capacity to love, create, expand, transcend. These are qualities that no machine can ever bear, that are reserved to only humans.Jensen Huang: There is something going on.\u00a0Jensen Huang sees an AI future of progress and prosperity \u2026 not one with machines as our masters. We can only hope he's right.Jensen Huang: Thank you all for coming! Thank you.Produced by Marc Lieberman and Cassidy McDonald. Broadcast associate, Mariah B. Campbell. Edited by Peter M.

(TSM, Financials) to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at TSMC's new Arizona facility, Reuters said, citing people familiar with the matter. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.   The relocation would enable Nvidia to diversify its supply chain to satisfy the rising demand for artificial intelligence hardware, therefore extending its manufacturing outside of Taiwan. With preparations for first manufacture slated to commence early next year, TSMC's Arizona factory is scheduled to start volume production in 2025. Right now, only TSMC's facilities in Taiwan manufacture Nvidia's March debuted Blackwell processors. Companies engaged in generative artificial intelligence and rapid computing have shown great demand for the chips, so the possible expansion to Arizona is a noteworthy event in the semiconductor sector. Although TSMC intends to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the plant lacks the capability for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging, which is vital for these processors. The chips will therefore be returned to Taiwan for ultimate packaging. Currently housed in Taiwan, all of TSMC's CoWoS capability highlights the difficulties in completely moving sophisticated chip manufacturing to the United States, according to the report.  Should it be approved, the arrangement with Nvidia would add another significant customer to TSMC's Arizona operationswhich also include Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials), the report said. With rising geopolitical concerns in the area, the Arizona project marks a major turning point in TSMC's attempts to have a manufacturing presence other than Taiwan. The construction of TSMC's Arizona facility is a result of a larger U.S. government initiative to increase home semiconductor manufacture. Under the Chips Act, the Biden government concluded an incentive deal with TSMC last month hoping to drive tens of thousands of employment by the end of the decade, $65 billion in private investment, and three semiconductor factories in Arizona. NVDA stock is up 200% this year. Growing demand for Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors is fueling this stock price. With its market value momentarily exceeding $3 trillion in June 2024, Nvidia became among the most valuable corporations in the world. At its Memphis supercomputer site, Elon Musk's AI firm xAI intends to incorporate at least one million GPUs, maybe involving a large acquisition of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, worth between $24 billion and $32 billion. Investing $10 billion in a new data center in Louisiana, Meta Platforms (META, Financials) hopes to use 350,000 Nvidia H100 processors by the end of 2024, hence increasing demand for Nvidia's goods.

The series will also highlight the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries.\nTo enhance productivity and upskill workers, organizations worldwide are seeking ways to provide consistent, around-the-clock customer service with greater speed, accuracy and scale.\nIntelligent AI agents offer one such solution. They deliver advanced problem-solving capabilities and integrate vast and disparate sources of data to understand and respond to natural language.\nPowered by generative AI and agentic AI, digital avatars are boosting efficiency across industries like healthcare, telecom, manufacturing, retail and more. According to Gartner, by 2028, 45% of organizations with more than 500 employees will use employee AI avatars to expand the capacity of human capital.1\nFrom educating prospects on policies to giving customers personalized solutions, AI is helping organizations optimize revenue streams and elevate employee knowledge and productivity.\n\nWhere Context-Aware AI Avatars Are Most Impactful\nStaying ahead in a competitive, evolving market requires continuous learning and analysis. AI avatars \u2014 also referred to as digital humans \u2014 are addressing key concerns and enhancing operations across industries.\nOne key benefit of agentic digital human technology is the ability to offer consistent, multilingual support and personalized guidance for a variety of use cases.\nFor instance, a medical-based AI agent can provide 24/7 virtual intake and support telehealth services. Or, a virtual financial advisor can help enhance client security and financial literacy by alerting bank customers of potential fraud, or offering personalized offers and investment tips based on their unique portfolio.\nThese digital humans boost efficiency, cut costs and enhance customer loyalty. Some key ways digital humans can be applied include:\n\nPersonalized, On-Brand Customer Assistance: A digital human interface can provide a personal touch when educating new customers on a company\u2019s products and service portfolios. They can provide ongoing customer support, offering immediate responses and solving problems without the need for a live operator.\nEnhanced Employee Onboarding: Intelligent AI assistants can offer streamlined, adaptable, personalized employee onboarding, whether in hospitals or offices, by providing consistent access to updated institutional knowledge at scale. With pluggable, customizable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), these assistants can deliver real-time answers to queries while maintaining a deep understanding of company-specific data.\nSeamless Communication Across Languages: In global enterprises, communication barriers can slow down operations. AI-powered avatars with natural language processing capabilities can communicate effortlessly across languages. This is especially useful in customer service or employee training environments where multilingual support is crucial.\n\nLearn more by listening to the NVIDIA AI Podcast episode with Kanjun Qiu, CEO of Imbue, who shares insights on how to build smarter AI agents.\nInteractive AI Agents With Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text\nWith text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities, AI agents can offer enhanced interactivity and engagement in customer service interactions.\nSoftServe, an IT consulting and digital services provider, has built several digital humans for a variety of use cases, highlighting the technology\u2019s potential to enhance user experiences.\nSoftServe\u2019s Digital Concierge is accelerated by NVIDIA AI Blueprints and NVIDIA ACE technologies to rapidly deploy scalable, customizable digital humans across diverse infrastructures.\n\nGEN, SoftServe\u2019s virtual customer service assistant and digital concierge, makes customer service more engaging by providing lifelike interactions, continuous availability, personalized responses and simultaneous access to all necessary knowledge bases.\nSoftServe also developed FINNA, an AI-powered virtual financial advisor that can provide financial guidance tailored to a client\u2019s profile and simplify complex financial terminology. It helps streamline onboarding and due diligence, supporting goal-oriented financial planning and risk assessment. \nAISHA is another AI-powered digital human developed by SoftServe with NVIDIA technology. Created for the UAE Ministry of Justice, the digital human significantly improves judicial processes by reducing case review times, enhancing the accuracy of rulings and providing rapid access to legal databases. It demonstrates how generative AI can bridge the gap between technology and meaningful user interaction to enhance customer service and operational efficiency in the judicial sector.\n\nHow to Design AI Agents With Avatar and Speech Features\nDesigning AI agents with avatar and speech features involves several key steps\n\nDetermine the use case: Choose between 2D or 3D avatars based on the required level of immersion and interaction.\nAvatar development:\n\nFor 3D avatars, use specialized software and technical expertise to create lifelike movements and photorealism.\nFor 2D avatars, opt for quicker development suitable for web-embedded solutions.\n\n\nIntegrate speech technologies: Use NVIDIA Riva for world-class automatic speech recognition, along with text-to-speech to enable verbal interactions.\nRendering options: Use NVIDIA Omniverse RTX Renderer technology or Unreal Engine tools for 3D avatars to achieve high-quality output and compute efficiency.\nDeployment: Tap cloud-native deployment for real-time output and scalability, particularly for interactive web or mobile applications.\n\nFor an overview on how to design interactive customer service tools, read the technical blogs on how to \u201cBuild a Digital Human Interface for AI Apps With an NVIDIA AI Blueprint\u201d and \u201cExpanding AI Agent Interface Options With 2D and 3D Digital Human Avatars.\u201d\nNVIDIA AI Blueprint for Digital Humans\nThe latest release of the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for digital humans introduces several updates that enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of digital avatars, including dynamic switching between RAG models. Users can experience this directly in preview.\nThe integration of the Audio2Face-2D microservice in the blueprint means developers can create 2D digital humans, which require significantly less processing power compared with 3D models, for web- and mobile-based applications.\n2D avatars are better suited for simpler interactions and platforms where photorealism isn\u2019t necessary. This makes them ideal for scenarios like telemedicine, where quick loading times with lower bandwidth requirements are crucial.\nAnother significant update is the introduction of user attention detection through vision AI. This feature enables digital humans to detect when a user is present \u2014 even if they are idle or on mute \u2014 and initiate interaction, such as greeting the user. This capability is particularly beneficial in kiosk scenarios, where engaging users proactively can enhance the service experience.\nGetting Started\nNVIDIA AI Blueprints make it easy to start building and setting up virtual assistants by offering ready-made workflows and tools to accelerate deployment.

Now, the company is investing in the \u201cphysical AI\u201d space to help the new robotics firms grow.\nFor example, it joined Microsoft and OpenAI in a February funding round that valued humanoid robotics company Figure AI at $2.6 billion.\nWhile Nvidia does not break out figures for its robotics product sales, the FT report said that this part of its business represents a smaller share of its revenue. Data center revenue, for example, made up around 88% of the $35.1 billion in sales Nvidia reported in the third quarter.\nIn other robotics/AI news, PYMNTS wrote recently about research at MIT that developed an AI system that could let warehouse robots deftly handle odd-shaped packages and navigate crowded spaces without putting human workers in danger.\nIt\u2019s a breakthrough happening at a moment when retailers and logistics companies are facing increasing pressure to automate amid surging eCommerce demand.\u00a0\nAlthough robots excel at repetitive tasks such as moving pallets, MIT\u2019s PRoC3S technology could finally solve the long-standing challenge of robots safely performing more complex warehouse jobs that usually require human dexterity and spatial awareness.\n\u201cIn theory, PRoC3S could reduce a robot\u2019s error rate by vetting its initial LLM-based assumptions against more specific and accurate understandings of the warehouse environment,\u201d Erik Nieves, CEO and co-founder at Plus One Robotics, told PYMNTS.\n \u201cThink about it like this: A warehouse robot operating solely on LLM guidance has been described how to complete a task. The PRoC3S concept goes one step further by placing a digital robot in a simulated environment of that task. It\u2019s essentially the difference between classroom instruction and a really good field trip.\u201d\nAs PYMNTS has reported, robotics and AI technologies are transforming traditional distribution yards via specialized autonomous vehicles outfitted with robotic arms that can handle complex tasks such as connecting brake lines and positioning trailers, operating alongside human workers.\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, artificial intelligence, chips, data centers, Deepu Talla, digital transformation, Jetson Thor, News, NVIDIA, PYMNTS News, robotics, Robots, What's Hot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n                FlexTecs Updates FlexTrap Tool to Capture Payments Discrepancies            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The integration enables accelerated dense linear algebra for scientific and simulation workloads.\nSoftware developers can use Warp to write efficient and differentiable GPU kernels natively in Python, where Warp now exposes Tensor Core operations to accelerate simulation for robotics, computational fluid dynamics and digital twins.\nWarp uses cuBLASDx and cuFFTDx to implement matrix-multiply and fast fourier transform (FFT) tile operations. Combined with Warp\u2019s tile programming model, these NVIDIA device-side math libraries enable seamless fusion of Tensor Core accelerated GEMM, FFT and other tile operations within a single kernel.\nWith this approach, applications can outperform traditional linear algebra or tensor frameworks by a factor of 4x when requiring dense linear algebra, such as with robot forward dynamics.\nCustomers such as Autodesk are using NVIDIA Warp to write large-scale fluid simulations up to 8x faster and 5x larger than traditional frameworks.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Warp.\ncuPyNumeric Large-Scale Cluster Library\nThe NVIDIA cuNumeric accelerated computing library advances scientific discovery by helping researchers scale to powerful computing clusters without modifying their Python code. As data sizes and computational complexities grow, CPU-based programs need help meeting the speed and scale demanded by cutting-edge research.\nWith the cuPyNumeric library, researchers can now take their data-crunching Python code and effortlessly run it on GPU-powered workstations, cloud servers or massive supercomputers. The faster they can work through their data, the quicker they can make decisions about promising data points, trends worth investigating and adjustments to their experiments.\nOnce cuPyNumeric is applied, they can run their code on one or thousands of GPUs with zero code changes.\nEach CUDA-accelerated library is optimized to harness hardware features specific to NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs. Combined, they encompass the power of the NVIDIA suite of products, services and enabling technologies.\nNVIDIA provides over 400 libraries. New updates continue to be added on the CUDA platform roadmap, expanding across diverse use cases:\n\nGPUs can\u2019t simply accelerate software written for general-purpose CPUs. Specialized algorithm software libraries and tools are needed to accelerate specific workloads, especially in scientific computing and distributed computing architectures.\nThe demand for more computing horsepower grows daily, but without an increased energy bill. Using multi-GPU, multi-node parallel processing and distributed computing is the best way to help solve this demand, while reducing energy.\nLearn more about NVIDIA CUDA libraries and microservices for AI.\n\n\nCategories: SoftwareTags: CUDA | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Shareholders argued that NVIDIA did not disclose the extent to which sales to crypto-miners, rather than gaming companies, put their shares at risk. The court heard NVIDIA Corp v. E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB just last month, but the dismissal was no surprise. The most dominant theme of the argument was repeated comments by justices that the dispute was too fact specific to warrant their attention.\nThe specific question in the case was whether the complaint in this case was sufficiently specific to make out an allegation of fraud under the high pleading standard for securities fraud actions under the Private Securities Legal Reform Act. Now the case will go back to the trial court to allow the investors to attempt to prove their case against NVIDIA. This is a substantial defeat for NVIDIA, which understandably had good reason to hope the justices would reverse the lower court decision once they agreed to hear the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted in Merits Cases\n\n\nCases: NVIDIA Corp. v.

By now, we know what to expect from the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, so it's a good time to crystallize my overall thoughts on the upcoming launch. \nUpgrading my existing RTX 3080 to one of the RTX 5000 series graphics cards has been on my mind for quite a while, but after seeing what we most likely have in store come January, I don't think I'm going to go through with the upgrade, at least not in 2025. I plan to wait till the RTX 5000 Super refresh, but I don't have high hopes for that either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 reasons I'm scared my RTX 5000 dream might go up in smoke\n\t\t\n\nI'm convinced I want to switch from the RTX 3080 to the RTX 5080, but Nvidia will not make it easy\n\n\nPosts\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 \n\n                            My RTX 3080 isn't half bad\n                    \n\n            Still packs a punch\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RTX 5000 series will most likely be out of reach for the majority of gamers, but perhaps an unrelated reason for my personal disinterest is none other than my existing gaming PC. Outfitted with the RTX 3080 and the Ryzen 7 5700X, I realize I don't \"need\" to upgrade anytime soon. The RTX 3080 is easily one of the standout cards of the last few generations, and I was fortunate enough to get it at MSRP. It has allowed me to enjoy nearly every demanding title at maximum settings and smooth frame rates.\nOver the last 2 years of owning the RTX 3080, the time I spend playing big-budget AAA titles might have gradually decreased, but the itch to upgrade one of the latest and greatest graphics cards has remained strong. Despite that, I can't fully justify swapping my RTX 3080 just yet, considering it still has a lot of life left in it, even in today's heaviest titles as well as upcoming games in 2025.\nKeeping one's gaming PC up to date with a current-gen, high-end graphics card demands a significant investment, and considering I would not be able to devote as much time to gaming as I would like, it's reasonable to retain my current GPU, carve out time for more gaming sessions, and contemplate an upgrade in late 2025 or beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t7 clear signs you don't need to upgrade your gaming PC yet\n\t\t\n\nMarketing and FOMO might have you convinced otherwise, but your PC probably doesn't need an upgrade yet\n\n\nPosts\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 \n\n                            Nvidia has priced me out\n                    \n\n            This should not surprise anyone\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if I could allocate each of my weekends in 2025 to some hardcore gaming, Nvidia is hell-bent on making an RTX 5000 upgrade as hard as possible. Graphics cards being priced similarly to luxury goods is nothing new, and is a trend pioneered by none other than Nvidia, but the RTX 5000 series is set to take things to another level, if the latest reports are to be believed.\nThe current-gen RTX 4090 was already eye-watering at $1,600, but its successor, the RTX 5090, is likely to feature a $2,000+ price tag. Granted, the 90-series GPU isn't what the average gamer has in mind, but this insane pricing strategy will naturally trickle down to the rest of the product stack. I had my eyes on the RTX 5080 as I considered it a true upgrade over my existing RTX 3080, but reports suggest that even the RTX 5080 would not be cheaper than $1,200, and that's a conservative estimate.\nThe RTX 5080 might be around 35-40% faster than the RTX 4080, but if Nvidia decides to price it around $1,300-$1,400, it will become the next RTX 4090, a GPU that only a fraction of PC gamers ever consider splurging on. Going down the product stack, the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will probably also feature significant price hikes compared to their current-gen counterparts, at which point considering them \"mid-range\" will require even more mental gymnastics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t11 best games to play on your RTX 5000 series\n\t\t\n\nWhether you go for the flagship RTX 5090 or the midrange, these are the best games to show off the power of your new GPU\n\n\nPosts\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 \n\n                            Even high-end models lack enough VRAM\n                    \n\n            Nvidia hasn't stopped being stingy\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice isn't the only problem with Nvidia's RTX 5000 series graphics cards. The same reports I referred to above claim that only the RTX 5090 is getting a bump in VRAM (24GB to 32GB), whereas the RTX 5080 would get the same 16GB VRAM seen on the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super. A similar story will play out with the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070, as the former will support the same 16GB VRAM seen on the RTX 4070 Ti Super, with the latter having to make do with just 12GB, the same as that seen on the RTX 4070 Ti.\nWhen such high-end models \u2014 the cheapest of which might even cost around $800 \u2014 aren't deemed worthy of sufficient VRAM by Nvidia, it is genuinely impossible for gamers to take these cards seriously. Nvidia has been skimping on VRAM for a long time, and a lot has been said about it already, but it's still appalling that the company consistently fails to equip its fastest cards with the necessary VRAM required to perform at high resolutions, especially in the latest and upcoming titles.\nNvidia might be using VRAM as another lever to differentiate between its SKUs, prompting customers to shell out extra for a higher-tier card than what they initially plan on getting. However, when the actual VRAM numbers are as low as 12GB on an $800+ GPU in 2025, it is not easy to see eye to eye with Team Green.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\t3 reasons why it's time for NVIDIA to start ponying up more VRAM on their mid-range GPUs\n\t\t\n\nNVIDIA has been skimping on VRAM for far too long.\n\n\nPosts\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n                            Mainstream SKUs don't feature a significant performance uplift\n                    \n\n            The best is reserved for the most expensive cards\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's stance on the performance of its RTX 5000 series GPUs is perfectly in sync with that of VRAM, meaning it is planning real generational uplifts only on its flagship and higher-end models. The RTX 5090 is poised to be way faster than the RTX 4090, with some leaks even expecting a 70% performance increase. The RTX 5080 is also expected to be around 40% faster than its predecessor, the RTX 4080.\nHowever, when you exclude those cards from the discussion, the performance gains promised by the RTX 5000 series fail to impress anyone. Sure, we could see around 20-30% improved performance on the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti compared to the models they will replace, but these SKUs are already massively nerfed when compared to the flagship models. Coupled with the lack of sufficient VRAM, spending $800 to $1,000 on a 70-class card is what I consider the furthest thing from a good deal.\nWhile it is reasonable to expect a significant performance difference between different tiers of GPUs, Nvidia seems to be widening the gulf compared to what we saw in the previous-gen models. The RTX 3070 Ti featured only around 4% more CUDA cores than the RTX 3070, whereas the gap increased to around 30% when comparing the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070. The RTX 5070 Ti is rumored to have around 45% more CUDA cores than the RTX 5070, something that would also be reflected in the RTX 5070 Ti's pricing relative to that of the RTX 5070.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhich GPU should you buy in each $100 price bracket?\n\t\t\n\nThere's something here for everyone, regardless of whether you're a budget user or a gaming enthusiast\n\n\nPosts\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n                            RTX 5000 Super refresh will (probably) not be any better\n                    \n\n            More like super disappointing\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother significant difference in the upcoming generation of graphics cards will be the level of competition Nvidia faces in the high-end segment. AMD has confirmed that it will only focus on mid-range and budget graphics cards with its RX 8000 series, whereas Intel's Battlemage graphics cards would also not compete head-on with Nvidia. This lack of competition would most likely ensure Nvidia will not have any incentive to offer better value to gamers with an eventual RTX 5000 Super refresh.\nOne of the reasons the RTX 4080 Super launched with a price cut compared to the RTX 4080 was the competition offered by AMD's high-end RX 7000 graphics cards. In the absence of such pressures next year, Nvidia will do what it pleases. We might not even see the RTX 5080 Super or RTX 5080 Ti close the enormous gap between the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, and Nvidia might just discontinue the RTX 5080 when a slightly faster 5080 Super is launched.\nThis is why I'm not confident that waiting for the eventual RTX 5000 Super refresh is going to pay any significant dividends for PC gamers. Unless Nvidia sees a miraculous drop in the sales of its latest GPUs in the next year, we have no reason to believe that value for money would be high on Nvidia's list of priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHere's what Nvidia, Intel, and AMD need to focus on in 2025\n\t\t\n\nThe year 2025 is set to be a momentous year for Nvidia, Intel, and AMD. Here's what they need to do to put their best foot forward.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Prepare for the worst, hope for the minimum\n    \nNvidia's RTX 5000 series will undoubtedly launch to a lot of hype and varied opinions, but I believe most of it will be centered around the insane pricing, a possible increase in power requirements, and a general disappointment with the state of the gaming GPU industry. We will see RTX 5090 memes, familiar stock issues, and endless rants on Reddit, but Nvidia will continue doing what it's doing.\nThe gaming GPU market is a small portion of Nvidia's overall business, with the bulk of its revenues coming from data center GPUs. And that's where the company's focus and priorities lie, at least in the new future. Gamers will have to accept whatever Nvidia comes out with next year, and hope that AMD and even Intel's mid-range offerings force Nvidia to make some welcome changes, at least with its mainstream offerings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series: Everything you need to know about Blackwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Follow\n                                        \n\n\n\n                                            Followed\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Like\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nFlipboard\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders like you help support XDA.

The purchase is intended to improve Nvidia's AI-oriented products and increase its capacity to maximize GPU resource consumption in demanding computing scenarios.  Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.  The deal coincides with Nvidia's ongoing leadership in artificial intelligence technologies becoming more solidified. Run:ai is well-known for its own software, which makes virtualization and orchestration of AI workloads possiblea necessary ability for effective GPU allocation. Nvidia wants to include this technology into its DGX Cloud system so that it may provide business users more options for managing artificial intelligence workload. Early this month, regulatory obstacles were removed when the European Commission decided the merger would not hinder competition in the AI and GPU sectors and gave unqualified clearance for it. The U.S. Department of Justice, looking at Nvidia's impact in the artificial intelligence sector, also scrutinized the purchase. As Nvidia keeps extending its portfolio of AI-driven products, its acquisition approach fits with its more general goals to control the AI ecosystem. These include hardware, software, and cloud-based artificial intelligence systems. The financial specifics of how Nvidia intends to integrate Run:ai's activities into its larger architecture are still unknown. The purchase is seen as a calculated action to maintain Nvidia's competitive advantage as demand for artificial intelligence technology rises in several sectors.

The Information reported that the US Department of Commerce asked the chipmaker to investigate how its products ended up in China despite tight export controls. Distributors like Super Micro and Dell embed Nvidia\u2019s AI processors in their server products. Subsequently, Nvidia asked these distributors to conduct spot checks of Southeast Asian customers. So far, during inspections by Super Micro, those smuggling the chips have evaded detection.\n\nAlthough Nvidia tries to adhere to export control restrictions, the chipmaker is at the center of the ongoing US-China trade war. Technology export regulations have become a diplomatic tool for the US. The outgoing Biden administration has been cracking down on chips exported to China. These efforts include broader restrictions on advanced technology that can be sent to China to prevent Bejing from developing its own chips that could be used in AI for sophisticated military applications. Also, the US has halted exports to 140 Chinese companies.\n\nEven so, after a review of tender documents in early 2024, Chinese universities and research institutes have been able to procure banned Nvidia chips through resellers, Reuters reports. It is not illegal to buy or sell US chips in China,which has a strong demand for Nvidia chips because of a lack of quality alternatives.\n\nIn what could be considered retaliation, a week after the Biden administration introduced the new restrictions, China began investigating Nvidia for potential violations of antitrust law in its 2020 acquisition of an Israeli-American multinational supplier of computer networking products, Mellanox Technologies. Nvidia is under scrutiny for potentially breaching commitments to provide access to GPU accelerators and networking equipment in China and prohibiting anticompetitive practices.\n\nAlso, in response to the Biden administration, China\u2019s government introduced a ban on exports to the US of several rare minerals\u2014gallium, germanium, and antimony\u2014used to make semiconductors and sanctioned over a dozen US defense firms and executives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n \n\nEconomics, Policy & Regulation\nWilbur Ross On How Trump\u2019s Tariffs Impact CFOs And Key US Trade Partners: Part 2\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEconomics, Policy & Regulation\nWilbur Ross on Tariffs, Trump, and Navigating US Trade Policy: Part 1\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEconomics, Policy & Regulation\nKuwait Doubles Down On Oil Infrastructure And Investment\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEconomics, Policy & Regulation\nProposed Mortgage Law Would Be A \u2018Game Changer\u2019 For Kuwaiti Banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPage footer\t\n\n\nAwards ProgramOur Awards and How to Enter\nLogos & Licensing\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter\n \n\n \n\nAbout UsAbout Global Finance\nPrivacy and Cookie Policy\nTerms of Use\nLegal Notices\n \n\nSubscribePrint Subscription\nDigital Subscription\nSocial Media \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tfacebook\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLink to Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tlinkedin\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLink to LinkedIn\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tyoutube\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLink to YouTube\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\ttwitter\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLink to X\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2025 Global Finance Magazine All Rights Reserved \n\n\n\n\nNews & Features\n\nCapital Raising & Corporate Finance\nTransaction Banking\nEconomics, Policy & Regulation\nEmerging & Frontier Markets\nSustainable Finance\nTechnology\nBanking\nInsurance\nExecutive Interviews\nDigital Editions\nNews & Features Archive\n\n\nData & Rankings\n\nSafest Banks\nEconomic Data & Rankings\nNon-Economic Data & Rankings\nCountry Economic Data\n\n\nAwards\n\nAward Winners\nWinner Insights\nWinner Announcements\nOur Awards and How to Enter\n\n\nEvents & Videos\n\nEditorial Videos\nExpert Perspectives\nAward Ceremonies and Events\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nSponsored Content\n2025 Editorial Calendar Information Page\nMedia Kit\nContact Us\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia\u2019s bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company\u2019s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.\nAt issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia\u2019s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company\u2019s stock price.\nNvidia had argued that the investors\u2019 lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court.\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court hears arguments on study requirements for environmental regulators\nIn 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.\nNvidia\u2019s recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year.\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\nThe lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors\u2019 lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                An Nvidia Blackwell GPU is displayed at COMPUTEX in Taipei, Taiwan June 4, 2024.

This partnership brings NVIDIA\u2019s open-source CUDA-Q quantum development platform to Amazon Braket, enabling researchers to design, simulate and execute hybrid quantum-classical algorithms more efficiently.\nThe Role of Hybrid Computing\nHybrid computing \u2014 where classical and quantum systems work together \u2014 is actually a facet of all quantum computing applications. Classical computers handle tasks like algorithm testing and error correction, while quantum computers tackle problems beyond classical reach. As quantum processors improve, the demand for classical computing power grows exponentially, especially for tasks like error mitigation and pre-processing.\nThe collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA is designed to ease this transition by providing researchers with seamless access to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA-Q platform directly within Amazon Braket. This integration allows users to test their programs using powerful GPUs, then execute the same programs on quantum hardware without extensive modifications.\nFaster Simulations, Easier Workflows\nIncorporating CUDA-Q into Amazon Braket brings significant performance gains, according to the team. One example is the speed-up offered by NVIDIA GPUs for quantum circuit simulations. Tests showed that simulating a 21-qubit algorithm on a GPU was 350 times faster than on a CPU. This kind of acceleration enables researchers to explore larger-scale quantum systems more efficiently.\nThe team writes that the integration of CUDA-Q with Amazon Braket is designed to help researchers focus on building algorithms rather than managing infrastructure. Ultimately, the team believes this could be a critical step forward in making hybrid quantum computing accessible.\nAmazon Braket users can now leverage this integration to streamline their research. CUDA-Q programs can run on all Braket-supported quantum hardware, including systems from IonQ, Rigetti and IQM, by changing just one line of code.\nPreparing for the Quantum Future\nQuantum error correction \u2014 arguably the most important technique required for scalable quantum computing \u2014 relies heavily on classical co-processing. As quantum systems evolve to handle more qubits and deeper circuits, researchers will require not only faster hardware but also more sophisticated tools to manage the interplay between quantum and classical systems.\nAWS and NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration lays the groundwork for such advancements. The partnership aims to develop a hybrid quantum-computing infrastructure that blends classical computing with quantum systems, offering flexibility and scalability for cutting-edge workloads.\nThe team emphasized the importance of forward-looking infrastructure, writing: As quantum computing technologies mature, state-of-the-art workloads will have diverse and increasingly demanding requirements for the associated classical compute resources: from\u00a0ultra-low latency co-processing for quantum error correction (QEC) decoding and feedback\u00a0and\u00a0supercomputing-scale classical pre- and post-processing\u00a0to quantum hardware control and calibration, and\u00a0AI-enabled quantum simulations.\u00a0To address these challenges, AWS is working with NVIDIA to evaluate the latency and compute requirements of future workloads, as well as develop a quantum computing stack that gives customers the performance and flexibility needed to get the most out of emerging quantum computing technologies.\u201d\nBenefits for Researchers\nThe integration allows researchers to:\n\nAccelerate Simulations: NVIDIA GPUs significantly reduce simulation times, enabling faster testing of quantum algorithms.\nSimplify Hybrid Workflows: With CUDA-Q on Braket, researchers can seamlessly transition from simulations to quantum hardware execution.\nFocus on Research: Managed access to GPUs and quantum devices removes the need for researchers to handle complex infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, AWS provides a pay-as-you-go model, ensuring cost efficiency for researchers working on demanding computational problems.\nA Glimpse into the Results\nPerformance tests conducted by AWS showed the CUDA-Q platform outperforming other open-source simulators for a 29-qubit algorithm, running significantly faster on a single GPU instance. The flexibility of Braket Hybrid Jobs also allows researchers to scale workloads across multiple GPUs, achieving even greater speed-ups for certain tasks.\nFor example, parallelizing a 30-qubit circuit across eight GPUs led to a 6.5x speedup in runtime, while distributing 128 different circuits yielded speedups of up to 17x for parameterized circuits. These gains are critical as researchers push the boundaries of quantum computing.\nFuture Directions\nAs the collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA deepens, their focus will include evaluating the latency and computational requirements for emerging quantum workloads. The ultimate goal is to create an integrated quantum-classical computing ecosystem that supports researchers at every stage, from algorithm design to execution on cutting-edge quantum hardware.\nThe researchers describe this integration as just the beginning: \u201cThis release is a first step to a broader collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA to explore the quantum stack as quantum and classical become inextricably linked over time.\u201d\nFor researchers interested in exploring these tools, AWS provides detailed example notebooks to get started. You can check out\u00a0the example notebooks\u00a0in the team\u2019s GitHub repo.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon BraketAWSCUDA-QNVIDIA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Swayne \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a several-decades long background in journalism and communications, Matt Swayne has worked as a science communicator for an R1 university for more than 12 years, specializing in translating high tech and deep tech for the general audience.

Next year? Plenty of challenges.      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor Updated December 30, 2024 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.48%    AAPL   -0.82%    QCOM   -0.72%    AVGO   -2.87%    AMD   -0.81%       Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That\u2019s not all. It\u2019s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some.  And there\u2019s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. \u201cNvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,\u201d Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well \u2026 liked within the developer communities.\u201d But the competition isn\u2019t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia\u2019s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia\u2019s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant\u2019s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.57 -2.96 (-2.48%)  As of 3:14:37 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. The dominator Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it\u2019s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet\u2019s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business.   Story Continues \u201cEverybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,\u201d TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell told Yahoo Finance.  Top of the heap: CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSNvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company\u2019s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production \u2014 and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate.\u201cI don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia\u2019s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cSo, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.\u201dWith hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips.Nvidia still faces risksWhile Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there\u2019s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD\u2019s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia\u2019s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor.AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia\u2019s lead.  Facing risks? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in San Jose, Calif. last March. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\u201cWhat AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand \u2026with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,\u201d Newman said. \u201cBecause these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.\u201dIt\u2019s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia\u2019s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator.  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.  There\u2019s also concern that the shift to \"inferencing AI models\" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips.Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips.Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia\u2019s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training.Even if Nvidia\u2019s market share slides, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before.\u201cThis is definitely a case of raising all boats,\u201d Newman said. \u201cSo even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.\u201d  Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 yahoofinanceEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

That\u2019s about how many medical imaging tests are performed annually worldwide to diagnose, monitor and treat various conditions.\nSpeeding up the processing and evaluation of all these X-rays, CT scans, MRIs and ultrasounds is essential to helping doctors manage their workloads and to improving health outcomes.\nThat\u2019s why NVIDIA introduced MONAI, which serves as an open-source research and development platform for AI applications used in medical imaging and beyond. MONAI unites doctors with data scientists to unlock the power of medical data to build deep learning models and deployable applications for medical AI workflows.\nThis week at the annual meeting of RSNA, the Radiological Society of North America, NVIDIA announced that Siemens Healthineers has adopted MONAI Deploy, a module within MONAI that bridges the gap from research to clinical production, to boost the speed and efficiency of integrating AI workflows for medical imaging into clinical deployments.\nWith over 15,000 installations in medical devices around the world, the Siemens Healthineers Syngo Carbon and syngo.via enterprise imaging platforms help clinicians better read and extract insights from medical images of many sources.\nDevelopers typically use a variety of frameworks when building AI applications. This makes it a challenge to deploy their applications into clinical environments.\nWith a few lines of code, MONAI Deploy builds AI applications that can run anywhere. It is a tool for developing, packaging, testing, deploying and running medical AI applications in clinical production. Using it streamlines the process of developing and integrating medical imaging AI applications into clinical workflows.\nMONAI Deploy on the Siemens Healthineers platform has significantly accelerated the AI integration process, letting users port trained AI models into real-world clinical settings with just a few clicks, compared with what used to take months. This helps researchers, entrepreneurs and startups get their applications into the hands of radiologists more quickly.\n\u201cBy accelerating AI model deployment, we empower healthcare institutions to harness and benefit from the latest advancements in AI-based medical imaging faster than ever,\u201d said Axel Heitland, head of digital technologies and research at Siemens Healthineers. \u201cWith MONAI Deploy, researchers can quickly tailor AI models and transition innovations from the lab to clinical practice, providing thousands of clinical researchers worldwide access to AI-driven advancements directly on their syngo.via and Syngo Carbon imaging platforms.\u201d\nEnhanced with MONAI-developed apps, these platforms can significantly streamline AI integration. These apps can be easily provided and used on the Siemens Healthineers Digital Marketplace, where users can browse, select and seamlessly integrate them into their clinical workflows.\nMONAI Ecosystem Boosts Innovation and Adoption\nNow marking its five-year anniversary, MONAI has seen over 3.5 million downloads, 220 contributors from around the world, acknowledgements in over 3,000 publications, 17 MICCAI challenge wins and use in numerous clinical products.\nThe latest release of MONAI \u2014 v1.4 \u2014 includes updates that give researchers and clinicians even more opportunities to take advantage of the innovations of MONAI and contribute to Siemens Healthineers Syngo Carbon, syngo.via and the Siemens Healthineers Digital Marketplace.\nThe updates in MONAI v1.4 and related NVIDIA products include new foundation models for medical imaging, which can be customized in MONAI and deployed as NVIDIA NIM microservices. The following models are now generally available as NIM microservices:\n\nMAISI (Medical AI for Synthetic Imaging) is a latent diffusion generative AI foundation model that can simulate high-resolution, full-format 3D CT images and their anatomic segmentations.\nVISTA-3D is a foundation model for CT image segmentation that offers accurate out-of-the-box performance covering over 120 major organ classes.

These disturbances, introduced by environmental interactions and imperfect hardware, mean that today\u2019s qubits can only perform hundreds of operations before quantum computations irretrievably deteriorate.\u00a0\nThough seemingly inevitable, noise in quantum hardware can be tackled by so-called logical qubits \u2014 collections of tens, hundreds or even thousands of actual physical qubits that allow the correction of noise-induced errors. Logical qubits are the holy grail of quantum computing, and quantum hardware builder Infleqtion today published groundbreaking work that used the NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform to both design and demonstrate an experiment with two of them.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese logical qubits were used to perform a small-scale demonstration of the so-called single-impurity Anderson model, a high-accuracy approach necessary for many important materials science applications.\u00a0\nThis constitutes the first time that a demonstration of a materials science quantum algorithm has been performed on logical qubits. The creation of just a single logical qubit is extremely challenging. Infleqtion was able to achieve such a feat thanks to accurate modeling of its quantum computer using CUDA-Q\u2019s unique GPU-accelerated simulation capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\nHaving developed and tested its entire experiment within CUDA-Q\u2019s simulators, with only trivial changes, Infleqtion could then use CUDA-Q to orchestrate the experiment using the actual physical qubits within its Sqale neutral atom quantum processor.\u00a0\nThis work sets the stage for quantum computing\u2019s move toward large-scale, error-corrected systems.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany scaling challenges still stand between today\u2019s quantum devices and large systems of logical qubits, which will only be solved by integrating quantum hardware with AI supercomputers to form accelerated quantum supercomputers.\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA continues to work with partners like Infleqtion to enable this breakthrough research needed to make accelerated quantum supercomputing a reality.\u00a0\nRead the NVIDIA Technical Blog on this news and learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s quantum computing platforms.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: SoftwareTags: CUDA | Quantum Computing | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After a few years, she became fascinated with the volumes of information communicated in text and shifted her expertise to large language models.\n\u201cEvery time I learn something new, I become more and more curious. I\u2019m always seeking new knowledge and trying to solve challenges in creative ways,\u201d said Rishab, who also applies her creativity outside of work by painting and sketching.\n\nFor around two years, Rishab was part of the team leading NVIDIA\u2019s submissions for MLPerf Training, a series of benchmarks designed to provide unbiased evaluations of how quickly systems can train models to a target quality metric. Twice a year, Rishab trained and submitted deep learning models to demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the NVIDIA AI platform.\nThe large language models she works with are the foundation for some of the most widely used AI services today. Rishab is especially proud of NVIDIA\u2019s first time submitting a GPT-3-based model powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs to MLPerf Training. The team broke MLPerf records, the result of many months of hard work from NVIDIA and other collaborators across the industry.\nRishab\u2019s work created an opportunity for her to join MLCommons, the consortium of AI leaders that runs MLPerf. As the training cochair, she partners with representatives from academia, research and industry to help determine new, relevant models to add for future benchmarking.\n\n\u201cWhen we collaborate as a community, we can make things faster and better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that MLCommons is an open, public benchmark. Anyone can view or submit, and it helps the whole industry learn and determine our future together.\u201d\nRishab currently works on open-source, publicly available large language models and associated open-source platforms, such as NVIDIA NeMo, that anybody can run on NVIDIA hardware. She\u2019s passionate about accelerating the most important models in the industry, while also making sure the training processes are resilient and efficient.\n\u201cMost of the work I\u2019ve done at NVIDIA has been open source, and I\u2019m proud of making AI more open and transparent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think about the whole community in everything we do. It\u2019s proof of my life\u2019s work.\u201d\nFollow @nvidialife on Instagram and learn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By deploying robust, AI solutions, businesses can achieve accurate, scalable and high-impact results.\nNVIDIA\u2019s platform and consulting partners play a critical role in ensuring enterprises can efficiently adopt and integrate generative AI capabilities, such as the new multilingual NeMo Retriever microservices. These partners help align AI solutions to an organization\u2019s unique needs and resources, making generative AI more accessible and effective. They include:\n\nCloudera plans to expand the integration of NVIDIA AI in the Cloudera AI Inference Service. Currently embedded with NVIDIA NIM, Cloudera AI Inference will include NVIDIA NeMo Retriever to improve the speed and quality of insights for multilingual use cases.\nCohesity introduced the industry\u2019s first generative AI-powered conversational search assistant that uses backup data to deliver insightful responses. It uses the NVIDIA NeMo Retriever reranking microservice to improve retrieval accuracy and significantly enhance the speed and quality of insights for various applications.\nSAP is using the grounding capabilities of NeMo Retriever to add context to its Joule copilot Q&A feature and information retrieved from custom documents.\nVAST Data is deploying NeMo Retriever microservices on the VAST Data InsightEngine with NVIDIA to make new data instantly available for analysis. This accelerates the identification of business insights by capturing and organizing real-time information for AI-powered decisions.\nWEKA is integrating its WEKA AI RAG Reference Platform (WARRP) architecture with NVIDIA NIM and NeMo Retriever into its low-latency data platform to deliver scalable, multimodal AI solutions, processing hundreds of thousands of tokens per second.\n\nBreaking Language Barriers With Multilingual Information Retrieval\nMultilingual information retrieval is vital for enterprise AI to meet real-world demands. NeMo Retriever supports efficient and accurate text retrieval across multiple languages and cross-lingual datasets. It\u2019s designed for enterprise use cases such as search, question-answering, summarization and recommendation systems.\nAdditionally, it addresses a significant challenge in enterprise AI \u2014 handling large volumes of large documents. With long-context support, the new microservices can process lengthy contracts or detailed medical records while maintaining accuracy and consistency over extended interactions.\nThese capabilities help enterprises use their data more effectively, providing precise, reliable results for employees, customers and users while optimizing resources for scalability. Advanced multilingual retrieval tools like NeMo Retriever can make AI systems more adaptable, accessible and impactful in a globalized world.\nAvailability\nDevelopers can access the multilingual NeMo Retriever microservices, and other NIM microservices for information retrieval, through the NVIDIA API catalog, or a no-cost, 90-day NVIDIA AI Enterprise developer license.\nLearn more about the new NeMo Retriever microservices and how to use them to build efficient information retrieval systems.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Once the car arrives, the user manually drives it.\nAfter completing their trip, the user can end the rental in the app and pull over to a safe location to exit the car, away from traffic flow. There\u2019s no need to park the vehicle, as the teledriver will handle the parking or drive the car to the next customer.\nThis system offers sustainable, door-to-door mobility, with the unique advantage of having a human driver remotely controlling the vehicle in real time.\nVay\u2019s technology is built on the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX centralized compute platform, running the NVIDIA DriveOS operating system for safe, AI-defined autonomous vehicles.\nThese technologies enable Vay\u2019s fleets to process large volumes of camera and other vehicle data over the air. DRIVE AGX\u2019s real-time, low-latency video streaming capabilities provide enhanced situational awareness for teledrivers, while its automotive-grade design ensures reliability in any driving condition.\n\u201cBy combining Vay\u2019s innovative remote driving capabilities with the advanced AI and computing power of NVIDIA DRIVE AGX, we\u2019re setting a new standard for remotely driven vehicles,\u201d said Justin Spratt, chief business officer at Vay. \u201cThis collaboration helps us bring safe, reliable and accessible driverless options to the market and provides an adaptable solution that can be deployed in real-world environments now \u2014 not years from now.\u201d\n\nHigh-Quality Video Stream\nVay\u2019s advanced technology stack includes NVIDIA DRIVE AGX software that\u2019s optimized for latency and processing power. By harnessing NVIDIA GPUs specifically designed for autonomous driving, the company\u2019s teledriving system can process and transmit high-definition video feeds in real time, delivering critical situational awareness to the teledriver, even in complex environments. In the event of an emergency, the vehicle can safely bring itself to a complete stop.\n\u201cWorking with NVIDIA, Vay is setting a new standard in driverless technology,\u201d said Bogdan Djukic, cofounder and vice president of engineering, teledrive experience and autonomy at Vay. \u201cWe are proud to not only accelerate the deployment of remotely driven and autonomous vehicles but also to expand the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in urban transportation, logistics and beyond \u2014 transforming mobility for both businesses and communities.\u201d\nReshaping Mobility With Teledriving\nVay\u2019s technology enables professionally trained teledrivers to remotely drive vehicles from specialized teledrive stations equipped with industry-standard controls, such as a steering wheel and pedals.\nThe company\u2019s teledrivers are totally immersed in the drive \u2014 road traffic sounds, such as those from emergency vehicles and other warning signals, are transmitted via microphones to the operator\u2019s headphones. Camera sensors reproduce the car\u2019s surroundings and transmit them to the screens of the teledrive station with minimum latency. The vehicles can operate at speeds of up to 26 mph.\nVay\u2019s technology effectively addresses complex edge cases with human supervision, enhancing safety while significantly reducing costs and development challenges.\n\nVay is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures AI startups with go-to-market support, expertise and technology. Last year, Vay became the first and only company in Europe to teledrive a vehicle on public streets without a safety driver.\nSince January, Vay has been operating its commercial services in Las Vegas. The startup recently secured a partnership with Bayanat, a provider of AI-powered geospatial solutions, and is working with Ush and Poppy, Belgium-based car-sharing companies, as well as Peugeot, a French automaker.\nIn October, Vay announced a $34 million investment from the European Investment Bank, which will help it roll out its technology across Europe and expand its development team.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA DRIVE platform.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Hardware | SoftwareTags: NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA Inception \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Custom Silicon By Tech Giants\n\nGoogle (TPUs): Tensor Processing Units power Google\u2019s internal AI workloads and are available through Google Cloud. While not a direct competitor in the open market, TPUs reduce Google\u2019s reliance on Nvidia.\nAmazon And Microsoft: Both hyperscalers are developing in-house AI chips like Amazon\u2019s Trainium and Microsoft\u2019s Athena, signaling a shift away from dependence on third-party providers.\n\n3. Startups And Niche Players\n\nGraphcore: Focused on Intelligence Processing Units, Graphcore optimizes efficiency and performance for specific AI applications.\nCerebras Systems: Cerebras uses wafer-scale engines to cater to compute-intensive tasks, offering a unique solution for large-scale AI workloads.\nTenstorrent: Founded by chip design legend Jim Keller, Tenstorrent is pioneering innovative architectures for AI acceleration.\n\nThe Prospects For Competition\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s leadership position remains strong, several factors could reshape the competitive dynamics:\n\nCustom ASICs\n\nThe rise of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits for specialized workloads poses a direct challenge to GPUs. Companies like Google and Amazon, with their in-house chips, could erode Nvidia\u2019s market share.\n\nManufacturing Bottlenecks\n\nNvidia\u2019s reliance on TSMC for manufacturing makes it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Competitors with diversified manufacturing capabilities could gain ground during shortages.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny\n\nThe Chinese antitrust investigation into Nvidia highlights the regulatory risks of dominance. Such scrutiny could open doors for rivals to compete more aggressively, particularly in key markets like China.\n\nBreakthroughs In Efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency is becoming a critical factor in AI hardware. Companies delivering significant energy savings through new architectures or advanced cooling technologies could gain a competitive edge.\nThe Road Ahead\nNvidia remains the dominant force in AI chips, but the competition is closing in. Established players like AMD and Intel are doubling down on innovation, hyperscalers like Google and Amazon are developing custom silicon, and startups are pushing the boundaries with niche solutions.\nThe Chinese antitrust investigation adds another layer of complexity to Nvidia\u2019s position, as regulatory actions could reshape market dynamics. The next phase of the AI chip race will hinge on balancing performance, efficiency, and cost while navigating a strained global supply chain and an increasingly burdened power grid.\nThe stakes have never been higher, and the challengers are ready to test Nvidia\u2019s resilience. The future of AI hardware\u2014and the AI industry as a whole\u2014will be shaped by fierce competition and relentless innovation.

Used by thousands of web and mobile app users daily, the experience is powered by the NVIDIA StyleGAN2 generative AI model.\nHair color try-ons feature links to Ulta Beauty products so shoppers can achieve the look in real life. The company, which has more than 1,400 stores across the U.S., has found that people who use the virtual tool are more likely to purchase a product than those who don\u2019t.\n\u201cShoppers need to try out hair and makeup styles before they purchase,\u201d said Juan Cardelino, director of the computer vision and digital innovation department at Ulta Beauty. \u201cAs one of the first cosmetics companies to integrate makeup testers in stores, offering try-ons is part of Ulta Beauty\u2019s DNA \u2014 whether in physical or digital retail environments.\u201d\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hair-final-Nvidia-2024.12.18.mp4\nAdding Ulta Beauty\u2019s Flair to StyleGAN2\nGLAMlab is Ulta Beauty\u2019s first generative AI application, developed by its digital innovation team.\nTo build its AI pipeline, the team turned to StyleGAN2, a style-based neural network architecture for generative adversarial networks, aka GANs. StyleGAN2, developed by NVIDIA Research, uses transfer learning to generate infinite images in a variety of styles.\n\u201cStyleGAN2 is one of the most well-regarded models in the tech community, and, since the source code was available for experimentation, it was the right choice for our application,\u201d Cardelino said. \u201cFor our hairstyle try-on use case, we had to license the model for commercial use, retrain it and put guardrails around it to ensure the AI was only modifying pixels related to hair \u2014 not distorting any feature of the user\u2019s face.\u201d\nAvailable on the Ulta Beauty website and mobile app, the hair style and color try-ons rely on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs in the cloud to run AI inference, which takes around 5 seconds to compute the first style and about a second each for subsequent styles.\nThe company next plans to incorporate virtual trials for additional hair categories like wigs and is exploring how the virtual hairstyle try-ons could be connected to in-store styling services.\n\u201cStylists could use the tool to show our guests how certain hairstyles will look on them, giving them more confidence to try new looks,\u201d Cardelino said.\nBeyond giving customers a new way to interact with Ulta Beauty\u2019s products, these AI-powered virtual try-ons give users a chance to be creative and explore new possibilities for their personal styles.\n\u201cHair and makeup are playful categories,\u201d Cardelino said. \u201cVirtual try-ons are a way to explore options that may be out of a customer\u2019s comfort zone without needing to commit to a physical change.\u201d\nSee the latest work from NVIDIA Research, which has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Research | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In that time, I've concocted and documented hundreds of custom PC builds and benchmarked hundreds more products, each time installing a fresh OS on every system I use \u2013 and that doesn't include reinstalls on my own rigs.I can tell you now, nothing infuriated me more than GeForce Experience during that time. That might sound like quite the hyperbolic statement to launch an opinion piece like this, right out of the gate, but seriously \u2013 it was a program that just got more convoluted, less useful, and generally more of a pain in the ass to deal with over the years. With its retirement and replacement with the Nvidia App this year, I was at first cautiously weary, but soon enough, found myself filled with glee.Why the big beef with Nvidia's GeForce Experience (GFE)? Well, mostly it just felt a bit grubby. When GFE was first introduced, it was simple enough \u2013 just a desktop program that would suggest some settings for games (which I'd promptly ignore), along with update recommendations to grab new drivers (cutting-edge stuff), oh, and ShadowPlay, which, let's face it, was largely written off by gamers.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nNvidia in 2024: year in review\n\n\n\n\nI saw Nvidia's new DLSS 4 in action on the RTX 5090 and it's a true game changer \u2013 here's why\n\n\n\nOver time, GFE changed and required an Nvidia account to login. Why? Good question. I still don't know, and nothing transferred over from machine to machine with that login, plus there was no personal information stored on the app either. So, Nvidia, why did you need me to login? That remains a mystery.Then came the captcha \u2013 good grief, the captcha. Select the squares with the traffic lights in them. Great, thanks. Does the pole count as a traffic light? That square also has the corner of a traffic light in it \u2013 does that count? Wrong, try again (argh).Lastly, came the email notification instead to sign in, and arguably a dramatic improvement as a result. All for a driver update notification. Fantastic.(Image credit: Shutterstock / Monkey Business Images)How bad did it get? I actively recommended against installing GFE on machines to pretty much anyone in the PC gaming space. I treated it in the exact same manner I reserve for third-party antivirus software \u2013 just don't, it's not worth it. I never installed GFE on my own rigs, that's for sure. After every build I finished or update I did on my own PCs, I'd go straight to Nvidia's website, download the drivers directly, and install them without installing GeForce Experience, with the occasional glance for a new driver every month or so. Life was good.Then I got the chance to check out AMD's Adrenalin software, and boy oh boy, was I impressed. From stats to settings to driver updates, the works, it was (and still is) incredible. How could Nvidia be sleeping on a treasure trove of features when the competition (which is notably struggling with GPU market share) did such a swell job with its app?\n\n\nNVIDIA App | Essential Companion for PC Gamers & Creators - YouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nGeForce Experience and Nvidia Control Panel rolled into oneWith the launch of the Nvidia App (what a name, guys \u2013 killed it) and the death of GeForce Experience, as mentioned, I was nervous at first but then I quickly became elated. This was everything I wanted in a decent GPU control app. It almost feels weird saying this, but it was great to see Team Green finally catch up with AMD.Not only did the Nvidia App take the best of GeForce Experience (what little there was), but it also took the ridiculously antiquated Windows XP-looking Nvidia Control Panel, and baked some of its most used features in as well. All put together in a lovely little package that, thankfully, doesn't require a login. Or a captcha! (Although you can login if you want \u2013 but I'm not sure why you would).In almost every scenario, the Nvidia App is a major upgrade. Driver updates and notifications, check. Graphics settings for games (for those who don't like to tinker with settings), check. Monitor control options, check. There's even stuff in here to overclock your GPU and monitor in-game stats. Nice.There is still a link out to that old-school Control Center for those who require finer details adjusting (if you're a madman who needs to adjust monitor color settings, or the other refined 3D settings, for instance), sadly, but that's not the end of the world.However, the Nvidia App isn't flawless, and there's still room for improvement. Go on the Home tab, and you'll find links to Nvidia Broadcast, ICAT, FrameView, and GeForce Now. They act as sub-links, kind of, either pushing you to a download page, or opening the program directly from there, but full integration would make the Nvidia App seriously more potent.(Image credit: Nvidia)Right now, Nvidia has only just caught up with AMD (it still feels very weird to say that), and there's nothing here that really separates this app from the crowd. It's a nice update for the folks that are already with Nvidia, but there's nothing more to it than that. The Nvidia App doesn't push the envelope on what could be done with it. Still, I guess we should all be thankful that those damn traffic lights have disappeared, at least for now.And that's the worry, really. Perhaps Team Green finally realized that it just wasn't getting as many sign-ins as it used to on GeForce Experience. That us good PC folks were dodging the bullet entirely and opting to download just the bare graphics driver, without the weird green little add-on package in tow. Perhaps this is all just a cunning ploy to get us to download this shiny new thing, with a few added bonuses, and then, six months down the line, wham: Login please, oh, and identify these bicycles while you're at it. Wrong!

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This article, originally published on May 20, 2022, has been updated.\nAdvances in extended reality have already changed the way we work, live and play, and it\u2019s just getting started.\nExtended reality, or XR, is an umbrella category that covers a spectrum of newer, immersive technologies, including virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality.\nFrom gaming to virtual production to product design, XR has enabled people to create, collaborate and explore in computer-generated environments like never before.\nWith the introduction of spatial computing, it further enhances these capabilities by seamlessly blending physical and digital spaces, enabling more intuitive interactions and real-world applications.\nWhat Is Extended Reality?\nVirtual, augmented and mixed reality are all elements of XR technology.\nVirtual reality puts users inside a virtual environment. VR users typically wear a headset that transports them into a virtual world \u2014 one moment they\u2019re standing in a physical room, and the next they\u2019re immersed in a simulated environment.\nThe latest VR technologies push these boundaries, making these environments look and behave more like the real world. They\u2019re also adding support for additional senses, including touch, sound and smell.\nWith VR, gamers can become fully immersed in a video game, designers and customers can review building projects to finalize details prior to construction, and retailers can test virtual displays before committing to a physical one.\n\nAugmented reality is when a rendered image is overlaid onto the real world. The mobile game Pok\u00e9mon GO famously brought AR to the mainstream by showing computer-rendered monsters standing on lawns and sidewalks as players roam their neighborhoods.\nAR graphics are visible through cell phones, tablets and other devices, bringing a new kind of interactive experience to users. Navigating directions, for example, can be improved with AR. Rather than following a 2D map, a windshield can superimpose directions over one\u2019s view of the road, with simulated arrows directing the driver exactly where to turn.\n\nMixed reality is a seamless integration of the real world and rendered graphics, which creates an environment in which users can directly interact with the digital and physical worlds together.\nWith MR, real and virtual objects blend, and are presented together within a single display. Users can experience MR environments through a headset, phone or tablet, and can interact with digital objects by moving them around or placing them in the physical world.\nThere are two types of MR:\n\u00a0\n\nMixing virtual objects into the real world \u2014 for instance, where a user sees the real world through cameras in a VR headset with virtual objects seamlessly mixed into the view. See this example video.\nMixing real-world objects into virtual worlds \u2014 for example, a camera view of a VR participant mixed into the virtual world, like watching a VR gamer playing in a virtual world.\n\nThe History of XR\nTo understand how far XR has come, consider its origins in VR.\nVR began in the federal sector, where it was used to train people in flight simulators. The energy and automotive design industries were also early adopters. These simulation and visualization VR use cases required large supercomputers. It also needed dedicated spaces, including powerwalls, which are ultra-high-resolution displays, and VR CAVEs, which are empty rooms that have the VR environment projected on each surface, from the walls to the ceiling.\nFor decades, VR remained unaffordable for most users, and the small VR ecosystem was mainly composed of large institutions and academic researchers.\nBut early in the previous decade, several key component technologies reached a tipping point, which precipitated the launch of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift head-mounted displays (HMDs), along with the SteamVR runtime.\n\nIndividuals could now purchase personal HMDs to experience great immersive content. And they could drive those HMDs and experiences from an individual PC or workstation with a powerful GPU.\nSuddenly, VR was accessible to millions of individuals, and a large ecosystem quickly sprung up, filled with innovation and enthusiasm.\nIn recent years, a new wave of VR innovation started with the launch of all-in-one (AIO) headsets. Previously, fully immersive VR experiences required a physical connection to a powerful PC. The HMD couldn\u2019t operate as a self-contained device, as it had no operating system and no ability to compute the image.\nBut with AIO headsets, users gained access to a dedicated device with a simple setup that could deliver fully tracked VR anywhere, anytime. Coupled with the innovation of VR streaming technology, users could now experience powerful VR environments, even while on the go.\nLatest Trends in XR\nHigh-quality XR is becoming increasingly accessible. Consumers worldwide are purchasing AIOs to experience XR, from immersive gaming to remote learning to virtual training. Large enterprises are adding XR into their workflows and design processes. XR drastically improves design implementation with the inclusion of a digital twin.\nImage courtesy of Innoactive.\nAnd one of today\u2019s biggest trends is streaming XR experiences through 5G from the cloud. This removes the need to be tethered to workstations or limit experiences to a single space.\nBy streaming over 5G from the cloud, people can use XR devices and get the computational power to run XR experiences from a data center, regardless of location and time. Advanced solutions like NVIDIA CloudXR are making immersive streaming more accessible, so more XR users can experience high-fidelity environments from anywhere.\n\nAR is also becoming more common. After Pok\u00e9mon GO became a household name, AR emerged in a number of additional consumer-focused areas. Many social media platforms added filters that users could overlay on their faces. Organizations in retail incorporated AR to showcase photorealistic rendered 3D products, enabling customers to place these products in a room and visualize it in any space.\n\nhttps://developer.download.nvidia.com/cloudxr/videos/compressed/CloudXR_mclaren_002.mp4\nPlus, enterprises in various industries like architecture, manufacturing, healthcare and more are using the technology to vastly improve workflows and create unique, interactive experiences. For example, architects and design teams are integrating AR for construction project monitoring, so they can see onsite progress and compare it to digital designs.\nAnd though it\u2019s still fairly new, MR is developing in the XR space. Trends are shown through the emergence of many new headsets built for MR, including the Varjo XR-3. With MR headsets, professionals in engineering, design, simulation and research can develop and interact with their 3D models in real life.\nVarjo XR-3 headset. Image courtesy of Varjo.\nThe Future of XR\nAs XR technology advances, another technology is propelling users into a new era: artificial intelligence.\nAI will play a major role in the XR space, from virtual assistants helping designers in VR to intelligent AR overlays that can walk individuals through do-it-yourself projects.\nFor example, imagine wearing a headset and telling the content what to do through natural speech and gestures. With hands-free and speech-driven virtual agents at the ready, even non-experts will be able to create amazing designs, complete exceedingly complex projects and harness the capabilities of powerful applications.\n\nPlatforms like NVIDIA Omniverse have already changed how users create 3D simulations and virtual worlds. Omniverse allows users from across the globe to develop and operate digital twin simulations. The platform provides users with the flexibility to portal into the physically accurate, fully ray-traced virtual world through 2D monitors, or their preferred XR experience, so they can experience vast virtual worlds immersively.\nEntering the next evolution of XR, the possibilities are virtually limitless.\nWhat Is Spatial Computing?\nUnlike traditional digital experiences, which are confined to screens, spatial computing places virtual elements directly into the physical world, creating more natural and intuitive interactions. The technology combines sensors, cameras and AI-driven software to recognize and respond to real-world elements, so users can interact with digital objects as if they were tangible. \n\nSupported by platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse, spatial computing has broad applications, from industrial design and training to navigation and entertainment. For example, designers could use it to visualize 3D prototypes in real space, or field teams could harness the technology to receive AR guidance overlaid onto real equipment.\nWith NVIDIA\u2019s new spatial streaming for Omniverse digital twins workflow, these experiences are now possible with unmatched visual fidelity and performance. This hybrid rendering solution combines local and cloud-based rendering using NVIDIA RTX GPUs and NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network (GDN), enabling developers to stream detailed OpenUSD-based datasets to devices like Apple Vision Pro.\nAs spatial computing evolves, it\u2019s poised to reshape interactions with digital information, making it part of everyday physical environments and expanding the possibilities for XR in practical and creative ways.\nLearn more about how organizations can use NVIDIA XR technologies.\n\n\nCategories: Explainer | Pro GraphicsTags: CloudXR | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They are still up 180% so far this year.Considered a bellwether for artificial intelligence demand, Nvidia has led the AI sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s shares have surged this year along with the California company\u2019s revenue and profit due to AI demand. According to data firm FactSet, about 16% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from China, second only to its U.S.-generated revenue.\n\nA spokesperson for the company based in Santa Clara, California, said in an emailed statement that Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201dIn its most recent earnings release, Nvidia posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago. Nvidia earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. The earnings release did not break out revenue from China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang discusses AI\u2019s future at GTC 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street falls in a manic day after briefly dropping more than 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street tumbles as tariff whiplash and falling AI stocks drag Nasdaq 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s market value rocketed to $3.5 trillion recently, passing Microsoft and briefly overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s antitrust investigation follows a report this summer by technology news site The Information that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating complaints from rivals that Nvidia was abusing its market dominance in the chip sector. The allegations reported include Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both itself and its competitors at the same time.\n\nDavid Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China\u2019s investigation is \u201cnot about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se\u201d but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.The Chinese government, he said, is telling the U.S. \u201cdon\u2019t mess with us, because all of your darling corporations that your version of capitalism needs to prosper have entanglements\u201d with China.Nvidia will have to revise its strategy in China or come up with provisions in their budgets for the type of uncertainty business with China will bring, Bieri said.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that they can shake off,\u201d he said. \u201cI also have a tremendous amount of faith in the brilliance of the management strategy of a corporation like Nvidia to not only pay attention to credit risk, market risk and operational risk, but also to political risk.\u201dNvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.Last month, it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending the pioneering semiconductor company\u2019s 25-year run on the index. Unlike Intel, Nvidia designs but doesn\u2019t manufacture its own chips, relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., an Intel rival.___Associated Press Technology Writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration guts board of US Institute of Peace.

They feature specialized AI Tensor Cores that can deliver more than 1,300 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of processing power for cutting-edge performance in gaming, creating, everyday productivity and more. For workstations, NVIDIA RTX GPUs deliver over 1,400 TOPS, enabling next-level AI acceleration and efficiency.\nUnlocking Productivity and Creativity With AI-Powered Chatbots\nAI Decoded earlier this year explored what LLMs are, why they matter and how to use them.\nFor many, tools like ChatGPT were their first introduction to AI. LLM-powered chatbots have transformed computing from basic, rule-based interactions to dynamic conversations. They can suggest vacation ideas, write customer service emails, spin up original poetry and even write code for users.\n\nIntroduced in March, ChatRTX is a demo app that lets users personalize a GPT LLM with their own content, such as documents, notes and images.\nWith features like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM and RTX acceleration, ChatRTX enables users to quickly search and ask questions about their own data. And since the app runs locally on RTX PCs or workstations, results are both fast and private.\nNVIDIA offers the broadest selection of foundation models for enthusiasts and developers, including Gemma 2, Mistral and Llama-3. These models can run locally on NVIDIA GeForce and RTX GPUs for fast, secure performance without needing to rely on cloud services.\nDownload ChatRTX today.\nIntroducing RTX-Accelerated Partner Applications\nAI is being incorporated into more and more apps and use cases, including games, content creation apps, software development and productivity tools.\nThis expansion is fueled by the wide selection of RTX-accelerated developer and community tools, software development kits, models and frameworks have made it easier than ever to run models locally in popular applications.\nAI Decoded in October spotlighted how Brave Browser\u2019s Leo AI, powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs and the open-source Ollama platform, enables users to run local LLMs like Llama 3 directly on their RTX PCs or workstations.\nThis local setup offers fast, responsive AI performance while keeping user data private \u2014 without relying on the cloud. NVIDIA\u2019s optimizations for tools like Ollama offer accelerated performance for tasks like summarizing articles, answering questions and extracting insights, all directly within the Brave browser. Users can switch between local and cloud models, providing flexibility and control over their AI experience.\nFor simple instructions on how to add local LLM support via Ollama, read Brave\u2019s blog. Once configured to point to Ollama, Leo AI will use the locally hosted LLM for prompts and queries.\nAgentic AI \u2014 Enabling Complex Problem-Solving\nAgentic AI is the next frontier of AI, capable of using sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems.\nAI Decoded explored how the AI community is experimenting with the technology to create smarter, more capable AI systems.\nPartner applications like AnythingLLM \u00a0showcase how AI is going beyond simple question-answering to improving productivity and creativity. Users can harness the application to deploy built-in agents that can tackle tasks like searching the web or scheduling meetings.\nExample of a user invoking an AI agent in AnythingLLM to complete a web search query.\nAnythingLLM lets users interact with documents through intuitive interfaces, automate complex tasks with AI agents and run advanced LLMs locally. Harnessing the power of RTX GPUs, it delivers faster, smarter and more responsive AI workflows \u2014 all within a single local desktop application. The application also works offline and is fast and private, capable of using local data and tools typically inaccessible with cloud-based solutions.\n\nAnythingLLM\u2019s Community Hub lets anyone easily access system prompts that can help them steer LLM behavior, discover productivity-boosting slash commands and build specialized AI agent skills for unique workflows and custom tools.\nBy enabling users to run agentic AI workflows on their own systems with full privacy, AnythingLLM is fueling innovation and making it easier to experiment with the latest technologies.\nAI Decoded Wrapped\nOver 600 Windows apps and games today are already running AI locally on more than 100 million GeForce RTX AI PCs and workstations worldwide, delivering fast, reliable and low-latency performance.

Vention creates pretrained skills to ease development of robotic tasks. And Cobot offers Proxie, an AI-powered cobot designed to handle material movement and adapt to dynamic environments, working seamlessly alongside humans.\nThese leading robotics startups are all making advances using NVIDIA Isaac Sim on Amazon Web Services. Isaac Sim is a reference application built on NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to simulate and test AI-driven robots in physically based virtual environments.\nNVIDIA announced at AWS re:Invent today that Isaac Sim now runs on Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) G6e instances accelerated by NVIDIA L40S GPUs. And with NVIDIA OSMO, a cloud-native orchestration platform, developers can easily manage their complex robotics workflows across their AWS computing infrastructure.\nThis combination of NVIDIA-accelerated hardware and software \u2014 available on the cloud \u2014 allows teams of any size to scale their physical AI workflows.\nPhysical AI describes AI models that can understand and interact with the physical world. It embodies the next wave of autonomous machines and robots, such as self-driving cars, industrial manipulators, mobile robots, humanoids and even robot-run infrastructure like factories and warehouses.\nWith physical AI, developers are embracing a three computer solution for training, simulation and inference to make breakthroughs.\nYet physical AI for robotics systems requires robust training datasets to achieve precision inference in deployment. Developing such datasets, however, and testing them in real situations can be impractical and costly.\nSimulation offers an answer, as it can significantly accelerate the training, testing and deployment of AI-driven robots.\nHarnessing L40S GPUs in the Cloud to Scale Robotics Simulation and Training\nSimulation is used to verify, validate and optimize robot designs as well as the systems and their algorithms before deployment. Simulation can also optimize facility and system designs before construction or remodeling starts for maximum efficiencies, reducing costly manufacturing change orders.\nAmazon EC2 G6e instances accelerated by NVIDIA L40S GPUs provide a 2x performance gain over the prior architecture, while allowing the flexibility to scale as scene and simulation complexity grows. The instances are used to train many computer vision models that power AI-driven robots. This means the same instances can be extended for various tasks, from data generation to simulation to model training.\nUsing NVIDIA OSMO in the cloud allows teams to orchestrate and scale complex \u200crobotics development workflows across distributed computing resources, whether on premises or in the AWS cloud.\nIsaac Sim provides access to the latest robotics simulation capabilities and the cloud, fostering collaboration. One of the critical workflows is generating synthetic data for perception model training.\nUsing a reference workflow that combines NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a framework for building custom synthetic data generation (SDG) pipelines and a core extension of Isaac Sim, with NVIDIA NIM microservices, developers can build generative AI-enabled SDG pipelines.\nThese include the USD Code NIM microservice for generating Python USD code and answering OpenUSD queries, and the USD Search NIM microservice for exploring OpenUSD assets using natural language or image inputs. The Edify 360 HDRi NIM microservice generates 360-degree environment maps, while the Edify 3D NIM microservice creates ready-to-edit 3D assets from text or image prompts. This eases the synthetic data generation process by reducing many tedious and manual steps, from asset creation to image augmentation, using the power of generative AI.\nRendered.ai\u2019s synthetic data engineering platform integrated with Omniverse Replicator enables companies to generate synthetic data for computer vision models used in industries from security and intelligence to manufacturing and agriculture.\nSoftServe, an IT consulting and digital services provider, uses Isaac Sim to generate synthetic data and validate robots used in vertical farming with Pfeifer & Langen, a leading European food producer.\nTata Consultancy Services is building custom synthetic data generation pipelines to power its Mobility AI suite to address automotive and autonomous use cases by simulating real-world scenarios. Its applications include defect detection, end-of-line quality inspection and hazard avoidance.\nLearning to Be Robots in Simulation\nWhile Isaac Sim enables developers to test and validate robots in physically accurate simulation, Isaac Lab, an open-source robot learning framework built on Isaac Sim, provides a virtual playground for building robot policies that can run on AWS Batch.\nBecause these simulations are repeatable, developers can easily troubleshoot and reduce the number of cycles required for validation and testing.\nSeveral robotics developers are embracing NVIDIA Isaac on AWS to develop physical AI, such as:\n\nAescape\u2019s robots are able to provide precision-tailored massages by accurately modeling and tuning onboard sensors in Isaac Sim.\nCobot has used Isaac Sim with its AI-powered cobot, Proxie, to optimize logistics in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing sites, and more.\nCohesive Robotics has integrated Isaac Sim into its software framework called Argus OS for developing and deploying robotic workcells used in high-mix manufacturing environments.\nField AI, a builder of robot foundation models, uses Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab to evaluate the performance of its models in complex, unstructured environments across industries such as construction, manufacturing, oil and gas, mining and more.\nStandard Bots is simulating and validating the performance of its R01 robot used in manufacturing and machining setup.\nSwiss Mile is using Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab for robot learning so that wheeled quadruped robots can perform tasks autonomously with new levels of efficiency in factories and warehouses.\nVention, which offers a full-stack cloud-based automation platform, is harnessing Isaac Sim for developing and testing new capabilities for robot cells used by small to medium-size manufacturers.\n\nLearn more about Isaac Sim 4.2, now available on Amazon EC2 G6e instances powered by NVIDIA L40S GPUs on AWS Marketplace.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse Enterprise | Physical AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In Vietnam, he announced NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with the country\u2019s government on an AI research and development center \u2014 and NVIDIA\u2019s acquisition of VinBrain, a health technology startup funded by Vingroup, one of Vietnam\u2019s largest public companies.\nThese events capped a year of global investments in sovereign AI, the ability for countries to develop and harness AI using domestic computing infrastructure, data and workforces. AI will contribute nearly $20 trillion to the global economy through the end of the decade, according to IDC.\nCanada, Denmark and Indonesia are among the countries that have announced initiatives to develop sovereign AI infrastructure powered by NVIDIA technology. And at the recent NVIDIA AI Summits in India and Japan, leading enterprises, infrastructure providers and startups in both countries announced sovereign AI projects in sectors including finance, healthcare and manufacturing.\nSupporting Sovereign Cloud Infrastructure in Thailand\nHuang\u2019s Southeast Asia visit kicked off with a meeting with Thailand Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, where he discussed the opportunities for sovereign AI development in Thailand and shared memories of his childhood years spent in Bangkok.\nThe pair discussed how further investing in AI education and training can help Thailand drive AI innovations in fields such as weather prediction, climate simulation and healthcare. NVIDIA is working with dozens of local universities and startups to support AI advancement in the country.\nHuang and Shinawatra met in the Purple Room of the Thai-Khu-Fah building, which houses the offices of the prime minister and cabinet.\nHuang later took the stage at an \u201cAI Vision for Thailand\u201d event hosted by SIAM.AI Cloud, a cloud platform company that offers customers access to virtual servers featuring NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.\n\u201cThe most important part of artificial intelligence is the data. And the data of Thailand belongs to the Thai people,\u201d Huang said in a fireside chat with Ratanaphon Wongnapachant, CEO of SIAM.AI Cloud. Highlighting the importance of sovereign AI development, Huang said, \u201cThe digital data of Thailand encodes the knowledge, the history, the culture, the common sense of your people. It should be harvested by your people.\u201d\nFollowing the conversation, Wongnapachant gifted Huang a custom leather jacket lined with Thai silk. The pair also signed an NVIDIA DGX H200 system in recognition of SIAM.AI Cloud\u2019s plans to expand its offerings to NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips.\n\nAdvancing AI From Research to Industry in Vietnam\nIn Hanoi the next day, Huang met with Vietnam\u2019s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, and NVIDIA signed an agreement to open the company\u2019s first research and development center in the country. The center will focus on software development and collaborate with Vietnam\u2019s enterprises, startups, government agencies and universities to accelerate AI adoption in the country.\n\nThe announcement builds on NVIDIA\u2019s existing work with 65 universities in Vietnam and more than 100 of the country\u2019s AI startups through NVIDIA Inception, a global program designed to help startups evolve faster. NVIDIA has acquired Inception member VinBrain, a Hanoi-based company that applies AI diagnostics to multimodal health data.\nWhile in Vietnam, Huang also received the 2024 VinFuture Prize alongside AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann Le Cun and Fei-Fei Li for their \u201ctransformational contributions to the advancement of deep learning.\u201d\nBroadcast live nationally in the country, the awards ceremony was hosted by the VinFuture Foundation, a nonprofit that recognizes innovations in science and technology with significant societal impact.\n\u201cOur award today is recognition by the VinFuture committee of the transformative power of AI to revolutionize every field of science and every industry,\u201d Huang said in his acceptance speech.\nBengio, Huang and LeCun accepted the 2024 VinFuture Prize onstage in Hanoi.\nLearn more about sovereign AI.\nEditor\u2019s note: The data on the economic impact of AI is from IDC\u2019s press release titled \u201cIDC: Artificial Intelligence Will Contribute $19.9 Trillion to the Global Economy through 2030 and Drive 3.5% of Global GDP in 2030,\u201d published in September 2024.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You can think of agents as super-powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You\u2019ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies.  The goal is to cut down on often bothersome, time-consuming tasks like filing expense reports \u2014 the bane of my professional existence. Not only will we see more AI agents, we\u2019ll see more major tech companies developing them. Companies using them say they\u2019re seeing changes based on their own internal metrics. According to Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot at Microsoft, the Windows maker has already seen improvements in both responsiveness to IT issues and sales outcomes. According to Lamanna, Microsoft employee IT self-help success increased by 36%, while revenue per seller has increased by 9.4%. The company has also experienced improved HR case resolution times.   Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS As with any new technology, using AI agents will take some getting used to. But if they live up to the lofty expectations tech companies are laying out, they could win over plenty of users as an impressive new use case for generative AI. \u201cIf \u2026 you immediately get very rapid and very accurate and very meaningful and helpful responses, then that can start to change people's habits,\u201d TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut changing people's habits takes a while.\u201d You\u2019ll find AI agents at the office and on your phone The AI chatbot/AI copilot/AI agent discussion can be a bit confusing. After all, generative AI chatbots still feel like a new technology, and now we\u2019re already being shuffled on to the next big thing. But those three capabilities are all part of the same overall system. Ray Smith, Microsoft\u2019s vice president of AI agents, says you can think of an AI copilot as your main interface for interacting with your chatbot or assistant. Kind of like a home screen for your different AI needs. When you ask your chatbot or assistant to complete various tasks for you, it will reach out to the AI agents with the appropriate capabilities.  If that sounds complex, here\u2019s an easy example: Say you want to book a flight. You could tell your chatbot to see what flights are available for you, and it will use different AI agents to check your flight preferences, your calendar and availability, and potentially even your financial apps to make sure you\u2019re getting a flight in your budget range and then come back with a handful of suggested flights.   Story Continues Earlier this month, Google debuted its experimental prototype, Project Mariner, which is capable of navigating the web and performing tasks via Google\u2019s Chrome browser. In a video demo, Google shows an example of a user who needs to look up the contact information for a number of companies listed in a Google Sheets document. The user tells Mariner to memorize the list of companies, go to their websites, and find their contact emails.The agent then actively navigates to each website, grabs the email information, and provides it for each company. Google significantly sped up the process in the demo video, explaining that Mariner is still in its early stages and that it takes time for it to complete requests. But the company says accuracy and speed will improve quickly, though it doesn\u2019t have a set release date.Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Apple Intelligence will eventually offer AI agent-style functionality as well. In upcoming updates, the company says you\u2019ll be able to do things like ask Siri when you should pick up your husband or wife from the airport. The assistant will then check your email to see when the flight is expected to land, check traffic via Apple Maps, and provide you with a suggested time to hit the road.According to Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman, agents will also be able to do things like help workers find potential business opportunities then help them set up and book meetings with prospective clients.Don\u2019t expect high-powered, multistep AI agents to go mainstream as soon as the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Day. We\u2019ll start to see a few next year, but it\u2019ll likely take a bit of work to iron out all of the kinks. Instead, expect companies to lean into more basic enterprise use cases.\u201cThere's going to be also what I\u2019ll call more boring agents that do productive things, things that automate IT processes, things that automate other tedious tasks,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cThose, I think, are going to become really important next year.\u201d  Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 yahoofinanceEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Gil Press writes about technology, entrepreneurs and innovation.Follow AuthorDec 10, 2024, 09:00am ESTShareSaveCommentThe Quantum Computer at the Israeli Quantum Computing Center (IQCC). Quantum Machines\n\u201cQuantum Technology is the largest paradigm shift in a generation,\u201d says a recent comprehensive assessment of the current state of quantum computing from quantum research firm GQI. Quantum technology will have \u201ca wide impact across all industry sectors\u201d but all major approaches to quantum computing still face many challenges, say GQI analysts.\n\n\nOne of these challenges is the increasingly complex calibration requirements of quantum computing systems, a significant bottleneck slowing down efforts to scale them. \u201cAs we move toward systems with thousands of qubits,\u201d says Yonatan Cohen, co-founder and CTO of Quantum Machines, \u201cthe challenge becomes exponentially more difficult. The traditional approach of manual calibration by quantum physicists simply won't scale with our ambitions for larger quantum computers.\u201d\n\nQuantum Machines, Rigetti Computing, and Nvidia announced today the successful application of AI to automate the calibration of a quantum computer. With their AI-powered tools, Quantum Elements and Qruise, remotely automated the calibration of a 9-qubit Rigetti quantum processing unit (QPU) integrated with Quantum Machines\u2019 advanced control system and Nvidia DGX Quantum. A unified system for quantum-classical computing that Nvidia built with Quantum Machines, it is hosted at the Israeli Quantum Computing Center (IQCC).\n\n\nThe use of AI tools, says the GQI report, \u201ccould unlock a new wave of algorithmic progress. Just as quantum hardware is expected to improve, quantum software improvements can play their part in closing the gap to quantum utility.\u201d\n\nAutomated, rather than manual calibration, speeds up the lengthy preparation process of the quantum computing system. Also focusing on speed, AWS and Nvidia announced last week that they are joining forces to bring Nvidia CUDA-Q, its open-source quantum development environment, to Amazon Braket. GPU-based simulations on Braket have demonstrated up to 350x speed improvements over CPU-based simulations, enabling more efficient testing of quantum circuits.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nOther large technology vendors have also maintained an accelerated rate of innovation: Google is collaborating with Nvidia to enhance quantum device design using simulations on the Eos supercomputer and introduced AlphaQubit, an AI-based decoder that identifies quantum computing errors with state-of-the-art accuracy; Microsoft achieved a breakthrough by entangling 24 logical qubits using neutral atom quantum computing; and IBM has developed a 1,121-qubit chip.\n\nInvestors are paying attention. Venture funding in the sector has reached new levels in 2024, according to Crunchbase data. Quantum computing startups have already raised $1.5 billion in venture funding in 50 deals so far this year, almost doubling the $785 million raised last year.\n\n\nSimilarly, the quantum computing sector in Israel has seen significant growth according to a recent report from Startup Nation Central. As of August 2024, Israel had 22 quantum computing startups, with total funding for the sector in 2024 already nearing the 2023 annual total by mid-year. \u201cThis suggests a strong potential rebound and growing investor confidence in quantum technologies,\u201d concludes the report.\nInvestment in quantum technology is not just a private matter. Governments around the world are investing heavily in quantum computing, communications and sensing. As with AI, this is usually presented as primarily a race between two superpowers. China is \u201cpositioning itself as a dominant cyber and quantum technology player,\u201d says Skip Sanzeri, founder and COO of QuSecure, and is considered the world\u2019s leader in quantum communications.\nIn response, the newly proposed bi-partisan National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act would authorize $2.7 billion in federal funding to accelerate quantum research and development at federal science agencies for the next five years. The bill would refocus the National Quantum Initiative from basic research to practical applications and expand it to include other federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), State Department and Small Business Administration (SBA).\n\u201cQuantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems exponentially faster than existing computers,\u201d says the U.S. Senate press release. \u201cThe technology could lead to breakthroughs in drug discovery, weather forecasting, financial and economic modeling, artificial intelligence, cryptography and other innovations. Quantum sensing applications can provide more precise measurements critical for navigation and tracking, seismic monitoring, infrastructure monitoring and geographical surveying.\u201d\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Nvidia, the RTX 4010 doesn\u2019t exist, yet one YouTuber could buy one and use it mostly without issue. The video by Budget-Builds Official shows off the graphics card that purports to be an RTX 4010.How the YouTuber obtained the card is strange; Budget-Builds Official found the GPU on an online marketplace called the Shenzen Bitland Nvidia RTX 4010. If that wasn\u2019t dubious enough, the seller told Budget-Builds Official that the card came with no warranty and was intended for OEMs rather than end-users.However, the YouTuber recently worked with this merchant to get a GT 1010 (which is hard to find nowadays), and the seller delivered, so he decided to buy one of these RTX 4010s to see if it was real. The card cost about \u00a380, but since it was imported from China, it cost around \u00a3120, or roughly $150.What Budget-Builds Official received was a single-slot, low-profile GPU with a sleek, black cooler that had the Nvidia logo on it; that kind of design isn\u2019t what you\u2019d typically expect with a weird, China-made graphics card that\u2019s not supposed to exist. The anti-static bag the card came in also had a sticker with PNY\u2019s logo, even though this was supposed to be a card made by Shenzen Bitland.Once installed in a PC, GPU-Z didn\u2019t recognize the card but said it had 768 shaders, 4GB of GDDR6 memory, a bus width of 64 bits, a memory bandwidth of 96 GB/s, and a PCIe 3.0 x16 connection. For comparison, the RTX 4060 has four times the shaders, double the memory, double the bus width, and nearly three times the bandwidth.There wasn\u2019t much mystery behind this purported RTX 4010, however. Budget-Builds Official identified the card as an RTX A400, a budget workstation GPU from the Ampere generation launched earlier this year. This card is made directly by Nvidia and then resold by brands like PNY, hence the nice-looking cooler with Nvidia\u2019s branding. The card is supposed to have the RTX A400 directly on the cooler near the Nvidia logo, but it seems the reseller obscured it with a sticker.\n\n\nI Ordered an NVIDIA RTX4010 from China... - YouTube\n\n\n\n\nWatch On \nHowever, the RTX 4010 isn\u2019t just a card sold under a different name. It has been modified to work with Nvidia\u2019s Chinese drivers (the same ones you need for the RTX 4090D) and has a frequency 200 MHz higher than the A400. The 4010 apparently fills a hole in the budget segment of the graphics market in China and can be used either as a cheap gaming GPU or a simple video-out card. At a starting price of \u00a380, it\u2019s inexpensive compared to other graphics cards.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The RTX 4010 performed decently in gaming benchmarks, achieving 30 to 60 FPS in most games at 1080p with high to ultra settings. However, it didn\u2019t do very well in ray tracing tests, getting only 56 FPS in Portal RTX with the resolution set to a dismal 480p, which is unsurprising given the card\u2019s few cores.However, the card wasn\u2019t entirely free of bugs, probably because it was running on drivers for the RTX 4090D, as there are no official 4010 drivers. For some reason, AV1 encoding refused to work on Source engine games like Half-Life 2, and recording video using the AV1 encoder was only possible through OBS.Budget-Builds Official argues that if this card were sold in the rest of the world for the same price it was going for in China, it would be a very popular card since today\u2019s budget GPUs start at $250 or so. But given that the RTX 4060 currently retails for $300 and is Nvidia\u2019s cheapest current-gen card, it seems unlikely that Nvidia would come out with a $100 GPU even if it\u2019s based on a chip that came out four years ago.However, you can purchase an RTX A400 for about $175 at the time of writing. It will use Nvidia\u2019s Studio drivers rather than GeForce drivers, which may impact the gaming experience. And at $175, it\u2019s more expensive than the RX 6400 and 6500 XT, which are gaming GPUs that might have better value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (13)\n\n\n\nMatthew ConnatserSocial Links NavigationMatthew\u00a0Connatser is a freelancing writer for Tom's Hardware US.

A380 is not terrible for the money. Nvidia RTX 3050 6GB is actually a reasonable card in a lot of situations.\n\nB580/B570 is quite good for the money. They may make a smaller B380 at some point though we may have reached that point where smaller cards aren't worth it as integrated graphics grows larger to fill that price point.\n\nRX7600 isn't bad either, and a follow up to that card could fall in that sub-$250 range and be pretty good.\n\nCertainly not going to see a sub $200 Blackwell or Ada GPU anytime soon. Maybe after Rubin has been in production for a while.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 13 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC\u2019s Subway Violence Deters Drive to Bring Workers Back to Office Don\u2019t Shrink the Bus NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYC Congestion Pricing Takes Effect After Years of Delays   Sales of the 112-year-old company\u2019s AI-use substrates are robust with customers buying up all that Ibiden has, CEO Koji Kawashima said, adding that that demand is likely to last at least through next year. Ibiden is building a new substrate factory in Gifu prefecture, central Japan, expected to go online at 25% production capacity around the last quarter of 2025 before reaching 50% by March 2026. But that may not be enough, Kawashima said. The company\u2019s in talks about when to get the remaining 50% capacity online. \u201cOur customers have concerns,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re already being asked about our next investment and the next capacity expansion.\u201d Ibiden\u2019s shares rose as much as 5.5% in Tokyo on Monday, their biggest intraday gain in more than a month. Ibiden\u2019s clients include Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., as well as Nvidia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Many of them consult with the Japanese company early in product development, because the substrates \u2014 which help transmit signals from semiconductors to the circuit board \u2014 need to be tailored for each chip. Substrates must be made to withstand the heat of an Nvidia graphics processing unit to form an AI chip package complete with components such as memory.  Founded as a power utility company in 1912, Ibiden developed semiconductor expertise through a partnership with Intel that Kawashima cultivated by waiting every day in front of the Santa Clara company to stop engineers and executives for product feedback in the early 1990s. At one point, Intel comprised around 70% to 80% of Ibiden\u2019s revenue from chip package substrates. That fell to around 30% in the fiscal year ended March as the US chipmaker struggled to execute a turnaround that recently saw the ousting of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Reliance on Intel has hurt Ibiden\u2019s stock, down around 40% this year. In October, Ibiden revised down its profit outlook after sluggish demand for components used in general purpose servers outweighed AI server-related growth. But while noting it was important to expand business with chipmakers other than Intel, Kawashima said he was confident Intel will bounce back.   Story Continues \u201cIntel\u2019s overall technology is very sophisticated,\u201d the 61-year-old said. \u201cIntel raised us up and opened so many doors. Our relationship with Intel will always be our treasure, and Intel will forever be an important customer.\u201dWith many foreign chipmakers unwilling to transfer their latest technology to the US, Intel is likely to play a key role in Washington\u2019s goal to boost cutting-edge semiconductor production capabilities at home, Kawashima said. Ibiden itself has no manufacturing facilities in the US. It has no plans to build any due to the cost of labor and logistics, Kawashima said, irrespective of US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on a wide range of products.All of Nvidia\u2019s AI semiconductors now use Ibiden\u2019s substrates, although Taiwanese rivals such as Unimicron Technology Corp. are eyeing the field. But it won\u2019t be easy to break Ibiden\u2019s position as dominant supplier, according to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda.\u201cNvidia\u2019s AI chips need sophisticated substrates, and Ibiden is the only one that can mass produce them at a good production yield,\u201d he said. \u201cTaiwanese competitors won\u2019t be able to take Ibiden\u2019s share away by much.\u201dAI semiconductors earn more than 15% of Ibiden\u2019s sales of around \u00a5370 billion ($2.3 billion), with that percentage expected to rise further. Nvidia\u2019s said it\u2019s begun full production of its next-generation Blackwell chips after encountering some initial technical challenges.Read: Nvidia Partner Hon Hai Boosts Capacity to Meet \u2018Crazy\u2019 AI DemandOver the long term, Nvidia may face growing competition from application-specific chips by Marvell Technology Inc. and Broadcom Inc. as well as in-house silicon from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp. In theory, Ibiden should be able to accommodate them all, as AI chip package design and material will likely remain similar to Nvidia\u2019s, according to Kawashima.(Adds share price movement in the 5th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe US\u2019s Worst Fears of Chinese Hacking Are on Display in Guam Elon Musk Is Not Having a Happy New Year Why Everyone\u2019s Obsessed With Meat Sticks and Cottage Cheese Zyn\u2019s Online Hype Risks Leading to the Nicotine Pouches\u2019 Downfall What Will Elon Musk Do in 2025? \u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

Tom's Hardware tried this out with several different games, including Black Myth Wukong and Baldur's Gate 3, and found performance dips of varying degrees in all of them. \nSEE ALSO:\n\nThe 10 best video games you may have missed in 2024\n\n\n\nSo, what the heck is going on here? It turns out that the Nvidia app, which Nvidia launched last month to give users a one-stop shop for downloading new drivers and whatnot, has some AI-fueled \"game filters\" that are theoretically supposed to make games look a little better. These are turned on by default, and if they're on, they can reduce frame rates in games, even when the filters aren't being applied to the game in question. \n\n            Mashable Light Speed\n        \n\nWant more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?\nSign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\nSign Me Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                By clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n            \n\n\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\n\nNvidia gave a statement to Tom's Hardware acknowledging the issue and giving simple instructions for how to turn the feature off and fix your performance problems:Open the Nvidia app and go to SettingsGo to FeaturesGo to OverlayGo to Game Filters and Photo Mode and turn off the game filtersApparently, this will cure what ails you.

This dominance, says Jon Peddie Research (JPR) mascot, is a difficult environment for AMD and Intel competitors. Five years ago, AMD was a minor player in the space, and its share shrunk to just 10%, while Intel has scarcely budged.  Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.  Though GPU shipments overall have fallen by 7.9% year over year and 14.5% quarter over quarter, NVIDIA has laid down markers as the leading force in the GPU sector. The fall in graphics has been caused by consumer anticipation for next gen GPUs, namely NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, AMD's RX 8000 series, which have been tipped to rekindle the market. The main problem currently for AMD is that it has been losing ground since the acquisition of the ATI in 2006. The company could have to pivot swiftly if it goes any further down this track, analysts warn, as NVIDIA's innovations and manufacturing capabilities are jockeying ahead of its competitors. And it's a critical moment for AMD (AMD, Financial) and Intel (INTC, Financial) to try to redefine strategy in the GPU market, because the market's near monopoly raises questions about innovation and pricing.

Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool   December 4, 2024 6 min read        3   In This Article:  NVDA            There's no denying the fact that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has turned out to be a life-changing investment for anyone who bought shares of this chipmaker a decade ago. That's because Nvidia stock has delivered remarkable gains of more than 26,800% in the past 10 years, significantly crushing the 195% gains that the S&P 500 index has clocked over the same period.  Investors who bought and held Nvidia stock for such a long time have been able to benefit from multiple catalysts, such as the growth in the video gaming market, the increasing deployment of its graphics processing units (GPUs) in data centers, and additional growth opportunities in markets such as automotive and digital twins. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?\u00a0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\u00a0Sign Up For Free \u00bb However, the stunning surge in Nvidia stock over the past decade has made it the second-largest company in the world, with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion. Expecting Nvidia stock to replicate its eye-popping performance over the coming decade looks like a far-fetched idea, considering that the size of the global economy is expected to hit $110 trillion this year. That number is expected to jump to almost $140 trillion by 2029, which means that a 35-fold jump in Nvidia stock over the next five years would make it bigger than the global economy.  Of course, that's absurd. Moreover, investors should note that betting on just one stock in anticipation that it could change your life may not be the best idea. But at the same time, Nvidia may still have more upside to offer to investors in the long run in view of the huge addressable revenue opportunity it's sitting on, which is why it could find a place in a diversified portfolio. Let's take a closer look at the potential catalysts for Nvidia and check why having this stock as a part of your portfolio could turn out to be a smart long-term move. Nvidia's total addressable market is well above $1 trillion In its investor day presentation of 2022, Nvidia management pointed out that it has a $1 trillion revenue opportunity. The company broke down this opportunity as follows: $100 billion in gaming, $300 billion in automotive, $150 billion in enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) software, $150 billion in Omniverse enterprise software, $150 billion in enterprise chips and systems, and another $150 billion in hyperscale chips and systems. However, that addressable opportunity seems to have grown immensely in the past couple of years. For instance, Nvidia management now sees a $1 trillion revenue opportunity in data center chips alone. That's because the chipmaker is now forecasting a transition from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing in data centers to help reduce electricity consumption and increase computing power at the same time.   Story Continues On Nvidia's August earnings conference call, CEO Jensen Huang remarked that accelerated computing \"enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed.\" He added that it won't be \"unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost\" by moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.Accelerated computing is made possible by accelerators such as GPUs, a market that Nvidia dominates. It reportedly controlled 98% of the data center GPU market last year. That's not surprising, since rivals such as AMD are way behind Nvidia when it comes to data center revenue.So, if we assume that Nvidia's revenue opportunity in gaming, automotive, enterprise AI software, and Omniverse software has remained constant over the past couple of years at a combined $700 billion, its overall total addressable market now sits at an impressive $1.7 trillion. Given that Nvidia is expected to finish the ongoing fiscal year 2025 with $129 billion in revenue, the massive addressable market indicates that the company's outstanding growth could be sustained for a long time.This is probably the reason why there has been a notable increase in Nvidia's consensus revenue estimates for the next couple of years.  NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts. Consistent growth in Nvidia's earnings could result in terrific upsideThe healthy growth in Nvidia's top line explains why the company's earnings are also expected to grow at a nice pace going forward.  NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts. Nvidia finished the previous fiscal year with earnings of $1.30 per share, and its bottom line is on track to more than double this year. The chart above shows that its earnings could increase by 50% in the next fiscal year, followed by a 26% increase in fiscal 2027. If we assume that Nvidia manages to make the most of the lucrative addressable market on offer and clocks 15% annual earnings growth for the next 10 years, its bottom line could hit $11.93 per share (using the current fiscal year's projected earnings of $2.95 per share as the base).The stock is currently trading at 32 times forward earnings, which is a discount to the company's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 41. If the market decides to reward Nvidia with a richer multiple and it trades at 41 times earnings after a decade (in line with the five-year average), its stock price could hit $489 per share based on the projected earnings of $11.93 per share.Reaching that level would be a 254% increase from current levels, and it doesn't look impossible. Hence, investors can consider buying Nvidia stock to hold it for the long run, as it still could help them get richer.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analystsfor\u00a0Great SpeculationsFollow AuthorDec 06, 2024, 05:00am ESTShareSaveCommentJensen Huang, CEO and founder of Nvidia, which makes chips used to train artificial intelligence ... [+] technology, takes part in a press conference at the Government Office in Hanoi on December 5, 2024. (Photo by Nam NGUYEN / AFP) (Photo by NAM NGUYEN/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images\nNvidia has been the poster child of the AI boom, with its stock surging by over 180% this year, pushing its valuation to close to $3.4 trillion. Nvidia\u2019s revenues are on track to more than double this fiscal year led by surging demand for its GPUs which have become the de facto chips for AI applications. In contrast, Intel stock has had a tough year. The stock remains down by about 50% year-to-date and has a market cap of a mere $100 billion. Intel\u2019s revenues are expected to contract this year. But here\u2019s the twist: This might be the right time to rethink the AI bellwether. Why is that? Also see a crypto mover that is Up 300% In A Month, XRP Is Just Getting Warmed Up.\n\n\nThe markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia\u2019s case, they believe that demand for AI accelerators will hold up and Nvidia\u2019s margins and growth rates will remain strong. On the other hand, Intel\u2019s market share losses in the CPU space and its foundry business struggles have made investors pessimistic about its future. However, almost everything in life is cyclical and this couldn\u2019t be more true with the semiconductor markets. Reducing positions in Nvidia and considering Intel stock could be a wise move at this juncture. We explain below - the \u2018why\u2019. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Boom Might Be Front-Loaded\nCompanies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. This is evident from Nvidia\u2019s recent revenue growth. Sales are on track to expand from a mere $27 billion in FY\u201923 to almost $130 billion in FY\u201925. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. As models grow larger in terms of several parameters, incremental performance gains are expected to diminish. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck. With much of the Internet\u2019s high-quality data already run through by large language models, there could be a shift from large-scale, general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized models - reducing demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-powered GPUs. The explosive demand Nvidia has witnessed over the last few years may very well have been front-loaded, with future growth very likely slowing. Separately, see What\u2019s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock?\n\n\nNow, AI-related chip demand could shift from training to inference, which is the phase where trained models generate outputs. Inference is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors. To be sure, Nvidia will likely remain the leader by far in the inferencing space as well (it says that inferencing accounts for about 40% of its data center chip demand) but there\u2019s certainly an opening from rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain a bit of market share.\n\nDuring the initial wave of generative AI, enterprises and big tech companies scrambled to invest in GPUs due to the \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d without worrying about costs and returns on investments. This led to a surge in pricing power for Nvidia, with its net margins coming in at over 50% in recent quarters. However, companies and their investors will eventually look for returns on their investments meaning that they could become more judicious about AI costs going forward and this is likely to hurt margins. Moreover, besides rivals such as AMD and Intel, Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers such as Google and Amazon are doubling down on building their own AI chips. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia\u2019s business.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\nIntel\u2019s Foundry Business In Ripe For Turnaround\nWhile the narrative around Nvidia has been the AI boom, the pessimism around Intel has been due to its foundry business. The business has posted sizable losses ($7 billion operating loss in 2023) and has also faced a tech handicap versus industry leader TSMC. However, the division is poised for a potential comeback with its newest 18A process node. This technology, featuring RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, promises significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency. Intel has already secured contracts with major players like Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense for custom chip designs using the 18A process. Intel has achieved some key technical milestones with this process and the company expects external customers to move their first 18A designs into production in 2025. If Intel successfully executes this transition, it could shift the narrative around its foundry business. See why 2025 Could Be Intel Stock\u2019s Comeback Year for an in depth look at how Intel stock could be re-rated higher.\n\nMoreover, with Donald Trump set to return to the White House in 2025, Intel\u2019s extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint is also likely to emerge as a much more valuable asset. Trump\u2019s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains could translate into favorable policies for Intel. Potential tariffs on foreign-made chips or incentives for domestic production could give Intel a competitive edge, particularly in its foundry division. Moreover, Intel\u2019s status as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips positions it well to win more Federal government contracts.\n\n\nIntel May Offer A Better Risk-Adjusted Return\nIntel stock trades at a reasonable valuation at just 23x consensus 2025 earnings. The 2025 earnings estimate is in fact depressed versus historical levels, at just about $1 per share on account of Intel\u2019s current struggles. For perspective, Intel has reported earnings of close to $2 per share in 2022 and earnings of over $5 per share over 2021 and 2020. This means that if Intel sees earnings recover to historical levels in the coming years, the stock could similarly follow suit. The company is expected to return to revenue growth in 2024, with consensus estimates pointing to a 6% revenue increase and there are multiple tailwinds in both the chip and foundry business. Intel\u2019s improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. Intel could also see incremental upside in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators.\nWhile Nvidia has returned outsized gains, in contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nNvidia, on the other hand, trades at a lofty 48x projected FY\u201925 earnings. While Nvidia has seen impressive growth recently, it remains to be seen if the good times will last. And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia\u2019s future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company\u2019s earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that\u2019s probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Trefis\nInvest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\n\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

PLTR this year (up 386.7% YTD). The stock even outperformed the gem of AI \u2014 NVIDIA Corporation NVDA (up about 190% YTD) \u2014 in 2024. Retail traders poured almost $30 billion into NVIDIA shares this year on balance, according to Vanda Research, as quoted on CNBC. NVIDIA is now the second-most valuable company in the United States. This makes us wonder which stock is the better AI investment for 2025. Let\u2019s examine the details. The Bullish Case for Palantir  AI Platform Success Palantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has gained widespread adoption, helping businesses integrate large language models into operations. AIP\u2019s scalability and adaptability have helped Palantir secure a significant number of deals worth over $1 million. Customer and Revenue Growth  In Q3 2024, Palantir\u2019s customer base grew 39% year over year, while transactions over $1 million surged 30%. The company achieved a net-dollar retention rate of 118%, up from 107% a year earlier, indicating its ability to generate additional revenues from existing customers. Along with commercial markets, Palantir has a solid government customer base. Huge Exposure to Government Sector Palantir and Anduril, two of the leading U.S. defense technology, are in discussions with around a dozen competitors to establish a consortium aimed at collectively bidding for U.S. government contracts. Consortium is likely to include Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ChatGPT maker OpenAI, autonomous-ship builder Saronic and artificial intelligence data group Scale AI, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. NVIDIA\u2019s Edge in AI Dominance GPU Market Leadership: NVIDIA\u2019s continued dominance in the GPU market is supported by solid demand for its Hopper architecture and the upcoming Blackwell chips. Customers trust NVIDIA\u2019s existing products, with newer chips promising even greater performance. NVIDIA's Blackwell chip is set to dominate in 2025, overshadowing other lingering concerns (like slowing revenue growth), per Morgan Stanley, as quoted on Business Insider. Cutting-Edge Technology: The new Blackwell chips, such as the GB200 NVL72, deliver AI inference speeds 30 times faster than the H100. Tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle have already invested heavily in these chips, indicating strong future demand. Morgan Stanley believes GPU demand will outperform ASIC chips (produced by the likes of Broadcom and Marvel) in 2025, per the above-mentioned source.   Story Continues Robust Shipment GrowthNVIDIA shipped 13,000 Blackwell chips last quarter, with projections of 300,000 units in Q4 2024 and 800,000 units in Q1 2025. This growing demand positions NVIDIA for sustained profit increases, with a 61.54% year-over-year rise in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS to 84 cents for the quarter ended Q1 2025.Why NVIDIA is the Better InvestmentValuation ComparisonNVIDIA\u2019s shares are more attractively priced than Palantir\u2019s. NVIDIA trades at 51.45 times trailing 12 month earnings, whereas Palantir trades at a significantly higher multiple of 230.14, making NVIDIA a less-pricey option. NVIDIA\u2019s price-to-cash flow ratio stands at 108.57X versus Palantir\u2019s 843.51X valuation.Growth ProspectThe 2025 growth rate is expected to be 41.50% for NVIDIA and 23.68% for Palantir. NVIDIA\u2019s return on equity (ROE) stands at 114.8%, far surpassing Palantir\u2019s 9.94%. This reflects NVIDIA\u2019s ability to generate more profits and make efficient use of shareholder capital.Dividend AdvantageUnlike Palantir, NVIDIA pays dividends, with a payout ratio of 2% and a 5.4% increase over the past five years. This underscores the company\u2019s strong business model and ability to reinvest earnings into research and development.Are NVIDIA ETFs Better AI Plays?While both companies are poised for growth in the AI sector, NVIDIA\u2019s established market dominance, and more attractive valuation make it the better investment for 2025. Should companies scale back AI investments, Palantir\u2019s performance could falter, whereas NVIDIA\u2019s market position and pricing power provide greater resilience. Plus, the Blackwell rollout will be an added advantage for NVIDIA in 2025.However, we cannot completely rule out growing competition and slowing sales growth. Against this backdrop, investors can tap NVIDIA-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, Columbia Semiconductor and Technology ETF SEMI and Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC.Meanwhile, Palantir is a high-growth and momentum stock. Its huge exposure to the government sector is a key winning point in investment rationale. Investors can ride out these positives with PLTR-heavy ETFs like ProShares Big Data Refiners ETF DAT, REX AI Equity Premium Income ETF AIPI and Adaptiv Select ETF ADPV.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
